(NASDAQ: SILC ), a leading provider of networking and data infrastructure solutions, reported a challenging first quarter for 2024, with revenues significantly down from the previous year. The company outlined a strategic plan to combat the current headwinds, which include excess customer inventory, a slowdown in IT infrastructure investments, and customer-specific delays. Despite reporting a net loss, Silicom remains optimistic about its long-term growth, backed by a strong balance sheet and ongoing share buybacks.\n\nKey Takeaways\n\nCompany Outlook\n\nBearish Highlights\n\nBullish Highlights\n\nMisses\n\nQ&A Highlights\n\nIn conclusion, Silicom is navigating a challenging environment with a strategic focus on long-term growth. The company's management is taking proactive steps, including share buybacks and new product initiatives, to stabilize and expand its market position. With a solid financial foundation and a clear vision for the future, Silicom remains committed to delivering value to its shareholders and customers alike.\n\nInvestingPro Insights\n\nSilicom Ltd. (SILC) is charting a course through turbulent waters with a strategic focus on long-term growth. As part of this journey, the company's financial health and market valuation provide insightful data points for investors considering the stock's future prospects.\n\nInvestingPro Data reveals a market capitalization of $103.5 million, suggesting a smaller cap company with potential room for growth. The company's Price/Book ratio as of the last twelve months ending Q1 2024 stands at a modest 0.74, which could indicate that the stock is potentially undervalued relative to its assets. This is particularly relevant given Silicom's strong balance sheet, with more cash than debt, as highlighted in one of the InvestingPro Tips.\n\nSpeaking of the company's financial performance, the revenue for the last twelve months as of Q1 2024 is reported at $101.31 million. Although this represents a significant decline of -34.93%, it's worth noting that Silicom's management has been actively buying back shares, which can be a signal of confidence in the company's value and a contributor to shareholder yield.\n\nFor investors seeking additional insights, there are a total of 11 InvestingPro Tips available, including points on Silicom's free cash flow yield and sales projections. While the company does not pay dividends, suggesting a reinvestment strategy or other uses of capital, it's noteworthy that analysts predict Silicom will return to profitability this year.\n\nFor those interested in a deeper dive into Silicom's financial metrics and future outlook, consider using the coupon code PRONEWS24 to get an additional 10% off a yearly or biyearly Pro and Pro+ subscription at InvestingPro.

Welcome to the Silicom First Quarter 2024 Results Conference Call. All participants are at present in listen-only mode. Following management's formal presentation, instructions will be given for the question-and-answer session. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. You should have all received by now the company's press release. If you have not received it, please contact Silicom's Investor Relations team at EK Global Investor Relations at 1212378-8040 or view it in the news section of the company's website, www.silicom-usa.com. I would now like to hand over the call to Mr. Kenny Green of EK Global Investor Relations. Mr. Green, would you like to begin, please?\n\nKenny Green: Thank you, operator. I would like to welcome all of you to Silicom's first quarter 2024 results conference call. Before we start, I would like to draw your attention to the following safe harbor statement. This conference call contains forward-looking statements. Such statements may include, but are not limited to, anticipated future financial operating results and Silicom's outlook and prospects. Those statements are based on management's current beliefs, expectations and assumptions, which may be affected by subsequent business, political, environmental, regulatory, economic and other conditions and are subject to known and unknown risks and uncertainties and other factors, many of which are outside of Silicom's control. These may cause actual results to differ materially from expectations expressed or implied in the forward-looking statements and which include, but are not limited to, Silicom's increasing dependence for a substantial amount of revenue growth on a limited number of customers, the speed and extent to which Silicom solutions are adopted by relevant markets, difficulty in commercializing and marketing of Silicom's products and services, maintaining and protecting brand recognition, protection of intellectual property, competition, disruptions to manufacturing, sales and marketing, development and customer support activities, the impact of oil in Israel and in the Ukraine, rising inflation, rising interest rates, volatile exchange rates as well as any continuing or new effects resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic and the global economic uncertainty, which may impact customer demand through the exercising greater caution and selectivity of short-term IT investment plans. The factors noted are not exhaustive. Further information about the company's businesses, including information about factors that could materially affect Silicom's results of operations and financial condition are discussed in the annual report filed on Form 20-F and other documents filed by the company that may be subsequently filed by the company from time to time with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Therefore, there could be no assurance that actual or future results would not differ significantly from anticipated results. Consequently, investors are cautioned not to rely on these forward-looking statements. Silicom does not undertake to update any forward-looking statements as a result of new information or future events or developments, except as may be required by law. In addition, following the company's disclosure of certain non-GAAP financial measures in today's earnings release, such non-GAAP financial measures will be discussed during this call. Such non-GAAP measures are used by management to make strategic decisions, forecast future results and evaluate the company's current performance. Management believes the presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures are useful to investors' understanding and assessment of the company's ongoing core operations and prospects for the future. Unless otherwise stated, it should be assumed that financials discussed in this conference call will be on a non-GAAP basis. Non-GAAP financial measures disclosed by management are provided as additional information to investors in order to provide them with an alternative method for assessing financial conditions and operating results. These measures are not in accordance with or a substitute for GAAP. And a full reconciliation of non-GAAP to GAAP financial measures are included in today's earnings press release, which you can find on Silicom's website. With us on the line today are Mr. Liron Eizenman, President and CEO; and Mr. Eran Gilad, CFO. Liron, will begin with an overview of the results followed by Eran, who will provide the analysis of the financials, we'll then turn the call over to a question-and-answer session. And with that, I would like to hand the call over to Liron. Liron, please go ahead.\n\nLiron Eizenman: Thank you, Kenny. Welcome, everyone, to our financial results conference call for the first quarter of 2024. As we move through 2024, as many of you know, we are currently in the midst of significant headwinds, all coming together at the same time and strongly impacting our revenues. While I discussed them in detail last quarter, the factors are affecting us are number one, excess customer inventory of our products, which were previously built up during post-COVID and component shortages era when the supply chains were tight. Number two, macroeconomic and an industry slowdown generally delaying IT infrastructure investments and ultimately slowing down or pausing customer orders of our products; and number three, in some cases, customer-specific factors causing them to delay or not to make new purchases under existing design wins. In light of those factors, as we explained last quarter, we launched a 5-year strategic plan whose goal is to generate significant value for our shareholders even under the new market reality of today. Our 5-year strategic plan is aimed at returning Silicom to gradual and steady top line and EPS growth with a financial long-term objective to increase our earnings per share to about $3 in 2028. A key element is to use our $80 million plus cash position to increase shareholder value through an aggressive share buyback, which would reduce share count by leveraging our strong balance to ensure our long-term growth potential remains intact. Our plan calls for purchasing 1.6 million shares during 2024 and 2025, which represented approximately a quarter of our full share count as of when we announced it. In the first quarter, we repurchased approximately 250,000 shares, representing a return to shareholders at a cost of $4.1 million. The Board of Directors has approved a new repurchase plan for the coming year, and our aggressive buyback will continue. I would like to stress that our very strong balance sheet and cash position allows us to continue business investment at an adequate pace without compromising our future. It supports a broad and deep pipeline as well as allows us to continue with our core R&D efforts while not being significantly impacted by a loss of a few million dollars over the upcoming transition period. At the same time, an important factor in our strategic plan was to stabilize OpEx at the level that, on the one hand, maintains continuous support and educate investment into our main growth drivers, while on the other hand, conservatively balances our expenses footprint with today's expected revenue level under the current market environment. We continue to strongly believe in the long-term potential of our main product lines, namely server adapters and Edge systems, and this includes investments in the development of two strategic new product families with significant revenues potential that we believe will increase our future success. A further step in our strategic plan was to shift focus for our sales and marketing efforts to a broader range of potential design wins, including smaller ones, which have the potential to ramp up quicker and ultimately bring greater diversification to our revenues. We, therefore, made changes to our salespeople compensation package to create the right incentives. We are already seeing the initial momentum of small to medium design wins, and we see a broader pipeline for future potential design wins. In terms of our financial performance for the first quarter we reported revenue of $14.4 million, within our expected guidance range which we shared last quarter. On the bottom line, we reported a net loss of $2.4 million. Despite this loss, demonstrating the strength and quality of our working capital, we generated an impressive positive operating cash flow of over $13 million, contributing to our very strong net cash position of over $80 million, which I discussed earlier. I want to stress that our current working capital and marketable securities as of the end of Q1 is $133 million with a very high quality of inventory amounting to $46 million. Accounts receivable, net of accounts payables of $7 million, as well as the $80 million in cash. All this represents about $21 per share. Looking towards the near term, we expect that second quarter 2024 revenues will be between $15 million to $17 million. We continue to expect that our 2024 revenues will be at about $70 million impacted mainly by the headwinds and issues I mentioned earlier. We believe that the excess customer inventory in global economy headwinds will ease as we move forward throughout 2024. And thus, second half revenues will be higher than those of the first half. Looking further out towards 2025 and beyond, we are modeling an approximate 20% compound average annual growth from 2024 baseline over the course of the 5 years plan. We expect that this growth will come from the ramp-up of already achieved SD-WAN and SASE design wins, additional Edge system sales to leading telcos and service providers and from increased revenues related to our large roster of design wins and pipeline of potential design wins for server adapters and Edge products with leading networking security and service providers globally. This growth rate does not consider potential significant individual upside that we may experience from very large projects like the ones we had in the past, which may provide additional incremental growth for our business. To summarize, as you know, our environment is much more challenging going into 2024 for all players in the industry. I want to stress that Silicom is very well positioned as a key player in our industry with over $80 million on the balance sheet, a deep pipeline and a design win roster, I'm confident that our long-term growth story remains intact, and we will achieve renewed growth starting from 2025 and beyond. We have a strong strategic plan in place, which focuses on ultimately bringing value to our shareholders, not just by returning to revenue growth, reducing expenses and growing profitability, but also by enhancing it through an aggressive buyback and a strong reduction in share count over 2 years. We have a very dedicated and loyal management team with a lot of experience in the hardware business, most members of our management team and Board of Directors have been with us for many years and have already navigated our business to success through many market prices and transformation in 2008 and 2017, just to name a few. I strongly believe that the target that I outlined are attainable by Silicom. I'm optimistic in our ability to successfully execute on this 5-year plan and bring earnings per share in excess of $3 by 2028. With that, I will now hand over the call to Eran for a detailed review of the quarter results. Eran, please go ahead.\n\nEran Gilad: Thank you, Liron, and good day to everyone. Revenues for the first quarter of 2024 were $14.4 million, a decline from revenues of $37.2 million as reported in the first quarter of last year. The geographical revenue breakdown over the last 12 months was as follows: North America, 82%; Europe and Israel, 15%; Far East and rest of the world, 3%. During the last 12 months, we had two over 10% customers, and our top three customers together accounted for about 40% of our revenues. I will be presenting the rest of the financial results on a non-GAAP basis, which excludes the noncash compensation expenses in respect of options and RSUs granted to directors, officers and employees, acquisition-related adjustments as well as these liabilities, financial income. For the full reconciliation from GAAP to non-GAAP numbers, please refer to the press release we issued earlier today. Gross profit for the first quarter of 2024 was $4.1 million, representing a gross margin of 28.5% and compared to a gross profit of $11.9 million or gross margin of 32% in the first quarter of 2023. As discussed last quarter, for the near term, our gross margin is expected to be at the lower end of our 27% to 32% expected range. And as our revenues grow from current levels over the longer term it will increase towards the upper end. Operating expenses in the first quarter of 2024 were $6.8 million compared to $7.1 million reported in the first quarter of 2023. We believe that this level represents our expected quarterly operating expenses during the rest of the year. Operating loss for the first quarter of 2024 was $2.7 million compared to operating income of $4.8 million as reported in the first quarter of 2023. Net loss for the quarter was $2.4 million compared to net income of $4.2 million in the first quarter of 2023. Loss per share in the quarter was $0.38. This is compared with diluted earnings per share of $0.61 as reported in the first quarter of last year. Now turning to the balance sheet. As of March 31, 2024, the company's cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaled $80.7 million with no debt. This represents an increase of $9.2 million just in the first quarter, a result of a positive operational cash flow of $13.3 million, net of share repurchase cost of $4.1 million. During the quarter, Silicom repurchased approximately 250,000 shares under our current share repurchase plan. As mentioned by Liron, based on our strong balance sheet and improved cash position, we intend to continue repurchasing our shares at a full pace. That ends my summary. I would like to hand back over to the operator for the questions-and-answer session. Operator?\n\nOperator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, at this time, we will begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] The first question is from Alex Henderson of Needham & Company. Please go ahead.\n\nAlex Henderson: Thanks. So a couple of questions just on the conditions in the field. To start with, can you talk to what you think the customer inventories look like in the field? How much maybe they were brought down by? And how long it will take to get back to a normalized condition within the field inventories?\n\nLiron Eizenman: Yes, absolutely. So it's really case by case, customer by customer. We - on the one side, I can say where we have customers that are almost back to normal. On the other hand, there's customers that it will take them longer, maybe second half of 2024, maybe even a little bit more than that. It really depends on the customer. I can even say that we had some good and bad surprises that we've seen recently where customers that we were not expecting to place orders in Q1, placed orders in Q1 for a specific SKU [ph] Does it mean that they completely depleted all the inventory? No, but it means that at least for certain parts, they need more. But on the other hand, we also had other customers that we were expecting to place orders, but eventually, they said that they - it will take them a little bit more time. So it really depends on customer to customer.\n\nAlex Henderson: If you were to aggregate all your customers, can you talk to the percentage of the field inventory that might have been brought down. I mean clearly, that clearing is the critical variable. I'll give you an example of with Extreme Networks (NASDAQ: EXTR ) yesterday, they talked about a $45 million reduction in channel inventories, which gives us a sense of where they are and when they expect that to come into closer balance. Can you just talk about maybe the percentage of that field inventory? I assume you've calibrated it to some degree?\n\nLiron Eizenman: I mean we are having those discussions. Not necessarily, we know the exact percentage, and it really depends on customer to customer. But I think overall, we see a decrease. We see customers coming back to us in ordering. But there's also a different trend. I cannot give an exact number, and I understand it's a key factor. But right now, there's no specific number I can provide.\n\nAlex Henderson: All right. You've pivoted your go-to-market strategy to smaller deals, which have been the bread and butter of the company for as long as I can remember, and I've been following you guys for a long time. And it's my understanding that those generally are fairly long process cycle from the time you win and start doing it. It takes time to get it engineered in. And then second, once it's engineered in, it takes time for those products to launch and to ramp. So how long do you think it will take for this small deal momentum to build? Is it 18 to 24 months type cycle?\n\nLiron Eizenman: So one of the main reasons to go to the, let's say, small to medium or bring back the focus to the small and medium design wins, it's partially because it's actually going faster, much faster than the big design wins. So I can even say that we have seen a few small to medium design wins recently that are starting because sometimes, it only takes one engineer to qualify a card and put it in the server tested, give the green light to purchasing and it starts moving, maybe not in big quantities, but we see it start moving. So I can say we're already seeing some success. And part of the reason to go and the second part, let's say, of the reason to go back to small to medium design means is that sometimes those small to medium become big eventually, not immediately. And so there - none of those that we won recently a small medium has become more than that. But definitely, we see some small to medium design wins already won, already starting. And the big ones, they will take more time for sure.\n\nAlex Henderson: So again, is it typical for these to be 12 to 18, 24-month cycle times or we...\n\nLiron Eizenman: No. For the small to medium, it's shorter than that. For the small medium, it's usually a shorter time cycle than that. It's in the seven months time frame, but it doesn't mean that they fully ramp up in this time line, it means that a decision can be made in a short period of time of seven months and then the ramp-up starts. The bigger ones, they are probably more, I don't know, 12 months, sometimes, sometimes even more than that. But for the small to medium, it should be shorter than that.\n\nAlex Henderson: Right. Shifting from the small deals to the larger deals. Obviously, you had a lot of large deal momentum going into the supply chain problems. You basically signed a whole slew of deals. Clearly, some of those deals have been shelved. Some of those deals may never happen, but others are likely to still ramp maybe with a delay in terms of the timing of the launch. Can you quantify or qualify the mechanics around those deals, to what extent you have clarity on what portion of them have really gone away and are just no longer there? And to what extent you think the other ones might still be in the pipeline and still be ready to ramp at some point?\n\nLiron Eizenman: When I think of the big ones that I have in my mind right now, they're not gone, but they are suffering from two main pain points. One is that the customer was overoptimistic which led to a situation of our inventory. So they thought that they will roll out the units much, much quicker, which means they bought parts, bought too many parts because they thought that it will - that they will sell much more, and that is right now leading to a situation where they have too much inventory. And to some extent, the second item is related to the first one, which is that they are actually suffering probably from the global economy and slowdown in IT infrastructure investments. So they're not able to sell as much as they wanted. But we know we're in touch with those big accounts and big wins. They are still deploying even though the fact that they're not even planning to order from us this quarter, next quarter, and we don't know exactly when they will return buying from us, definitely. It's something that they are still selling. They're running out, but not at the pace that they wanted to do so.\n\nAlex Henderson: Okay. So just - I mean, is there any portion three quarters or more of them are still operative? Any sense of what might have gone away versus continuing?\n\nLiron Eizenman: So right now, as I said, I don't believe any of them went away. I believe that in a time frame of a year, give or take, we will see some of those big guys coming back and generating revenue with us.\n\nAlex Henderson: Okay. And then going back to the balance sheet, your inventory is quite a bit higher than normal relative to your revenue run rate. Can you talk a little bit about how rapidly you can bring that inventory down? What do you think the risk is that some of that inventory might be obsoleted by sitting on the shelf for too long and kind of monetization of that? Obviously, you did a great job on the receivables here, but I think the inventories in the next piece of the free cash flow generation.\n\nLiron Eizenman: So first of all, we believe that the inventory value is real value. I mean that's - that we believe is high-quality inventory, and we're monitoring it and it did decrease by $7 million this quarter. We believe it will continue to go down. I cannot give an exact number because I don't know exactly what it will go down by. But yes, we expect it to continue to go down. And despite the fact that with certain customers, they're not ordering as quick as they said that they will. They're still ordering, and we believe they will continue to order in the future. And our purchases also from suppliers is obviously lower, and we're not increasing our inventory as well. We will just eat our inventory and will continue to deplete it until we'll be in a position that it goes back to a relatively normal size to our revenue business. But we don't see a risk for that. We don't see a risk for having that stock or something of that sort in significant value, not at all.\n\nAlex Henderson: Okay. Great. I'll see the floor. If there's - if there aren't any other questions, I'll come back and ask some more, but give somebody else a chance if they're in the queue.\n\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] The next question is from Alex Henderson of Needham & Company. Please go ahead.\n\nAlex Henderson: I didn't know whether there would be anybody else there or not. So going back into the cost-cutting moves, can you talk about what you've done in terms of the timeline of the staff cuts? Are they all now completed? Were they in for the entire quarter? You know, how do I think about the degree to which that's already in the first quarter and or alternatively, whether there's still further cuts to come benefiting future quarters?\n\nLiron Eizenman: So currently, so we completed the cuts that we wanted to do, right now, we're not expecting significant cuts here and there, maybe, but not something that should impact the numbers significantly. The cuts were made during Q4. The full impact of them, I think, was completely realized in Q1. If not, then let's say 90% or so. So with the numbers that you're seeing right now, as Eran said earlier, is what we expect to see on the OpEx going forward.\n\nAlex Henderson: Okay, great. And going forward, do you think that you're done with anything else on the cost side that might be changing going forward, or is that the completion of all your intentions on that front?\n\nLiron Eizenman: Can you repeat the question? I couldn't hear it.\n\nAlex Henderson: Yeah. Just to be clear, there's no additional cuts or other things being contemplated at this point?\n\nLiron Eizenman: No, not at the moment.\n\nAlex Henderson: And then going back to the timeline for the year, assuming the back half is considerably stronger, do you still think you'll be at the lower end of the gross margin band. You know, if you're talking about a band of 27 to 32, should we be in the midpoint to the lower half of the gross margins even as we exit the year because the baseline is so, so much lower than normal?\n\nLiron Eizenman: Yeah, I think that's the first assumption. I think that's pretty much where we find ourselves.\n\nAlex Henderson: Okay. And any thoughts on the tax line, whether that will be something that you're still paying out, or do you think there's any opportunity for that to zero out because of the very low level of profitability?\n\nEran Gilad: Assuming 2024 will not be profitable, we expect annual income tax of approximately $0.5 million.\n\nAlex Henderson: Okay. So pretty much similar to the first quarter for the year. Maybe a little larger?\n\nEran Gilad: The first quarter was lower than the expected level due to one time reasons. So I repeat, it should be approximately $0.5 million for the full year.\n\nAlex Henderson: That's better than the million plus we had in our model. So that's what I meant. Okay, great. I'll see the floor. Thanks.\n\nOperator: The next question is from Don McKinnon of Landlocked Securities [ph] Please go ahead.\n\nUnidentified Analyst: Yeah. Thank you. I think earlier in the call you mentioned a couple of maybe larger deals you're working on. My question is, are these old deals that have come back, or are these new opportunities? And if so, can you provide some color on that? Thanks.\n\nLiron Eizenman: I'm not sure which business you're referring to that we worked on. Maybe you can clarify the question a little bit more.\n\nUnidentified Analyst: Well, yeah, well, I guess you mentioned some larger opportunities, I think at the early part of the call. Maybe just provide some color on that.\n\nLiron Eizenman: So we, I mean, we changed a little bit of our methodology in the cells [ph] I think, for, if we're talking about design wins that we already achieved and that are ramping up slower than we expected. I think I touched on it a little bit on Alex's question. We think it will ramp up. The ramp up will continue from our perspective, let's say, in about a year. And if you're talking, maybe you're asking about the two products we discussed that we're developing or product families that we're working on, and we believe that those will be something that could be significant for our customers and for us as big revenue projects in the future. Right now, we prefer to kind of stay still in stealth mode a little bit with regards to them. But I can add a little bit color on that. Is that on one of the product families we're developing it together with for a customer of ours that already committed to the product. And it's also being developed together with a major chipset vendor and the second product family, it actually adds some critical features to our Edge products. So it's within our existing customer base of our Edge products. And they need some very critical features that are not found in common products. So there is a level of customization here and it will allow them to deploy those products in areas and environments are not able to do so today. So we think that could be very big as well. I hope I got to do...\n\nUnidentified Analyst: Yeah, I think it was really more about two new product families rather than maybe two opportunities. So that a lot. Yeah. Thanks. And then you have sort of a relationship with a company in the AI space. Is that panning out at all result in any opportunity for you - artificial intelligence?\n\nLiron Eizenman: Yeah, sure, sure. So in the AI space right now, yeah, we do have a few AI vendors, chief vendors we're working with. Right now we're in PoC stage. There's no design wins yet. It's definitely one area that we're looking at. And right now it's PoC stage with a few customers. I cannot add much more than that right now, apart from the fact that we were hopeful maybe some of those will materialize into, into a product. Halo [ph] is one of those vendors, an Israeli company as well. So very close to them, working with them closely. We hope it will generate maybe another pipeline of new deals as well.\n\nUnidentified Analyst: Okay, great. Well, thanks for taking my questions. Thanks.\n\nLiron Eizenman: Thank you. Operator?\n\nOperator: There are no further questions at this time. Before I ask Mr. Eizenman to go ahead with his closing statement, I would like to remind participants that a replay of this call will be available by tomorrow on Silicom's website, www.silicom-usa.com. Mr. Eizenman, would you like to make your concluding statement?\n\nLiron Eizenman: Thank you, operator. Thank you, everybody, for joining the call and for your interest in Silicom. We look forward to hosting you on our next call in three months. Good day.\n\nOperator: Thank you. This concludes Silicom's first quarter 2024 results conference call.

(NASDAQ:SILC), a leading provider of networking and data infrastructure solutions, reported a challenging first quarter for 2024, with revenues significantly down from the previous year. The company outlined a strategic plan to combat the current headwinds, which include excess customer inventory, a slowdown in IT infrastructure investments, and customer-specific delays. Despite reporting a net loss, Silicom remains optimistic about its long-term growth, backed by a strong balance sheet and ongoing share buybacks.\n\nIn conclusion, Silicom is navigating a challenging environment with a strategic focus on long-term growth. The company's management is taking proactive steps, including share buybacks and new product initiatives, to stabilize and expand its market position. With a solid financial foundation and a clear vision for the future, Silicom remains committed to delivering value to its shareholders and customers alike.\n\nSilicom Ltd. (SILC) is charting a course through turbulent waters with a strategic focus on long-term growth. As part of this journey, the company's financial health and market valuation provide insightful data points for investors considering the stock's future prospects.\n\nInvestingPro Data reveals a market capitalization of $103.5 million, suggesting a smaller cap company with potential room for growth. The company's Price/Book ratio as of the last twelve months ending Q1 2024 stands at a modest 0.74, which could indicate that the stock is potentially undervalued relative to its assets. This is particularly relevant given Silicom's strong balance sheet, with more cash than debt, as highlighted in one of the InvestingPro Tips.\n\nSpeaking of the company's financial performance, the revenue for the last twelve months as of Q1 2024 is reported at $101.31 million. Although this represents a significant decline of -34.93%, it's worth noting that Silicom's management has been actively buying back shares, which can be a signal of confidence in the company's value and a contributor to shareholder yield.\n\nFor investors seeking additional insights, there are a total of 11 InvestingPro Tips available, including points on Silicom's free cash flow yield and sales projections. While the company does not pay dividends, suggesting a reinvestment strategy or other uses of capital, it's noteworthy that analysts predict Silicom will return to profitability this year.\n\nFor those interested in a deeper dive into Silicom's financial metrics and future outlook, consider using the coupon code PRONEWS24 to get an additional 10% off a yearly or biyearly Pro and Pro+ subscription at InvestingPro.

Welcome to the Silicom First Quarter 2024 Results Conference Call. All participants are at present in listen-only mode. Following management's formal presentation, instructions will be given for the question-and-answer session. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. You should have all received by now the company's press release. If you have not received it, please contact Silicom's Investor Relations team at EK Global Investor Relations at 1212378-8040 or view it in the news section of the company's website, www.silicom-usa.com. I would now like to hand over the call to Mr. Kenny Green of EK Global Investor Relations. Mr. Green, would you like to begin, please?\n\nKenny Green: Thank you, operator. I would like to welcome all of you to Silicom's first quarter 2024 results conference call. Before we start, I would like to draw your attention to the following safe harbor statement. This conference call contains forward-looking statements. Such statements may include, but are not limited to, anticipated future financial operating results and Silicom's outlook and prospects. Those statements are based on management's current beliefs, expectations and assumptions, which may be affected by subsequent business, political, environmental, regulatory, economic and other conditions and are subject to known and unknown risks and uncertainties and other factors, many of which are outside of Silicom's control. These may cause actual results to differ materially from expectations expressed or implied in the forward-looking statements and which include, but are not limited to, Silicom's increasing dependence for a substantial amount of revenue growth on a limited number of customers, the speed and extent to which Silicom solutions are adopted by relevant markets, difficulty in commercializing and marketing of Silicom's products and services, maintaining and protecting brand recognition, protection of intellectual property, competition, disruptions to manufacturing, sales and marketing, development and customer support activities, the impact of oil in Israel and in the Ukraine, rising inflation, rising interest rates, volatile exchange rates as well as any continuing or new effects resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic and the global economic uncertainty, which may impact customer demand through the exercising greater caution and selectivity of short-term IT investment plans. The factors noted are not exhaustive. Further information about the company's businesses, including information about factors that could materially affect Silicom's results of operations and financial condition are discussed in the annual report filed on Form 20-F and other documents filed by the company that may be subsequently filed by the company from time to time with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Therefore, there could be no assurance that actual or future results would not differ significantly from anticipated results. Consequently, investors are cautioned not to rely on these forward-looking statements. Silicom does not undertake to update any forward-looking statements as a result of new information or future events or developments, except as may be required by law. In addition, following the company's disclosure of certain non-GAAP financial measures in today's earnings release, such non-GAAP financial measures will be discussed during this call. Such non-GAAP measures are used by management to make strategic decisions, forecast future results and evaluate the company's current performance. Management believes the presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures are useful to investors' understanding and assessment of the company's ongoing core operations and prospects for the future. Unless otherwise stated, it should be assumed that financials discussed in this conference call will be on a non-GAAP basis. Non-GAAP financial measures disclosed by management are provided as additional information to investors in order to provide them with an alternative method for assessing financial conditions and operating results. These measures are not in accordance with or a substitute for GAAP. And a full reconciliation of non-GAAP to GAAP financial measures are included in today's earnings press release, which you can find on Silicom's website. With us on the line today are Mr. Liron Eizenman, President and CEO; and Mr. Eran Gilad, CFO. Liron, will begin with an overview of the results followed by Eran, who will provide the analysis of the financials, we'll then turn the call over to a question-and-answer session. And with that, I would like to hand the call over to Liron. Liron, please go ahead.\n\nLiron Eizenman: Thank you, Kenny. Welcome, everyone, to our financial results conference call for the first quarter of 2024. As we move through 2024, as many of you know, we are currently in the midst of significant headwinds, all coming together at the same time and strongly impacting our revenues. While I discussed them in detail last quarter, the factors are affecting us are number one, excess customer inventory of our products, which were previously built up during post-COVID and component shortages era when the supply chains were tight. Number two, macroeconomic and an industry slowdown generally delaying IT infrastructure investments and ultimately slowing down or pausing customer orders of our products; and number three, in some cases, customer-specific factors causing them to delay or not to make new purchases under existing design wins. In light of those factors, as we explained last quarter, we launched a 5-year strategic plan whose goal is to generate significant value for our shareholders even under the new market reality of today. Our 5-year strategic plan is aimed at returning Silicom to gradual and steady top line and EPS growth with a financial long-term objective to increase our earnings per share to about $3 in 2028. A key element is to use our $80 million plus cash position to increase shareholder value through an aggressive share buyback, which would reduce share count by leveraging our strong balance to ensure our long-term growth potential remains intact. Our plan calls for purchasing 1.6 million shares during 2024 and 2025, which represented approximately a quarter of our full share count as of when we announced it. In the first quarter, we repurchased approximately 250,000 shares, representing a return to shareholders at a cost of $4.1 million. The Board of Directors has approved a new repurchase plan for the coming year, and our aggressive buyback will continue. I would like to stress that our very strong balance sheet and cash position allows us to continue business investment at an adequate pace without compromising our future. It supports a broad and deep pipeline as well as allows us to continue with our core R&D efforts while not being significantly impacted by a loss of a few million dollars over the upcoming transition period. At the same time, an important factor in our strategic plan was to stabilize OpEx at the level that, on the one hand, maintains continuous support and educate investment into our main growth drivers, while on the other hand, conservatively balances our expenses footprint with today's expected revenue level under the current market environment. We continue to strongly believe in the long-term potential of our main product lines, namely server adapters and Edge systems, and this includes investments in the development of two strategic new product families with significant revenues potential that we believe will increase our future success. A further step in our strategic plan was to shift focus for our sales and marketing efforts to a broader range of potential design wins, including smaller ones, which have the potential to ramp up quicker and ultimately bring greater diversification to our revenues. We, therefore, made changes to our salespeople compensation package to create the right incentives. We are already seeing the initial momentum of small to medium design wins, and we see a broader pipeline for future potential design wins. In terms of our financial performance for the first quarter we reported revenue of $14.4 million, within our expected guidance range which we shared last quarter. On the bottom line, we reported a net loss of $2.4 million. Despite this loss, demonstrating the strength and quality of our working capital, we generated an impressive positive operating cash flow of over $13 million, contributing to our very strong net cash position of over $80 million, which I discussed earlier. I want to stress that our current working capital and marketable securities as of the end of Q1 is $133 million with a very high quality of inventory amounting to $46 million. Accounts receivable, net of accounts payables of $7 million, as well as the $80 million in cash. All this represents about $21 per share. Looking towards the near term, we expect that second quarter 2024 revenues will be between $15 million to $17 million. We continue to expect that our 2024 revenues will be at about $70 million impacted mainly by the headwinds and issues I mentioned earlier. We believe that the excess customer inventory in global economy headwinds will ease as we move forward throughout 2024. And thus, second half revenues will be higher than those of the first half. Looking further out towards 2025 and beyond, we are modeling an approximate 20% compound average annual growth from 2024 baseline over the course of the 5 years plan. We expect that this growth will come from the ramp-up of already achieved SD-WAN and SASE design wins, additional Edge system sales to leading telcos and service providers and from increased revenues related to our large roster of design wins and pipeline of potential design wins for server adapters and Edge products with leading networking security and service providers globally. This growth rate does not consider potential significant individual upside that we may experience from very large projects like the ones we had in the past, which may provide additional incremental growth for our business. To summarize, as you know, our environment is much more challenging going into 2024 for all players in the industry. I want to stress that Silicom is very well positioned as a key player in our industry with over $80 million on the balance sheet, a deep pipeline and a design win roster, I'm confident that our long-term growth story remains intact, and we will achieve renewed growth starting from 2025 and beyond. We have a strong strategic plan in place, which focuses on ultimately bringing value to our shareholders, not just by returning to revenue growth, reducing expenses and growing profitability, but also by enhancing it through an aggressive buyback and a strong reduction in share count over 2 years. We have a very dedicated and loyal management team with a lot of experience in the hardware business, most members of our management team and Board of Directors have been with us for many years and have already navigated our business to success through many market prices and transformation in 2008 and 2017, just to name a few. I strongly believe that the target that I outlined are attainable by Silicom. I'm optimistic in our ability to successfully execute on this 5-year plan and bring earnings per share in excess of $3 by 2028. With that, I will now hand over the call to Eran for a detailed review of the quarter results. Eran, please go ahead.\n\nEran Gilad: Thank you, Liron, and good day to everyone. Revenues for the first quarter of 2024 were $14.4 million, a decline from revenues of $37.2 million as reported in the first quarter of last year. The geographical revenue breakdown over the last 12 months was as follows: North America, 82%; Europe and Israel, 15%; Far East and rest of the world, 3%. During the last 12 months, we had two over 10% customers, and our top three customers together accounted for about 40% of our revenues. I will be presenting the rest of the financial results on a non-GAAP basis, which excludes the noncash compensation expenses in respect of options and RSUs granted to directors, officers and employees, acquisition-related adjustments as well as these liabilities, financial income. For the full reconciliation from GAAP to non-GAAP numbers, please refer to the press release we issued earlier today. Gross profit for the first quarter of 2024 was $4.1 million, representing a gross margin of 28.5% and compared to a gross profit of $11.9 million or gross margin of 32% in the first quarter of 2023. As discussed last quarter, for the near term, our gross margin is expected to be at the lower end of our 27% to 32% expected range. And as our revenues grow from current levels over the longer term it will increase towards the upper end. Operating expenses in the first quarter of 2024 were $6.8 million compared to $7.1 million reported in the first quarter of 2023. We believe that this level represents our expected quarterly operating expenses during the rest of the year. Operating loss for the first quarter of 2024 was $2.7 million compared to operating income of $4.8 million as reported in the first quarter of 2023. Net loss for the quarter was $2.4 million compared to net income of $4.2 million in the first quarter of 2023. Loss per share in the quarter was $0.38. This is compared with diluted earnings per share of $0.61 as reported in the first quarter of last year. Now turning to the balance sheet. As of March 31, 2024, the company's cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaled $80.7 million with no debt. This represents an increase of $9.2 million just in the first quarter, a result of a positive operational cash flow of $13.3 million, net of share repurchase cost of $4.1 million. During the quarter, Silicom repurchased approximately 250,000 shares under our current share repurchase plan. As mentioned by Liron, based on our strong balance sheet and improved cash position, we intend to continue repurchasing our shares at a full pace. That ends my summary. I would like to hand back over to the operator for the questions-and-answer session. Operator?\n\nOperator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, at this time, we will begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] The first question is from Alex Henderson of Needham & Company. Please go ahead.\n\nAlex Henderson: Thanks. So a couple of questions just on the conditions in the field. To start with, can you talk to what you think the customer inventories look like in the field? How much maybe they were brought down by? And how long it will take to get back to a normalized condition within the field inventories?\n\nLiron Eizenman: Yes, absolutely. So it's really case by case, customer by customer. We - on the one side, I can say where we have customers that are almost back to normal. On the other hand, there's customers that it will take them longer, maybe second half of 2024, maybe even a little bit more than that. It really depends on the customer. I can even say that we had some good and bad surprises that we've seen recently where customers that we were not expecting to place orders in Q1, placed orders in Q1 for a specific SKU [ph] Does it mean that they completely depleted all the inventory? No, but it means that at least for certain parts, they need more. But on the other hand, we also had other customers that we were expecting to place orders, but eventually, they said that they - it will take them a little bit more time. So it really depends on customer to customer.\n\nAlex Henderson: If you were to aggregate all your customers, can you talk to the percentage of the field inventory that might have been brought down. I mean clearly, that clearing is the critical variable. I'll give you an example of with Extreme Networks (NASDAQ:EXTR) yesterday, they talked about a $45 million reduction in channel inventories, which gives us a sense of where they are and when they expect that to come into closer balance. Can you just talk about maybe the percentage of that field inventory? I assume you've calibrated it to some degree?\n\nLiron Eizenman: I mean we are having those discussions. Not necessarily, we know the exact percentage, and it really depends on customer to customer. But I think overall, we see a decrease. We see customers coming back to us in ordering. But there's also a different trend. I cannot give an exact number, and I understand it's a key factor. But right now, there's no specific number I can provide.\n\nAlex Henderson: All right. You've pivoted your go-to-market strategy to smaller deals, which have been the bread and butter of the company for as long as I can remember, and I've been following you guys for a long time. And it's my understanding that those generally are fairly long process cycle from the time you win and start doing it. It takes time to get it engineered in. And then second, once it's engineered in, it takes time for those products to launch and to ramp. So how long do you think it will take for this small deal momentum to build? Is it 18 to 24 months type cycle?\n\nLiron Eizenman: So one of the main reasons to go to the, let's say, small to medium or bring back the focus to the small and medium design wins, it's partially because it's actually going faster, much faster than the big design wins. So I can even say that we have seen a few small to medium design wins recently that are starting because sometimes, it only takes one engineer to qualify a card and put it in the server tested, give the green light to purchasing and it starts moving, maybe not in big quantities, but we see it start moving. So I can say we're already seeing some success. And part of the reason to go and the second part, let's say, of the reason to go back to small to medium design means is that sometimes those small to medium become big eventually, not immediately. And so there - none of those that we won recently a small medium has become more than that. But definitely, we see some small to medium design wins already won, already starting. And the big ones, they will take more time for sure.\n\nAlex Henderson: So again, is it typical for these to be 12 to 18, 24-month cycle times or we...\n\nLiron Eizenman: No. For the small to medium, it's shorter than that. For the small medium, it's usually a shorter time cycle than that. It's in the seven months time frame, but it doesn't mean that they fully ramp up in this time line, it means that a decision can be made in a short period of time of seven months and then the ramp-up starts. The bigger ones, they are probably more, I don't know, 12 months, sometimes, sometimes even more than that. But for the small to medium, it should be shorter than that.\n\nAlex Henderson: Right. Shifting from the small deals to the larger deals. Obviously, you had a lot of large deal momentum going into the supply chain problems. You basically signed a whole slew of deals. Clearly, some of those deals have been shelved. Some of those deals may never happen, but others are likely to still ramp maybe with a delay in terms of the timing of the launch. Can you quantify or qualify the mechanics around those deals, to what extent you have clarity on what portion of them have really gone away and are just no longer there? And to what extent you think the other ones might still be in the pipeline and still be ready to ramp at some point?\n\nLiron Eizenman: When I think of the big ones that I have in my mind right now, they're not gone, but they are suffering from two main pain points. One is that the customer was overoptimistic which led to a situation of our inventory. So they thought that they will roll out the units much, much quicker, which means they bought parts, bought too many parts because they thought that it will - that they will sell much more, and that is right now leading to a situation where they have too much inventory. And to some extent, the second item is related to the first one, which is that they are actually suffering probably from the global economy and slowdown in IT infrastructure investments. So they're not able to sell as much as they wanted. But we know we're in touch with those big accounts and big wins. They are still deploying even though the fact that they're not even planning to order from us this quarter, next quarter, and we don't know exactly when they will return buying from us, definitely. It's something that they are still selling. They're running out, but not at the pace that they wanted to do so.\n\nAlex Henderson: Okay. So just - I mean, is there any portion three quarters or more of them are still operative? Any sense of what might have gone away versus continuing?\n\nLiron Eizenman: So right now, as I said, I don't believe any of them went away. I believe that in a time frame of a year, give or take, we will see some of those big guys coming back and generating revenue with us.\n\nAlex Henderson: Okay. And then going back to the balance sheet, your inventory is quite a bit higher than normal relative to your revenue run rate. Can you talk a little bit about how rapidly you can bring that inventory down? What do you think the risk is that some of that inventory might be obsoleted by sitting on the shelf for too long and kind of monetization of that? Obviously, you did a great job on the receivables here, but I think the inventories in the next piece of the free cash flow generation.\n\nLiron Eizenman: So first of all, we believe that the inventory value is real value. I mean that's - that we believe is high-quality inventory, and we're monitoring it and it did decrease by $7 million this quarter. We believe it will continue to go down. I cannot give an exact number because I don't know exactly what it will go down by. But yes, we expect it to continue to go down. And despite the fact that with certain customers, they're not ordering as quick as they said that they will. They're still ordering, and we believe they will continue to order in the future. And our purchases also from suppliers is obviously lower, and we're not increasing our inventory as well. We will just eat our inventory and will continue to deplete it until we'll be in a position that it goes back to a relatively normal size to our revenue business. But we don't see a risk for that. We don't see a risk for having that stock or something of that sort in significant value, not at all.\n\nAlex Henderson: Okay. Great. I'll see the floor. If there's - if there aren't any other questions, I'll come back and ask some more, but give somebody else a chance if they're in the queue.\n\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] The next question is from Alex Henderson of Needham & Company. Please go ahead.\n\nAlex Henderson: I didn't know whether there would be anybody else there or not. So going back into the cost-cutting moves, can you talk about what you've done in terms of the timeline of the staff cuts? Are they all now completed? Were they in for the entire quarter? You know, how do I think about the degree to which that's already in the first quarter and or alternatively, whether there's still further cuts to come benefiting future quarters?\n\nLiron Eizenman: So currently, so we completed the cuts that we wanted to do, right now, we're not expecting significant cuts here and there, maybe, but not something that should impact the numbers significantly. The cuts were made during Q4. The full impact of them, I think, was completely realized in Q1. If not, then let's say 90% or so. So with the numbers that you're seeing right now, as Eran said earlier, is what we expect to see on the OpEx going forward.\n\nAlex Henderson: Okay, great. And going forward, do you think that you're done with anything else on the cost side that might be changing going forward, or is that the completion of all your intentions on that front?\n\nLiron Eizenman: Can you repeat the question? I couldn't hear it.\n\nAlex Henderson: Yeah. Just to be clear, there's no additional cuts or other things being contemplated at this point?\n\nLiron Eizenman: No, not at the moment.\n\nAlex Henderson: And then going back to the timeline for the year, assuming the back half is considerably stronger, do you still think you'll be at the lower end of the gross margin band. You know, if you're talking about a band of 27 to 32, should we be in the midpoint to the lower half of the gross margins even as we exit the year because the baseline is so, so much lower than normal?\n\nLiron Eizenman: Yeah, I think that's the first assumption. I think that's pretty much where we find ourselves.\n\nAlex Henderson: Okay. And any thoughts on the tax line, whether that will be something that you're still paying out, or do you think there's any opportunity for that to zero out because of the very low level of profitability?\n\nEran Gilad: Assuming 2024 will not be profitable, we expect annual income tax of approximately $0.5 million.\n\nAlex Henderson: Okay. So pretty much similar to the first quarter for the year. Maybe a little larger?\n\nEran Gilad: The first quarter was lower than the expected level due to one time reasons. So I repeat, it should be approximately $0.5 million for the full year.\n\nAlex Henderson: That's better than the million plus we had in our model. So that's what I meant. Okay, great. I'll see the floor. Thanks.\n\nOperator: The next question is from Don McKinnon of Landlocked Securities [ph] Please go ahead.\n\nUnidentified Analyst: Yeah. Thank you. I think earlier in the call you mentioned a couple of maybe larger deals you're working on. My question is, are these old deals that have come back, or are these new opportunities? And if so, can you provide some color on that? Thanks.\n\nLiron Eizenman: I'm not sure which business you're referring to that we worked on. Maybe you can clarify the question a little bit more.\n\nUnidentified Analyst: Well, yeah, well, I guess you mentioned some larger opportunities, I think at the early part of the call. Maybe just provide some color on that.\n\nLiron Eizenman: So we, I mean, we changed a little bit of our methodology in the cells [ph] I think, for, if we're talking about design wins that we already achieved and that are ramping up slower than we expected. I think I touched on it a little bit on Alex's question. We think it will ramp up. The ramp up will continue from our perspective, let's say, in about a year. And if you're talking, maybe you're asking about the two products we discussed that we're developing or product families that we're working on, and we believe that those will be something that could be significant for our customers and for us as big revenue projects in the future. Right now, we prefer to kind of stay still in stealth mode a little bit with regards to them. But I can add a little bit color on that. Is that on one of the product families we're developing it together with for a customer of ours that already committed to the product. And it's also being developed together with a major chipset vendor and the second product family, it actually adds some critical features to our Edge products. So it's within our existing customer base of our Edge products. And they need some very critical features that are not found in common products. So there is a level of customization here and it will allow them to deploy those products in areas and environments are not able to do so today. So we think that could be very big as well. I hope I got to do...\n\nUnidentified Analyst: Yeah, I think it was really more about two new product families rather than maybe two opportunities. So that a lot. Yeah. Thanks. And then you have sort of a relationship with a company in the AI space. Is that panning out at all result in any opportunity for you - artificial intelligence?\n\nLiron Eizenman: Yeah, sure, sure. So in the AI space right now, yeah, we do have a few AI vendors, chief vendors we're working with. Right now we're in PoC stage. There's no design wins yet. It's definitely one area that we're looking at. And right now it's PoC stage with a few customers. I cannot add much more than that right now, apart from the fact that we were hopeful maybe some of those will materialize into, into a product. Halo [ph] is one of those vendors, an Israeli company as well. So very close to them, working with them closely. We hope it will generate maybe another pipeline of new deals as well.\n\nUnidentified Analyst: Okay, great. Well, thanks for taking my questions. Thanks.\n\nLiron Eizenman: Thank you. Operator?\n\nOperator: There are no further questions at this time. Before I ask Mr. Eizenman to go ahead with his closing statement, I would like to remind participants that a replay of this call will be available by tomorrow on Silicom's website, www.silicom-usa.com. Mr. Eizenman, would you like to make your concluding statement?\n\nLiron Eizenman: Thank you, operator. Thank you, everybody, for joining the call and for your interest in Silicom. We look forward to hosting you on our next call in three months. Good day.\n\nOperator: Thank you. This concludes Silicom's first quarter 2024 results conference call.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Garrett Edson. Please go ahead.\n\nGarrett Edson: Thank you and good afternoon. By now, everyone should have access to our earnings announcement and supplemental presentation which were released prior to this call and may be found on our website at regionalmanagement.com. Before we begin our formal remarks, I will direct you to Page 2 of our supplemental presentation, which contains important disclosures concerning forward-looking statements and the use of non-GAAP financial measures. Part of our discussion today may include forward-looking statements which are based on management's current expectations, estimates, and projections about the company's future financial performance and business prospects. These forward-looking statements speak only as of today and are subject to various assumptions, risks, uncertainties and other factors that are difficult to predict and that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied in the forward-looking statements. These statements are not guarantees of future performance and therefore you should not place undue reliance upon them. Refer all of you to our press release, presentation, and recent filings with the SEC for a more detailed discussion of our forward-looking statements and the risks and uncertainties that could impact our future operating results and financial condition. Also, our discussion today may include references to certain non-GAAP measures. A reconciliation of these measures to the most comparable GAAP measures can be found within our earnings announcement or earnings presentation and posted on our website at regionalmanagement.com. I would now like to introduce Rob Beck, President and CEO of Regional Management Corp.\n\nRob Beck: Thanks, Garrett, and welcome to our first quarter 2024 earnings call. I'm joined today by Harp Rana, our Chief Financial Officer. On this call, we'll cover our first quarter financial and operating results, discuss the credit performance of our portfolio, and share our expectations for the second quarter and the balance of the year. We had a very strong start to 2024 as we outperformed our outlook on both the top and bottom lines. For the quarter, we generated net income of $15.2 million, and diluted earnings per share of $1.56. Our portfolio liquidated by $27 million in the quarter, in line with our expectations and consistent with normal seasonal trends. The increased pricing that we've implemented over the past several quarters and the growth in our higher-margin, small loan portfolio drove total revenue yield to 32.8%, which was 80 basis points better than prior year and contributed to record quarterly revenue of $144 million. We've also continued to aggressively manage our expense base while still investing in our growth and strategic initiatives, resulting in a sequential improvement in our operating expense ratio of 110 basis points. In sum, we're very pleased with our first quarter results, and I continue to be very proud of the way that our team members are navigating through the current environment. We remain cautiously optimistic about the direction of the economy and the credit performance of our portfolio. We continue to maintain tighter underwriting guidelines and thoughtfully grow our high-margin, small loan portfolio, which has grown by nearly $50 million, or 10%, since the middle of last year. We expect to continue to grow our small loan book in a measured way as the returns are very strong and more than make up for the higher loss rates on this portfolio. Overall, we're seeing the benefits of our prudent underwriting in our credit metrics, despite the growth of those loans with higher risk-adjusted margins. We again originated roughly 60% of our loans through our top two risk ranks in the first quarter. We ended the first quarter with a 30-plus day delinquency rate of 7.1%, a 10 basis points improvement from the first quarter of last year. Our auto-secured portfolio has also continued to grow, ending the quarter at 9.2% of our total portfolio, up from 2.1% three years ago. The credit performance of these loans has been very strong with a 30-plus day delinquency rate of 2.1% as of the end of the quarter. In addition, our front book continues to perform in line with our expectations despite macroeconomic stress. The front book represented 78% of the portfolio at the end of the first quarter and had a 30-plus day delinquency rate of 6.5%, compared to 9.8% in our back book. The back book accounted for 25% of our 30-plus day delinquent accounts, despite representing only 18% of the portfolio at quarter end. By the end of 2024, we expect the back book to represent only 8% to 10% of the total portfolio. Compared to the back book, the front book continues to season at lower levels of loss, which should benefit our 2025 results. Our net credit losses also came in better than outlook. Despite indicators of improving credit performance within our portfolio, we marginally increased our loan loss reserve rate to 10.7 in the quarter in light of more recent mixed economic indicators, including inflation rates that remain elevated. We believe this approach is appropriate during this time of relative economic uncertainty. While inflation and interest rates remain higher than expected, we are maintaining our full year guidance. The strong start to the year provides us with protection on the bottom line should macro conditions, namely inflation and interest rates, remain elevated for longer. In addition, our outperformance on G&A expenses in the first quarter, part of which is due to timing, gives us flexibility to invest more in marketing in the back half of the year to benefit 2025 results, assuming the economic conditions are conducive to faster growth. Against the current economic backdrop, we will continue to operate based on the guiding principles that I've laid out previously. First, we're committed to our core business of small and large loan installment lending. We have a long history and runway of controlled, profitable growth with these products. We'll continue to originate loans where we have a high degree of confidence in meeting our return hurdles. We're always keeping a close eye on economic data and its impact on our consumer base. Recent reports indicate a strong labor market and real wage growth. However, we continue to observe stress in certain segments of our portfolio caused by continued inflationary pressures. Given the economic uncertainty, at this time, we remain comfortable prioritizing credit quality over loan growth. As a result, we expect to remain highly selective in making loans within our tight credit box, at least in the near term. By expanding to eight new states and increasing our addressable market by more than 80% since 2020, we have ample opportunity to take advantage of high levels of consumer demand to drive quality portfolio growth while remaining selective in approving borrowers under our more conservative underwriting criteria. Where appropriate, we'll also continue to pursue opportunities to increase pricing and expand our margins, including through growth in our small loan portfolio, a strategy that has been effective in recent quarters in improving our revenue yield. As we've always done, we'll manage the business with a goal of maximizing direct contribution margin and bottom line results. Second, we'll continue to meticulously manage expenses while also investing in our core business in a way that improves our operating efficiency over time and ensures our long-term success and profitability. We continue to allocate capital to improve our capabilities and pursue our strategic initiatives, including several important technology, digital, and data and analytics projects that are key to the modernization and evolution of our platform and omnichannel business. These investments are critical to achieving our strategic objectives and will create additional sustainable growth, improved credit performance, and greater productivity, operating efficiency, and leverage over the long term. Finally, we'll maintain a strong balance sheet with ample liquidity and borrowing capacity, diversified and staggered funding sources, and a sensible interest rate management strategy. As of the end of the first quarter, we had $478 million of unused capacity on our credit facilities and 81% of our debt was at a fixed rate with a weighted average coupon of 3.7% and a weighted average revolving duration of one year. Later this year, we expect to access the securitization market. However, given our significant existing liquidity and borrowing capacity, we have the flexibility to go to market when conditions are most advantageous. In summary, we'll continue to stay focused on making fundamentally sound business decisions in line with these key principles. We're well positioned to operate effectively through the current economic cycle. Though we remain measured on growth at this time, we stand ready to make adjustments to our underwriting and growth strategy based on changes in our credit performance and the macroeconomic environment. With ample liquidity, significant borrowing capacity, and a large addressable market, we have the ability to lean back into growth when justified by the economic conditions. I'll now turn the call over to Harp to provide additional color on our first quarter results as well as second quarter guidance.\n\nHarp Rana: Thank you, Rob, and hello, everyone. I'll now take you through our first quarter results in more detail and provide you with an updated outlook for the second quarter. On Page 4 of the supplemental presentation, we provide our first quarter financial highlights. As Rob noted, we generated strong net income of $15.2 million, or diluted earnings per share of $1.56, driven by solid revenue growth and continued expense discipline. We also exited the quarter with a strong balance sheet, healthy loan loss reserves, and an improved credit profile. Turning to Page 5. Demand remained strong in the quarter, and we maintained a cautious approach to underwriting, with an emphasis on higher-margin segments. Total originations increased 8% year-over-year. By channel, branch and direct mail originations increased by 2% and 30%, respectively, while digital originations were 9% lower year-over-year. As we've consistently noted, we've deliberately decelerated origination since 2022 as we appropriately balanced growth with credit quality and higher returns. Page 6 displays our portfolio growth and our product mix through the first quarter. We closed the quarter with net finance receivables of roughly $1.74 billion, down $27 million from year-end due to the normal seasonal liquidation expected in the quarter. As of the end of the first quarter, our large loan book comprised 72% of our total portfolio. In addition, slightly under 84% of our portfolio carried an APR at or below 36%, compared to just over 86% of our portfolio a year ago. As Rob previously noted, we've purposefully leaned into growth of higher-margin small loans in recent quarters as they will support future revenue yield offsetting increasing funding costs and exceed our return hurdles despite higher expected net credit losses on these particular segments. Looking ahead, we expect our ending net receivables in the second quarter to increase by approximately $30 million to $35 million as we exit tax season and begin to regrow our portfolio. During the quarter, we'll continue to monitor the economy and focus on originating loans that maximize our margins. As economic circumstances dictate, we're prepared to further tighten our underwriting or lean back into growth, either of which could impact ending net receivables. Turning to Pages 7 and 8. Total revenue grew to a record $144 million in the first quarter, up 7% from the prior year period. Our total revenue yield and interest and fee yield were 32.8% and 29.3%, respectively. Sequentially, total revenue yield was up 50 basis points, exceeding our outlook. Year-over-year, our total revenue yield was up 80 basis points due in large part to our pricing increases on newer loans and growth in our higher-margin small loan portfolio. In the second quarter, we expect a roughly 50 basis point sequential decline in total revenue yield, primarily due to higher expected interest income reversals from net credit losses in the quarter. As credit outcomes improve in parallel with an improving economic environment, we would expect to see benefits to yield. Moving to Page 9. Our delinquency and net credit losses were roughly in line with our outlook, despite a slower start to the tax season and continued inflationary pressure. Our 30-plus day delinquency rate as of quarter end was 7.1%, up sequentially, but an improvement from 7.2% at the end of the first quarter of 2023. Our net credit losses of $46.7 million were modestly better than our first quarter outlook, while we recorded an annualized net credit loss rate of 10.6%. Page 10 provides additional information on the performance of our front book and back book. The front book ended the quarter at 78% of our total book compared to 73% at the end of 2023 and represents 71% of our 30-plus-day delinquency. Our back book, which represents 18% of our portfolio, accounts for 25% of our 30-plus-day delinquency. Our front book and back book reserve rates are 10.1% and 14.1%, respectively. In the second quarter, we expect our delinquency rate to improve consistent with seasonal patterns. In addition, we anticipate that our net credit losses will be approximately $55 million in the second quarter as more of our back book loans roll to loss. Turning to Page 11. We increased our first quarter allowance for credit losses reserve rate by 10 basis points to 10.7%, slightly above our outlook due to macroeconomic considerations. As of quarter end, the allowance was $187 million and assumes a 2024 year-end unemployment rate of 5.8%. Looking ahead, we expect to maintain a loan loss reserve rate of 10.5% at the end of the second quarter, which would be a 20 basis point reduction from the end of the first quarter, subject, of course, to economic conditions. Flipping to Page 12, we continue to closely manage our spending while still investing in our capabilities and strategic initiatives. Our G&A expenses of $60.4 million in the first quarter were substantially better than our outlook, partially due to timing. Our annualized operating expense ratio was 13.7% in the first quarter, 30 basis points better than the prior year period, and our first quarter 2024 year-over-year revenue growth outpaced our G&A expense growth by 7.9 times. We continue to aggressively manage our personnel expense. And as Rob noted, our beat on G&A expenses in the first quarter gives us the ability to spend more in marketing in the back half of the year to benefit 2025 results, assuming the economic conditions are right. We'll continue to manage our spending closely moving forward. In the second quarter, we expect G&A expenses to be approximately $62 million to support our larger portfolio and continued targeted investments in our operations. Turning to Pages 13 and 14. Our interest expense for the first quarter was $17.5 million, or 4% of average net receivables on an annualized basis, slightly better than our outlook on lower average debt and lower rates. Despite the sharp increase in benchmark rates since early 2022, we've experienced a comparatively modest increase in interest expense as a percentage of average net receivables, thanks to our fixed rate debt issued through our asset-backed securitization program. As of March 31st, 81% of our debt is fixed rate, with a weighted average coupon of 3.7% and a weighted average revolving duration of one year. In the second quarter, we expect interest expense to be approximately $18.5 million, or 4.2% of average net receivables. As our fixed rate funding matures, and we continue to grow using variable rate debt, our interest expense will increase as a percentage of average net receivables. We also have a strong balance sheet and continue to maintain ample liquidity to fund our growth. We have $187 million of lifetime loan loss reserves as well as $336 million of stockholders' equity, a little over $34 in book value per share. As of the end of the first quarter, we had $478 million of unused capacity on our credit facilities and $169 million of available liquidity, consisting of unrestricted cash on hand and immediate availability to draw down on our revolving credit facility. Our debt has staggered revolving duration stretching out to 2026. And since 2020, we've maintained a quarter-end unused borrowing capacity of between roughly $400 million and $700 million, demonstrating our ability to protect ourselves against short-term disruptions in the credit markets. Our first quarter funded debt to equity ratio remained a conservative 4.0 to 1, with ample capacity to fund our business. We incurred an effective tax rate of 23.7% in the first quarter, slightly lower than our guidance due to discrete tax benefits related to equity compensation. For the second quarter, we expect an effective tax rate of 24% to 25% prior to discrete items. We also continue to return capital to our shareholders. Our Board of Directors declared a dividend of $0.30 per common share for the second quarter. The dividend will be paid on June 12, 2024, to shareholders of record as of the close of business on May 22, 2024. Finally, I'll note that we provide a summary of our second quarter 2024 guidance on Page 15 of our earnings supplement, and we've maintained our full year 2024 guidance. As a reminder, our quarterly net income typically is at its lowest point in the second quarter of each year, and we expect 2024 to be no different. That concludes my remarks. I'll now turn the call back over to Rob.\n\nRob Beck: Thanks, Harp. Before we get into Q&A, I'd like to take a moment to thank the Regional team for the hard work, commitment to our hard-working customers, and delivery of outstanding results in the first quarter. We had an excellent start to the new year, and we look forward to continuing the momentum in the second quarter and beyond. While we remain conservative on our underwriting at this time, we're cautiously optimistic about the direction of the economy, and we're well positioned to continue our growth and increase our market share when the conditions are right. In the meantime, we'll continue to provide best-in-class service to our customers, advance our capabilities and strategic initiatives, and deliver sustainable returns and long-term value to our shareholders. Thank you, again, for your time and interest. I'll now open up the call for questions. Operator, could you please open the line?\n\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] First question comes from John Hecht with Jefferies. Please go ahead.\n\nJohn Hecht: Hey guys, thanks for taking my question. I know you guys, you mentioned a revenue yield about 50 basis points below Q2 from Q1, which I think is normal from a seasonal perspective, and I think that's suppressed because of delinquencies. But how do we think about core yields throughout the year, given pricing increases? And how should that influence the yields in the second half?\n\nHarp Rana: Hi, John, it's Harp. Thank you for the question. So, I think you're referring to second quarter guidance where we said that we would be lower by 50 basis points, and that very much is seasonal. Our NCLs are going to go up in the second quarter. So, that's very much due to that. In terms of yields for the full year, we did provide guidance, and we said that they were going to be 40 to 50 basis points up year over year. And that is inclusive of the pricing that we've spoken about previously.\n\nJohn Hecht: Okay.\n\nRob Beck: Yeah. And, John, I would just add that yields are up 80 basis points versus prior year and 50 basis points versus prior quarter. And if you look at Page 9 of the release, you'll see that it's all on the small loan side. So, small loans are up 280 basis points versus prior year and 150 basis points versus prior quarter. And that's important because we put on about $50 million of small loans since middle of last year. That's part of that higher risk but higher return business that we've been talking about. It's fantastic business. We're obviously putting it on in a very measured way, but it's having a meaningful impact on yields. And I would tell you that from a delinquency standpoint, that business probably cost us 10 basis points of delinquencies in the quarter, but 80 basis points of improved yield. So, we've got a dial that we can turn on. We're being measured in terms of how we do it and when we do it, because we're watching, obviously, the inflationary environment and seeing that hopefully continue to come down. But it's a big lever for us if we choose to pursue it more aggressively. And quite frankly, I think it's one of the biggest strategic advantages that we have versus others that cap themselves at 36%. Having this pricing power is something that sets us apart should we choose to lean in more aggressively at some point in time.\n\nJohn Hecht: Okay. And then just on expenses real quick, you beat your specific guidance by $5 million in the quarter. You referred to some of it was timing difference, but your Q2 guide is less than that. So, I guess the question is, where are you getting some good leverage in the expenses, and how does that kind of impact the expense rate past the next quarter?\n\nHarp Rana: So, John, it's Harp again. So, in terms of our beat this quarter, we really were focused on managing all lines, but we very much managed our personnel line. Part of what we said in the prepared remarks is there was going to be timing between first quarter and second quarter that's a little bit under $1 million that you'll see shift from first quarter into second quarter, which is part of that increase that you see in the second quarter guidance. The other increase that you see in the second quarter guidance is really marketing and volume-related expenses as our volumes pick up in the second quarter. But our beat versus first quarter was again due to that timing item, but also very much due to us managing our line items quite meticulously, specifically personnel.\n\nRob Beck: Yeah. And, John, look, and that was a conscious decision. I think our people costs are actually down almost $800,000 versus prior year despite the growth in the business and obviously down versus fourth quarter, as you noted. And so, our view was, let's manage the business very tightly. It gives us dry powder to lean back into growth more aggressively later in the year. And so, we feel good about, quite frankly, how we executed on every line item. But you want to run the business in a relatively conservative way as you wait for the macro conditions to further unfold. And I think that we did a great job keeping a tight control of expenses.\n\nJohn Hecht: Great. Appreciate the answers. Thanks very much.\n\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Next question comes from Matt Dhane with Tieton Capital Management. Go ahead.\n\nMatt Dhane: Thank you. That's Tieton Capital. I did want to delve a little bit more into, I guess, the conditions you're looking for before you do lean into growth, what more can you share with that around that? Because although the economy has been slowing, it still has decent GDP growth. And so I was looking to get a little bit more guidance on what you're looking for before you start growing the loan book again.\n\nRob Beck: Yeah. Hey, Matt, great question. Look, I think I've heard -- well, I haven't tracked what a lot of people are saying about the state of the customer, and I think that's really what is the driver of how aggressively you lean into growth. So, the metrics that we're looking at is consumers have had real wage growth last year. As you said, the economy's growing. There's still 8.5 million open jobs out there. Most of them or a large portion of them are for lower income folks. And that's all the positives that we see. Obviously, inflation is still higher than expected. We're not seeing, obviously, the number of rate cuts that we would have anticipated early in the year. Maybe we'll see one. And so, where I look at it is the customer is still recovering from the inflation hangover, right? So, since 2020 to April of 2024, inflation's up about 21%. But wage growth for the, call it, the 20% or 40% segment of the population has been a little over 5%. And so, while the stimulus money helped people stay on top and meet their family obligations, they're still working their way through kind of that inflationary period. And so, from our standpoint, we're able to be very selective in where we put on growth. We're able to be very selective where we put on some of the higher-risk, higher-return growth. And so, I think what we're really looking for is inflation to continue to fall. I will tell you that demand, in my opinion, has started to pick up here in the month of April. That's encouraging, but it has to be the right demand, obviously. You want to make sure customers with our underwriting that can pay their bills. So, that's where we're at. I feel like it's a good place to be because we've tested into the smaller loan portfolio. We're seeing how that's performing. We know how to turn the dials up to when we feel like it's the right time. But I don't think it's prudent necessarily to slam the accelerator down at this point in time, either. So, as long as we continue to make those right tradeoffs each and every quarter, I see things continuing to improve. I will also say that from a credit standpoint, the credit on the front book is performing in line with our expectations. Of course, everybody would like to have inflation go down faster, but we are where we are. And I would tell you that our one to 89 day delinquency bucket's about 190 basis points below 2019 and 200 basis points below the fourth quarter. And while delinquencies overall in the first quarter were up 20 basis points versus the fourth quarter, when you kind of normalize for the loan sale, it's actually down 70 basis points. So, we're seeing the trends, and although I don't typically say this, I will disclose that the April delinquency number is below 7%. And that's in line with the seasonal improvement that Harp talked about in the second quarter. So, we're feeling good about pricing and the impact. We're feeling reasonably good about credit, and we're cautiously optimistic about when we can might lean back into more aggressive growth as macro conditions continue to improve.\n\nMatt Dhane: Great. That's helpful, Rob. I appreciate the color there. One other dynamic I did want to ask about is, you folks have entered a couple of new states here over the last several years. Just wanted to get some insights into how those have been developing relative to your expectations. And, yeah, just what more can you tell us around those newer states?\n\nRob Beck: Yeah. I mean, look, and, I think, it's in the appendix of the supplement. But you can see that the ENR per branch for branches open less than a year is now about $3.7 million, up from $2.3 million a year ago. And same thing for branches open from one to three years. Now, with the environment we in, we haven't added a ton of branches. So, that addressable market opportunity that we talked about from the new states, which is increased by 80%, in my mind is still largely untapped. And so, my expectation is we will add a few more branches this year. We've got some expense dollars, which may allow us to add more branches, and we'll see whether that's the appropriate thing to do. And then we'll be looking in 2025, of course, to continue to go after that untapped market and maybe even look at additional markets. But overall, we're pleased with the new states.\n\nOperator: There are no further questions. I would like to turn the floor over to Rob Beck for closing remarks.\n\nRob Beck: Great. Thank you, operator. Look, in conclusion, I'd just say we're very pleased with the outcome of the quarter. As I said, I think, we've executed on all lines across the P&L. And that's hard to do in any environment. So, we're really pleased with the effort, and I'm extremely pleased with the team and how they're executing. I talked about credit, I talked about pricing, continued expense discipline, that's at the heart of what we do. And as I said, I do believe that having this small loan business that can price above 36% is a real competitive advantage. And in a couple ways, not only the pricing power, but it also gives you the customer flow in that allows you to, which is part of our core strategy, to graduate those customers to a lower rate loan and a higher dollar loan. The customer is extremely satisfied by that. It improves their credit profile, and it's core to the business that we've been building over the last 7 or 8 years in growing our large loan book. I would also say that the $50 million of small loans that we put on, which are higher risk and higher returns, a very key part of our strategy is also to balance that out with a more low-risk product, which is our auto-secured business. And our auto-secured business, we put on about $30 million over that same timeframe as the small loans. And that auto-secured business is very low delinquencies and losses. So, we're balancing out this business, a barbell strategy between taking on a little bit more risk on one end, which gives you good returns and strong revenue yields, even though it's slightly elevated losses and delinquencies. And we're balancing that out with that auto-secured book. So, everything we put in place and the hard work we did in the fourth quarter and the actions we took, we feel like they paid off for us in the first quarter. So, with that, I would just say, thanks, everybody, for joining the call and appreciate the call and have a good evening.\n\nOperator: This concludes today's teleconference.

I would now like to introduce Rob Beck, President and CEO of Regional Management Corp.\n\nRob Beck: Thanks, Garrett, and welcome to our first quarter 2024 earnings call. I'm joined today by Harp Rana, our Chief Financial Officer. On this call, we'll cover our first quarter financial and operating results, discuss the credit performance of our portfolio, and share our expectations for the second quarter and the balance of the year. We had a very strong start to 2024 as we outperformed our outlook on both the top and bottom lines. For the quarter, we generated net income of $15.2 million, and diluted earnings per share of $1.56. Our portfolio liquidated by $27 million in the quarter, in line with our expectations and consistent with normal seasonal trends. The increased pricing that we've implemented over the past several quarters and the growth in our higher-margin, small loan portfolio drove total revenue yield to 32.8%, which was 80 basis points better than prior year and contributed to record quarterly revenue of $144 million. We've also continued to aggressively manage our expense base while still investing in our growth and strategic initiatives, resulting in a sequential improvement in our operating expense ratio of 110 basis points. In sum, we're very pleased with our first quarter results, and I continue to be very proud of the way that our team members are navigating through the current environment. We remain cautiously optimistic about the direction of the economy and the credit performance of our portfolio. We continue to maintain tighter underwriting guidelines and thoughtfully grow our high-margin, small loan portfolio, which has grown by nearly $50 million, or 10%, since the middle of last year. We expect to continue to grow our small loan book in a measured way as the returns are very strong and more than make up for the higher loss rates on this portfolio. Overall, we're seeing the benefits of our prudent underwriting in our credit metrics, despite the growth of those loans with higher risk-adjusted margins. We again originated roughly 60% of our loans through our top two risk ranks in the first quarter. We ended the first quarter with a 30-plus day delinquency rate of 7.1%, a 10 basis points improvement from the first quarter of last year. Our auto-secured portfolio has also continued to grow, ending the quarter at 9.2% of our total portfolio, up from 2.1% three years ago. The credit performance of these loans has been very strong with a 30-plus day delinquency rate of 2.1% as of the end of the quarter. In addition, our front book continues to perform in line with our expectations despite macroeconomic stress. The front book represented 78% of the portfolio at the end of the first quarter and had a 30-plus day delinquency rate of 6.5%, compared to 9.8% in our back book. The back book accounted for 25% of our 30-plus day delinquent accounts, despite representing only 18% of the portfolio at quarter end. By the end of 2024, we expect the back book to represent only 8% to 10% of the total portfolio. Compared to the back book, the front book continues to season at lower levels of loss, which should benefit our 2025 results. Our net credit losses also came in better than outlook. Despite indicators of improving credit performance within our portfolio, we marginally increased our loan loss reserve rate to 10.7 in the quarter in light of more recent mixed economic indicators, including inflation rates that remain elevated. We believe this approach is appropriate during this time of relative economic uncertainty. While inflation and interest rates remain higher than expected, we are maintaining our full year guidance. The strong start to the year provides us with protection on the bottom line should macro conditions, namely inflation and interest rates, remain elevated for longer. In addition, our outperformance on G&A expenses in the first quarter, part of which is due to timing, gives us flexibility to invest more in marketing in the back half of the year to benefit 2025 results, assuming the economic conditions are conducive to faster growth. Against the current economic backdrop, we will continue to operate based on the guiding principles that I've laid out previously. First, we're committed to our core business of small and large loan installment lending. We have a long history and runway of controlled, profitable growth with these products. We'll continue to originate loans where we have a high degree of confidence in meeting our return hurdles. We're always keeping a close eye on economic data and its impact on our consumer base. Recent reports indicate a strong labor market and real wage growth. However, we continue to observe stress in certain segments of our portfolio caused by continued inflationary pressures. Given the economic uncertainty, at this time, we remain comfortable prioritizing credit quality over loan growth. As a result, we expect to remain highly selective in making loans within our tight credit box, at least in the near term. By expanding to eight new states and increasing our addressable market by more than 80% since 2020, we have ample opportunity to take advantage of high levels of consumer demand to drive quality portfolio growth while remaining selective in approving borrowers under our more conservative underwriting criteria. Where appropriate, we'll also continue to pursue opportunities to increase pricing and expand our margins, including through growth in our small loan portfolio, a strategy that has been effective in recent quarters in improving our revenue yield. As we've always done, we'll manage the business with a goal of maximizing direct contribution margin and bottom line results. Second, we'll continue to meticulously manage expenses while also investing in our core business in a way that improves our operating efficiency over time and ensures our long-term success and profitability. We continue to allocate capital to improve our capabilities and pursue our strategic initiatives, including several important technology, digital, and data and analytics projects that are key to the modernization and evolution of our platform and omnichannel business. These investments are critical to achieving our strategic objectives and will create additional sustainable growth, improved credit performance, and greater productivity, operating efficiency, and leverage over the long term. Finally, we'll maintain a strong balance sheet with ample liquidity and borrowing capacity, diversified and staggered funding sources, and a sensible interest rate management strategy. As of the end of the first quarter, we had $478 million of unused capacity on our credit facilities and 81% of our debt was at a fixed rate with a weighted average coupon of 3.7% and a weighted average revolving duration of one year. Later this year, we expect to access the securitization market. However, given our significant existing liquidity and borrowing capacity, we have the flexibility to go to market when conditions are most advantageous. In summary, we'll continue to stay focused on making fundamentally sound business decisions in line with these key principles. We're well positioned to operate effectively through the current economic cycle. Though we remain measured on growth at this time, we stand ready to make adjustments to our underwriting and growth strategy based on changes in our credit performance and the macroeconomic environment. With ample liquidity, significant borrowing capacity, and a large addressable market, we have the ability to lean back into growth when justified by the economic conditions. I'll now turn the call over to Harp to provide additional color on our first quarter results as well as second quarter guidance.\n\nHarp Rana: Thank you, Rob, and hello, everyone. I'll now take you through our first quarter results in more detail and provide you with an updated outlook for the second quarter. On Page 4 of the supplemental presentation, we provide our first quarter financial highlights. As Rob noted, we generated strong net income of $15.2 million, or diluted earnings per share of $1.56, driven by solid revenue growth and continued expense discipline. We also exited the quarter with a strong balance sheet, healthy loan loss reserves, and an improved credit profile. Turning to Page 5. Demand remained strong in the quarter, and we maintained a cautious approach to underwriting, with an emphasis on higher-margin segments. Total originations increased 8% year-over-year. By channel, branch and direct mail originations increased by 2% and 30%, respectively, while digital originations were 9% lower year-over-year. As we've consistently noted, we've deliberately decelerated origination since 2022 as we appropriately balanced growth with credit quality and higher returns. Page 6 displays our portfolio growth and our product mix through the first quarter. We closed the quarter with net finance receivables of roughly $1.74 billion, down $27 million from year-end due to the normal seasonal liquidation expected in the quarter. As of the end of the first quarter, our large loan book comprised 72% of our total portfolio. In addition, slightly under 84% of our portfolio carried an APR at or below 36%, compared to just over 86% of our portfolio a year ago. As Rob previously noted, we've purposefully leaned into growth of higher-margin small loans in recent quarters as they will support future revenue yield offsetting increasing funding costs and exceed our return hurdles despite higher expected net credit losses on these particular segments. Looking ahead, we expect our ending net receivables in the second quarter to increase by approximately $30 million to $35 million as we exit tax season and begin to regrow our portfolio. During the quarter, we'll continue to monitor the economy and focus on originating loans that maximize our margins. As economic circumstances dictate, we're prepared to further tighten our underwriting or lean back into growth, either of which could impact ending net receivables. Turning to Pages 7 and 8. Total revenue grew to a record $144 million in the first quarter, up 7% from the prior year period. Our total revenue yield and interest and fee yield were 32.8% and 29.3%, respectively. Sequentially, total revenue yield was up 50 basis points, exceeding our outlook. Year-over-year, our total revenue yield was up 80 basis points due in large part to our pricing increases on newer loans and growth in our higher-margin small loan portfolio. In the second quarter, we expect a roughly 50 basis point sequential decline in total revenue yield, primarily due to higher expected interest income reversals from net credit losses in the quarter. As credit outcomes improve in parallel with an improving economic environment, we would expect to see benefits to yield. Moving to Page 9. Our delinquency and net credit losses were roughly in line with our outlook, despite a slower start to the tax season and continued inflationary pressure. Our 30-plus day delinquency rate as of quarter end was 7.1%, up sequentially, but an improvement from 7.2% at the end of the first quarter of 2023. Our net credit losses of $46.7 million were modestly better than our first quarter outlook, while we recorded an annualized net credit loss rate of 10.6%. Page 10 provides additional information on the performance of our front book and back book. The front book ended the quarter at 78% of our total book compared to 73% at the end of 2023 and represents 71% of our 30-plus-day delinquency. Our back book, which represents 18% of our portfolio, accounts for 25% of our 30-plus-day delinquency. Our front book and back book reserve rates are 10.1% and 14.1%, respectively. In the second quarter, we expect our delinquency rate to improve consistent with seasonal patterns. In addition, we anticipate that our net credit losses will be approximately $55 million in the second quarter as more of our back book loans roll to loss. Turning to Page 11. We increased our first quarter allowance for credit losses reserve rate by 10 basis points to 10.7%, slightly above our outlook due to macroeconomic considerations. As of quarter end, the allowance was $187 million and assumes a 2024 year-end unemployment rate of 5.8%. Looking ahead, we expect to maintain a loan loss reserve rate of 10.5% at the end of the second quarter, which would be a 20 basis point reduction from the end of the first quarter, subject, of course, to economic conditions. Flipping to Page 12, we continue to closely manage our spending while still investing in our capabilities and strategic initiatives. Our G&A expenses of $60.4 million in the first quarter were substantially better than our outlook, partially due to timing. Our annualized operating expense ratio was 13.7% in the first quarter, 30 basis points better than the prior year period, and our first quarter 2024 year-over-year revenue growth outpaced our G&A expense growth by 7.9 times. We continue to aggressively manage our personnel expense. And as Rob noted, our beat on G&A expenses in the first quarter gives us the ability to spend more in marketing in the back half of the year to benefit 2025 results, assuming the economic conditions are right. We'll continue to manage our spending closely moving forward. In the second quarter, we expect G&A expenses to be approximately $62 million to support our larger portfolio and continued targeted investments in our operations. Turning to Pages 13 and 14. Our interest expense for the first quarter was $17.5 million, or 4% of average net receivables on an annualized basis, slightly better than our outlook on lower average debt and lower rates. Despite the sharp increase in benchmark rates since early 2022, we've experienced a comparatively modest increase in interest expense as a percentage of average net receivables, thanks to our fixed rate debt issued through our asset-backed securitization program. As of March 31st, 81% of our debt is fixed rate, with a weighted average coupon of 3.7% and a weighted average revolving duration of one year. In the second quarter, we expect interest expense to be approximately $18.5 million, or 4.2% of average net receivables. As our fixed rate funding matures, and we continue to grow using variable rate debt, our interest expense will increase as a percentage of average net receivables. We also have a strong balance sheet and continue to maintain ample liquidity to fund our growth. We have $187 million of lifetime loan loss reserves as well as $336 million of stockholders' equity, a little over $34 in book value per share. As of the end of the first quarter, we had $478 million of unused capacity on our credit facilities and $169 million of available liquidity, consisting of unrestricted cash on hand and immediate availability to draw down on our revolving credit facility. Our debt has staggered revolving duration stretching out to 2026. And since 2020, we've maintained a quarter-end unused borrowing capacity of between roughly $400 million and $700 million, demonstrating our ability to protect ourselves against short-term disruptions in the credit markets. Our first quarter funded debt to equity ratio remained a conservative 4.0 to 1, with ample capacity to fund our business. We incurred an effective tax rate of 23.7% in the first quarter, slightly lower than our guidance due to discrete tax benefits related to equity compensation. For the second quarter, we expect an effective tax rate of 24% to 25% prior to discrete items. We also continue to return capital to our shareholders. Our Board of Directors declared a dividend of $0.30 per common share for the second quarter. The dividend will be paid on June 12, 2024, to shareholders of record as of the close of business on May 22, 2024. Finally, I'll note that we provide a summary of our second quarter 2024 guidance on Page 15 of our earnings supplement, and we've maintained our full year 2024 guidance. As a reminder, our quarterly net income typically is at its lowest point in the second quarter of each year, and we expect 2024 to be no different. That concludes my remarks. I'll now turn the call back over to Rob.\n\nRob Beck: Thanks, Harp. Before we get into Q&A, I'd like to take a moment to thank the Regional team for the hard work, commitment to our hard-working customers, and delivery of outstanding results in the first quarter. We had an excellent start to the new year, and we look forward to continuing the momentum in the second quarter and beyond. While we remain conservative on our underwriting at this time, we're cautiously optimistic about the direction of the economy, and we're well positioned to continue our growth and increase our market share when the conditions are right. In the meantime, we'll continue to provide best-in-class service to our customers, advance our capabilities and strategic initiatives, and deliver sustainable returns and long-term value to our shareholders. Thank you, again, for your time and interest. I'll now open up the call for questions. Operator, could you please open the line?\n\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] First question comes from John Hecht with Jefferies. Please go ahead.\n\nJohn Hecht: Hey guys, thanks for taking my question. I know you guys, you mentioned a revenue yield about 50 basis points below Q2 from Q1, which I think is normal from a seasonal perspective, and I think that's suppressed because of delinquencies. But how do we think about core yields throughout the year, given pricing increases? And how should that influence the yields in the second half?\n\nHarp Rana: Hi, John, it's Harp. Thank you for the question. So, I think you're referring to second quarter guidance where we said that we would be lower by 50 basis points, and that very much is seasonal. Our NCLs are going to go up in the second quarter. So, that's very much due to that. In terms of yields for the full year, we did provide guidance, and we said that they were going to be 40 to 50 basis points up year over year. And that is inclusive of the pricing that we've spoken about previously.\n\nJohn Hecht: Okay.\n\nRob Beck: Yeah. And, John, I would just add that yields are up 80 basis points versus prior year and 50 basis points versus prior quarter. And if you look at Page 9 of the release, you'll see that it's all on the small loan side. So, small loans are up 280 basis points versus prior year and 150 basis points versus prior quarter. And that's important because we put on about $50 million of small loans since middle of last year. That's part of that higher risk but higher return business that we've been talking about. It's fantastic business. We're obviously putting it on in a very measured way, but it's having a meaningful impact on yields. And I would tell you that from a delinquency standpoint, that business probably cost us 10 basis points of delinquencies in the quarter, but 80 basis points of improved yield. So, we've got a dial that we can turn on. We're being measured in terms of how we do it and when we do it, because we're watching, obviously, the inflationary environment and seeing that hopefully continue to come down. But it's a big lever for us if we choose to pursue it more aggressively. And quite frankly, I think it's one of the biggest strategic advantages that we have versus others that cap themselves at 36%. Having this pricing power is something that sets us apart should we choose to lean in more aggressively at some point in time.\n\nJohn Hecht: Okay. And then just on expenses real quick, you beat your specific guidance by $5 million in the quarter. You referred to some of it was timing difference, but your Q2 guide is less than that. So, I guess the question is, where are you getting some good leverage in the expenses, and how does that kind of impact the expense rate past the next quarter?\n\nHarp Rana: So, John, it's Harp again. So, in terms of our beat this quarter, we really were focused on managing all lines, but we very much managed our personnel line. Part of what we said in the prepared remarks is there was going to be timing between first quarter and second quarter that's a little bit under $1 million that you'll see shift from first quarter into second quarter, which is part of that increase that you see in the second quarter guidance. The other increase that you see in the second quarter guidance is really marketing and volume-related expenses as our volumes pick up in the second quarter. But our beat versus first quarter was again due to that timing item, but also very much due to us managing our line items quite meticulously, specifically personnel.\n\nRob Beck: Yeah. And, John, look, and that was a conscious decision. I think our people costs are actually down almost $800,000 versus prior year despite the growth in the business and obviously down versus fourth quarter, as you noted. And so, our view was, let's manage the business very tightly. It gives us dry powder to lean back into growth more aggressively later in the year. And so, we feel good about, quite frankly, how we executed on every line item. But you want to run the business in a relatively conservative way as you wait for the macro conditions to further unfold. And I think that we did a great job keeping a tight control of expenses.\n\nJohn Hecht: Great. Appreciate the answers. Thanks very much.\n\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Next question comes from Matt Dhane with Tieton Capital Management. Go ahead.\n\nMatt Dhane: Thank you. That's Tieton Capital. I did want to delve a little bit more into, I guess, the conditions you're looking for before you do lean into growth, what more can you share with that around that? Because although the economy has been slowing, it still has decent GDP growth. And so I was looking to get a little bit more guidance on what you're looking for before you start growing the loan book again.\n\nRob Beck: Yeah. Hey, Matt, great question. Look, I think I've heard -- well, I haven't tracked what a lot of people are saying about the state of the customer, and I think that's really what is the driver of how aggressively you lean into growth. So, the metrics that we're looking at is consumers have had real wage growth last year. As you said, the economy's growing. There's still 8.5 million open jobs out there. Most of them or a large portion of them are for lower income folks. And that's all the positives that we see. Obviously, inflation is still higher than expected. We're not seeing, obviously, the number of rate cuts that we would have anticipated early in the year. Maybe we'll see one. And so, where I look at it is the customer is still recovering from the inflation hangover, right? So, since 2020 to April of 2024, inflation's up about 21%. But wage growth for the, call it, the 20% or 40% segment of the population has been a little over 5%. And so, while the stimulus money helped people stay on top and meet their family obligations, they're still working their way through kind of that inflationary period. And so, from our standpoint, we're able to be very selective in where we put on growth. We're able to be very selective where we put on some of the higher-risk, higher-return growth. And so, I think what we're really looking for is inflation to continue to fall. I will tell you that demand, in my opinion, has started to pick up here in the month of April. That's encouraging, but it has to be the right demand, obviously. You want to make sure customers with our underwriting that can pay their bills. So, that's where we're at. I feel like it's a good place to be because we've tested into the smaller loan portfolio. We're seeing how that's performing. We know how to turn the dials up to when we feel like it's the right time. But I don't think it's prudent necessarily to slam the accelerator down at this point in time, either. So, as long as we continue to make those right tradeoffs each and every quarter, I see things continuing to improve. I will also say that from a credit standpoint, the credit on the front book is performing in line with our expectations. Of course, everybody would like to have inflation go down faster, but we are where we are. And I would tell you that our one to 89 day delinquency bucket's about 190 basis points below 2019 and 200 basis points below the fourth quarter. And while delinquencies overall in the first quarter were up 20 basis points versus the fourth quarter, when you kind of normalize for the loan sale, it's actually down 70 basis points. So, we're seeing the trends, and although I don't typically say this, I will disclose that the April delinquency number is below 7%. And that's in line with the seasonal improvement that Harp talked about in the second quarter. So, we're feeling good about pricing and the impact. We're feeling reasonably good about credit, and we're cautiously optimistic about when we can might lean back into more aggressive growth as macro conditions continue to improve.\n\nMatt Dhane: Great. That's helpful, Rob. I appreciate the color there. One other dynamic I did want to ask about is, you folks have entered a couple of new states here over the last several years. Just wanted to get some insights into how those have been developing relative to your expectations. And, yeah, just what more can you tell us around those newer states?\n\nRob Beck: Yeah. I mean, look, and, I think, it's in the appendix of the supplement. But you can see that the ENR per branch for branches open less than a year is now about $3.7 million, up from $2.3 million a year ago. And same thing for branches open from one to three years. Now, with the environment we in, we haven't added a ton of branches. So, that addressable market opportunity that we talked about from the new states, which is increased by 80%, in my mind is still largely untapped. And so, my expectation is we will add a few more branches this year. We've got some expense dollars, which may allow us to add more branches, and we'll see whether that's the appropriate thing to do. And then we'll be looking in 2025, of course, to continue to go after that untapped market and maybe even look at additional markets. But overall, we're pleased with the new states.\n\nOperator: There are no further questions. I would like to turn the floor over to Rob Beck for closing remarks.\n\nRob Beck: Great. Thank you, operator. Look, in conclusion, I'd just say we're very pleased with the outcome of the quarter. As I said, I think, we've executed on all lines across the P&L. And that's hard to do in any environment. So, we're really pleased with the effort, and I'm extremely pleased with the team and how they're executing. I talked about credit, I talked about pricing, continued expense discipline, that's at the heart of what we do. And as I said, I do believe that having this small loan business that can price above 36% is a real competitive advantage. And in a couple ways, not only the pricing power, but it also gives you the customer flow in that allows you to, which is part of our core strategy, to graduate those customers to a lower rate loan and a higher dollar loan. The customer is extremely satisfied by that. It improves their credit profile, and it's core to the business that we've been building over the last 7 or 8 years in growing our large loan book. I would also say that the $50 million of small loans that we put on, which are higher risk and higher returns, a very key part of our strategy is also to balance that out with a more low-risk product, which is our auto-secured business. And our auto-secured business, we put on about $30 million over that same timeframe as the small loans. And that auto-secured business is very low delinquencies and losses. So, we're balancing out this business, a barbell strategy between taking on a little bit more risk on one end, which gives you good returns and strong revenue yields, even though it's slightly elevated losses and delinquencies. And we're balancing that out with that auto-secured book. So, everything we put in place and the hard work we did in the fourth quarter and the actions we took, we feel like they paid off for us in the first quarter. So, with that, I would just say, thanks, everybody, for joining the call and appreciate the call and have a good evening.\n\nOperator: This concludes today's teleconference.

For opening remarks and introductions, I will now turn the call over to Michael Funari at Sapphire Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nMike Funari: Thank you, and good morning. With me today from FARO are Peter Lau, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Matt Horwath, Chief Financial Officer. Yesterday after market close, the company released its financial results for the first quarter of 2024. The related press release and Form 10-Q is available on FARO's website at www.faro.com. Please note certain statements in this conference call, which are not historical facts may be considered forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties, some of which are beyond our control and include statements regarding future business results, product technology development, customer demand, inventory levels, our outlook and financial guidance, economic industry projections or subsequent events. Various factors could cause actual results to differ materially. For a more detailed description of these and other risks and uncertainties, please refer to today's press release and our annual and quarterly SEC filings. Forward-looking statements reflect our views only as of today, and except as required by law, we undertake no obligation to update or revise them. During today's conference call, management will discuss certain financial measures that are not presented in accordance with the U.S. generally accepted accounting principles or non-GAAP financial measures. In the press release, you will find additional disclosures regarding these non-GAAP measures, including reconciliations to comparable GAAP measures. While not recognized on GAAP, management believes these non-GAAP financial measures provide investors with relevant period comparisons of core operations. However, they should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for a measure of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. Now I'd like to turn the call over to Peter Lau.\n\nPeter Lau: Thank you, Mike. Good morning, and welcome, everyone, to our call. In the first quarter, our focus on executing the strategic plan we outlined in March, continued to drive meaningful results. We again exceeded our targets in the quarter, delivering $84.2 million in revenue, which was towards the high end of our guidance range, $0.09 of non-GAAP EPS, which was above the high end of our guidance range, $5.6 million of adjusted EBITDA and $4.2 million of free cash flow. We've taken significant strides in the past few quarters in enhancing the operational efficiency of our business. Our first quarter earnings and cash flow demonstrate this progress, marking the first time in four years, where we've achieved positive non-GAAP EPS and cash flow during what is traditionally our slowest quarter. This accomplishment is particularly noteworthy as it signifies a fundamental shift in our operating model, establishing a new starting point from which we expect to benefit from in the forthcoming quarters. From a top line perspective, in the first quarter, we continued to see strong demand across a wide range of industries. The better-than-expected performance in the quarter was mainly driven by several large manufacturing orders out of the Asia Pacific region. While pleasantly surprised with the orders, they tended to be specific to individual customer situations. We remain cautious on the overall near-term outlook in the Asia Pacific region, given the ongoing challenges in the construction market within China. Across the broader global market, we have seen our overall pipeline continue to grow, but have seen a shift in customer behavior in mature markets such as the U.S. and Western Europe in the quarter. There has been both a move to prioritize larger capacity-related investment initiatives and increasing caution on the outlook within commercial construction. As a result, we've seen an elongating sales cycle in these markets, which is evidenced in our first quarter geographical mix. Operationally, we again saw a notable year-over-year improvement in gross margin, along with a positive sequential trend considering our revenue seasonality. As we have discussed in prior calls, our focus on variable cost productivity, mitigation of broker fees and supply chain localization efforts within Southeast Asia continue to progress as planned. These actions contributed meaningfully to the first quarter results, and we expect this focus on operational excellence to positively impact our results over the next several quarters. Taken all together, our non-GAAP gross margin improved 420 basis points year-over-year to 51.8%. As I mentioned earlier, from a cash flow perspective, we successfully generated $4.2 million in free cash flow in the first quarter, marking our second sequential quarter of meaningful cash flow generation and the first positive Q1 in several years. The initiatives we put in place to monetize our balance sheet are paying off, and we are increasingly confident in our ability to drive sustained cash flow generation under the current market conditions. While we've made great strides in improving financial performance over the past several quarters, it's important to note we're still in the early stages of refining our execution strategies and enhancing outcomes. Our team fully understands the extent of work ahead and is dedicated to delivering on our plans. The adjustments made to our cost structure thus far, evidenced by our first quarter expense base, improving gross margins and working capital efficiencies demonstrate the progress we've made in refining our operational framework. Moving forward, we remain focused on productivity and continuing to expand gross margins while simultaneously making strategic investments in new products and technologies. We understand the importance of continuing to foster innovation and growth through focused investments in our core. By maintaining this balanced approach, we aim to both increase shareholder value and expand our competitive position in the marketplace. On the product front, I'm pleased to report that now two quarters after the launch, feedback on our new Orbis mobile scanner remains very positive. Notably, the revenue for our mobile scanning solutions has increased double digits year-over-year, reflecting the increasing adoption of our technology. In addition, the success of Orbis underscores the growth opportunity potential of expanding into adjacent markets within our core. By targeting the mobile scanning market with a diversified set of solutions, we've been able to expand our served addressable market, providing an initial proof point towards our long-term growth strategy of entering markets adjacent to our core, where FARO has the right to play and the right to win. Bolstering our software offering in the last quarter, we showcased a strong software release cadence with advancements across our portfolio. Multiple software updates were rolled out, solidifying our commitment to enhancing customer experience. A key highlight was the enhancement of FARO CAM2 our leading 3D metrology software with an upgraded CAD translator, which supports additional CAD formats and improves interoperability. Additionally, FARO Connect, our mobile scanning software received advanced processing options tailored to diverse use cases, empowering customers with greater control of their data. We also unveiled a groundbreaking innovation in FARO Zone 3D aimed at public safety customers, the MassZone collision prediction system, facilitating the creation of immersive what-if crash animations by seamlessly blending real-world and digital data. Furthermore, with the release of 3D model import, the FARO Sphere XG digital reality cloud solution has become the singular platform where AECO professionals can seamlessly visualize 3D models alongside the reality capture data. Our R&D roadmap, which integrates both hardware and software into value-added solutions for our customers is firmly directed towards increasing our served addressable market by 40% over our strategic horizon. As we move through 2024, we look forward to discussing impactful new product launches with you in greater detail, including the markets they target and opportunities they represent. To further support the momentum in our business and align the success of all of our stakeholders, I'm very excited to share that we recently announced a stock ground program for all FARO employees. By extending ownership opportunities to all levels of the organization, we align the interest of every single employee with the company's long-term goals, driving motivation, creativity and dedication to those goals. This program underscores FARO's commitment to our people and our vision of building a stronger, more resilient organization for the future. At our recent investor event held in March, we outlined our commitment to enhancing shareholder value through a strategic approach anchored on three fundamental principles: first, accelerating revenue growth ahead of the market trends we operate within; second, to grow earnings at a pace exceeding that of our revenue expansion; and third, to expand our free cash flow at a velocity surpassing our earnings growth. FARO operates within highly promising markets poised for growth. By prioritizing our core customers and understanding their evolving needs, we position ourselves to deliver innovative solutions that effectively address their most pressing challenges, giving us the opportunity to outpace market growth rates. Through the combination of diligent efforts to expand our gross margins and a milestone funding approach to operating expense management, we expect to be in a position to realize meaningful operating leverage as revenue grows. This disciplined approach ensures sustainable growth while fostering increased profitability and facilitating heightened cash flow generation. The implementation of the strategic playbook over the last four quarters has significantly bolstered FARO's financial standing. We are enthusiastic about the continued execution of this strategy in the years ahead and are confident in its capacity to drive substantial shareholder value creation. With that, I'll now turn the call over to Matt to provide an overview of our first quarter financial resorts and our second quarter outlook.\n\nMatt Horwath: Thank you, Peter, and good morning, everyone. First quarter revenue of $84.2 million was approximately flat with the first quarter of 2023. Geographically, demand strength in the Europe and Asia Pacific regions helped offset incremental softness in the Americas as a result of lengthening sales cycles, which Peter mentioned earlier. First quarter hardware revenue of $52.6 million was down 4% year-over-year, while software revenue of $10.9 million was up 6% and service revenue of $20.7 million increased by 5%. Recurring revenue was $16.7 million and represented 20% of sales. GAAP gross margin was 51.4% and non-GAAP gross margin was 51.8% for the first quarter of 2024 compared to 47.6% in 2023. As Peter mentioned, in the first quarter, we executed on our variable cost productivity initiatives, including mitigating broker fees and incremental benefits from supply chain localization. Non-GAAP gross margin increased 420 basis points year-over-year. GAAP operating expenses were $48.6 million and included approximately $5.2 million in acquisition-related intangible amortization and stock compensation expenses and $2.7 million in restructuring and other executive transition costs. Non-GAAP operating expense of $40.7 million was down $8.1 million from Q1 last year as we realized the benefit of our restructuring efforts and continued productivity improvements. GAAP operating loss was $5.3 million in the first quarter of 2024 compared with an operating loss of $18.6 million in the first quarter of 2023. Non-GAAP operating income was $3 million in the first quarter of 2024 compared to a loss of $8.3 million in the first quarter of 2023. Adjusted EBITDA was $5.6 million for approximately 6.6% of sales compared to an EBITDA loss of $5.5 million in the first quarter of 2023. Our GAAP net loss was $7.3 million or $0.38 per share. Our non-GAAP net income was $1.7 million or $0.09 per share for the first quarter of 2024 compared to a net loss of $7.1 million or $0.38 per share in Q1 2023. Our cash and short-term investment balance at the end of the quarter was $99.3 million, up $3 million from Q4 due to profitability levels and continued working capital improvements. Given our current accounts receivable balance, expectations for revenue and our new expense base as well as further enhancements to our inventory management, we continue to expect to be cash flow positive throughout the first half of 2024. While we are pleased with our first quarter results and view them as evidence the business is moving in the right direction, we remain cautious in the near term. From a geographic perspective, we do not expect the construction market in China to rebound in the second quarter. And together with the elongating sales cycles in select geographies, we want to remain thoughtful and measured in setting expectations for the second quarter of 2024. Although the macro environment remains choppy, our confidence level continues to increase in our ability to deliver on our execution priorities that we outlined during our March Investor event, specifically in our ability to expand gross margins, control our operating expenses and generate positive free cash flow. As a result, at present FX rates, we expect second quarter revenue of between $79 million and $87 million. At those revenue levels and given corresponding non-GAAP gross margin between 51% and 52.5% and non-GAAP operating expenses of between $41 million and $43 million, we would expect non-GAAP earnings per share ranging from negative $0.08 per share to positive $0.12 per share for second quarter profitability. This concludes our prepared remarks. And at this time, we'd be pleased to take your questions.\n\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] I will take our first question from James Ricchiuti with Needham. Please go ahead.\n\nJames Ricchiuti: Hi. Thank you. Good morning. So I'm looking at the low end and the midpoint of your guidance and it implies virtually no seasonal improvement, which you almost always experience. So I'd like to go into that a little more. Is that conservatism? Or are you seeing something additional in the market that maybe represents more headwinds exiting Q1? Or are there some comparisons at work here? You've talked about China still being weak. And clearly, there were some larger orders that you did call out in APAC, which I'd like to follow up on. But I wonder if you could frame that a little bit for us.\n\nPeter Lau: Hi Jim, this is Pete. Good morning to you as well, and thanks for the question. I mean as we look at our range, normally you would see seasonality. What we talked about in our remarks was a couple of large orders out of China, which a little bit skewed our expectations and our geographical mix in the first quarter. And coupled with some slowing in the developed markets due to larger capacity initiatives from some of our customers. We saw a little bit of a slowdown in longer sales cycles in those developed countries, along with some large orders that we don't necessarily expect to repeat in Q2. So, as we think about the seasonality of the business, you're right, normally it goes up. But if you take those orders out of Q1, the Asia Pacific orders out of Q1, we would expect to see that seasonality along with a cautious outlook in those developed regions as we see kind of how the second quarter develops.\n\nJames Ricchiuti: And can you elaborate on these large orders in APAC. Were they entirely in China? Or were there some other countries? What kind of customer or application, and was this direct sale or a channel partner as you called out last quarter?\n\nPeter Lau: Yes, it's a good question, Jim. And I would say a mix between direct sale and channel partners. But as we've seen the construction market in China continued to remain muted. We've shifted a lot of our sales resources from construction over to manufacturing. And in the manufacturing space, obviously, the Chinese government has put in place measures to stimulate that Chinese economy. And we came across and we were pleasantly surprised, came across some very nice large orders in China in the manufacturing space, both through channel partners and our direct sales teams, and we're really pleased with those orders. But ultimately, those large orders are different from kind of what we experienced quarter-to-quarter. So again, if we remove those from our base, we would see sequential improvement first quarter to second quarter. Obviously, our aim is to always get more large orders, but those orders come with less frequency than our normal flow of business, I would say.\n\nJames Ricchiuti: Understood, okay. Thank you.\n\nOperator: And our next question comes from Greg Palm with Craig-Hallum. Please go ahead.\n\nGreg Palm: Yes. Thanks. Good morning, guys. Thanks for taking the questions here. I just want to follow up a little bit on what you're seeing out there in terms of the elongated sales cycles. Just to be clear, is it concentrated in a certain geography, in certain end markets or segments? I just want to be clear exactly what you're saying.\n\nPeter Lau: Yes, thanks, Greg, good morning, and thank you for the question. What I would say is we see the market specifically in the U.S. and Western Europe. We see those markets continuing to be strong in the manufacturing side of our business. So strong in fact that our customers are so busy with larger type CapEx and capacity-related initiatives. And ultimately, our products tend to be smaller CapEx-related initiatives. And so, as those customers move through their cycles to increase their capacity, it's just elongated our sales cycle and a little bit in the first quarter. And we would hope and expect to see those sales cycles sort of normalize as we move into the second quarter. But we want to be cautious because we did see that elongation in the first quarter. Again, I would say, in Western Europe and specifically in the U.S.\n\nGreg Palm: Because I was going to follow up with trying to tie out what you're seeing with some better maybe macro data or at least a stabilization in some of the manufacturing data, the PMIs, especially over in Europe. And I know that's kind of a good sort of -- it's a metric, maybe a lagging metric for your business. But how do you sort of tie what we're seeing in some of the macro indicators with kind of what you're sort of hearing or seeing in your own business? And I'm more asking about as we progress throughout the year, not just Q2.\n\nPeter Lau: It's really a good question. And you're right. We have seen the PMI stabilized and maybe uptick a little bit. Although I would call out that in certain countries, it's better than others around the world. But on the whole, you're right. Generally, I think you're also right to point out that it is a bit of a leading indicator. And historically, if you remember back to our March event, we showed our revenue growth and the correlation to the PMI trends. And we typically see a 2- to 3- to 4-quarter lag relative to the PMI and our revenue. And so it is good news for us as the PMI continues to strengthen. And of course, it depends on our mix and where those countries, the PMI is being strong and where it's weakening a little bit. But on the whole, I would definitely classify it as a leading indicator, and we generally lag that by a couple of quarters.\n\nGreg Palm: And then last one, I recall you talking about price a little bit as a lever. And I'm curious where you're at if you've taken price up across certain product lines across most product lines? How that was received by the customer base, the feedback, maybe the timing of some of those price increases? Can you just give us a little bit of color there, please?\n\nPeter Lau: Sure Greg. We announced a price increase at the beginning of the year. And ultimately, when we announced price increases, our quotes are good for a period of time. And so I would say feedback so far has been positive. But ultimately, because of that lag between announced date and implementation date, while we've seen positive outlook and feedback to that price increase, we've not recognized a ton of price in our results yet and view that as an opportunity moving forward.\n\nOperator: Thank you. And this concludes our Q&A session. I will now turn the call over to Peter Lau for closing remarks.\n\nPeter Lau: Thank you, operator. On behalf of all of our colleagues, I want to thank you for your interest in FARO. FARO has a strong foundation, and we continue to improve our financial performance. As we outlined in our March Investor Event, we are extremely enthusiastic about our strategic playbook and ability to create short- and long-term shareholder value. Our first quarter performance was a significant step towards achieving our long-term goals as we demonstrated a fundamental shift in our operating model. We look forward to sharing our progress towards those goals and the execution of our strategy in future quarters. This concludes our call today. Thank you very much for your time.\n\nOperator: This does conclude today's program. Thank you for your participation.

A reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the closest GAAP measure on historical basis can be found in the press release, the slide presentation or the financial supplement, which are posted on our website, as I mentioned earlier. With those comments, I will turn the call over to Jack.\n\nJohn Roche: Thank you, Oksana. Good morning, everyone, and thank you all for joining us. We opened 2024 with an excellent first quarter, delivering robust earnings and effectively executing on our margin recapture and CAT mitigation plans. Consistent with our focus over the past several quarters, we remain disciplined and discerning in our growth as we continue to reposition our Personal Lines business and to improve earnings resiliency in our overall mix in order to drive strong, sustainable returns for our shareholders over the long term. On today's call, I will share my perspective on our results, as well as my thoughts on why we believe our company is well positioned to continue to deliver improving financial performance in 2024. Jeff will review our financial and operating results in more detail, and discuss our expectations for the second quarter and through year-end. Finally, we will open the line for questions. After-tax operating income for the quarter was $112 million, or $3.08 per diluted share, generating an operating return on equity of 15%. We improved our ex-CAT combined ratio by more than 2 points in the quarter demonstrating the effectiveness of our margin recapture initiatives. As expected, overall growth was subdued in the quarter at 2.3% as we continue to prioritize profitability improvement actions. We expect to accelerate the pace of growth throughout 2024, and we expect to generate net written premium growth in the mid-single-digit range for the full year. We continue to effectively leverage our strong relationships with our best-in-class independent agent partners, helping them successfully navigate the dynamic marketplace and enabling us to build momentum in our target markets. Turning to our segment highlights. In Specialty, we delivered another quarter of exceptional profitability, generating a combined ratio of 87.6%. Consistent with the outlook we provided on our year-end call, Specialty growth picked up from the low watermark in the fourth quarter. The market is very healthy and remains robust with exciting opportunities across Multiple Lines including Excess and Surplus Lines, Marine, Specialty Industrial Property, Healthcare and Surety. Other areas such as Professional and Executive Lines remain competitive, but we are seeing opportunities and premium growth picking up as well. In light of our robust profitability in this subsegment, we will continue to strike a prudent balance appropriately pricing risk while protecting our highly profitable book of business and pursuing quality new business opportunities. At the same time, our Specialty top line results still reflect the impact of underwriting actions on specific underperforming programs within our Specialty P&C subsegment. The impact of these actions is expected to decrease as the year progresses. We expect Specialty net written premium growth in the upper single digits for the full year of 2024 as we further capitalize on our broad diversification and favorable market dynamics in most of our segments. In Marine, we anticipate significant growth in 2024 as we capitalize on opportunities across our diverse portfolio of inland marine products and sectors. In E&S, we expect the recent implementation of our new policy platform will enable us to capture even more market share beginning in the current quarter. In Professional and Executive Lines, we see potential for increased growth in areas such as management liability and selected areas of our Professional Liability business. We're confident we can capitalize on these opportunities as they present themselves throughout the year, and that we will drive meaningful top line growth and further diversification across our overall business mix. Looking at Core Commercial, we are pleased with the segment's strong performance as we continue to provide our agents with a highly attractive portfolio of capabilities. Our Core Commercial team maintained its focus on driving growth in Small Commercial while executing on margin improvement initiatives in Middle Market. Small Commercial grew by approximately 8% in the quarter, fueled by the continued success of our highly intuitive TAP sales platform. Our national rollout of this quote-to-issue platform for bot business is now complete. With that, we are actively working on adding the workers' compensation line of business to the platform, which will support our new business growth efforts in that area. In addition, we are expanding the use of APIs to further enhance our TAP sales reach by efficiently connecting to additional sources of business and adding targeted products to our specialized offerings. In Middle Market, we continue to achieve better and more consistent earnings performance by aggressively nonrenewing bottom decile property business. We're also adjusting our new business appetite to reflect the changing environment, and ensuring that our pursuits are focused on high-quality accounts in targeted sectors and geographies. Additionally, we are making considerable progress against our IoT sensor enrollment program. While the program is targeted at most of our Property Lines, Middle Market remains in the epicenter of these actions given the higher limits profile. Across all of our business lines, we've deployed over 10,000 water and temperature sensors. That program has already resulted in numerous instances of loss prevention and mitigation. We believe we have achieved scale, meaning that operationally, we have enough sensors deployed where we can collect data and recognize trends, such as identifying geographic territories with higher risk profiles, several types of system failures or trends across certain industry sectors. We believe this data will enable us to work even more effectively with our policyholders, providing guidance on how best to build resiliency. Overall, the Commercial P&C market remains rational, and continues to support needed price increases amid recent property loss trends and emerging industry concerns about casualty. For example, new business pricing in Small Commercial continues to accelerate and outpace loss trends. In what has become an increasingly dynamic loss trend environment, we're often asked about our position relative to the social inflation challenges affecting the P&C industry. As a member of the American Property Casualty Insurance Association and other trade associations, we are actively engaged in promoting awareness and reforms to stem the cost of legal system abuse and in advocating for change. In addition, we believe our current liability profile will help us effectively navigate current social inflation trends. On a relative basis, we have a low policy limit profile with over 93% of our liability policy limits at or below $1 million. We have secured and are maintaining low per-risk reinsurance retention, which attaches at $2.5 million, and we have avoided areas that attract a higher level of liability severity and are increasingly challenging to price adequately such as public D&O insurance and stand-alone excess umbrella policies. Over the last several years, we've also taken steps to lower our risk exposure in large metropolitan areas and in industries that are more susceptible to social inflation, reducing umbrella limits in certain lines in highly litigious jurisdictions and executing rate increases to stay on top of trend assumptions. We have approached this issue with a thoughtful and intentional strategy that we believe enables us to effectively manage the current liability environment. Turning to Personal Lines. The business continues to demonstrate improved profitability and is performing largely on track relative to our expectations. Our loss ratio in both Auto and Home decreased compared with the first quarter of last year, in line with our assumptions. Personal Lines renewal price change was a robust 22.8% in the quarter. What's more? All targeted new business is subject to product changes, including an increase in all peril deductibles and the addition of wind and hail deductibles in certain geographies. These changes also are being rolled out with the renewals in targeted states. In addition, we continued to address geographic micro concentrations in the Midwest. As a result of our intense focus on profit improvement, as expected, net written premium growth in Personal Lines was flat year-over-year in the first quarter. We reduced our exposure in the Midwest in a deliberate and controlled manner during the quarter, resulting in a 4% decline in premiums in this region and an approximate 8% decline in policies in force. Having the flexibility and the willingness to shed premiums to reposition our book will lead to improved profit margins in a higher, more resilient profit pool in the future. To that point, excluding Midwestern states, we have delivered growth of 4% with PIF down only 2% year-over-year. Primarily driven by lower new business, while retention remained relatively stable at over 84%. This said, in select geographies, we are already pivoting to a more aggressive new business stance where we have hit our profitability milestones on a written basis and where we are already comfortable with diversification positioning. Overall, the Personal Lines market remains robust. We expect premium growth to accelerate from this point forward and pricing to remain firm in 2024. In the Midwest, we are seeing others follow our lead, implementing higher deductibles and introducing other product changes to offset loss trends. Our Personal Line's account orientation is unique in the independent agency channel, with about 88% of our business representing a whole account. In our view, that orientation creates a preferred customer base that is both more protection minded and far less price elastic which we believe will position us for continued success. As we work to institute increased pricing deductibles and to adjust terms and conditions, our strong independent agency relationships are once again proving to be critical. Just a few weeks ago, we met with over 120 of our largest, most successful agents at our Annual President's Club Conference. We held a number of executive meetings focused on how we can best support our agents in the current dynamic market environment and grow our business together. We believe our independent partner agents fully recognize the critical role they play in our efforts to advance customer adoption of risk prevention and mitigation tools as well as in garnering customer support for the needed pricing increases we are implementing. We walked away from this annual event with more confidence than ever in the strength of our distribution platform and the commitment of our agent partners. In summary, our excellent performance in Q1 underscores the strength, diversification and resilience of our business. We already have begun to see the positive effects of our underwriting actions, catastrophe management initiatives and other proactive steps to enhance profitability across our businesses. We look forward through year-end and beyond with a tremendous sense of optimism. Confident in our ability to deliver increasingly stronger results to execute on our strategic priorities and to deliver value for our shareholders, agent partners and customers. With that, I'll turn the call over to Jeff.\n\nJeff Farber: Thank you, Jack, and good morning, everyone. I'll begin with an overview of our first quarter results, discuss our segment financial highlights and investment performance and then mention our 2024 outlook. We are very pleased with our strong start for the year, posting a first quarter combined ratio of 95.5%. We delivered a combined ratio, excluding catastrophes, of 89.5%, a 2.2 point improvement over the prior year quarter. Our current accident year loss ratio, excluding catastrophes, improved 1.9 points to 59.3% reflecting the continued earning-in of price increases. Our results were highlighted by a year-over-year reduction in the underlying loss ratio in Personal Lines and Specialty. Strong and steady margins in Core Commercial also contributed to the excellent performance. The continued improvement in profitability validates the effectiveness of our margin recapture plan, and gives us confidence that we are on the right path to deliver on our long-term ROE target of 14% or higher. At 30.9%, our first quarter expense ratio was slightly above our full year target of 30.7%, primarily due to the timing of certain expenses. Relative to the first quarter of last year, the expense ratio is higher primarily driven by changes in variable compensation accruals between the two periods as well as increased investments in our Specialty business this year, consistent with our growth and market share gain strategy. We remain on track to deliver a full year expense ratio of 30.7% in 2024. Catastrophe activity was within our CAT assumption for the quarter, accounting for 6% of net earned premium. Northeast floods in January and hail events in February and March were the main contributors to CAT losses. Ex-CAT prior year development was approximately $10 million favorable in the quarter driven by overall favorability in Core Commercial and Specialty. Each of the main lines of business in our Core segment developed favorably. Personal Lines prior year development was immaterial overall. Favorable development in Auto was offset by some unfavorable development in Home and Other. As we noted in our year-end call, the industry is experiencing elevated auto-related umbrella losses, and we prudently increased our recent prior year loss expectations in response. Overall, a combination of reserving prudence and favorable liability mix characteristics in Commercial Lines continues to serve us well. Now I'll review underlying segment results beginning with Specialty. Our Specialty book continued its track record of profitability in the quarter, delivering an ex-CAT combined ratio of 85.4%, 2.4 points better than the prior year quarter. The underlying loss ratio of 48.7% marked an improvement of 4.8 points over the prior year quarter, primarily from lower-than-expected losses in our Specialty Property business. Our longer-term loss expectation for Specialty remains in the low 50s. From a top line perspective, we remain on track to accelerate Specialty growth to the upper single digits for the full 2024 year. Our Core Commercial segment delivered an ex-CAT combined ratio of 90.0% in the first quarter. a 2.1 point improvement year-over-year. The Core Commercial current accident year loss ratio, excluding catastrophes, was relatively in line with our expectations and the prior year quarter at 58.5%. At the same time, we are intently watching for liability trends, including social inflation pressures in Casualty Lines. Trends in our book of business so far remains stable and very manageable. Our litigated frequency per exposure has returned to normal levels in 2022 and '23 after unusually low frequency of litigation in 2020 and '21. Overall, general liability loss frequency continues to decline, while the mix of claims is shifting to more complex claims, contributing to an increased loss severity. Commercial auto liability frequency seems to have settled at a new normal somewhat below the pre-pandemic levels, while severity is elevated but manageable. Workers' compensation remains stable, with a slight increase in indemnity while medical inflation remains within our expectations. Of course, we continue to monitor trends closely. We are managing our liability profile very carefully, as Jack discussed. Importantly, we are maintaining a very disciplined approach to our prudent liability loss picks and prior year estimations, taking small adjustments if and when needed, and promptly incorporating our updated view of trends into pricing and terms and conditions. We established this approach back in 2016 when we materially added to our reserve position as a new leadership team, while at the same time, initiating a shift in liability mix. We also adhered to thoughtful prudence during low-frequency COVID periods. We continue to feel confident in our reserve position. Core Commercial Lines net written premiums grew 3% in the first quarter. Rates continue to hold firm in both property and most liability lines, while retention ticked down 1.7 points for the quarter due to targeted nonrenewals in middle market, in-keeping with our positive strategic decision to sacrifice some top line growth in exchange for improved margin. Now moving on to Personal Lines. This segment delivered an ex-CAT combined ratio of 91.1%, an improvement of 5.1 points over the first quarter of 2023. The Personal Lines current accident year loss ratio, excluding catastrophes, improved 2.4 points to 65.6%, with the accelerating benefit of prior and current rate increases earning-in, coupled with moderating collision and property loss costs, we expect meaningful improvement in our ex-CAT loss ratio to continue throughout 2024. Auto current accident year loss ratio, excluding catastrophes of 73.6% in the first quarter improved 2.2 points year-over-year, driven by the benefit of earned pricing increases. Additionally, our data indicates that collision loss severity is easing, in particular for used car prices. We are also experiencing some deceleration in the cost of parts as well as lower rental costs due to shorter repair cycle times. At the same time, we remain cautious about liability coverages in auto and therefore, reflected an elevated loss expectation in current accident year picks in bodily injury. Similar to Commercial Auto, bodily injury frequency seems to have settled at a level below pre-COVID, while severity is elevated due to a higher occurrence of catastrophic claims, including pedestrian, bicycle and motorcycle hits and crashes at high speeds. However, as the benefit of higher rate continues to earn-in and the property loss trends ease, we expect significant loss ratio improvement for Auto throughout 2024. Home and Other current accident year loss ratio, excluding catastrophes, improved 2.4 points to 54.5%, driven by rate and exposure adjustments earning in. Also within Home and Other, we prudently increased loss ratio expectation for umbrella coverage in response to prior year development and an increase in catastrophic auto accidents in the industry. Of course, umbrella rates are up meaningfully compared to historical levels and the market is reacting accordingly. Both Auto and Home Lines of business achieved strong pricing increases in the first quarter. Auto price was up 18.2%, and we expect it to continue to stay solid throughout the year. Home price was up 30.2% on average in the first quarter including 19.6 points of rate and 10.5 points of exposure increases. We expect Personal Lines pricing to remain robust for the remainder of the year. However, Home exposures will tick down starting in the second quarter as insurance to value inflation adjustments return to more normal levels. Additionally, all peril and wind and hail deductibles start being applied to the majority of our target renewals in April, effectively lowering our risk on every property where such deductibles are applied. Equally important, earned prices will continue to accelerate for some time, increasing underwriting margins. Looking ahead, we expect the benefit of strong earned Personal Lines pricing and more stable property loss trend to drive a meaningfully improved Personal Lines current accident year ex-CAT loss ratio throughout 2024. Furthermore, we anticipate some additional improvements as the result of increased home inspections and new business rigor implemented in 2023 in homeowners. We expect significant margin improvement in Auto and Home to pace a return to target profitability by the end of this year on a written basis and in 2025 on an earned basis. Moving on to investment performance. Net investment income increased $11 million or about 14% to $89.7 million in the first quarter 2024, primarily driven by strong fixed income results from higher bond yields. The current rate environment should continue to provide an accumulating benefit to net investment income in 2024 and subsequent years. Historically, much of our investment portfolio was internally managed. After an in-depth and thoughtful analysis, we have made the decision to transfer management of the investment-grade fixed maturity portion of our investment assets to an external manager. We believe the switch to an outsourced model will allow us to benefit from the expansive capabilities of a large-scale asset manager, including their market depth and knowledge among others. Longer term, we hope that the external asset manager will help us to further optimize our investment portfolio's contribution to The Hanover's bottom line. We expect to complete this transition before the end of the second quarter. Moving on to book value and capital position. Strong earnings in the first quarter were partially offset by an increase in the fixed income portfolio's unrealized loss position, marking a 1.9% sequential increase in GAAP book value per share to $70.22. Statutory surplus increased by about 5% to $2.8 billion. In this dynamic environment, we remain focused on ensuring we maintain ample financial flexibility to support our business. Although we refrained from making any share repurchases this quarter, returning capital to shareholders through regular quarterly dividends and share buybacks remain important elements of our long-term capital allocation strategy. For the second quarter of 2024 our planned CAT load is 8.5%. As we mentioned in February, we have intended to pick higher on the probability curve in establishing our full year 2024 CAT load of 7%, and that it should decline for 2025. Our CAT guidance does not yet reflect the ultimate impact of substantial terms and conditions changes in Personal Lines that are currently underway. In summary, we are off to a strong start in 2024. We are executing successfully on our margin recapture initiatives and disciplined growth strategies concentrated in our most profitable lines of business. Our financial and operational performance is underpinned by targeted underwriting, strong pricing and a commitment to provide the products and services our agent partners and customers value most. We will continue to focus on creating long-term growth and superior returns for our shareholders. With that, we will now open the line for questions. Operator?\n\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And the first question will come from Michael Phillips with Oppenheimer.\n\nMichael Phillips: First question, Jeff, on your comments there on Core Commercial, specifically GL, frequency is still down. good news there. I guess, maybe a brief description of why you think that's still the case and how long that could continue? And then part of that, too, is you said more complex claims. Can you talk about what you're seeing to describe those complex claims?\n\nJeff Farber: Sure. In terms of the frequency, I think we're seeing some of our insureds there's less physical activity going into the premises. And in some cases, people aren't going into malls, people aren't going into restaurants quite as often, and that's creating a reduced frequency. That's been pretty dramatic. In terms of the complex claims, you're seeing less minor claims, so the overall proportion of claims is growing with respect to the complex claims or more severity that's having lawyer involvement and the like.\n\nMichael Phillips: Okay. And I guess, secondly, maybe just more higher level. You talked about in the Specialty business, the investments you're making, and some pressure on the expense ratio. How long will those investments continue? And then maybe just talk about growth opportunities or what those investments are going to accrue to you over the next couple of years?\n\nJohn Roche: Yes, Mike, this is Jack. Thanks for that question. We're -- we're quite excited about the performance of our Specialty business. And as 2023 concluded, we made a decision to look at the best-performing areas of Specialty and make some additional investments from a resource standpoint. And we also invested in a platform that affected a few of our newer and profitable businesses. So I'll let Bryan kind of speak to that, but we know that the growth trajectory that we have ahead for Specialty will make the expense ratio very [pairable]. And overall, what you should get from that is that we're investing in one of our key businesses.\n\nBryan Salvatore: Yes, sure. So I'll just give a little bit of more detail there, right? So for example, we've been leaning into technology for our E&S business, right? This is a fast-growing, very profitable area. We built out a completely new system for them. As you may know, they also have a lot of submissions and quotes in the E&S space. So we will get a lot of efficiency and upside from that type of investment. We're also adding staff to that area. And it's not just in our E&S area. We're also investing in the platform for our Industrial Property business, and we're investing in staff for our Marine business and our Healthcare businesses. So a number of our areas that we see is quite profitable, growing and having a lot of opportunity we're investing in. And I do think to Jack's point, that will earn through the revenue -- will earn through and that will absolutely help us on the expense side.\n\nJeff Farber: Mike, notwithstanding investing heavily in our most profitable and ultimately fastest-growing business. We're still committed to the 30.7% expense ratio for the overall firm.\n\nOperator: The next question will come from Michael Zaremski with BMO Capital Markets.\n\nJack Matten: This is Jack on for Mike. You touched on this in the prepared remarks, but just curious if you could offer more color on the deconcentration strategy and progress in Personal Lines. Specifically in Michigan and perhaps in the Northeast as well? Are you reducing concentration in those geographies meaningfully? Or are you losing fewer customers and expect as you successfully push improved terms and conditions, including higher deductibles?\n\nJohn Roche: Yes. This is Jack again. I frankly couldn't be any more pleased with the execution that we're seeing within Personal Lines and frankly, the rest of the enterprise, because as we think about property aggregations and we think about spreading our risk and implementing terms and conditions, that requires the entire enterprise to kind of contribute. But specific to Personal Lines, we are right on target with the thresholds and the milestones that we set for ourselves so much so that with the implementation, particularly on the renewal terms and conditions, if that continues to go as well as we project that we can continue to change the dials on our new business appetite. We've already done that in 5 of our states. We're looking at the next 5. So I think of this as a big picture is we are making meaningful progress on our margin recapture and simultaneously advancing our diversification efforts at a really good clip. So I couldn't be more pleased with the way that's playing out in Personal Lines.\n\nJeff Farber: From a premium and insured perspective, you'll see some PIF shrink into 2025. But from a premium growth perspective, you'll start seeing some growth continuing to get larger from here on, from here forward.\n\nRichard Lavey: And this is Dick Lavey, one last point to your question about the Midwest versus the Northeast. Yes, exactly as Jeff said, we're manufacturing the PIF reduction in the Midwest 3x to 4x the rate in other geographies. That's really where the confection storm issues have prevailed and the wind and hail deductibles are being in place. The Northeast doesn't have those perils. So our Northeast business retention is higher and PIF shrinkage is less.\n\nJack Matten: And second question is on reserve development, which was healthy again this quarter. I was wondering if there's any change in your high-level view on loss expense trends? You talked about frequency trends normalizing for some Casualty Lines. But wondering if you're seeing any changes in severity. I'm just asking given that some other insurers have increased their loss inflation forecast recently?\n\nJeff Farber: Yes. So overall, we're very comfortable with our balance sheet and very prudent in how we set reserves. In Core Commercial, we -- every major line was favorable. So feeling really good about that. Overall, our Property Casualty mix, while a little bit challenging during the inflation in that period, serves us reasonably well as casualty trends spike up. And Specialty is also largely a claims-made policy construction, which will help us, Jack talked about the limit structure in his prepared remarks, where 93% is less than or equal to $1 million overall and 77% in Core. And we also talked about how comfortable we are and the approach we took around reserving both in 2016 and 2020. And then finally, the concentration or our geographic focus, we -- back in '17, '18, '19, we really wanted to deemphasize the major metropolitan cities. Think about L.A., Chicago, New York, and that has really, really served us well. So while frequency is down, severity is up dramatically, and I think we've been prudent at picking and preparing for that all the while bringing up our severity picks.\n\nOperator: The next question will come from Meyer Shields with KBW.\n\nUnidentified Analyst: Thank you. It's [Jane] on for Meyer. My first question is on the core loss ratio for commercial. It was flat year-over-year. Just curious what your expectation for here onward? Is the run rate that we should think about going forward?\n\nJeff Farber: We're getting rate meaningfully above loss trend. And so we feel optimistic about our ability to have some improvement in the loss ratio going forward. From time to time, you have particularly higher or lower individual losses for property. I think a year ago, we happened to have had some lower levels losses this particular quarter, a little bit higher. But I'm pleased with how that business is producing at 58.5%, but I think we have a little bit of opportunity to improve that going forward as the rate earns in.\n\nUnidentified Analyst: Perfect. That's helpful. My second question is on Personal Auto. I saw like a slight reserve charge there. I know it's very small. Just wondering if you can add more color on that? Just want to make sure I'm not missing anything behind it.\n\nJeff Farber: Can you clarify the question? I think I missed a word or two. It was about Personal Auto and what was the concern on the slide?\n\nUnidentified Analyst: It's not a concern, just there's a slight reserves charge on that?\n\nJeff Farber: So in Personal Lines, overall, we had no development. Auto was favorable and Home was slightly -- it was adverse. And in Home, it was actually the umbrella. And truth be told, it's actually Auto that's showing itself in the umbrella. And I think we talked in our prepared remarks about some of the catastrophic activities such as pedestrian hits and some of those things are driving us to increase our picks for both prior and current period for umbrella.\n\nOperator: The next question will come from Grace Carter with Bank of America (NYSE:BAC).\n\nGrace Carter: Hi, everyone. The data on limits that you gave for the Liability exposures in Core Commercial is really helpful. Just kind of looking at continued growth in the Small Commercial book versus the underwriting and Middle Market over the past few quarters? Even though that's kind of geared towards the property side. I was wondering if you expect any sort of perceptible impact on the limits going forward in the liability book just kind of given maybe a greater emphasis on smaller accounts?\n\nJohn Roche: Yes, Grace, this is Jack. Given our current trajectory of growth patterns, I think those -- that limits profile will be either equally as impressive or maybe even a little bit better because we are growing our smaller business, both in the Core Lines and in Specialty at a faster clip. And we believe we have a real competitive advantage in both of those areas. That said, I think as we move through this liability environment. Longer term, our hope and expectation is, is that we can put ourselves in a position so we can participate in the mid-range Specialty business and eventually middle market in a more robust way. But this is an environment where I think caution and prudence is appropriate. But I don't want you to miss the point that our relevance with agents and our ability to take the company to the next level, has some bearing on whether we can navigate these trends that we're all going through and grow all of our businesses into the future. So that's how we're approaching it.\n\nGrace Carter: And I guess following up on that, I think last quarter, you all had mentioned maybe a greater emphasis on Liability Lines versus history going forward. I was just wondering if given kind of, I guess, the noise is growing loud around social inflation around the industry, if there's been any tweaks to that plan so far on the magnitude of the shift? And just kind of any sort of progress on how you're thinking about that so far?\n\nJohn Roche: Yes. I think we -- I think at the time, we were clear about the fact that this was not going to be a major step change in one direction or the other. We were clearly disadvantaged last year by having more property in our mix than some of our competitors. I believe we'll be less disadvantaged and potentially advantaged going forward if the liability trends continue to present themselves. So I think to your point, Grace, we're not having an identity crisis with our book mix, we're trying to optimize. And where we see particularly in certain geographies, in certain sectors. We are moving forward on our liability mix. Bryan spoke about that, particularly in E&S and the lower end of Management Liability and our Healthcare businesses. We have great margins, great transparency to what growth looks like. So overall, I think you're right, it will be somewhat balanced. We're pretty excited about our business mix going forward.\n\nOperator: The next question is a follow-up from Michael Phillips with Oppenheimer.\n\nMichael Phillips: Just your last couple of questions there. On Small Commercial kind of prodded me on this one. Small Commercial has been kind of a sweet spot for the industry for a while. You guys are killing it there. But I guess because it's been such a sweet spot, it seems like -- it feels like at least going back a couple of years, that's a place where many people said they would want to go. And not sure you've seen them come into that space and maybe the competitive landscape has changed? And if not, here's why not? Maybe what's the moat to get into that space and be as successful as you guys are?\n\nJohn Roche: Yes, Mike, I think that's very perceptive, and I'll let Dick speak to that. But I do believe that Small Commercial a business that takes significant investment and frankly, insight in terms of where the profit pools are? What pricing sophistication needs to look like? And so it is not something that you can just turn the switch and get into, and there have been carriers that have highlighted that and either not made the progress that they intended to make or in some cases, regressed. So Dick, maybe you can build on that.\n\nRichard Lavey: You hit it well. I mean this business is one where ease of doing business wins the day, and I know that's an overused term, but that means all the elements of the operating model aligned from the people, the way you have them, the way you do new business, the way renewals are handled. And of course, the platform that you put on the agent's desktop for them to submit and issue business. So as you know, we've made significant investments going back 3, 4 years on that. Our first product BOP is now completely rolled out, and we're working hard to get more comp added to it. So other competitors haven't frankly made those levels of investments. There are some that we compete well against day-to-day, but we're absolutely thrilled with where this business is and looking into the future, now that the platform is nearing completion, we feel comfortable actually expanding distribution and finding other points of access.\n\nOperator: This concludes our question-and-answer session.

Welcome to the Cactus Q1 2024 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speaker's presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Alan Boyd, Director of Corporate Development and Investor Relations.\n\nAlan Boyd: Thank you, and good morning. We appreciate you joining us on today's call. Our speakers will be Scott Bender, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Al Keifer, our Interim Chief Financial Officer. Also joining us today are Joel Bender, President; Steven Bender, Chief Operating Officer; Steve Tadlock, CEO of FlexSteel; and Will Marsh, our General Counsel. Please note that any comments we make on today's call regarding projections or expectations for future events are forward-looking statements covered by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act. Forward-looking statements are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, many of which are beyond our control. These risks and uncertainties can cause actual results to differ materially from our current expectations. We advise listeners to review our earnings release and the risk factors discussed in our filings with the SEC. Any forward-looking statements we make today are only as of today's date, and we undertake no obligation to publicly update or review any forward-looking statements. In addition, during today's call, we will reference certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are included in our earnings release. With that, I'll turn the call over to Scott.\n\nScott Bender: Thanks, Alan, and good morning to everyone. We began 2024 with solid execution as revenues in both segments exceeded our expectations. I'm particularly pleased with Spoolable Technologies' sales in the first quarter, which increased from the fourth quarter, largely due to strong sales to our large integrated customers. During this period, we also saw renewed international activity in the segment. This strength, which provides usual seasonal softness in the first quarter, further demonstrates the differentiation inherent in our spoolable products as well as the benefits of expanding the product line of our overall Cactus portfolio. Some first quarter total company highlights include revenue of $274 million, adjusted EBITDA of $95 million, adjusted EBITDA margins of 34.8%. We paid a quarterly dividend of $0.12 per share, and we increased our cash balance to a $194 million. I'll now turn the call over to Al Keifer, our CFO, who will review our financial results. Following his remarks, I'll provide some thoughts on our outlook for the near term before opening the lines for Q&A. So Al?\n\nAlan Keifer: Thank you. As Scott mentioned, total Q1 revenues were $274 million. For our Pressure Control segment, revenues of $175 million were down 3% sequentially, driven primarily by decreased customer activity. Operating income decreased $4.4 million or 7.8% sequentially, with operating margins decreasing 160 basis points. Adjusted segment EBITDA decreased $4 million or 6.2% sequentially with margins decreasing by 120 basis points. The margin declines were primarily due to lower operating leverage. For our Spoolable Technologies segment, revenues of $99 million were up 5% sequentially on higher customer demand largely from the majors. Operating income decreased $11.8 million sequentially due primarily to an increase in the expense resulting from the remeasurement of the FlexSteel earn-out liability. Adjusted segment EBITDA decreased $0.4 million or 1.1% sequentially, while margins decreased by 240 basis points due to an increase in input costs. Corporate and other expenses were $5.5 million in Q1, down $0.2 million sequentially. On a total company basis, first quarter adjusted EBITDA was $95 million, down 4.8% from $100 million during the fourth quarter. Adjusted EBITDA margin for the first quarter was 34.8% compared to 36.4% for the fourth quarter. Adjustments to total company EBITDA during the first quarter included noncash charges of $4.4 million in stock-based compensation and a $13.3 million loss related to the FlexSteel earn-out liability remeasurement. Depreciation and amortization expense for the first quarter was $15 million, which includes $4 million of amortization expense related to intangible assets recorded as part of purchase accounting. Total depreciation and amortization expense during the second quarter is expected to be approximately $15 million, $7 million of which is associated with our Pressure Control segment and $8 million of which is associated with Spoolable Technologies. Income tax expense during the first quarter was approximately $13 million. During the first quarter, the public or Class A ownership of the company was 82%. Barring further changes in our public ownership percentage, we expect an effective tax rate of approximately 22% for Q2 2024. GAAP net income was $50 million in the first quarter versus $62 million during the fourth quarter. The decrease was largely driven by the increase in the remeasurement of the earn-out liability. Adjusted net income and earnings per share were $60 million and $0.75 per share, respectively, during the first quarter, compared to $65 million and $0.81 per share in the fourth quarter. Adjusted net income for the first quarter was net of a 26% tax rate applied to our adjusted pretax income. We estimate that the tax rate for adjusted EPS will be 26% during the second quarter of 2024. During the first quarter, we paid a quarterly dividend of $0.12 per share, resulting in a cash outflow of approximately $10 million, including related distributions to members. The Board has approved a quarterly dividend of $0.12 per share to be paid in June. We ended the quarter with a cash balance of $194 million, a sequential increase of approximately $60 million. Net capex was approximately $7 million during the first quarter. Our full year 2024 capex outlook remains in the range of $45 million to $55 million. In conclusion, the revenue-based FlexSteel earn-out payment is currently estimated to be approximately $34.1 million, which will be paid in the third quarter of this year. This additional consideration has been more than offset by the substantial outperformance of the business, relative to our expectations. That covers the financial review, and I will now turn the call back over to Scott.\n\nScott Bender: Thanks, Al. I'll now touch on our expectations for the second quarter of 2024, our reporting segment. During the second quarter, we expect Pressure Control revenue to be relatively flat versus the first quarter, despite our anticipation that the U.S. land rig count will be slightly down from the first quarter average levels in the period as the effects of rig releases in gas basins lead to lower activity. Adjusted EBITDA margins in our Pressure Control segment are expected to be essentially flat at 33% to 35% for the second quarter. This adjusted EBITDA guidance excludes approximately $3 million of stock-based comp expense within the segment. As mentioned previously, we anticipate introducing our latest generation wellhead to customers in the coming months, which should begin to more significantly impact operating results late this year depending on our inventory position. Regarding our Mid-East expansion plans, we are pursuing 2 viable options in the region. But as we are at a commercially sensitive stage, I do not plan to share further details with you at this time. We believe the current market for surface pressure control equipment in Saudi Arabia exceeds $0.5 billion annually, and we look forward to establishing a more material presence in this market in the coming years. We view the recent shift towards onshore unconventional gas production to be net positive to our potential business. In addition, we are currently finalizing the terms of a significant international order outside of the Mid-East. Switching over to Spoolable Technologies' segment, we expect second quarter revenue to be slightly up from the first quarter with increased installation efficiency from better seasonal activity, sales to midstream customers and continued international shipments, offsetting general industry trends. Our cross-selling initiatives continue to expand, and we're enjoying the benefits of enhanced relationships with our core customers. We expect adjusted EBITDA margins in this segment to be approximately 36% to 38% for the second quarter. Increased input costs are impacting margins in the first half of the year, although we have seen a moderation from the recent peak. Additionally, we began to utilize our pressure control, low-cost supply chain to source select components of our spoolable pipe product, which should enhance margins as the sourcing effort expands throughout 2024. Note that this margin guidance excludes approximately $1 million of stock-based comp in this segment. Adjusted corporate EBITDA is expected to be approximately a $4 million loss in Q2, flat from the first quarter, which excludes approximately $1.5 million of stock-based compensation. Although the macro backdrop provides little reason for optimism about 2024 U.S. activity levels, we remain well positioned at the market and plan to execute on several internal initiatives this year that should improve cash flows and returns. These initiatives include our low-cost supply chain diversification strategy, the introduction of our latest generation wellhead, enhanced frac innovations and the progression of our expansion into international markets. Additionally, I remain very pleased with the integration of our Spoolable Technologies business, which has recently received inquiries from several non-oil and gas customers for large international projects and increasing number of orders of our pipe from a major new midstream customer with a strong outlook for larger awards later this year. Further, CCUS related inquiries are increasing, and we are involved with a customer in hydrogen transmission testing. We believe these new applications, along with the opportunity to gain market share with our existing E&P customer base, should lead to further above market growth in this segment. These recent inquiries and wins further demonstrate the differentiation in the business and reinforce our rationale for this acquisition. So with that, I'll turn it back over to the operator, and we can begin Q&A. Operator?\n\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Stephen Gengaro with Stifel.\n\nStephen Gengaro: So, two things for me. What I'll start with is when we think about our model for you guys, we basically think about North America, right? And you've mentioned some international opportunities and growth. From your seat, when would you expect -- just from a large bigger picture, international to start sort of really showing up on the income statement, where we need to be thinking about sort of baking that into our forecast? Is it later this year? Is it next year? How should we think about that?\n\nScott Bender: Yes. I think it would be next year for it to be a meaningful entry.\n\nStephen Gengaro: Okay. And when [indiscernible] talking maybe more about sort of the size over time, but when we think about your views of the U.S. land market, I mean, you mentioned kind of not a lot of optimism this year, do you see -- obviously, the second quarter we've heard maybe is a bit lower. But do you see a plateau here as you kind of get this gas activity coming off and oil hopefully at least stabilizing, if not trending a little higher. But how do you think about U.S. activity in the back half of this year? And what do you -- sort of catalyst is to get it moving in the right direction?\n\nScott Bender: Yes. Steven, I don't think I've changed my opinion about activity maybe hitting a trough in the [650 onshore to 670 -- I'm sorry, $5.50 to $5.75] range. But I think we'll hit that trough as we exit the summer. And so maybe that will be a time for a plateau.\n\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] I'm not showing any further questions at this time. I would now like to turn the call back over to Scott Bender for any closing remarks.\n\nScott Bender: All right. Well, I thank you all very much. I know we must have had some conflicting earnings calls this morning. But I absolutely -- we all appreciate your support of the company. I think that although not asked, I need to express my extreme gratitude to Steve Tadlock for the job he's done at Spoolables and I think our bright outlook for the expansion of that business. Anyway, have a good day, everybody. Thanks for calling.\n\nOperator: Thank you. This concludes the conference. Thank you for your participation.

The company saw a decrease in its Medical segment by 15% year-over-year, but a 6% increase in its Industrial segment.\n\nNon-GAAP earnings per share were $0.16, and the company ended the quarter with a strong cash position of $190 million. Despite the adoption of its photon-counting technology, Varex lowered its revenue expectations for the remainder of the fiscal year due to cautious purchasing behavior and market challenges in China. They expect flat revenue in the fourth quarter compared to the third.\n\nKey Takeaways\n\nCompany Outlook\n\nBearish Highlights\n\nBullish Highlights\n\nMisses\n\nQ&A Highlights\n\nInvestingPro Insights\n\nVarex Imaging Corporation's (VREX) recent earnings report has shed light on some key financial metrics that are worth considering. According to the real-time data from InvestingPro, VREX has a market capitalization of $636.94 million and is trading at a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 16.46. However, when adjusted for the last twelve months as of Q2 2024, the P/E ratio stands at a more attractive 11.93.\n\nThe company's PEG ratio, which measures the stock's price relative to its earnings growth, is at a low 0.46 for the same period, suggesting that the stock may be undervalued given its earnings growth potential. Moreover, the price to book ratio is 1.11, further indicating that the stock might be trading at a price close to its actual net asset value.\n\nFrom an operational standpoint, Varex's gross profit margin for the last twelve months as of Q2 2024 is solid at 32.39%, with an operating income margin of 7.06%. These figures highlight the company's ability to maintain profitability despite the reported decline in revenue.\n\nInvestingPro Tips for VREX suggest that the stock is currently in oversold territory, as indicated by the RSI, and is trading near its 52-week low. This could potentially offer an attractive entry point for investors. Moreover, the company is said to be trading at a low P/E ratio relative to near-term earnings growth, which, in combination with a strong free cash flow yield, could signal a good value buy.\n\nIt is worth noting that analysts predict VREX will be profitable this year and that it has been profitable over the last twelve months. Still, the company does not pay a dividend to shareholders, which could be a consideration for income-focused investors.\n\nFor readers looking to delve deeper into the financial health and future prospects of Varex Imaging Corporation, there are additional InvestingPro Tips available at https://www.investing.com/pro/VREX.

At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode. A brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Chris Belfiore, Director of Investor Relations. Thank you, sir. You may begin.\n\nChris Belfiore: Good afternoon, and welcome to Varex Imaging Corporation's earnings conference call for the second quarter of fiscal year 2024. With me today are Sunny Sanyal, our President and CEO; and Sam Maheshwari, our CFO. Please note that the live webcast of this conference call includes a supplemental slide presentation that can be accessed at Varex's website at vareximaging.com. The webcast and supplemental slide presentation will be archived on Varex's website. To simplify our discussion, unless otherwise stated, all references to the quarter are for the second quarter of fiscal year 2024. In addition, unless otherwise stated, quarterly comparisons are made year-over-year from the second quarter of fiscal year 2024 to the second quarter of fiscal year 2023. Finally, all references to the year are to the fiscal year and not the calendar year, unless otherwise stated. Please be advised that during this call, we will be making forward-looking statements, which are predictions or projections about future events. These statements are based on current expectations and assumptions that are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated. Risks relating to our business are described in our quarterly earnings release and our filings with the SEC. Additional information concerning the factors that could cause actual results to materially differ from those anticipated is contained in our SEC filings, including Item 1A, Risk Factors of our quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and our Annual Report on Form 10-K. The information in this discussion speaks as of today's date, and we assume no obligation to update or revise the forward-looking statements in this discussion. On today's call, we will be discussing certain non-GAAP financial measures. These non-GAAP measures are not presented in accordance with, nor are they a substitute for, GAAP financial measures. We will provide a reconciliation of each non-GAAP financial measure to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure in our earnings press release, which is posted on our website. I will now turn the call over to Sunny.\n\nSunny Sanyal: Thank you, Chris. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us for our second quarter earnings call. Sales in the second quarter was in line with our expectations, resulting in revenue of $206 million. Non-GAAP gross margin of 33% was within the guided range, and non-GAAP earnings per share was $0.16 in the quarter. Revenue in the second quarter was down 10% year-over-year. Revenue in the Medical segment decreased 15% year-over-year, while the Industrial segment revenue increased 6%. Non-GAAP gross margin in the second quarter was 33%, which was flat compared to the same quarter last year, and non-GAAP EPS was $0.16 compared to $0.26 last year. We ended the second quarter with $190 million worth of cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities on the balance sheet, up $68 million compared to the second quarter of fiscal 2023. Now let me give you some insights into the sales detail by modality in the quarter compared to a five-quarter average, which we will refer to as the sales trend. Sales in our Medical segment was down in the quarter due to cautious purchasing behavior by our customers in addition to the continued softness in China. Global sales of CT tubes improved in the quarter and is now in line with the sales trend. Fluoroscopy and mammography were both in line with their respective sales trends. Oncology, radiographic, and dental modalities were all below their respective sales trends. Global sales of our industrial products were solid in the quarter and in line with our sales trend. Our cargo inspection products and industrial tubes continued to see strong sales while we experienced some softness in other industrial end markets, primarily in semiconductor, electronics, and battery inspection. Now I'd like to take a moment to give you an update on our photon-counting technology. As we highlighted in the past quarters, photon-counting detector technologies are a significant focus across the entire imaging industry. Both medical and industrial OEMs continue to explore the use of photon-counting in imaging applications across various modalities, from food inspection to full body medical CT. Engagement with our OEM customers has accelerated over the past year, and we believe Varex continues to be well positioned to benefit from these trends given our innovative technology and breadth of our product portfolio. Our Industrial segment, where technology adoption tends to be faster, continues to be the main driver of our photon-counting detector sales. The technology is being adopted in high growth niche verticals where there's a need for high speed and high sensitivity imaging. Our photon-counting detectors continue to be integrated into new customer systems, and we expect industrial applications to remain solid source of sales of Varex's photon-counting products in the future. In addition, last year we provided an overview of two collaborative photon-counting projects in our industrial business, PARSEC and GRINNER. These projects are sponsored under the Horizon Europe program, the European Union's key funding program for research and innovation. Both projects are focused on the speed of imaging and material discrimination, which are distinctive strengths of photon-counting. The PARSEC project, aimed at addressing the potential abuse of postal and express courier services by criminals and terrorists, is making solid progress. The material discrimination capability of our photon-counting technology, coupled with AI software, is being used to test the detection of illicit substances within clusters of parcels. The GRINNER project, which is aimed at preventing battery-caused fires in the electronics waste management chain, is also progressing well. A prototype incorporating our photon-counting technology is expected to be deployed to an end user facility in Europe for gathering data and field-testing. Once testing at the recycling facility is complete in late fiscal 2024, we expect to work with our customer on commercialization of the final system. In our Medical segment, our photon-counting technology is being used in full body scans and panoramic dental imaging. As we noted on our first quarter earnings call, we're working with a major OEM to integrate our photon-counting technology in their next generation of CT scanners. This process is moving along as planned. We also now have other prospects in the pipeline who are in various stages in assessing our technology for CT applications. We expect new and existing applications of our photon-counting technology to contribute strong sales growth over the next five years. Specifically, we expect additional applications in medical, including CT, to add over $100 million of revenue over this timeframe. Coupled with traction in our industrial markets, we expect our photon-counting portfolio to contribute more than $150 million of revenue annually by fiscal 2029. We continue to be encouraged by the acceptance of photon-counting technologies for medical and industrial applications. With that, let me hand over the call to Sam.\n\nSam Maheshwari: Thanks, Sunny, and hello, everyone. Our revenues in the second quarter were $206 million at the midpoint of our guidance, while non-GAAP gross margin was 33%, within our guided range. Non-GAAP EPS was $0.16 below the midpoint of our guided range. Second quarter revenues decreased 10% compared to the second quarter of fiscal 2023. Medical revenues were $149 million and Industrial revenues were $57 million. Medical revenues were 72%, and Industrial revenues were 28% of our total revenues for the quarter. Looking at revenues by region. Americas increased 1% compared to the second quarter of fiscal 2023, while EMEA increased 2% and APAC decreased 27%. The decline in APAC was primarily the result of lower sales in China due to the government's anticorruption campaign there and investigation into its healthcare system. China accounted for 12% of overall revenues in the second quarter, compared to 17% in the second quarter of prior fiscal year. Further, sales to China in the second quarter declined sequentially from the first quarter. Given this trend, we no longer expect a pickup in China sales before the start of our next fiscal year. We remain optimistic about the prospects of long-term healthcare-related growth in China. Let me now cover our results on a GAAP basis. Second quarter gross margin was 32%, flat year-over-year. Operating expenses were $58 million, up $1 million compared to the second quarter of fiscal 2023, and operating income was $8 million, down $8 million from Q2 of 2023. GAAP net earnings were $1 million, and EPS was $0.03 per share, based on a fully diluted 41 million shares. Moving on to the non-GAAP results for the quarter. Gross margin was 33% flat compared to the second quarter of fiscal 2023. Gross margin benefited by approximately 1 percentage point due to a reclassification of fixed expense related to our joint venture dpiX from cost of goods sold to SG&A expense. This change is expected to remain in place for foreseeable future, and we are assessing ways to reduce this expense. This benefit to gross margin was offset by approximately one percentage point of higher warranty expense in the quarter. We expect the higher warranty expense to taper off and return to historical levels by the end of our fiscal year. R&D spending was $23 million, flat compared to the second quarter of fiscal 20'23. R&D was 11% of revenues. In the second quarter, we made the fourth milestone payment of $1 million to Micro-X. Generally, our target for R&D spending is 8% to 10% of revenue on an annual basis, R&D spending is expected to remain around current levels. However, R&D as a percentage of sales may fluctuate due to overall sales levels. SG&A expense was approximately $32 million, up $3 million compared to the second quarter of fiscal 2023. SG&A was 16% of revenues. The increase in SG&A in the quarter was primarily the result of the aforementioned reclassification of fixed expense related to our joint venture dpiX. Operating expenses were $54 million, or 26% of revenues, above our expectations for the quarter. Operating income was $13 million, down $10 million compared to the same quarter last year. Operating margin was 6% of revenue, compared to 10% in the second quarter of fiscal 2023. Tax expense was $2 million, or 19% of pre-tax income, compared to $4 million, or 28%, in the second quarter of the prior year. We continue to expect a tax rate of 21% to 23% for full fiscal year 2024. Net earnings were $7 million, or $0.16 per diluted share, down $0.10 year-over-year. Average diluted shares for the quarter were 41 million on a non-GAAP basis. Now, turning to the balance sheet, accounts receivables increased by $12 million from the first quarter of fiscal 2024, primarily the result of higher sales in the quarter. Days sales outstanding remained flat at 67 days. Inventory decreased $4 million sequentially in the second quarter, and days of inventory decreased by 13 days to 185 days. Accounts payable decreased by $5 million, and days payable decreased five days to forty-five days. Now moving to debt and cash flow information, net cash flow from operations was $3 million. We ended the quarter with cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities of $190 million, up $68 million compared to the second quarter of the prior year, and down $5 million compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2024. Please note that $190 million includes $142 million of cash and cash equivalents and $47 million of marketable securities, which is now broken out as a separate line item on our balance sheet. Gross debt outstanding at the end of the quarter was $447 million and debt, net of $190 million of cash and marketable securities, was $257 million. Regarding capital structure, we implemented a $155 million revolver on March 26. Separately, we recently secured an additional $20 million financing as a delayed draw term loan. Both of these actions put us in a comfortable liquidity position as we approach refinancing of our convertible bonds. Now moving on to the outlook for the third quarter and the remainder of fiscal 2024, as discussed by Sunny, due to cautious purchasing behavior by our customers broadly, in addition to continued softness in China, we are reducing our expectations for the remainder of the fiscal year. Based on our current visibility, we expect revenue in the fourth fiscal quarter of 2024 to be flat with that of the third quarter. While demand is soft in the near term, we continue to be optimistic in the long term and continue to invest in promising technologies such as photon counting. With the above context, guidance for the third quarter is: revenues are expected between $200 million and $220 million; and non-GAAP earnings per diluted share are expected between $0.05 and $0.25. Our expectations are based on non-GAAP gross margin in a range of 33% to 34%; non-GAAP operating expenses in a range of $52 million to $53 million; tax rate of about 22% for the third quarter; and non-GAAP diluted share count of about $41 million shares. And with that, we'll now open the call for your questions.\n\nOperator: Thank you. We will now conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Suraj Kalia with Oppenheimer. Please proceed.\n\nShaymus Contorno: Doing fine. Just to get started, China - any more color you can give there, what are you seeing on the ground? Obviously, it's kind of pushed out from your initial expectations of second half of the year - of calendar year kind of getting started. Can you talk a little bit more about the delay pushing out through the remainder of your fiscal year and when we may start seeing some pickup?\n\nSunny Sanyal: Yes. So, as you might recall, a couple of quarters ago, we started talking about softness in China based on early signals that we were getting from our customers. And this was driven by the audit process that the Chinese government had launched on the hospitals there. And it was anticipated that it would take about 12 months to complete that process. So, the signals that we were getting from our customers broadly on the ground was that by late spring, early summer, this thing should start to free up and buying would begin again. And so, that's what led us to give you the indications that we would expect to start to see recovery in the second half of the year. And I think that was somewhat consistent with what others were seeing as well. We are not seeing the early indicators at this time that would lead us to believe that the recovery will happen with any significant volume in our second half. As you know, we are 90 to 120 days ahead in the value chain of our customers and so, with that in mind, we are giving a cautious view of the second half and as far as China is concerned. Now, that said, as we continue to keep our ears to the ground there and work with our customers, what we expect is likely to happen is, there are multiple factors playing - at play here. One was the audit, but secondly, there may be some impact of the stimulus package that's being - that's in the wings, it's not clear what that is, and it's not clear what the impact is, but there is some general confusion. All of this leads us to believe that the recovery in China will be more of a gradual, steady recovery as opposed to any significant burst of pent-up recovery. We're not anticipating that, but again, it's very fluid there, and we are staying close to it.\n\nShaymus Contorno: Got it, appreciate that. And then kind of can you describe the environment you are seeing outside of China? I think Americas growth was, I think, 1%; EMEA was 2% or 3% somewhere there. What kind of environment are you seeing outside there? Is it kind of - sorry.\n\nSunny Sanyal: Let me add one more point regarding China. We have seen no shift or no change in the Chinese government's intent or their policy or their intentions to expand healthcare delivery - continue to expand healthcare delivery services throughout China. And to the contrary, it seems like the intention of the stimulus is also to continue to support that. Now, what we are seeing outside of China, ex-China, is that there continues to be a general softness in demand. And this is what we characterized as some cautious buying behavior by our customers. Our customers, they predict, they forecast their needs, and then they place orders with us within our prescribed lead times. And then as they get closer to when they need the product, that's when they give us delivery dates. And what we've seen is general cautiousness around volumes of shipments that they would like from us. So, they are asking us across the board - many customers have asked us to defer, delay, slow down shipments as they adjust their stocking levels and inventory levels to match their more recent forecasts of when they expect to deploy these products into new systems for shipment. So, that's a broad based view that we're getting of the overall Medical segment. It's hard for us to tease apart where some of that softness is coming from because, as you know, our customers are global customers, we ship products to them, and then they send those products all over the world. So, it's hard to pinpoint any specific sources of softness.\n\nShaymus Contorno: Got it. Thank you. And just one last one from me - from our side and photon counting, we appreciate the color and quantification. I think you noted somewhere in that slide deck it's about $150 million in revenues by about 2029. So, I guess, can you describe how you're expecting the growth? Is this going to be a slow burn? Is there going to be some inflection point where in a year everything's going to start to accelerate? Any color there. Thank you.\n\nSunny Sanyal: Yes. Our photon counting detectors, first of all, it's a new platform. And anytime a new technology is introduced in the healthcare environment, the time to adoption is fairly long. So, that's why our R&D cycles are long and our customers' R&D cycles are long, and then their regulatory cycles. So, that said, that's the backdrop on the Medical side. Our photon counting sales are coming from industrial and medical, both. On the industrial side, which is currently our largest chunk of photon counting sales, the uptake there is steady, and it's growing, and it's accelerating. So, in this trajectory from where we are today, in $20-ish million of sales going up to the $150 million-ish that we talked about in the slides, we expect to see steady, accelerating uptake on the industrial side driven by new applications that are coming out. And adoption in Industrial tends to be much faster than medical because they have a product, they just put it out there, and they try it out. On the medical side, we have customers currently that have designed our photon counting detectors in certain applications. And there are a variety of applications that this technology, these detectors are going into. A few of them are out, and we mentioned that during the earnings call, and then there are more that are in the pipeline. In the early stages of these applications, design-in process, we see low volumes, largely prototypes that we ship, then there's customers take a couple of years to bring the product to market, and then we see initial pilots, and then a year after that, we see run rate, higher volumes. So, that's, I'd say, the general modality - most of the modalities behave that way. Now, CT detectors, we expect, will have a different trajectory, and that's because they are much larger, higher priced, bigger detectors. So, there it'll be, we will be in design phase and implementation phase for at least two to three years, after which we expect the acceleration to be fairly rapid as our customers take their new CT systems to market. And it'll be driven by the pace of adoption, really, of CT systems more so than the new CT system that our customers bring to market versus just photon-counting technology at that point. Our photon counting technologies are being driven towards mainstream markets. So, we're confident that once our customers bring these products to market, it won't be a very narrow niche application. We are targeting at the mainstream CT market. So, towards that outer end of our trajectory that we showed you in the walk, it's going to be driven by CT. Between now and 2028, it's going to be 2026, 2027, 2028, it's going to be driven by industrial and a few other medical modalities. I hope that gives you the color you are looking for. It's hard for us to go get more specific because there's challenges in predicting that far out on products that are in design phase with the customers.\n\nShaymus Contorno: Appreciated. Thank you very much.\n\nOperator: The next question comes from Young Li with Jefferies. Please proceed.\n\nSunny Sanyal: Hell, Young.\n\nYoung Li: Great. Hey there. Thanks for taking our question. I guess to start, maybe to follow up on China a little bit. I mean it sounds like most, if not all, the impact is due to the anticorruption campaign. Wondering if there's any local competitive dynamics that's at play there as well.\n\nSunny Sanyal: No, we don't see that as the reason for any of this slowdown. The slowdown is substantial slowdown, and as you know, most of our business in China is driven by x-ray tubes. And within x-ray tubes, the majority of our volume comes from the CT systems where we are - it's a highly engineered product that's designed in. So, what we are experiencing is a result of our customers not needing the products because their sales have dropped pretty significantly.\n\nYoung Li: Okay, great. Very helpful. I guess just a separate question, just related to photon counting. That generates a lot more images and data. I'm curious, is there a software play or AI play for Varex? And how's your software business doing recently?\n\nSunny Sanyal: Yes, absolutely. So, photon counting, depending on the application, what you just described, would be certainly true for CT. For CT, first of all, high-resolution detectors and imaging at high frame rates produces a lot of data. Yes, there is. So, the good news is in there that with the high-resolution images, the amount of information that's now available in these images opens up a lot of opportunities for AI plays and for material discrimination and more precise pinpointing of artifacts and reasons, and to be able to distinguish between one type of artifact versus another. Our software group is very capable with CT reconstruction and applying image processing and techniques to look into and extract more and more information out of the data that's received. So, we certainly expect that our software group will continue to benefit from photon counting. We have quite a bit of technology that we offer currently with our detectors for image processing, and those are actually a key part of our photon counting detector offerings. And as we take our products to market for CT, they are certainly playing a role in the image processing and image construction.\n\nYoung Li: Got it. Thank you very much.\n\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from James Sidoti with Sidoti & Company. Please proceed.\n\nJames Sidoti: Hi good afternoon and thanks to taking the question. On the situation in China, do you think there'll be some pent-up demand because of the slowdown in buying now, or the procedures are still getting done, tubes are still wearing out. So, when these restrictions get lifted, do you think there'll be an increase in demand?\n\nSunny Sanyal: Yes. So, Jim, procedure volumes are continuing. People need care, they go get care. So, what we are seeing is sales of replacement tubes. And for us, that's a recurring revenue stream. The pent-up demand is results when we get increased procedure volumes. So, that is, I don't know whether we can predict that at this point. However, what we believe will drive the return to growth is the continued push to expand healthcare services in China. They have not come off of that. Everything that we hear from our customers is that the Chinese government is continuing to press forward. What is unclear at this stage is what effect the stimulus package that is in the sidelines will have on how that pent-up demand will play out. We're not getting much transparency around what hospitals will have to do in order to be able to take advantage of the stimulus program that's being rolled out. Once there's more clarity on that, we'll be able to assess, the trajectory of the demand. But the thing that we have noticed over time is when there's any a slowdown or stoppage for economic reasons or other reasons, when the demand comes back, the pent-up demand doesn't go away. It comes back. And the question is whether it'll be a gradual ramp up, which we think it's more likely, versus is there going to be a sharp inflow of orders? We don't know that yet, honestly. So, that's what, in the next 90 days or so, we expect to get more clarity on that, and we will continue to share that with you.\n\nJames Sidoti: Okay. And then can you talk about your options regarding the refinancing the convert? Are you looking at another convert for that, or possibly going with straight debt? When do you need to do it? And how are rates comparing now to the existing loan?\n\nSam Maheshwari: Yes, sure. So, thank you Jim. So we just recently closed about $175 million of new financing, one is a revolver, $155 million and another $20 million of delayed draw term loan. So, from our position, we feel we are in a very strong position from the liquidity perspective to address the refinancing. So, at this time, the existing convertibles are maturing next June, so June 2025. So, we are going to monitor the situation and make the right decision for us. And we'll share with you as the Board makes that decision. There are a lot of factors that go into it, including interest rates, stock price, and various other things. So, that's the way we are thinking about. And then, in terms of interest rates, our current loan is at 4%. The current convertible bonds are at 4%. Based on what we have seen from the convertible market, it's around there. It's probably a little bit less than that if there were to be a new convertible loan. But as convertible loans can be structured with various dimensions and various outcomes. So, the interest rates can vary depending upon how it is structured. But at the same time, we feel we have good cash on the balance sheet. We are in an excess cash position, and with this extra liquidity that we now have raised, I think there is also the possibility that we can pay it down partially or completely. So, we'll share with you as and when we make the decision.\n\nJames Sidoti: All right. And that was going to be my next question. How much cash do you need on the balance sheet to comfortably run the business?\n\nSam Maheshwari: Yes, if you go back four or five years ago, we were running the business with about $50 million, $60 million. Since COVID, we've decided to have $100 million or thereabouts, in terms of the cash, that we would like to carry on the balance sheet. So, with $190 million, we have about $90 million of excess cash compared to that threshold.\n\nJames Sidoti: Okay. So, theoretically, you could pay down almost 25% of the outstanding debt.\n\nSam Maheshwari: No, we could theoretically pay down 50% of the convert, because the convert is about $200 million. And between now and June, we are targeting to generate cash, so we might be able to pay down 50% from balance sheet.\n\nJames Sidoti: Right. Which should theoretically lead to lower interest rates in 2025 and beyond. It does makes sense. Right. All right. Thank you.\n\nSam Maheshwari: Thank you, Jim.\n\nOperator: The next question comes from Larry Solow with CJS. Please proceed.\n\nLarry Solow: Great. Thanks guys. And good afternoon, good evening. I guess, the first question, in terms of the guidance or the lower outlook, is it principally - it sounds like its China, but it's also U.S. or ex-China, because China is only 10% of your overall revenue, right? So are there other drivers? I guess the U.S. or ex-China is also weaker in Medical. And how about Industrial? Has that changed at all? Just trying to kind of piecemeal the reduction. And I think when you started the year you had said, you thought took medical, I think, was going to be flattish overall sales, if I remember correctly. Is there a kind of revised number to that? I know you kind of only guide to the quarter, but it sounds like as a whole, your whole year is clearly coming down. But any more pieces to that kind of puzzle would be great.\n\nSam Maheshwari: Yes. Thanks Larry. So, yes, China is soft, but on top of that we did say that the broader market in Medical is also soft, particularly driven by what we said, cautious customer behavior. And that phenomenon is not just China. So, yes, there is the effect of China as well as ex-China there is also softness in Medical. So, Medical, we expect it to be down this year, year-over-year. So, that's what we are currently seeing in Medical. In terms of overall revenue, what we are saying, we have provided the guidance for Q3, and at this time we are seeing Q4 to be flattish to Q3. So, that gives you almost the entire year. We are expecting Industrial business to be a slight growth, flattish to slight up year-over-year. It's a pretty strong comp for the last year for what Industrial did. At this time, the cargo business in Industrial is doing very well, and we expect it to continue to do well. But there is softness in Industrial outside of cargo. So, with all of those puts and takes combined, we expect Industrial to be a growth area for us, but very slightly for full year 2024 compared to fiscal 2023. And we expect Medical to be down.\n\nLarry Solow: And the caution from, I guess, is your OEM customers, right, that you're referring to?\n\nSam Maheshwari: That is true, yes.\n\nLarry Solow: And I guess you're kind of it down the chain line, but does that start from the hospital? Because my understanding is, hospitals are actually doing okay. They're doing pretty fine. I mean their volumes have been good post COVID. And I think concerns about hospitals' finances are probably overblown, even though I know interest rates are a lot higher and that doesn't help them. But as far as I understand, capital spending in hospitals has been doing okay. So, are your customers cautious because there's too much inventory still? Is there any kind of common theme that's driving this caution?\n\nSunny Sanyal: Larry, it's all of the above and the conversation starts with, hey, we have what we need, and we just need to adjust our stocks and stocking levels. Can we slow this down? Can you push out? And then if you dig into, well, why do you have so much inventory? Well, we had expected a different trajectory for and of orders and then the COVID buying behavior post COVID, where people were worried about their factories were clogged and supply chain issues. So, it's kind of a myriad of things that have come together, causing some amount of destocking and inventory adjustments. And clearly what they had in mind when they bought the components didn't match up all the way with their current quarter production needs. So, it's several of those. It's hard to reconcile. See, most of our customer's ship from backlog. So the hospital's health, that's a good thing. I mean we're glad that procedure volumes are there and growing because that's going to drive in replacement of these modalities in our tubes. That doesn't correlate directly with hospitals accepting shipments of large systems which require then other work on the side of the hospital, civil works, construction and things like that. So, variety of reasons why their shipments have slowed for certain customers.\n\nLarry Solow: All right, I guess that's fair. Okay. I guess I'm all set then. Thanks.\n\nSunny Sanyal: Thank you, Larry.\n\nOperator: Thank you. At this time, I would like to turn the call back over to Chris Belfiore for closing comments.\n\nChris Belfiore: Thank you for your questions today and for your continued support of Varex.

The company saw a decrease in its Medical segment by 15% year-over-year, but a 6% increase in its Industrial segment.\n\nNon-GAAP earnings per share were $0.16, and the company ended the quarter with a strong cash position of $190 million. Despite the adoption of its photon-counting technology, Varex lowered its revenue expectations for the remainder of the fiscal year due to cautious purchasing behavior and market challenges in China. They expect flat revenue in the fourth quarter compared to the third.\n\nVarex Imaging Corporation's (VREX) recent earnings report has shed light on some key financial metrics that are worth considering. According to the real-time data from InvestingPro, VREX has a market capitalization of $636.94 million and is trading at a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 16.46. However, when adjusted for the last twelve months as of Q2 2024, the P/E ratio stands at a more attractive 11.93.\n\nThe company's PEG ratio, which measures the stock's price relative to its earnings growth, is at a low 0.46 for the same period, suggesting that the stock may be undervalued given its earnings growth potential. Moreover, the price to book ratio is 1.11, further indicating that the stock might be trading at a price close to its actual net asset value.\n\nFrom an operational standpoint, Varex's gross profit margin for the last twelve months as of Q2 2024 is solid at 32.39%, with an operating income margin of 7.06%. These figures highlight the company's ability to maintain profitability despite the reported decline in revenue.\n\nInvestingPro Tips for VREX suggest that the stock is currently in oversold territory, as indicated by the RSI, and is trading near its 52-week low. This could potentially offer an attractive entry point for investors. Moreover, the company is said to be trading at a low P/E ratio relative to near-term earnings growth, which, in combination with a strong free cash flow yield, could signal a good value buy.\n\nIt is worth noting that analysts predict VREX will be profitable this year and that it has been profitable over the last twelve months. Still, the company does not pay a dividend to shareholders, which could be a consideration for income-focused investors.\n\nFor readers looking to delve deeper into the financial health and future prospects of Varex Imaging Corporation, there are additional InvestingPro Tips available at https://www.investing.com/pro/VREX.

At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode. A brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Chris Belfiore, Director of Investor Relations. Thank you, sir. You may begin.\n\nChris Belfiore: Good afternoon, and welcome to Varex Imaging Corporation's earnings conference call for the second quarter of fiscal year 2024. With me today are Sunny Sanyal, our President and CEO; and Sam Maheshwari, our CFO. Please note that the live webcast of this conference call includes a supplemental slide presentation that can be accessed at Varex's website at vareximaging.com. The webcast and supplemental slide presentation will be archived on Varex's website. To simplify our discussion, unless otherwise stated, all references to the quarter are for the second quarter of fiscal year 2024. In addition, unless otherwise stated, quarterly comparisons are made year-over-year from the second quarter of fiscal year 2024 to the second quarter of fiscal year 2023. Finally, all references to the year are to the fiscal year and not the calendar year, unless otherwise stated. Please be advised that during this call, we will be making forward-looking statements, which are predictions or projections about future events. These statements are based on current expectations and assumptions that are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated. Risks relating to our business are described in our quarterly earnings release and our filings with the SEC. Additional information concerning the factors that could cause actual results to materially differ from those anticipated is contained in our SEC filings, including Item 1A, Risk Factors of our quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and our Annual Report on Form 10-K. The information in this discussion speaks as of today's date, and we assume no obligation to update or revise the forward-looking statements in this discussion. On today's call, we will be discussing certain non-GAAP financial measures. These non-GAAP measures are not presented in accordance with, nor are they a substitute for, GAAP financial measures. We will provide a reconciliation of each non-GAAP financial measure to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure in our earnings press release, which is posted on our website. I will now turn the call over to Sunny.\n\nSunny Sanyal: Thank you, Chris. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us for our second quarter earnings call. Sales in the second quarter was in line with our expectations, resulting in revenue of $206 million. Non-GAAP gross margin of 33% was within the guided range, and non-GAAP earnings per share was $0.16 in the quarter. Revenue in the second quarter was down 10% year-over-year. Revenue in the Medical segment decreased 15% year-over-year, while the Industrial segment revenue increased 6%. Non-GAAP gross margin in the second quarter was 33%, which was flat compared to the same quarter last year, and non-GAAP EPS was $0.16 compared to $0.26 last year. We ended the second quarter with $190 million worth of cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities on the balance sheet, up $68 million compared to the second quarter of fiscal 2023. Now let me give you some insights into the sales detail by modality in the quarter compared to a five-quarter average, which we will refer to as the sales trend. Sales in our Medical segment was down in the quarter due to cautious purchasing behavior by our customers in addition to the continued softness in China. Global sales of CT tubes improved in the quarter and is now in line with the sales trend. Fluoroscopy and mammography were both in line with their respective sales trends. Oncology, radiographic, and dental modalities were all below their respective sales trends. Global sales of our industrial products were solid in the quarter and in line with our sales trend. Our cargo inspection products and industrial tubes continued to see strong sales while we experienced some softness in other industrial end markets, primarily in semiconductor, electronics, and battery inspection. Now I'd like to take a moment to give you an update on our photon-counting technology. As we highlighted in the past quarters, photon-counting detector technologies are a significant focus across the entire imaging industry. Both medical and industrial OEMs continue to explore the use of photon-counting in imaging applications across various modalities, from food inspection to full body medical CT. Engagement with our OEM customers has accelerated over the past year, and we believe Varex continues to be well positioned to benefit from these trends given our innovative technology and breadth of our product portfolio. Our Industrial segment, where technology adoption tends to be faster, continues to be the main driver of our photon-counting detector sales. The technology is being adopted in high growth niche verticals where there's a need for high speed and high sensitivity imaging. Our photon-counting detectors continue to be integrated into new customer systems, and we expect industrial applications to remain solid source of sales of Varex's photon-counting products in the future. In addition, last year we provided an overview of two collaborative photon-counting projects in our industrial business, PARSEC and GRINNER. These projects are sponsored under the Horizon Europe program, the European Union's key funding program for research and innovation. Both projects are focused on the speed of imaging and material discrimination, which are distinctive strengths of photon-counting. The PARSEC project, aimed at addressing the potential abuse of postal and express courier services by criminals and terrorists, is making solid progress. The material discrimination capability of our photon-counting technology, coupled with AI software, is being used to test the detection of illicit substances within clusters of parcels. The GRINNER project, which is aimed at preventing battery-caused fires in the electronics waste management chain, is also progressing well. A prototype incorporating our photon-counting technology is expected to be deployed to an end user facility in Europe for gathering data and field-testing. Once testing at the recycling facility is complete in late fiscal 2024, we expect to work with our customer on commercialization of the final system. In our Medical segment, our photon-counting technology is being used in full body scans and panoramic dental imaging. As we noted on our first quarter earnings call, we're working with a major OEM to integrate our photon-counting technology in their next generation of CT scanners. This process is moving along as planned. We also now have other prospects in the pipeline who are in various stages in assessing our technology for CT applications. We expect new and existing applications of our photon-counting technology to contribute strong sales growth over the next five years. Specifically, we expect additional applications in medical, including CT, to add over $100 million of revenue over this timeframe. Coupled with traction in our industrial markets, we expect our photon-counting portfolio to contribute more than $150 million of revenue annually by fiscal 2029. We continue to be encouraged by the acceptance of photon-counting technologies for medical and industrial applications. With that, let me hand over the call to Sam.\n\nSam Maheshwari: Thanks, Sunny, and hello, everyone. Our revenues in the second quarter were $206 million at the midpoint of our guidance, while non-GAAP gross margin was 33%, within our guided range. Non-GAAP EPS was $0.16 below the midpoint of our guided range. Second quarter revenues decreased 10% compared to the second quarter of fiscal 2023. Medical revenues were $149 million and Industrial revenues were $57 million. Medical revenues were 72%, and Industrial revenues were 28% of our total revenues for the quarter. Looking at revenues by region. Americas increased 1% compared to the second quarter of fiscal 2023, while EMEA increased 2% and APAC decreased 27%. The decline in APAC was primarily the result of lower sales in China due to the government's anticorruption campaign there and investigation into its healthcare system. China accounted for 12% of overall revenues in the second quarter, compared to 17% in the second quarter of prior fiscal year. Further, sales to China in the second quarter declined sequentially from the first quarter. Given this trend, we no longer expect a pickup in China sales before the start of our next fiscal year. We remain optimistic about the prospects of long-term healthcare-related growth in China. Let me now cover our results on a GAAP basis. Second quarter gross margin was 32%, flat year-over-year. Operating expenses were $58 million, up $1 million compared to the second quarter of fiscal 2023, and operating income was $8 million, down $8 million from Q2 of 2023. GAAP net earnings were $1 million, and EPS was $0.03 per share, based on a fully diluted 41 million shares. Moving on to the non-GAAP results for the quarter. Gross margin was 33% flat compared to the second quarter of fiscal 2023. Gross margin benefited by approximately 1 percentage point due to a reclassification of fixed expense related to our joint venture dpiX from cost of goods sold to SG&A expense. This change is expected to remain in place for foreseeable future, and we are assessing ways to reduce this expense. This benefit to gross margin was offset by approximately one percentage point of higher warranty expense in the quarter. We expect the higher warranty expense to taper off and return to historical levels by the end of our fiscal year. R&D spending was $23 million, flat compared to the second quarter of fiscal 20'23. R&D was 11% of revenues. In the second quarter, we made the fourth milestone payment of $1 million to Micro-X. Generally, our target for R&D spending is 8% to 10% of revenue on an annual basis, R&D spending is expected to remain around current levels. However, R&D as a percentage of sales may fluctuate due to overall sales levels. SG&A expense was approximately $32 million, up $3 million compared to the second quarter of fiscal 2023. SG&A was 16% of revenues. The increase in SG&A in the quarter was primarily the result of the aforementioned reclassification of fixed expense related to our joint venture dpiX. Operating expenses were $54 million, or 26% of revenues, above our expectations for the quarter. Operating income was $13 million, down $10 million compared to the same quarter last year. Operating margin was 6% of revenue, compared to 10% in the second quarter of fiscal 2023. Tax expense was $2 million, or 19% of pre-tax income, compared to $4 million, or 28%, in the second quarter of the prior year. We continue to expect a tax rate of 21% to 23% for full fiscal year 2024. Net earnings were $7 million, or $0.16 per diluted share, down $0.10 year-over-year. Average diluted shares for the quarter were 41 million on a non-GAAP basis. Now, turning to the balance sheet, accounts receivables increased by $12 million from the first quarter of fiscal 2024, primarily the result of higher sales in the quarter. Days sales outstanding remained flat at 67 days. Inventory decreased $4 million sequentially in the second quarter, and days of inventory decreased by 13 days to 185 days. Accounts payable decreased by $5 million, and days payable decreased five days to forty-five days. Now moving to debt and cash flow information, net cash flow from operations was $3 million. We ended the quarter with cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities of $190 million, up $68 million compared to the second quarter of the prior year, and down $5 million compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2024. Please note that $190 million includes $142 million of cash and cash equivalents and $47 million of marketable securities, which is now broken out as a separate line item on our balance sheet. Gross debt outstanding at the end of the quarter was $447 million and debt, net of $190 million of cash and marketable securities, was $257 million. Regarding capital structure, we implemented a $155 million revolver on March 26. Separately, we recently secured an additional $20 million financing as a delayed draw term loan. Both of these actions put us in a comfortable liquidity position as we approach refinancing of our convertible bonds. Now moving on to the outlook for the third quarter and the remainder of fiscal 2024, as discussed by Sunny, due to cautious purchasing behavior by our customers broadly, in addition to continued softness in China, we are reducing our expectations for the remainder of the fiscal year. Based on our current visibility, we expect revenue in the fourth fiscal quarter of 2024 to be flat with that of the third quarter. While demand is soft in the near term, we continue to be optimistic in the long term and continue to invest in promising technologies such as photon counting. With the above context, guidance for the third quarter is: revenues are expected between $200 million and $220 million; and non-GAAP earnings per diluted share are expected between $0.05 and $0.25. Our expectations are based on non-GAAP gross margin in a range of 33% to 34%; non-GAAP operating expenses in a range of $52 million to $53 million; tax rate of about 22% for the third quarter; and non-GAAP diluted share count of about $41 million shares. And with that, we'll now open the call for your questions.\n\nOperator: Thank you. We will now conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Suraj Kalia with Oppenheimer. Please proceed.\n\nShaymus Contorno: Doing fine. Just to get started, China - any more color you can give there, what are you seeing on the ground? Obviously, it's kind of pushed out from your initial expectations of second half of the year - of calendar year kind of getting started. Can you talk a little bit more about the delay pushing out through the remainder of your fiscal year and when we may start seeing some pickup?\n\nSunny Sanyal: Yes. So, as you might recall, a couple of quarters ago, we started talking about softness in China based on early signals that we were getting from our customers. And this was driven by the audit process that the Chinese government had launched on the hospitals there. And it was anticipated that it would take about 12 months to complete that process. So, the signals that we were getting from our customers broadly on the ground was that by late spring, early summer, this thing should start to free up and buying would begin again. And so, that's what led us to give you the indications that we would expect to start to see recovery in the second half of the year. And I think that was somewhat consistent with what others were seeing as well. We are not seeing the early indicators at this time that would lead us to believe that the recovery will happen with any significant volume in our second half. As you know, we are 90 to 120 days ahead in the value chain of our customers and so, with that in mind, we are giving a cautious view of the second half and as far as China is concerned. Now, that said, as we continue to keep our ears to the ground there and work with our customers, what we expect is likely to happen is, there are multiple factors playing - at play here. One was the audit, but secondly, there may be some impact of the stimulus package that's being - that's in the wings, it's not clear what that is, and it's not clear what the impact is, but there is some general confusion. All of this leads us to believe that the recovery in China will be more of a gradual, steady recovery as opposed to any significant burst of pent-up recovery. We're not anticipating that, but again, it's very fluid there, and we are staying close to it.\n\nShaymus Contorno: Got it, appreciate that. And then kind of can you describe the environment you are seeing outside of China? I think Americas growth was, I think, 1%; EMEA was 2% or 3% somewhere there. What kind of environment are you seeing outside there? Is it kind of - sorry.\n\nSunny Sanyal: Let me add one more point regarding China. We have seen no shift or no change in the Chinese government's intent or their policy or their intentions to expand healthcare delivery - continue to expand healthcare delivery services throughout China. And to the contrary, it seems like the intention of the stimulus is also to continue to support that. Now, what we are seeing outside of China, ex-China, is that there continues to be a general softness in demand. And this is what we characterized as some cautious buying behavior by our customers. Our customers, they predict, they forecast their needs, and then they place orders with us within our prescribed lead times. And then as they get closer to when they need the product, that's when they give us delivery dates. And what we've seen is general cautiousness around volumes of shipments that they would like from us. So, they are asking us across the board - many customers have asked us to defer, delay, slow down shipments as they adjust their stocking levels and inventory levels to match their more recent forecasts of when they expect to deploy these products into new systems for shipment. So, that's a broad based view that we're getting of the overall Medical segment. It's hard for us to tease apart where some of that softness is coming from because, as you know, our customers are global customers, we ship products to them, and then they send those products all over the world. So, it's hard to pinpoint any specific sources of softness.\n\nShaymus Contorno: Got it. Thank you. And just one last one from me - from our side and photon counting, we appreciate the color and quantification. I think you noted somewhere in that slide deck it's about $150 million in revenues by about 2029. So, I guess, can you describe how you're expecting the growth? Is this going to be a slow burn? Is there going to be some inflection point where in a year everything's going to start to accelerate? Any color there. Thank you.\n\nSunny Sanyal: Yes. Our photon counting detectors, first of all, it's a new platform. And anytime a new technology is introduced in the healthcare environment, the time to adoption is fairly long. So, that's why our R&D cycles are long and our customers' R&D cycles are long, and then their regulatory cycles. So, that said, that's the backdrop on the Medical side. Our photon counting sales are coming from industrial and medical, both. On the industrial side, which is currently our largest chunk of photon counting sales, the uptake there is steady, and it's growing, and it's accelerating. So, in this trajectory from where we are today, in $20-ish million of sales going up to the $150 million-ish that we talked about in the slides, we expect to see steady, accelerating uptake on the industrial side driven by new applications that are coming out. And adoption in Industrial tends to be much faster than medical because they have a product, they just put it out there, and they try it out. On the medical side, we have customers currently that have designed our photon counting detectors in certain applications. And there are a variety of applications that this technology, these detectors are going into. A few of them are out, and we mentioned that during the earnings call, and then there are more that are in the pipeline. In the early stages of these applications, design-in process, we see low volumes, largely prototypes that we ship, then there's customers take a couple of years to bring the product to market, and then we see initial pilots, and then a year after that, we see run rate, higher volumes. So, that's, I'd say, the general modality - most of the modalities behave that way. Now, CT detectors, we expect, will have a different trajectory, and that's because they are much larger, higher priced, bigger detectors. So, there it'll be, we will be in design phase and implementation phase for at least two to three years, after which we expect the acceleration to be fairly rapid as our customers take their new CT systems to market. And it'll be driven by the pace of adoption, really, of CT systems more so than the new CT system that our customers bring to market versus just photon-counting technology at that point. Our photon counting technologies are being driven towards mainstream markets. So, we're confident that once our customers bring these products to market, it won't be a very narrow niche application. We are targeting at the mainstream CT market. So, towards that outer end of our trajectory that we showed you in the walk, it's going to be driven by CT. Between now and 2028, it's going to be 2026, 2027, 2028, it's going to be driven by industrial and a few other medical modalities. I hope that gives you the color you are looking for. It's hard for us to go get more specific because there's challenges in predicting that far out on products that are in design phase with the customers.\n\nShaymus Contorno: Appreciated. Thank you very much.\n\nOperator: The next question comes from Young Li with Jefferies. Please proceed.\n\nSunny Sanyal: Hell, Young.\n\nYoung Li: Great. Hey there. Thanks for taking our question. I guess to start, maybe to follow up on China a little bit. I mean it sounds like most, if not all, the impact is due to the anticorruption campaign. Wondering if there's any local competitive dynamics that's at play there as well.\n\nSunny Sanyal: No, we don't see that as the reason for any of this slowdown. The slowdown is substantial slowdown, and as you know, most of our business in China is driven by x-ray tubes. And within x-ray tubes, the majority of our volume comes from the CT systems where we are - it's a highly engineered product that's designed in. So, what we are experiencing is a result of our customers not needing the products because their sales have dropped pretty significantly.\n\nYoung Li: Okay, great. Very helpful. I guess just a separate question, just related to photon counting. That generates a lot more images and data. I'm curious, is there a software play or AI play for Varex? And how's your software business doing recently?\n\nSunny Sanyal: Yes, absolutely. So, photon counting, depending on the application, what you just described, would be certainly true for CT. For CT, first of all, high-resolution detectors and imaging at high frame rates produces a lot of data. Yes, there is. So, the good news is in there that with the high-resolution images, the amount of information that's now available in these images opens up a lot of opportunities for AI plays and for material discrimination and more precise pinpointing of artifacts and reasons, and to be able to distinguish between one type of artifact versus another. Our software group is very capable with CT reconstruction and applying image processing and techniques to look into and extract more and more information out of the data that's received. So, we certainly expect that our software group will continue to benefit from photon counting. We have quite a bit of technology that we offer currently with our detectors for image processing, and those are actually a key part of our photon counting detector offerings. And as we take our products to market for CT, they are certainly playing a role in the image processing and image construction.\n\nYoung Li: Got it. Thank you very much.\n\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from James Sidoti with Sidoti & Company. Please proceed.\n\nJames Sidoti: Hi good afternoon and thanks to taking the question. On the situation in China, do you think there'll be some pent-up demand because of the slowdown in buying now, or the procedures are still getting done, tubes are still wearing out. So, when these restrictions get lifted, do you think there'll be an increase in demand?\n\nSunny Sanyal: Yes. So, Jim, procedure volumes are continuing. People need care, they go get care. So, what we are seeing is sales of replacement tubes. And for us, that's a recurring revenue stream. The pent-up demand is results when we get increased procedure volumes. So, that is, I don't know whether we can predict that at this point. However, what we believe will drive the return to growth is the continued push to expand healthcare services in China. They have not come off of that. Everything that we hear from our customers is that the Chinese government is continuing to press forward. What is unclear at this stage is what effect the stimulus package that is in the sidelines will have on how that pent-up demand will play out. We're not getting much transparency around what hospitals will have to do in order to be able to take advantage of the stimulus program that's being rolled out. Once there's more clarity on that, we'll be able to assess, the trajectory of the demand. But the thing that we have noticed over time is when there's any a slowdown or stoppage for economic reasons or other reasons, when the demand comes back, the pent-up demand doesn't go away. It comes back. And the question is whether it'll be a gradual ramp up, which we think it's more likely, versus is there going to be a sharp inflow of orders? We don't know that yet, honestly. So, that's what, in the next 90 days or so, we expect to get more clarity on that, and we will continue to share that with you.\n\nJames Sidoti: Okay. And then can you talk about your options regarding the refinancing the convert? Are you looking at another convert for that, or possibly going with straight debt? When do you need to do it? And how are rates comparing now to the existing loan?\n\nSam Maheshwari: Yes, sure. So, thank you Jim. So we just recently closed about $175 million of new financing, one is a revolver, $155 million and another $20 million of delayed draw term loan. So, from our position, we feel we are in a very strong position from the liquidity perspective to address the refinancing. So, at this time, the existing convertibles are maturing next June, so June 2025. So, we are going to monitor the situation and make the right decision for us. And we'll share with you as the Board makes that decision. There are a lot of factors that go into it, including interest rates, stock price, and various other things. So, that's the way we are thinking about. And then, in terms of interest rates, our current loan is at 4%. The current convertible bonds are at 4%. Based on what we have seen from the convertible market, it's around there. It's probably a little bit less than that if there were to be a new convertible loan. But as convertible loans can be structured with various dimensions and various outcomes. So, the interest rates can vary depending upon how it is structured. But at the same time, we feel we have good cash on the balance sheet. We are in an excess cash position, and with this extra liquidity that we now have raised, I think there is also the possibility that we can pay it down partially or completely. So, we'll share with you as and when we make the decision.\n\nJames Sidoti: All right. And that was going to be my next question. How much cash do you need on the balance sheet to comfortably run the business?\n\nSam Maheshwari: Yes, if you go back four or five years ago, we were running the business with about $50 million, $60 million. Since COVID, we've decided to have $100 million or thereabouts, in terms of the cash, that we would like to carry on the balance sheet. So, with $190 million, we have about $90 million of excess cash compared to that threshold.\n\nJames Sidoti: Okay. So, theoretically, you could pay down almost 25% of the outstanding debt.\n\nSam Maheshwari: No, we could theoretically pay down 50% of the convert, because the convert is about $200 million. And between now and June, we are targeting to generate cash, so we might be able to pay down 50% from balance sheet.\n\nJames Sidoti: Right. Which should theoretically lead to lower interest rates in 2025 and beyond. It does makes sense. Right. All right. Thank you.\n\nSam Maheshwari: Thank you, Jim.\n\nOperator: The next question comes from Larry Solow with CJS. Please proceed.\n\nLarry Solow: Great. Thanks guys. And good afternoon, good evening. I guess, the first question, in terms of the guidance or the lower outlook, is it principally - it sounds like its China, but it's also U.S. or ex-China, because China is only 10% of your overall revenue, right? So are there other drivers? I guess the U.S. or ex-China is also weaker in Medical. And how about Industrial? Has that changed at all? Just trying to kind of piecemeal the reduction. And I think when you started the year you had said, you thought took medical, I think, was going to be flattish overall sales, if I remember correctly. Is there a kind of revised number to that? I know you kind of only guide to the quarter, but it sounds like as a whole, your whole year is clearly coming down. But any more pieces to that kind of puzzle would be great.\n\nSam Maheshwari: Yes. Thanks Larry. So, yes, China is soft, but on top of that we did say that the broader market in Medical is also soft, particularly driven by what we said, cautious customer behavior. And that phenomenon is not just China. So, yes, there is the effect of China as well as ex-China there is also softness in Medical. So, Medical, we expect it to be down this year, year-over-year. So, that's what we are currently seeing in Medical. In terms of overall revenue, what we are saying, we have provided the guidance for Q3, and at this time we are seeing Q4 to be flattish to Q3. So, that gives you almost the entire year. We are expecting Industrial business to be a slight growth, flattish to slight up year-over-year. It's a pretty strong comp for the last year for what Industrial did. At this time, the cargo business in Industrial is doing very well, and we expect it to continue to do well. But there is softness in Industrial outside of cargo. So, with all of those puts and takes combined, we expect Industrial to be a growth area for us, but very slightly for full year 2024 compared to fiscal 2023. And we expect Medical to be down.\n\nLarry Solow: And the caution from, I guess, is your OEM customers, right, that you're referring to?\n\nSam Maheshwari: That is true, yes.\n\nLarry Solow: And I guess you're kind of it down the chain line, but does that start from the hospital? Because my understanding is, hospitals are actually doing okay. They're doing pretty fine. I mean their volumes have been good post COVID. And I think concerns about hospitals' finances are probably overblown, even though I know interest rates are a lot higher and that doesn't help them. But as far as I understand, capital spending in hospitals has been doing okay. So, are your customers cautious because there's too much inventory still? Is there any kind of common theme that's driving this caution?\n\nSunny Sanyal: Larry, it's all of the above and the conversation starts with, hey, we have what we need, and we just need to adjust our stocks and stocking levels. Can we slow this down? Can you push out? And then if you dig into, well, why do you have so much inventory? Well, we had expected a different trajectory for and of orders and then the COVID buying behavior post COVID, where people were worried about their factories were clogged and supply chain issues. So, it's kind of a myriad of things that have come together, causing some amount of destocking and inventory adjustments. And clearly what they had in mind when they bought the components didn't match up all the way with their current quarter production needs. So, it's several of those. It's hard to reconcile. See, most of our customer's ship from backlog. So the hospital's health, that's a good thing. I mean we're glad that procedure volumes are there and growing because that's going to drive in replacement of these modalities in our tubes. That doesn't correlate directly with hospitals accepting shipments of large systems which require then other work on the side of the hospital, civil works, construction and things like that. So, variety of reasons why their shipments have slowed for certain customers.\n\nLarry Solow: All right, I guess that's fair. Okay. I guess I'm all set then. Thanks.\n\nSunny Sanyal: Thank you, Larry.\n\nOperator: Thank you.

Welcome to the Cactus Q1 2024 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speaker's presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Alan Boyd, Director of Corporate Development and Investor Relations.\n\nAlan Boyd: Thank you, and good morning. We appreciate you joining us on today's call. Our speakers will be Scott Bender, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Al Keifer, our Interim Chief Financial Officer. Also joining us today are Joel Bender, President; Steven Bender, Chief Operating Officer; Steve Tadlock, CEO of FlexSteel; and Will Marsh, our General Counsel. Please note that any comments we make on today's call regarding projections or expectations for future events are forward-looking statements covered by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act. Forward-looking statements are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, many of which are beyond our control. These risks and uncertainties can cause actual results to differ materially from our current expectations. We advise listeners to review our earnings release and the risk factors discussed in our filings with the SEC. Any forward-looking statements we make today are only as of today's date, and we undertake no obligation to publicly update or review any forward-looking statements. In addition, during today's call, we will reference certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are included in our earnings release. With that, I'll turn the call over to Scott.\n\nScott Bender: Thanks, Alan, and good morning to everyone. We began 2024 with solid execution as revenues in both segments exceeded our expectations. I'm particularly pleased with Spoolable Technologies' sales in the first quarter, which increased from the fourth quarter, largely due to strong sales to our large integrated customers. During this period, we also saw renewed international activity in the segment. This strength, which provides usual seasonal softness in the first quarter, further demonstrates the differentiation inherent in our spoolable products as well as the benefits of expanding the product line of our overall Cactus portfolio. Some first quarter total company highlights include revenue of $274 million, adjusted EBITDA of $95 million, adjusted EBITDA margins of 34.8%. We paid a quarterly dividend of $0.12 per share, and we increased our cash balance to a $194 million. I'll now turn the call over to Al Keifer, our CFO, who will review our financial results. Following his remarks, I'll provide some thoughts on our outlook for the near term before opening the lines for Q&A. So Al?\n\nAlan Keifer: Thank you. As Scott mentioned, total Q1 revenues were $274 million. For our Pressure Control segment, revenues of $175 million were down 3% sequentially, driven primarily by decreased customer activity. Operating income decreased $4.4 million or 7.8% sequentially, with operating margins decreasing 160 basis points. Adjusted segment EBITDA decreased $4 million or 6.2% sequentially with margins decreasing by 120 basis points. The margin declines were primarily due to lower operating leverage. For our Spoolable Technologies segment, revenues of $99 million were up 5% sequentially on higher customer demand largely from the majors. Operating income decreased $11.8 million sequentially due primarily to an increase in the expense resulting from the remeasurement of the FlexSteel earn-out liability. Adjusted segment EBITDA decreased $0.4 million or 1.1% sequentially, while margins decreased by 240 basis points due to an increase in input costs. Corporate and other expenses were $5.5 million in Q1, down $0.2 million sequentially. On a total company basis, first quarter adjusted EBITDA was $95 million, down 4.8% from $100 million during the fourth quarter. Adjusted EBITDA margin for the first quarter was 34.8% compared to 36.4% for the fourth quarter. Adjustments to total company EBITDA during the first quarter included noncash charges of $4.4 million in stock-based compensation and a $13.3 million loss related to the FlexSteel earn-out liability remeasurement. Depreciation and amortization expense for the first quarter was $15 million, which includes $4 million of amortization expense related to intangible assets recorded as part of purchase accounting. Total depreciation and amortization expense during the second quarter is expected to be approximately $15 million, $7 million of which is associated with our Pressure Control segment and $8 million of which is associated with Spoolable Technologies. Income tax expense during the first quarter was approximately $13 million. During the first quarter, the public or Class A ownership of the company was 82%. Barring further changes in our public ownership percentage, we expect an effective tax rate of approximately 22% for Q2 2024. GAAP net income was $50 million in the first quarter versus $62 million during the fourth quarter. The decrease was largely driven by the increase in the remeasurement of the earn-out liability. Adjusted net income and earnings per share were $60 million and $0.75 per share, respectively, during the first quarter, compared to $65 million and $0.81 per share in the fourth quarter. Adjusted net income for the first quarter was net of a 26% tax rate applied to our adjusted pretax income. We estimate that the tax rate for adjusted EPS will be 26% during the second quarter of 2024. During the first quarter, we paid a quarterly dividend of $0.12 per share, resulting in a cash outflow of approximately $10 million, including related distributions to members. The Board has approved a quarterly dividend of $0.12 per share to be paid in June. We ended the quarter with a cash balance of $194 million, a sequential increase of approximately $60 million. Net capex was approximately $7 million during the first quarter. Our full year 2024 capex outlook remains in the range of $45 million to $55 million. In conclusion, the revenue-based FlexSteel earn-out payment is currently estimated to be approximately $34.1 million, which will be paid in the third quarter of this year. This additional consideration has been more than offset by the substantial outperformance of the business, relative to our expectations. That covers the financial review, and I will now turn the call back over to Scott.\n\nScott Bender: Thanks, Al. I'll now touch on our expectations for the second quarter of 2024, our reporting segment. During the second quarter, we expect Pressure Control revenue to be relatively flat versus the first quarter, despite our anticipation that the U.S. land rig count will be slightly down from the first quarter average levels in the period as the effects of rig releases in gas basins lead to lower activity. Adjusted EBITDA margins in our Pressure Control segment are expected to be essentially flat at 33% to 35% for the second quarter. This adjusted EBITDA guidance excludes approximately $3 million of stock-based comp expense within the segment. As mentioned previously, we anticipate introducing our latest generation wellhead to customers in the coming months, which should begin to more significantly impact operating results late this year depending on our inventory position. Regarding our Mid-East expansion plans, we are pursuing 2 viable options in the region. But as we are at a commercially sensitive stage, I do not plan to share further details with you at this time. We believe the current market for surface pressure control equipment in Saudi Arabia exceeds $0.5 billion annually, and we look forward to establishing a more material presence in this market in the coming years. We view the recent shift towards onshore unconventional gas production to be net positive to our potential business. In addition, we are currently finalizing the terms of a significant international order outside of the Mid-East. Switching over to Spoolable Technologies' segment, we expect second quarter revenue to be slightly up from the first quarter with increased installation efficiency from better seasonal activity, sales to midstream customers and continued international shipments, offsetting general industry trends. Our cross-selling initiatives continue to expand, and we're enjoying the benefits of enhanced relationships with our core customers. We expect adjusted EBITDA margins in this segment to be approximately 36% to 38% for the second quarter. Increased input costs are impacting margins in the first half of the year, although we have seen a moderation from the recent peak. Additionally, we began to utilize our pressure control, low-cost supply chain to source select components of our spoolable pipe product, which should enhance margins as the sourcing effort expands throughout 2024. Note that this margin guidance excludes approximately $1 million of stock-based comp in this segment. Adjusted corporate EBITDA is expected to be approximately a $4 million loss in Q2, flat from the first quarter, which excludes approximately $1.5 million of stock-based compensation. Although the macro backdrop provides little reason for optimism about 2024 U.S. activity levels, we remain well positioned at the market and plan to execute on several internal initiatives this year that should improve cash flows and returns. These initiatives include our low-cost supply chain diversification strategy, the introduction of our latest generation wellhead, enhanced frac innovations and the progression of our expansion into international markets. Additionally, I remain very pleased with the integration of our Spoolable Technologies business, which has recently received inquiries from several non-oil and gas customers for large international projects and increasing number of orders of our pipe from a major new midstream customer with a strong outlook for larger awards later this year. Further, CCUS related inquiries are increasing, and we are involved with a customer in hydrogen transmission testing. We believe these new applications, along with the opportunity to gain market share with our existing E&P customer base, should lead to further above market growth in this segment. These recent inquiries and wins further demonstrate the differentiation in the business and reinforce our rationale for this acquisition. So with that, I'll turn it back over to the operator, and we can begin Q&A. Operator?\n\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Stephen Gengaro with Stifel.\n\nStephen Gengaro: So, two things for me. What I'll start with is when we think about our model for you guys, we basically think about North America, right? And you've mentioned some international opportunities and growth. From your seat, when would you expect -- just from a large bigger picture, international to start sort of really showing up on the income statement, where we need to be thinking about sort of baking that into our forecast? Is it later this year? Is it next year? How should we think about that?\n\nScott Bender: Yes. I think it would be next year for it to be a meaningful entry.\n\nStephen Gengaro: Okay. And when [indiscernible] talking maybe more about sort of the size over time, but when we think about your views of the U.S. land market, I mean, you mentioned kind of not a lot of optimism this year, do you see -- obviously, the second quarter we've heard maybe is a bit lower. But do you see a plateau here as you kind of get this gas activity coming off and oil hopefully at least stabilizing, if not trending a little higher. But how do you think about U.S. activity in the back half of this year? And what do you -- sort of catalyst is to get it moving in the right direction?\n\nScott Bender: Yes. Steven, I don't think I've changed my opinion about activity maybe hitting a trough in the [650 onshore to 670 -- I'm sorry, $5.50 to $5.75] range. But I think we'll hit that trough as we exit the summer. And so maybe that will be a time for a plateau.\n\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] I'm not showing any further questions at this time. I would now like to turn the call back over to Scott Bender for any closing remarks.\n\nScott Bender: All right. Well, I thank you all very much. I know we must have had some conflicting earnings calls this morning. But I absolutely -- we all appreciate your support of the company.

We are building for a better future, shifting sales and product development resources to the connected home space, expanding our end market reach and implementing cost initiatives. These actions delivered Q1 2024 results as expected with strong year-over-year gross margin improvements. More importantly, our customer wins, our global footprint optimization and our expense reductions position us for a profitable year as well as position us for consistent sales and earnings growth into 2025, 2026 and beyond. The strengths we have built over the past decades, delivering true seamless interoperability, discovering, connecting and controlling all devices and all brands translate beautifully into the climate control and home automation channels. Our expertise in connectivity protocols from infrared to radiofrequency to IP, and our ability to make those devices work better together gives us a competitive advantage that continues to create unique and differentiated solutions. Our capability to design, engineer and build solutions for the leading brands in the world that are interoperable and self-configuring can help the next generation of products in the home automation and climate control markets become ever more integral to the smart home experience. We are confident in our success as our capabilities align well with the connected home market needs, as evidenced by our new customer activity in this space. As always, the best testament to our success is the partners that choose to work with us on their product solutions. We have won new product designs with 6 of the top 10 HVAC OEM. companies on the planet and are working on to more. Further, the market is growing and undergoing constructive change as climate control devices are getting smarter. For example, there is a transition underway, bringing more efficient product forms such as heat pumps into popularity. Our ability to quickly address these opportunities is reminiscent to the early innings of our success in the home entertainment market. I'd like to highlight a few of our activities that support our outlook. In climate control, at the Consumer Electronics Show in January, we unveiled new UEI TIDE family offerings, including products that bridge to indoor air quality sensors, built-in air purifier control and additional accessories that broaden our control utility. We also took the show on the road and demonstrated our full suite of innovative climate control solutions to our growing list of HVAC OEM customers in Japan, including Daikin, Toshiba (OTC: TOSYY ) Carrier, Fujitsu, LG and Panasonic (OTC: PCRFY ). In March, we exhibited at one of the premier events for the HVAC industry in Europe. Our TIDE family was once again extremely well received generating strong interest from the leading brands in Europe. In fact, in a few short years, we have engaged 13 of the top 14 HVAC OEM brands in Europe that collectively represent over 80% of that market. Already, we have secured three active design wins with two of the top-3 European HVAC OEMs. With a long lead times in this segment, which we have previously discussed. These products are expected to start shipping in 2025. In home automation, during Q1, we received our first standard TIDE Dial and TIDE Touch thermostat orders from a leading multi-dwelling unit integrator in North America. We expect to begin product deliveries later this year. Additionally, TIDE Dial is currently in consumer trials with European utility provider. We expect to complete a successful trial and to begin shipping product to them in Q4. In home entertainment and consumer electronics, although the market has changed greatly over the last couple of years, we continued to capture market share with new product introductions at small and large operators. In Q1, we began shipping our sustainable remote control to Liberty Global (NASDAQ: LBTYA ). We continue to add customers on our Android remote control line, including two telecom companies in India. Both have products in development that are expected to ship in Q3 of this year. We continue to see traction on the Xumo platform across the Charter footprint and the Xumo TV branded platforms, as this program continues to scale in the market. Regarding licensing our proprietary technology, we recently added Hisense as a licensee of our Qterics digital rights management provisioning services. These software services are currently used by Vizio, TCL and numerous other TV OEMs to ensure secure delivery of digital rights management keys for streaming content services on their smart TV platforms. Our QuickSet licensees in consumer electronics such as Samsung (KS: 005930 ), LG and Sony (NYSE: SONY ) all announced their 2024 smart TV product lines and will continue to ship versions of our QuickSet cloud-enabled software. Our latest version brings added value to our customers, giving them access to a better user experience, increased user engagement and reduced onboarding and troubleshooting challenges. These long-term relationships built upon years of working together with these world leading home entertainment companies continued to be strengthened with these feature enhancements and give us further confidence in our success going forward. Now to the financials. Bryan, please go ahead.\n\nBryan Hackworth: Thank you, Paul. First, I'll review the results for the first quarter of 2024 compared to the first quarter of 2023. Net sales were $91.9 million within guidance. This compares to $108.4 million for the first quarter of 2023, reflecting cord cutting in the video service channel and in an environment where households for a variety of reasons are spending less on discretionary goods. Gross profit for the first quarter of 2024 was $27.2 million or 29.6% of sales, compared to 25.4% in the first quarter of 2023. For the past 2 years, our operations team has been focused on restructuring our manufacturing footprint and have executed well exceeding expectations. These efforts have resulted in significant reduction of manufacturing overhead, the main driver of the improvement in our gross margin. Our factory optimization plan is nearing completion. We closed 2023 strong, completing the first two phases, commencing operations in our new Vietnam facility and closing our factory in southwestern China ahead of schedule. Our Vietnam factory continues to scale and meet or exceed our expectations. We are currently streamlining our operations in Monterrey, Mexico, including moving into a smaller, more efficient facility that will supply product for certain North American customers. We remain on target for its completion in the second quarter of 2024. As we evolve as a company, we will continue to assess our global footprint and identify ways to operate more efficiently. For the first quarter of 2024, operating expenses were $29.4 million compared to $31.2 million in the first quarter of 2023, reflecting the execution of our cost savings initiatives. SG&A expenses decreased to $21.8 million compared to $23.1 million in the prior year quarter. R&D expenses decreased to $7.6 million compared to $8.1 million in the prior year's quarter. Operating loss was $2.2 million compared to $3.6 million in the first quarter of 2023. Our first quarter 2023 effective tax rate was 20.6% compared to 19.9% for the first quarter of 2023. Net loss for the first quarter of 2024 was $2.5 million or $0.19 per share compared to $3.5 million or $0.28 in the first quarter of 2023. Next, I'll review our cash flow and balance sheet. At March 31, 2024, cash and cash equivalents were $26.9 million compared to $42.8 million at December 31, 2023. Cash flows used by operating activities were $2.8 million for the first quarter of 2024, which includes a $5 million security deposit relating to a legal matter. This compares to $2 million cash used by operating activities in the prior year quarter. With interest rates at an elevated level, we repatriated foreign earnings, enabling us to reduce our outstanding debt from $55 million at December 31, 2023 to $46 million at March 31, 2024. We also repurchased approximately 95,000 shares in the open market for 843,000. Now, turning to our guidance. For the second quarter of 2024, we expect sales to range from $90 million to $100 million compared to $107.4 million in the second quarter of 2023. We expect to a range from a loss per share of $0.10 to breakeven compared to a loss of $0.06 per share in the second quarter of 2023. UEI continues to evolve as a company. While we remain committed to developing innovative solutions in the home entertainment space. In recent years, we've increased our focus in growth areas such as climate control and home automation. Paul mentioned several project wins in these channels with launches scheduled throughout the latter half of 2024 and 2025. We believe these project wins in the connected home channel, coupled with a more efficient factory footprint will yield bottom line growth and full year profitability. I would now like to turn the call back to Paul.\n\nPaul Arling: Thanks, Bryan. Our expansion into the connected home is broadening our market served and expanding our customer base. Our unique and innovative solutions supported by years of experience in bringing connected home configuration and control to major global brands, make our offerings attractive in these markets. As a result, our sales team and products are gaining traction as the leading brands are increasing their design awards with us. This process can take time, but as we experienced in home entertainment, one project leads to the next, and as we work more closely with these accounts and innovate to improve their product offering, they award more and more of their business to us. As noted, we have secured tangible wins that seek growth in the second half of 2024 and, importantly, into 2025, 2026 and beyond. We are very encouraged by numerous customer wins and are confident of many more to come. Based on our design wins and our customers' planned shipping schedules. We are also very encouraged by our customers' strong interest in our product roadmaps. The systems in our homes today, entertainment, climate control, health, safety, security and others are becoming increasingly interconnected. This brings great convenience functionality and value to consumers worldwide. Our customers, both current and potential, are very aware and interested in this change. Given our substantial experience in helping make these systems interconnected and interoperable, we continue to see significant interest from world leading brands in the markets we serve. As such, we will continue to invest to support the evolution of wireless home control. With our mounting project wins, along with our cost initiatives and global footprint optimization, we expect to be profitable for 2024. We believe our best years are ahead of us and our employees around the world remain hard at work to make this a reality. As always, stay tuned. Operator, we can now open up the call for questions.\n\nOperator: Thank you. At this time, we will conduct the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Greg Burns of Sidoti. Your line is now open.\n\nGregory Burns: Good afternoon. I guess, could we just start with the 10% customers for the quarter?\n\nBryan Hackworth: Yeah, we had two customers that exceeded the 10% threshold. First one is Daikin at 13.2% and the second company is Charter Communications (NASDAQ: CHTR ) at 11.1%.\n\nGregory Burns: Okay. Good to see, I guess, a cable customer popping back on there. So maybe that leads me to my second question, what are you seeing in the cable market? Are you seeing signs of stabilization, maybe improvements in order patterns there? What's the near-term results in the view on the cable market?\n\nPaul Arling: Yes. Our view is that there's obviously change, platforms either have or are changing to hybrid platforms, some of which are delivered to set-top box, some to the TV directly. And we are fully supporting our customers in these changes. As far as the future of the traditional method, we would, of course, not have as part of our plan of growth to have a huge return to the historical pattern of set-top boxes with remotes. We do think that is still there. It frankly can't shrink at the pace it has the last 4 years. So that is clearly just mathematically going to level out somewhat, but there's a change underway. They're powering new televisions with OSs, we're part of that, particularly with the Xumo and others. And that will allow people to get these hybrid platforms, linear content, news, sports, et cetera, alongside all the apps they love and all through that, easy-to-use interface, which we power through QuickSet cloud. So that's the change that's occurring. Home entertainment will be around for the foreseeable future, both here at UEI and generally with people, people aren't watching less television is just the way that it's being delivered is changing and we're changing alongside that. So the home entertainment business is still good. The licensing business has been okay. We saw a drop off last year due to sales of TVs, but that's temporal TVs grow at a constant rate of single digits. So, over time, that will still be true. Home entertainment is going to be here for a while. It's a good basis, a good foundation for our business. But the connected home segments are growing. They're growing fast they're changing, and we have capabilities, as I said in the prepared remarks that are unmatched in that market to help these customers interconnect and make products interoperable with directly with the OEMs. We think we'll power the market into the long-term future.\n\nGregory Burns: Okay. Great. Thank you.\n\nOperator: Thank you for your question. [Operator Instructions] Please stand by for our next question. Our next question comes from the line of Bill Dezellem of Tieton Capital Management. Your line is now open.\n\nBill Dezellem: Thank you. I have a couple of questions related to your comment that you will be profitable this year. Is that on an adjusted basis or on a GAAP basis?\n\nBryan Hackworth: Adjusted.\n\nBill Dezellem: And then, how do you anticipate kind of that Q3 and Q4 unfolding? Would you anticipate that both of them would be profitable or that Q3 would essentially be breakeven and then Q4 would have a level of profitability that would override the losses in the first part of the year?\n\nBryan Hackworth: Yeah. I'm not going to give a guidance for Q3 and Q4 specifically. Basically, right now, our forecast for the full year is for us on an adjusted basis to be profitable.\n\nBill Dezellem: And then, I may have a little bit more fun and try to continue this, if I may, Bryan. Relative to 2025, do you anticipate that whatever the business level is in Q4, that will continue as a run rate into 2025 that you then build off of? Or are you anticipating that there will be some seasonality that will lead to the Q4 being higher, and then you'll have a step back as you move into 2025 and then build from there?\n\nBryan Hackworth: Bill, I'll answer that generally. With all the projects we're winning, there's going to be a layering effect. And as they layer, I expect the sale to continue to grow. Now, if you're comparing Q4 to Q1, sometime Q1 could have a drop-off. But in general, I expect sales to start to ramp. I mean, I know it's small, but sequentially you're seeing it go from just under $92 million in Q1, and we expect the midpoint to be $95 million. So that growth is mainly driven by the project wins that we have. So I expect that to continue the projects we'll layer. And I think when you get into 2025, I think we're going to be in good shape and I expect that 2025 to be a very good year.\n\nBill Dezellem: Great. That is helpful. Thank you for taking the questions.\n\nOperator: Thank you for your question. Please stand by for our next question. Our next question comes from the line of Benjamin Alexander of Alexander Capital Management. Your line is now open.\n\nBenjamin Alexander: Thank you. Good afternoon, Paul and Bryan. I wanted to ask you about the business that you have actually won. You've called out that number in the past as well as the potential opportunities that you're looking at, which is another number you called out on prior calls?\n\nPaul Arling: Right. Yeah, the one business exceeds $80 million of the potential, as we now call the sales tube rather than funnel is in excess of a few hundred million. Now, again, everyone has to remember that the one projects enter the system, they're not one until the end. Once they're one, we then develop them fully and then ship them. So the one projects are almost universally assured. The ones that are in qualification or quote are not yet. We win many of our quotes once they proceed to that level, but we don't win all of them. So the few hundred million will get converted into business, but not completely. In other words, some of those projects will be either considered by the customer and not move forward on. That's typically what happens when they don't move forward. But there's a lot of business out there. This is a very large market. HVAC alone exceeds by almost 2x the size of the home entertainment control market. So it's a very large market and growing. And there's, as I said in the prepared remarks, constructive change taking place there. Technologies in both the units themselves and the control units is changing. The world on this topic, heat pumps are becoming more popular. They're much more energy efficient, less fossil fuel, of course, and that change is underway. Governments are beginning to on and off, put incentives in place for consumers to buy these and install these systems because, again, they use much less energy. So there's a change underway. The same thing that's at our home entertainment market from analog to digital from non-HD to HD, from non-DVR to DVR. There's a change underway and we're there to help them power it and make these systems smarter than ever. And that's why we're getting the traction we are with project wins and a lot of projects entering our sales process. So we're very confident, we're very excited about what's going to happen in not just the coming quarters, but the coming years, because the lead time on these projects is, unfortunately, sometimes 1.5, 2 years, some of them can even stretch more than 2 years once you've won them. But once you've won them, it provides a layer of sales that usually stays with you for a while. And by the way, it's not that different than home entertainment, these projects last 4 years. So we're confident that what we're doing. We've rightsized our manufacturing footprint in contemplation of this business change to more of these types of products, our overhead, we've taken our development money towards these product lines and we're winning projects.\n\nOperator: Thank you. Thank you so much for your question. At this time, that does conclude our question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the call back over to the Chairman and CEO, Paul Arling.\n\nPaul Arling: Yeah, I just want to thank everybody for joining us today and for your continued support of Universal Electronics. Hope to talk to you soon. Have a great day.\n\nOperator: This does conclude today's conference.

My name is Chuck, and I'll be your operator for today's call. [Operator Instructions] Please note this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Oksana Lukasheva. Please go ahead.\n\nOksana Lukasheva: Thank you, operator. Good morning, and thank you for joining us for our quarterly conference call. We will begin today's call with prepared remarks from Jack Roche, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Jeff Farber, our Chief Financial Officer. Available to answer your questions after our prepared remarks are Dick Lavey, President of Agency Markets; and Bryan Salvatore, President of Specialty Lines. Before I turn the call over to Jack, let me note that our earnings press release, financial supplement and a complete slide presentation for today's call are available in the Investors section of our website at www.hanover.com. After the presentation, we will answer questions in the Q&A session. Our prepared remarks and responses to your questions today, other than statements of historical fact, include forward-looking statements as defined under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements can relate to, among other things, our outlook and guidance for 2024 economic conditions and related effects, including economic and social inflation, potential recessionary impacts as well as other risks and uncertainties such as severe weather and catastrophes that could affect the company's performance and/or cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated. We caution you with respect to reliance with forward-looking statements, and in this respect, refer you to the forward-looking statements section in our press release, the presentation deck and our filings with the SEC. Today's discussion will also reference certain non-GAAP financial measures such as operating income and accident year loss and combined ratio, excluding catastrophes, among others. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the closest GAAP measure on historical basis can be found in the press release, the slide presentation or the financial supplement, which are posted on our website, as I mentioned earlier. With those comments, I will turn the call over to Jack.\n\nJohn Roche: Thank you, Oksana. Good morning, everyone, and thank you all for joining us. We opened 2024 with an excellent first quarter, delivering robust earnings and effectively executing on our margin recapture and CAT mitigation plans. Consistent with our focus over the past several quarters, we remain disciplined and discerning in our growth as we continue to reposition our Personal Lines business and to improve earnings resiliency in our overall mix in order to drive strong, sustainable returns for our shareholders over the long term. On today's call, I will share my perspective on our results, as well as my thoughts on why we believe our company is well positioned to continue to deliver improving financial performance in 2024. Jeff will review our financial and operating results in more detail, and discuss our expectations for the second quarter and through year-end. Finally, we will open the line for questions. After-tax operating income for the quarter was $112 million, or $3.08 per diluted share, generating an operating return on equity of 15%. We improved our ex-CAT combined ratio by more than 2 points in the quarter demonstrating the effectiveness of our margin recapture initiatives. As expected, overall growth was subdued in the quarter at 2.3% as we continue to prioritize profitability improvement actions. We expect to accelerate the pace of growth throughout 2024, and we expect to generate net written premium growth in the mid-single-digit range for the full year. We continue to effectively leverage our strong relationships with our best-in-class independent agent partners, helping them successfully navigate the dynamic marketplace and enabling us to build momentum in our target markets. Turning to our segment highlights. In Specialty, we delivered another quarter of exceptional profitability, generating a combined ratio of 87.6%. Consistent with the outlook we provided on our year-end call, Specialty growth picked up from the low watermark in the fourth quarter. The market is very healthy and remains robust with exciting opportunities across Multiple Lines including Excess and Surplus Lines, Marine, Specialty Industrial Property, Healthcare and Surety. Other areas such as Professional and Executive Lines remain competitive, but we are seeing opportunities and premium growth picking up as well. In light of our robust profitability in this subsegment, we will continue to strike a prudent balance appropriately pricing risk while protecting our highly profitable book of business and pursuing quality new business opportunities. At the same time, our Specialty top line results still reflect the impact of underwriting actions on specific underperforming programs within our Specialty P&C subsegment. The impact of these actions is expected to decrease as the year progresses. We expect Specialty net written premium growth in the upper single digits for the full year of 2024 as we further capitalize on our broad diversification and favorable market dynamics in most of our segments. In Marine, we anticipate significant growth in 2024 as we capitalize on opportunities across our diverse portfolio of inland marine products and sectors. In E&S, we expect the recent implementation of our new policy platform will enable us to capture even more market share beginning in the current quarter. In Professional and Executive Lines, we see potential for increased growth in areas such as management liability and selected areas of our Professional Liability business. We're confident we can capitalize on these opportunities as they present themselves throughout the year, and that we will drive meaningful top line growth and further diversification across our overall business mix. Looking at Core Commercial, we are pleased with the segment's strong performance as we continue to provide our agents with a highly attractive portfolio of capabilities. Our Core Commercial team maintained its focus on driving growth in Small Commercial while executing on margin improvement initiatives in Middle Market. Small Commercial grew by approximately 8% in the quarter, fueled by the continued success of our highly intuitive TAP sales platform. Our national rollout of this quote-to-issue platform for bot business is now complete. With that, we are actively working on adding the workers' compensation line of business to the platform, which will support our new business growth efforts in that area. In addition, we are expanding the use of APIs to further enhance our TAP sales reach by efficiently connecting to additional sources of business and adding targeted products to our specialized offerings. In Middle Market, we continue to achieve better and more consistent earnings performance by aggressively nonrenewing bottom decile property business. We're also adjusting our new business appetite to reflect the changing environment, and ensuring that our pursuits are focused on high-quality accounts in targeted sectors and geographies. Additionally, we are making considerable progress against our IoT sensor enrollment program. While the program is targeted at most of our Property Lines, Middle Market remains in the epicenter of these actions given the higher limits profile. Across all of our business lines, we've deployed over 10,000 water and temperature sensors. That program has already resulted in numerous instances of loss prevention and mitigation. We believe we have achieved scale, meaning that operationally, we have enough sensors deployed where we can collect data and recognize trends, such as identifying geographic territories with higher risk profiles, several types of system failures or trends across certain industry sectors. We believe this data will enable us to work even more effectively with our policyholders, providing guidance on how best to build resiliency. Overall, the Commercial P&C market remains rational, and continues to support needed price increases amid recent property loss trends and emerging industry concerns about casualty. For example, new business pricing in Small Commercial continues to accelerate and outpace loss trends. In what has become an increasingly dynamic loss trend environment, we're often asked about our position relative to the social inflation challenges affecting the P&C industry. As a member of the American Property Casualty Insurance Association and other trade associations, we are actively engaged in promoting awareness and reforms to stem the cost of legal system abuse and in advocating for change. In addition, we believe our current liability profile will help us effectively navigate current social inflation trends. On a relative basis, we have a low policy limit profile with over 93% of our liability policy limits at or below $1 million. We have secured and are maintaining low per-risk reinsurance retention, which attaches at $2.5 million, and we have avoided areas that attract a higher level of liability severity and are increasingly challenging to price adequately such as public D&O insurance and stand-alone excess umbrella policies. Over the last several years, we've also taken steps to lower our risk exposure in large metropolitan areas and in industries that are more susceptible to social inflation, reducing umbrella limits in certain lines in highly litigious jurisdictions and executing rate increases to stay on top of trend assumptions. We have approached this issue with a thoughtful and intentional strategy that we believe enables us to effectively manage the current liability environment. Turning to Personal Lines. The business continues to demonstrate improved profitability and is performing largely on track relative to our expectations. Our loss ratio in both Auto and Home decreased compared with the first quarter of last year, in line with our assumptions. Personal Lines renewal price change was a robust 22.8% in the quarter. What's more? All targeted new business is subject to product changes, including an increase in all peril deductibles and the addition of wind and hail deductibles in certain geographies. These changes also are being rolled out with the renewals in targeted states. In addition, we continued to address geographic micro concentrations in the Midwest. As a result of our intense focus on profit improvement, as expected, net written premium growth in Personal Lines was flat year-over-year in the first quarter. We reduced our exposure in the Midwest in a deliberate and controlled manner during the quarter, resulting in a 4% decline in premiums in this region and an approximate 8% decline in policies in force. Having the flexibility and the willingness to shed premiums to reposition our book will lead to improved profit margins in a higher, more resilient profit pool in the future. To that point, excluding Midwestern states, we have delivered growth of 4% with PIF down only 2% year-over-year. Primarily driven by lower new business, while retention remained relatively stable at over 84%. This said, in select geographies, we are already pivoting to a more aggressive new business stance where we have hit our profitability milestones on a written basis and where we are already comfortable with diversification positioning. Overall, the Personal Lines market remains robust. We expect premium growth to accelerate from this point forward and pricing to remain firm in 2024. In the Midwest, we are seeing others follow our lead, implementing higher deductibles and introducing other product changes to offset loss trends. Our Personal Line's account orientation is unique in the independent agency channel, with about 88% of our business representing a whole account. In our view, that orientation creates a preferred customer base that is both more protection minded and far less price elastic which we believe will position us for continued success. As we work to institute increased pricing deductibles and to adjust terms and conditions, our strong independent agency relationships are once again proving to be critical. Just a few weeks ago, we met with over 120 of our largest, most successful agents at our Annual President's Club Conference. We held a number of executive meetings focused on how we can best support our agents in the current dynamic market environment and grow our business together. We believe our independent partner agents fully recognize the critical role they play in our efforts to advance customer adoption of risk prevention and mitigation tools as well as in garnering customer support for the needed pricing increases we are implementing. We walked away from this annual event with more confidence than ever in the strength of our distribution platform and the commitment of our agent partners. In summary, our excellent performance in Q1 underscores the strength, diversification and resilience of our business. We already have begun to see the positive effects of our underwriting actions, catastrophe management initiatives and other proactive steps to enhance profitability across our businesses. We look forward through year-end and beyond with a tremendous sense of optimism. Confident in our ability to deliver increasingly stronger results to execute on our strategic priorities and to deliver value for our shareholders, agent partners and customers. With that, I'll turn the call over to Jeff.\n\nJeff Farber: Thank you, Jack, and good morning, everyone. I'll begin with an overview of our first quarter results, discuss our segment financial highlights and investment performance and then mention our 2024 outlook. We are very pleased with our strong start for the year, posting a first quarter combined ratio of 95.5%. We delivered a combined ratio, excluding catastrophes, of 89.5%, a 2.2 point improvement over the prior year quarter. Our current accident year loss ratio, excluding catastrophes, improved 1.9 points to 59.3% reflecting the continued earning-in of price increases. Our results were highlighted by a year-over-year reduction in the underlying loss ratio in Personal Lines and Specialty. Strong and steady margins in Core Commercial also contributed to the excellent performance. The continued improvement in profitability validates the effectiveness of our margin recapture plan, and gives us confidence that we are on the right path to deliver on our long-term ROE target of 14% or higher. At 30.9%, our first quarter expense ratio was slightly above our full year target of 30.7%, primarily due to the timing of certain expenses. Relative to the first quarter of last year, the expense ratio is higher primarily driven by changes in variable compensation accruals between the two periods as well as increased investments in our Specialty business this year, consistent with our growth and market share gain strategy. We remain on track to deliver a full year expense ratio of 30.7% in 2024. Catastrophe activity was within our CAT assumption for the quarter, accounting for 6% of net earned premium. Northeast floods in January and hail events in February and March were the main contributors to CAT losses. Ex-CAT prior year development was approximately $10 million favorable in the quarter driven by overall favorability in Core Commercial and Specialty. Each of the main lines of business in our Core segment developed favorably. Personal Lines prior year development was immaterial overall. Favorable development in Auto was offset by some unfavorable development in Home and Other. As we noted in our year-end call, the industry is experiencing elevated auto-related umbrella losses, and we prudently increased our recent prior year loss expectations in response. Overall, a combination of reserving prudence and favorable liability mix characteristics in Commercial Lines continues to serve us well. Now I'll review underlying segment results beginning with Specialty. Our Specialty book continued its track record of profitability in the quarter, delivering an ex-CAT combined ratio of 85.4%, 2.4 points better than the prior year quarter. The underlying loss ratio of 48.7% marked an improvement of 4.8 points over the prior year quarter, primarily from lower-than-expected losses in our Specialty Property business. Our longer-term loss expectation for Specialty remains in the low 50s. From a top line perspective, we remain on track to accelerate Specialty growth to the upper single digits for the full 2024 year. Our Core Commercial segment delivered an ex-CAT combined ratio of 90.0% in the first quarter. a 2.1 point improvement year-over-year. The Core Commercial current accident year loss ratio, excluding catastrophes, was relatively in line with our expectations and the prior year quarter at 58.5%. At the same time, we are intently watching for liability trends, including social inflation pressures in Casualty Lines. Trends in our book of business so far remains stable and very manageable. Our litigated frequency per exposure has returned to normal levels in 2022 and '23 after unusually low frequency of litigation in 2020 and '21. Overall, general liability loss frequency continues to decline, while the mix of claims is shifting to more complex claims, contributing to an increased loss severity. Commercial auto liability frequency seems to have settled at a new normal somewhat below the pre-pandemic levels, while severity is elevated but manageable. Workers' compensation remains stable, with a slight increase in indemnity while medical inflation remains within our expectations. Of course, we continue to monitor trends closely. We are managing our liability profile very carefully, as Jack discussed. Importantly, we are maintaining a very disciplined approach to our prudent liability loss picks and prior year estimations, taking small adjustments if and when needed, and promptly incorporating our updated view of trends into pricing and terms and conditions. We established this approach back in 2016 when we materially added to our reserve position as a new leadership team, while at the same time, initiating a shift in liability mix. We also adhered to thoughtful prudence during low-frequency COVID periods. We continue to feel confident in our reserve position. Core Commercial Lines net written premiums grew 3% in the first quarter. Rates continue to hold firm in both property and most liability lines, while retention ticked down 1.7 points for the quarter due to targeted nonrenewals in middle market, in-keeping with our positive strategic decision to sacrifice some top line growth in exchange for improved margin. Now moving on to Personal Lines. This segment delivered an ex-CAT combined ratio of 91.1%, an improvement of 5.1 points over the first quarter of 2023. The Personal Lines current accident year loss ratio, excluding catastrophes, improved 2.4 points to 65.6%, with the accelerating benefit of prior and current rate increases earning-in, coupled with moderating collision and property loss costs, we expect meaningful improvement in our ex-CAT loss ratio to continue throughout 2024. Auto current accident year loss ratio, excluding catastrophes of 73.6% in the first quarter improved 2.2 points year-over-year, driven by the benefit of earned pricing increases. Additionally, our data indicates that collision loss severity is easing, in particular for used car prices. We are also experiencing some deceleration in the cost of parts as well as lower rental costs due to shorter repair cycle times. At the same time, we remain cautious about liability coverages in auto and therefore, reflected an elevated loss expectation in current accident year picks in bodily injury. Similar to Commercial Auto, bodily injury frequency seems to have settled at a level below pre-COVID, while severity is elevated due to a higher occurrence of catastrophic claims, including pedestrian, bicycle and motorcycle hits and crashes at high speeds. However, as the benefit of higher rate continues to earn-in and the property loss trends ease, we expect significant loss ratio improvement for Auto throughout 2024. Home and Other current accident year loss ratio, excluding catastrophes, improved 2.4 points to 54.5%, driven by rate and exposure adjustments earning in. Also within Home and Other, we prudently increased loss ratio expectation for umbrella coverage in response to prior year development and an increase in catastrophic auto accidents in the industry. Of course, umbrella rates are up meaningfully compared to historical levels and the market is reacting accordingly. Both Auto and Home Lines of business achieved strong pricing increases in the first quarter. Auto price was up 18.2%, and we expect it to continue to stay solid throughout the year. Home price was up 30.2% on average in the first quarter including 19.6 points of rate and 10.5 points of exposure increases. We expect Personal Lines pricing to remain robust for the remainder of the year. However, Home exposures will tick down starting in the second quarter as insurance to value inflation adjustments return to more normal levels. Additionally, all peril and wind and hail deductibles start being applied to the majority of our target renewals in April, effectively lowering our risk on every property where such deductibles are applied. Equally important, earned prices will continue to accelerate for some time, increasing underwriting margins. Looking ahead, we expect the benefit of strong earned Personal Lines pricing and more stable property loss trend to drive a meaningfully improved Personal Lines current accident year ex-CAT loss ratio throughout 2024. Furthermore, we anticipate some additional improvements as the result of increased home inspections and new business rigor implemented in 2023 in homeowners. We expect significant margin improvement in Auto and Home to pace a return to target profitability by the end of this year on a written basis and in 2025 on an earned basis. Moving on to investment performance. Net investment income increased $11 million or about 14% to $89.7 million in the first quarter 2024, primarily driven by strong fixed income results from higher bond yields. The current rate environment should continue to provide an accumulating benefit to net investment income in 2024 and subsequent years. Historically, much of our investment portfolio was internally managed. After an in-depth and thoughtful analysis, we have made the decision to transfer management of the investment-grade fixed maturity portion of our investment assets to an external manager. We believe the switch to an outsourced model will allow us to benefit from the expansive capabilities of a large-scale asset manager, including their market depth and knowledge among others. Longer term, we hope that the external asset manager will help us to further optimize our investment portfolio's contribution to The Hanover's bottom line. We expect to complete this transition before the end of the second quarter. Moving on to book value and capital position. Strong earnings in the first quarter were partially offset by an increase in the fixed income portfolio's unrealized loss position, marking a 1.9% sequential increase in GAAP book value per share to $70.22. Statutory surplus increased by about 5% to $2.8 billion. In this dynamic environment, we remain focused on ensuring we maintain ample financial flexibility to support our business. Although we refrained from making any share repurchases this quarter, returning capital to shareholders through regular quarterly dividends and share buybacks remain important elements of our long-term capital allocation strategy. For the second quarter of 2024 our planned CAT load is 8.5%. As we mentioned in February, we have intended to pick higher on the probability curve in establishing our full year 2024 CAT load of 7%, and that it should decline for 2025. Our CAT guidance does not yet reflect the ultimate impact of substantial terms and conditions changes in Personal Lines that are currently underway. In summary, we are off to a strong start in 2024. We are executing successfully on our margin recapture initiatives and disciplined growth strategies concentrated in our most profitable lines of business. Our financial and operational performance is underpinned by targeted underwriting, strong pricing and a commitment to provide the products and services our agent partners and customers value most. We will continue to focus on creating long-term growth and superior returns for our shareholders. With that, we will now open the line for questions. Operator?\n\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And the first question will come from Michael Phillips with Oppenheimer.\n\nMichael Phillips: First question, Jeff, on your comments there on Core Commercial, specifically GL, frequency is still down. good news there. I guess, maybe a brief description of why you think that's still the case and how long that could continue? And then part of that, too, is you said more complex claims. Can you talk about what you're seeing to describe those complex claims?\n\nJeff Farber: Sure. In terms of the frequency, I think we're seeing some of our insureds there's less physical activity going into the premises. And in some cases, people aren't going into malls, people aren't going into restaurants quite as often, and that's creating a reduced frequency. That's been pretty dramatic. In terms of the complex claims, you're seeing less minor claims, so the overall proportion of claims is growing with respect to the complex claims or more severity that's having lawyer involvement and the like.\n\nMichael Phillips: Okay. And I guess, secondly, maybe just more higher level. You talked about in the Specialty business, the investments you're making, and some pressure on the expense ratio. How long will those investments continue? And then maybe just talk about growth opportunities or what those investments are going to accrue to you over the next couple of years?\n\nJohn Roche: Yes, Mike, this is Jack. Thanks for that question. We're -- we're quite excited about the performance of our Specialty business. And as 2023 concluded, we made a decision to look at the best-performing areas of Specialty and make some additional investments from a resource standpoint. And we also invested in a platform that affected a few of our newer and profitable businesses. So I'll let Bryan kind of speak to that, but we know that the growth trajectory that we have ahead for Specialty will make the expense ratio very [pairable]. And overall, what you should get from that is that we're investing in one of our key businesses.\n\nBryan Salvatore: Yes, sure. So I'll just give a little bit of more detail there, right? So for example, we've been leaning into technology for our E&S business, right? This is a fast-growing, very profitable area. We built out a completely new system for them. As you may know, they also have a lot of submissions and quotes in the E&S space. So we will get a lot of efficiency and upside from that type of investment. We're also adding staff to that area. And it's not just in our E&S area. We're also investing in the platform for our Industrial Property business, and we're investing in staff for our Marine business and our Healthcare businesses. So a number of our areas that we see is quite profitable, growing and having a lot of opportunity we're investing in. And I do think to Jack's point, that will earn through the revenue -- will earn through and that will absolutely help us on the expense side.\n\nJeff Farber: Mike, notwithstanding investing heavily in our most profitable and ultimately fastest-growing business. We're still committed to the 30.7% expense ratio for the overall firm.\n\nOperator: The next question will come from Michael Zaremski with BMO Capital Markets.\n\nJack Matten: This is Jack on for Mike. You touched on this in the prepared remarks, but just curious if you could offer more color on the deconcentration strategy and progress in Personal Lines. Specifically in Michigan and perhaps in the Northeast as well? Are you reducing concentration in those geographies meaningfully? Or are you losing fewer customers and expect as you successfully push improved terms and conditions, including higher deductibles?\n\nJohn Roche: Yes. This is Jack again. I frankly couldn't be any more pleased with the execution that we're seeing within Personal Lines and frankly, the rest of the enterprise, because as we think about property aggregations and we think about spreading our risk and implementing terms and conditions, that requires the entire enterprise to kind of contribute. But specific to Personal Lines, we are right on target with the thresholds and the milestones that we set for ourselves so much so that with the implementation, particularly on the renewal terms and conditions, if that continues to go as well as we project that we can continue to change the dials on our new business appetite. We've already done that in 5 of our states. We're looking at the next 5. So I think of this as a big picture is we are making meaningful progress on our margin recapture and simultaneously advancing our diversification efforts at a really good clip. So I couldn't be more pleased with the way that's playing out in Personal Lines.\n\nJeff Farber: From a premium and insured perspective, you'll see some PIF shrink into 2025. But from a premium growth perspective, you'll start seeing some growth continuing to get larger from here on, from here forward.\n\nRichard Lavey: And this is Dick Lavey, one last point to your question about the Midwest versus the Northeast. Yes, exactly as Jeff said, we're manufacturing the PIF reduction in the Midwest 3x to 4x the rate in other geographies. That's really where the confection storm issues have prevailed and the wind and hail deductibles are being in place. The Northeast doesn't have those perils. So our Northeast business retention is higher and PIF shrinkage is less.\n\nJack Matten: And second question is on reserve development, which was healthy again this quarter. I was wondering if there's any change in your high-level view on loss expense trends? You talked about frequency trends normalizing for some Casualty Lines. But wondering if you're seeing any changes in severity. I'm just asking given that some other insurers have increased their loss inflation forecast recently?\n\nJeff Farber: Yes. So overall, we're very comfortable with our balance sheet and very prudent in how we set reserves. In Core Commercial, we -- every major line was favorable. So feeling really good about that. Overall, our Property Casualty mix, while a little bit challenging during the inflation in that period, serves us reasonably well as casualty trends spike up. And Specialty is also largely a claims-made policy construction, which will help us, Jack talked about the limit structure in his prepared remarks, where 93% is less than or equal to $1 million overall and 77% in Core. And we also talked about how comfortable we are and the approach we took around reserving both in 2016 and 2020. And then finally, the concentration or our geographic focus, we -- back in '17, '18, '19, we really wanted to deemphasize the major metropolitan cities. Think about L.A., Chicago, New York, and that has really, really served us well. So while frequency is down, severity is up dramatically, and I think we've been prudent at picking and preparing for that all the while bringing up our severity picks.\n\nOperator: The next question will come from Meyer Shields with KBW.\n\nUnidentified Analyst: Thank you. It's [Jane] on for Meyer. My first question is on the core loss ratio for commercial. It was flat year-over-year. Just curious what your expectation for here onward? Is the run rate that we should think about going forward?\n\nJeff Farber: We're getting rate meaningfully above loss trend. And so we feel optimistic about our ability to have some improvement in the loss ratio going forward. From time to time, you have particularly higher or lower individual losses for property. I think a year ago, we happened to have had some lower levels losses this particular quarter, a little bit higher. But I'm pleased with how that business is producing at 58.5%, but I think we have a little bit of opportunity to improve that going forward as the rate earns in.\n\nUnidentified Analyst: Perfect. That's helpful. My second question is on Personal Auto. I saw like a slight reserve charge there. I know it's very small. Just wondering if you can add more color on that? Just want to make sure I'm not missing anything behind it.\n\nJeff Farber: Can you clarify the question? I think I missed a word or two. It was about Personal Auto and what was the concern on the slide?\n\nUnidentified Analyst: It's not a concern, just there's a slight reserves charge on that?\n\nJeff Farber: So in Personal Lines, overall, we had no development. Auto was favorable and Home was slightly -- it was adverse. And in Home, it was actually the umbrella. And truth be told, it's actually Auto that's showing itself in the umbrella. And I think we talked in our prepared remarks about some of the catastrophic activities such as pedestrian hits and some of those things are driving us to increase our picks for both prior and current period for umbrella.\n\nOperator: The next question will come from Grace Carter with Bank of America (NYSE: BAC ).\n\nGrace Carter: Hi, everyone. The data on limits that you gave for the Liability exposures in Core Commercial is really helpful. Just kind of looking at continued growth in the Small Commercial book versus the underwriting and Middle Market over the past few quarters? Even though that's kind of geared towards the property side. I was wondering if you expect any sort of perceptible impact on the limits going forward in the liability book just kind of given maybe a greater emphasis on smaller accounts?\n\nJohn Roche: Yes, Grace, this is Jack. Given our current trajectory of growth patterns, I think those -- that limits profile will be either equally as impressive or maybe even a little bit better because we are growing our smaller business, both in the Core Lines and in Specialty at a faster clip. And we believe we have a real competitive advantage in both of those areas. That said, I think as we move through this liability environment. Longer term, our hope and expectation is, is that we can put ourselves in a position so we can participate in the mid-range Specialty business and eventually middle market in a more robust way. But this is an environment where I think caution and prudence is appropriate. But I don't want you to miss the point that our relevance with agents and our ability to take the company to the next level, has some bearing on whether we can navigate these trends that we're all going through and grow all of our businesses into the future. So that's how we're approaching it.\n\nGrace Carter: And I guess following up on that, I think last quarter, you all had mentioned maybe a greater emphasis on Liability Lines versus history going forward. I was just wondering if given kind of, I guess, the noise is growing loud around social inflation around the industry, if there's been any tweaks to that plan so far on the magnitude of the shift? And just kind of any sort of progress on how you're thinking about that so far?\n\nJohn Roche: Yes. I think we -- I think at the time, we were clear about the fact that this was not going to be a major step change in one direction or the other. We were clearly disadvantaged last year by having more property in our mix than some of our competitors. I believe we'll be less disadvantaged and potentially advantaged going forward if the liability trends continue to present themselves. So I think to your point, Grace, we're not having an identity crisis with our book mix, we're trying to optimize. And where we see particularly in certain geographies, in certain sectors. We are moving forward on our liability mix. Bryan spoke about that, particularly in E&S and the lower end of Management Liability and our Healthcare businesses. We have great margins, great transparency to what growth looks like. So overall, I think you're right, it will be somewhat balanced. We're pretty excited about our business mix going forward.\n\nOperator: The next question is a follow-up from Michael Phillips with Oppenheimer.\n\nMichael Phillips: Just your last couple of questions there. On Small Commercial kind of prodded me on this one. Small Commercial has been kind of a sweet spot for the industry for a while. You guys are killing it there. But I guess because it's been such a sweet spot, it seems like -- it feels like at least going back a couple of years, that's a place where many people said they would want to go. And not sure you've seen them come into that space and maybe the competitive landscape has changed? And if not, here's why not? Maybe what's the moat to get into that space and be as successful as you guys are?\n\nJohn Roche: Yes, Mike, I think that's very perceptive, and I'll let Dick speak to that. But I do believe that Small Commercial a business that takes significant investment and frankly, insight in terms of where the profit pools are? What pricing sophistication needs to look like? And so it is not something that you can just turn the switch and get into, and there have been carriers that have highlighted that and either not made the progress that they intended to make or in some cases, regressed. So Dick, maybe you can build on that.\n\nRichard Lavey: You hit it well. I mean this business is one where ease of doing business wins the day, and I know that's an overused term, but that means all the elements of the operating model aligned from the people, the way you have them, the way you do new business, the way renewals are handled. And of course, the platform that you put on the agent's desktop for them to submit and issue business. So as you know, we've made significant investments going back 3, 4 years on that. Our first product BOP is now completely rolled out, and we're working hard to get more comp added to it. So other competitors haven't frankly made those levels of investments. There are some that we compete well against day-to-day, but we're absolutely thrilled with where this business is and looking into the future, now that the platform is nearing completion, we feel comfortable actually expanding distribution and finding other points of access.\n\nOperator: This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Ms. Oksana Lukasheva for any closing remarks. Please go ahead.\n\nOksana Lukasheva: Thank you, everybody, for your interest and participation.

[Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Mike Morrison, CFO. You may begin.\n\nMike Morrison: Thank you, Justin, and thank you for joining the NCS Multistage first quarter 2024 conference call. Our call today will be led by our CEO, Ryan Hummer, and I will also provide comments. I want to remind listeners that some of today's comments include forward-looking statements such as our financial guidance and comments regarding our future expectations for financial results and business operations. These statements are subject to many risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from any expectation expressed herein. Please refer to our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and our latest SEC filings for risk factors and cautions regarding forward-looking statements. Our comments today, as well as the results of operations included in our earnings release, contain the following non-GAAP financial measures, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA margin, adjusted gross profit, adjusted gross margin, free cashflow less distributions to non-controlling interests, and net working capital. The underlying details and reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP financial measures are provided in our first quarter earnings release, which can be found on our website, ncsmultistage.com. I'll now turn the call over to Ryan.\n\nRyan Hummer: Thank you, Mike, and welcome to our investors, analysts, and employees joining our first quarter 2024 earnings conference call. NCS is off to a strong start in 2024. Our first quarter revenue of $43.9 million, exceeded the high end of our guided range by nearly $4 million. The strength was broad-based as we achieved or exceeded the high end of our guided revenue range for each of our US, Canadian, and international markets, with the largest relative outperformance coming from Canada. Our adjusted gross margin of 40%, which excludes depreciation and amortization expense, was within our guided range for the quarter. Our SG&A expense of $13.8 million for the quarter was $2.3 million lower than in the first quarter of 2023, resulting from cost savings measures that demonstrate our commitment to control expenses and a year-over-year reduction in litigation-related professional fees. We also benefited from an increase in other income as compared to the first quarter of last year, primarily royalty income related to licensing our intellectual property, and the benefits from a technical services agreement with a local partner in Oman. Our adjusted EBITDA for the first quarter of $6.1 million, exceeded our estimate of $3 million to $4 million, and represents a year-over-year improvement of $1.2 million and a sequential improvement of $3.5 million. In prior earnings calls. I've referenced NCS's core strategies for creating value for our stakeholders. We've included a new slide in our investor presentation, which is available on our website, Slide 13, that helps to illustrate our strategy and provide examples of our progress. The first core strategy is to build upon our leading market positions. We've demonstrated our commitment to this strategy in Canada thus far in 2024. Our Q1 revenue in Canada of $32 million, increased by 3% as compared to the first quarter of 2023, despite a reduction in the average rig count in Canada of 6% for the same period. This performance reflects the initiatives to leverage the strength of our market position and customer relationships developed over time in our fracturing systems business, and to pull through additional revenue opportunities across our other product lines. In particular, we continue to capture additional well construction opportunities with our fracturing systems customers and to grow the customer base for our purple seal frack plugs and fracture express systems and plug-and-perf completions in Canada. Our second core strategy is to capitalize on international and offshore opportunities. We've previously discussed our efforts to grow our customer base in the North Sea and to position the company for long-term growth opportunities in the Middle East in particular. We are now benefiting from these strategic investments. We're off to a good start so far this year, having sold sliding sleeves to a new North Sea customer in the first quarter. As we move to the second quarter, we expect activity in the North Sea to improve on a seasonal basis, with installation and completion activity increasing, including the expected delivery of sliding sleeves to yet another new North Sea customer. In addition, we are experiencing a meaningful increase in Tracer Diagnostics activity in the Middle East. In April, we completed tracing the first of multiple pads for a leading national oil company in the Middle East, supporting development plans for their unconventional resource base. We expect to participate in at least two similar projects over the remainder of 2024. In addition, NCS has been awarded the opportunity to trace additional conventional wells for the same customer, supporting activity between the unconventional well pads. This is only possible because of the tireless effort of individuals across our organization to educate our customer on the value that our tracer diagnostic services can bring to tackle the procurement and logistical challenges of the work, and to provide outstanding customer service throughout the jobs and for the reporting process. Including the expected midpoint for international revenue guidance for the second quarter, our international revenues would approximate $7.2 million for the first half of 2024. This compares to $3.3 million in the first half of 2023, and would exceed our full-year 2023 international revenue of $6.5 million. As a reminder, full-year international revenue for NCS exceeded $10 million for each of 2018 through 2021, reaching a high of over $15 million during that period, highlighting our opportunity outside of North America. The third core strategy for NCS is to commercialize innovative solutions to complex customer challenges. We have internal objectives this year tied to obtaining field trials for new products and successfully entering new markets and regions. I spoke to this extensively on our prior call, so will just briefly highlight some of these exciting projects. We had a successful onshore trial during the first quarter for a completion system designed for deep water operations. This was developed in conjunction with an international oil company, with potential applications in the Gulf of Mexico and other deepwater regions. We've completed initial field trials for our pinpoint oriented perforating gun system at Repeat Precision, and we continue to advance further testing and validation, aligned with an influential customer's requirements. In the second quarter, we expect to install a well that will represent our highest ever sleeve count in the US at over 200 sleeves. The well will be utilizing fiber optic technology to help the customer optimize a horizontal water flood program. We had a successful entry into the SAGD market in Canada for our fracturing systems technology earlier this year. This is a first for NCS, and we expect to utilize our technology for additional applications and customers in this market over time. In addition to these projects, we have several other technology developments underway across our various product lines, which I'm looking forward to discussing as they roll out. Mike will now review our results for the first quarter and our guidance for the second quarter.\n\nMike Morrison: Thank you, Ryan. As reported in yesterday's earnings release, our first quarter revenues were $43.9 million, a 1% increase year-over-year, with our Canadian and international revenues up 3% and 39%, respectively, and our US revenues down 12%. Despite a slight decrease in the average rig count, we saw a modest increase in our Canadian revenues. Additionally, our international revenues experienced growth, driven by the sale of a frac systems to a customer in the North Sea. Our US revenues continued to be impacted by lower natural gas prices that have curtailed some customer activity. Sequentially, our revenues in the first quarter increased by 24%, with Canada up 27%, and the US up 10%, while international revenues nearly doubled. Our adjusted gross profit, defined as total revenues less total cost of sales, excluding depreciation and amortization expense, was $17.6 million in the first quarter of 2024. Our adjusted gross margin was 40%, down compared to our adjusted gross margin of 43% for the same period in 2023, but up sequentially from 37% for the fourth quarter of 2023. Selling, general, and administrative costs were $13.8 million for the first quarter, down by $2.3 million compared to the same period last year. The significant reduction was due in part to our restructuring efforts in 2023 to streamline operations and better leverage our SG&A spend. For the first quarter, we reported net income of $2.1 million or diluted earnings per share of $0.82, compared to a net loss of $15 million or a loss per share of $6.10 for the same period in 2023. Our prior year net loss was impacted by a $17.5 million litigation provision we recorded in the first quarter of 2023 that was later settled and reversed in the fourth quarter of 2023. Adjusted EBITDA for the first quarter was $6.1 million, an improvement to the $4.9 million in the same period in 2023. Now, turning to cashflow items on the balance sheet. Cashflow from operating activities and free cashflows less distributions to non-controlling interest, were uses of cash of $1.9 million and $2.5 million, respectively. Our forecast for the full year of 2024 is to be free cashflow-positive. However, similar to the first quarter of 2023, our negative cashflow was primarily due to an increase in net working capital of approximately $6 million. This was due in part to an increase in our accounts receivable, partially offset by a reduction in our inventory balances. On March 31, we had $14 million in cash, and total debt of $8.9 million, which consists primarily of finance lease obligations, resulting in a positive net cash position of $5.1 million. At the end of March 2024, the borrowing base availability under our undrawn ABL facility was $20.4 million, and Repeat had $6 million of outstanding borrowings under a promissory note that was repaid in full in April. Now, turning to a few points of guidance for the second quarter. We currently expect second quarter total revenue in the range of $27 million to $30 million. We expect Canadian revenue in the range of $12.5 million to $13.5 million, US revenue of $10 million to $11 million, and international revenues of $4.5 million to $5.5 million. We expect our adjusted gross margin to be between 36% and 38%, an improvement to our adjusted gross margin for the second quarter of 2023. Due to the Canadian seasonal impact of spring breakup, we expect our adjusted EBITDA to be between breakeven and a negative $2 million, and our second quarter depreciation and amortization expense to be approximately $1.2 million. With that, I'll hand it back over to Ryan to discuss our 2024 full-year guidance and for closing remarks.\n\nRyan Hummer: Thanks, Mike. We're making only slight adjustments to our full-year guidance for 2024 at this time. We currently expect full-year revenue of $150 million to $160 million. This guidance increases the low end of the revenue range by $5 million, and maintains the top end of the range. As a reminder, we expect our revenue growth will primarily result from increased sales at Repeat Precision and our fracturing systems product line in the US, and in international markets, the North Sea and Middle East in particular. We're cautiously optimistic about Canadian activity as well. There are fundamental drivers supporting customer activity in Canada, including the TMX oil pipeline coming online this quarter, and the Canada LNG facility due to come online in 2025, which is driving activity increases to support increased natural gas production in advance of this facility's commissioning. In addition, the strong US dollar supports Canadian activity, as our Canadian customers have operating expenses in Canadian dollars, but can sell oil and condensate at prices linked to the strong US dollar. These positive fundamental factors are tempered by the drought conditions that continue to exist in Western Canada. If we have a dry spring or an active wildfire season like we did in 2023, access to fresh water for our customers could be reduced, which could result in lower completions activity, as firefighting and agricultural activity would have preferential access to fresh water. At this point, our guidance incorporates at least some disruption from the drought conditions and wildfire prospects. So, there can certainly be more favorable Canadian customer activity levels if we continue to benefit from a wet spring, as we have thus far, and a less active fire season. We've increased our adjusted EBITDA range to $14.5 million to $17.5 million, with a midpoint of $16 million. The increase to the midpoint of the range is $1 million, with increases to both the bottom and top end. Due to the seasonality of our business, and consistent with prior years, we anticipate that the achievement of our annual adjusted EBITDA guidance range will be weighted to the second half of the year. The $4 million year-over-year increase in adjusted EBITDA at the midpoint of the current range, represents an incremental adjusted EBITDA margin of over 32% on the $12.4 million increase implied by the midpoint of our revenue guidance range, reflecting the impact of the business optimization initiatives undertaken by NCS in 2023, and our relatively fixed operating expenses. We expect our gross capital expenditures for the year to be between $1.5 million and $2.5 million, and we expect to generate over $5 million in free cashflow in 2024, after distributions to non-con controlling interests, despite the modest investment in net working capital that could result from supporting our revenue growth. We believe that our expectation for revenue and earnings growth in the current industry environment, paired with our strong balance sheet, positions us favorably amongst other publicly-traded oil field services and equipment peers. This is illustrated on Slide 19 of our investor presentation, which benchmarks analyst consensus revenue and EBITDA growth for 2024 for us and a group of publicly-traded peers with a market capitalization of below $1 billion. The charts illustrate that NCS is expected to generate revenue and earnings growth that is above the median of the peer set. Another chart on the slide demonstrates that our debt to capitalization ratio at December 31, 2023, was below the median for the peer set, reflecting our resilient balance sheet. However, this favorable growth in balance sheet profile is not reflected in our trading multiple, which at 3.4x enterprise value the 2024 EBITDA, was one multiple turn below that of the peer with the next lowest multiple, and approximately two multiple turns below the peer median. Before we open the call to Q&A, I'll close with a couple of brief comments. We're benefiting from the core strategies that we put in place in 2022 aimed at generating value for our stakeholders through organic growth and technology development. We have the infrastructure in place to support revenue growth in each of our geographic markets, providing leverage to growth future earnings. As demonstrated by our current guidance for 2024, achieving the midpoint of our guidance range would grow our annual revenue by 9% and our adjusted EBITDA by over 30%. We maintain a strong balance sheet and liquidity position, with a cash balance of over $14 million at the end of the first quarter. In addition, we expect to add to that cash balance by generating positive free cashflow in 2024, providing us with financial and strategic flexibility. Finally, we continue to benefit from the successful introduction of new technologies that meet the needs of our customers, adding to our portfolio, and expanding our addressable market. With that, we'd welcome any questions.\n\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Dave Storms from Stonegate. Your line is now open.\n\nDave Storms: Good morning. Just hoping we could start with the top-line guidance. It's great to see that you've raised the low end. What would you need to see either in the international markets or elsewhere to also raise the top end of that guidance?\n\nRyan Hummer: Sure, thanks, Dave. Appreciate the question. I think for us, the biggest thing right now is that we are taking a relatively conservative approach to the Canadian market. I outlined during the call what we think is a really, really strong fundamental backdrop for Canada, and I think that'll persist throughout the year. However, we certainly are aware that coming into 2024, you had a couple of years of extended drought conditions. There was a very active wildfire season last year. We're fortunate that there's been a relatively wet spring so far, but it's easy. So, I think we're just being a little bit cautious right now around the potential prospects for some potential reduced activity on the completion side if our customers find that it's a bit more difficult to access fresh water for their completions as you move into the summer months. So, I think as we move through the second quarter and understand whether - what the extent of that impact will be, if any, I think that's where we have a bit more confidence in really assessing whether there's some upsides to the top end of the range as well.\n\nDave Storms: Understood. Very helpful. And then you mentioned that international markets used to operate around $15 million or so a year. What's the pathway to get back to that? Is that going to be getting cataloged with current companies? Is that going to be addressing new markets? What does that look like?\n\nRyan Hummer: Yes, thanks. Another great question, Dave. I think the path to that is the path we're on, quite frankly, and there are two components to it. I think first is, during that period, we had one customer who was very active in the North Sea, an Aker BP (NYSE: BP ), who we've referred to as kind of our anchor customer in the North Sea over time. And as you know and as we've discussed, we've been really active in adding to our customer base for the North Sea. We think we'll work with at least five different companies this year. And what we're really looking forward to is both Aker and one of the other customers have field development projects that they're looking to bring online as we move forward into 2005 and 2026, which would represent more consistent work and would look a lot more like the level of activity that we saw back in those months or those prior years. And you pair that with the work that we've been doing in the Middle East, and we're in a really good spot right now with Tracer Diagnostics in the Middle East. We're getting additional well construction products qualified to be called out there. So, with the North Sea back to historical activity levels that we saw during that period, tied together with the additional opportunities in the Middle East, I think we are on the path towards hitting those sorts of - that revenue profile that we saw in those prior years.\n\nDave Storms: That's very helpful. Thank you. I'll get back in queue.\n\nOperator: And thank you. And one moment for our next question and our next question comes from Blake McLean from Daniel Energy Partners. Your line is now open.\n\nBlake McLean: Hey guys, thanks for taking my call. So, I was hoping you could provide a little bit more color on kind of how we should think about the offshore opportunity set, timing associated with that, and kind of what that sort of path forward to incremental revenue looks like over the next year or two or whatever timeframe works.\n\nRyan Hummer: Sure, yes, happy to do the best I can there. So, again, this year we're going to work for more customers in the North Sea than we ever have before. It will not be a large well count with any customers individually, but I think that sets the stage for some more work going forward. And I mentioned that there are two customers in particular operating in the North Sea, really one on the Norwegian side, one on the UK side, that have some larger development programs that we would expect to participate in, and we would see the work on those programs starting to ramp up, more so next year, but could represent pretty consistent work for multiple-year timeframe. We pair that with the technology development project that we have for the deepwater application. That's a little bit longer to develop, and I'd say the number of wells per year is not necessarily the same scope the North Sea is, but they're very attractive well opportunities for us on a single well basis. So, that could move forward and be a small handful of wells per year, but those individual well opportunities would be pretty impactful for us as a company. And again, that would develop over a longer term timeframe. I don't think you'd see that ramping up really until - we may have a first well in 2025, but that would pick up more in 2026 and beyond.\n\nBlake McLean: That's helpful. Thank you. Maybe just one more, just building on the last set of questions, and again, maybe zooming out a little bit, how should we think about the opportunity set internationally, and specifically in the Middle East? And how do you sort of tee yourselves up to be successful there? What does the sales and business development sort of team look like? How do you sort of execute well over there? Do you have that team in place? You have a plan to kind of build that out? And where do you think that the Tracer Diagnostics and some of the things you guys are doing out there, where do you think it really makes sense of if we think about it from a sort of multi-year perspective?\n\nRyan Hummer: Yes, no, another really good question. So, what I'd say is that at the highest level, we've got the right teams and strategies in place when we think about the leadership for our international group and the business development teams from the international group. We are aligned with what we think are very strong local partners in the various geographies and in Oman and in Saudi particularly, who are helping us to navigate that process of getting each of our product lines cataloged and in a position where the asset managers in the various international regions can kind of call out our work very quickly and without getting additional approvals from procurement and whatever the case may be. So, moving it from, call it a technology trial into having our products and services utilized in production mode. The big opportunity for us that we're executing on this year are these unconventional Tracer projects for a Middle East customer. I'd say that customer is very early in their development of their unconventional resource. And the opportunity there with - that's really that period where utilizing Tracer Diagnostics in particular is very, very valuable for a customer to help them understand the resource and optimize their development plans. So, I think there's a good runway there. Where we'll probably need to support that development over time will be with additional operations personnel. Right now, we're mobilizing people from North America, from Argentina, from China, to service some of that well work in the Middle East. So, we'll probably need to make some more investments in personnel, both within our own headcount, but also some folks within our local partners. And over time, we may look to make some strategic investments in the region as well, whether that's what I'd call sort of a relatively light footprint Tracer lab or some other types of investment there. But we'd only do that once we've established the track record and have sort of several years of relatively robust revenue and earnings in those markets before we deploy additional capital into supporting that business.\n\nBlake McLean: Got it. Thanks for walking through that in some detail. I've got just one more if you don't mind. Could you provide a bit more color on the sleeve that you guys highlighted in your prepared remarks?\n\nRyan Hummer: Sure. I think you're talking about the one in the US with the fiber optics, is that right?\n\nBlake McLean: Yes.\n\nRyan Hummer: Yes. So, that's a pretty interesting project. So, what we're able to do there, the customer wants to run a fiber optic line in that well, and it's - they're really - it's somewhat unique project, especially in the US where historically, water flood projects have used vertical injectors. This is an area that was developed horizontally. So, they're looking to execute a horizontal water flood program and optimize that. The well that's going to be installed will have a very large number of sliding sleeves, and it'll have a fiber optic cable clamp to it. And part of the reason that the customer would use sleeves for that is, one, to be able to have as many well-known access points along that lateral, but more importantly, as opposed to if you were going to plug-and-perf that well, there's a risk of having your perforation, if it's not aligned properly, accidentally shoot that cable and cut off your ability to acquire the data. So, we're able to channel that fiber in between the ports of our sleeves to take that risk off the table. So, yes, the customer will benefit in a number of ways. And the other piece with that, by installing sliding sleeves and specifically our reclosable sleeves, if the customer sees water breakthrough in parts of that well that's indicated by the fiber, what we can do is go in and help the customer manipulate those sleeves to shut off water breakthrough in certain areas and again, just maximize the value for that area through the deployment of the technology.\n\nBlake McLean: Okay. Thanks for that detail, you all. I'll kick it back to you all.\n\nOperator: [Operator instructions]. And am showing no further questions. I would now like to turn the call back over to Ryan Hummer, CEO, for closing remarks.\n\nRyan Hummer: All right. Thank you, Justin. All right. On behalf of our management team and board, we'd like to thank everyone on the call today, including our shareholders, analysts, and especially our employees. I truly appreciate the tremendous work and dedication demonstrated by our team here at NCS and Repeat Precision as we implement our long-term strategy. We're only as good as our people, and I believe we have the best team in the industry. Our team continues to provide excellent service to our customers and is developing new products and services that will enable our customers to be more successful. We appreciate everyone's interest to NCS Multistage, and we look forward to talking again on our next quarterly earnings call.\n\nOperator: This concludes today's conference call.

Management provides adjusted non-GAAP metrics, because it uses them for budget planning purposes and for making operational financial decisions, and believes that providing these non-GAAP financial measures to investors as a supplement to GAAP financial measures, help investors evaluate UEI's core operating and financial performance and business trends consistent with how management evaluates such performance and trends. In addition, management believes these measures facilitate comparisons with the core operating and financial results and business trends of competitors and other companies. A full description and reconciliation of these adjusted non-GAAP measures versus GAAP are included in the Company's press release issued today. On the call today are Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Paul Arling, who will deliver an overview; and Chief Financial Officer, Bryan Hackworth, who will summarize the financials. Paul will then return to provide the closing remarks. It's now my pleasure to introduce Paul Arling. Please go ahead, sir.\n\nPaul Arling: Thank you for joining us today. We are building for a better future, shifting sales and product development resources to the connected home space, expanding our end market reach and implementing cost initiatives. These actions delivered Q1 2024 results as expected with strong year-over-year gross margin improvements. More importantly, our customer wins, our global footprint optimization and our expense reductions position us for a profitable year as well as position us for consistent sales and earnings growth into 2025, 2026 and beyond. The strengths we have built over the past decades, delivering true seamless interoperability, discovering, connecting and controlling all devices and all brands translate beautifully into the climate control and home automation channels. Our expertise in connectivity protocols from infrared to radiofrequency to IP, and our ability to make those devices work better together gives us a competitive advantage that continues to create unique and differentiated solutions. Our capability to design, engineer and build solutions for the leading brands in the world that are interoperable and self-configuring can help the next generation of products in the home automation and climate control markets become ever more integral to the smart home experience. We are confident in our success as our capabilities align well with the connected home market needs, as evidenced by our new customer activity in this space. As always, the best testament to our success is the partners that choose to work with us on their product solutions. We have won new product designs with 6 of the top 10 HVAC OEM. companies on the planet and are working on to more. Further, the market is growing and undergoing constructive change as climate control devices are getting smarter. For example, there is a transition underway, bringing more efficient product forms such as heat pumps into popularity. Our ability to quickly address these opportunities is reminiscent to the early innings of our success in the home entertainment market. I'd like to highlight a few of our activities that support our outlook. In climate control, at the Consumer Electronics Show in January, we unveiled new UEI TIDE family offerings, including products that bridge to indoor air quality sensors, built-in air purifier control and additional accessories that broaden our control utility. We also took the show on the road and demonstrated our full suite of innovative climate control solutions to our growing list of HVAC OEM customers in Japan, including Daikin, Toshiba (OTC:TOSYY) Carrier, Fujitsu, LG and Panasonic (OTC:PCRFY). In March, we exhibited at one of the premier events for the HVAC industry in Europe. Our TIDE family was once again extremely well received generating strong interest from the leading brands in Europe. In fact, in a few short years, we have engaged 13 of the top 14 HVAC OEM brands in Europe that collectively represent over 80% of that market. Already, we have secured three active design wins with two of the top-3 European HVAC OEMs. With a long lead times in this segment, which we have previously discussed. These products are expected to start shipping in 2025. In home automation, during Q1, we received our first standard TIDE Dial and TIDE Touch thermostat orders from a leading multi-dwelling unit integrator in North America. We expect to begin product deliveries later this year. Additionally, TIDE Dial is currently in consumer trials with European utility provider. We expect to complete a successful trial and to begin shipping product to them in Q4. In home entertainment and consumer electronics, although the market has changed greatly over the last couple of years, we continued to capture market share with new product introductions at small and large operators. In Q1, we began shipping our sustainable remote control to Liberty Global (NASDAQ:LBTYA). We continue to add customers on our Android remote control line, including two telecom companies in India. Both have products in development that are expected to ship in Q3 of this year. We continue to see traction on the Xumo platform across the Charter footprint and the Xumo TV branded platforms, as this program continues to scale in the market. Regarding licensing our proprietary technology, we recently added Hisense as a licensee of our Qterics digital rights management provisioning services. These software services are currently used by Vizio, TCL and numerous other TV OEMs to ensure secure delivery of digital rights management keys for streaming content services on their smart TV platforms. Our QuickSet licensees in consumer electronics such as Samsung (KS:005930), LG and Sony (NYSE:SONY) all announced their 2024 smart TV product lines and will continue to ship versions of our QuickSet cloud-enabled software. Our latest version brings added value to our customers, giving them access to a better user experience, increased user engagement and reduced onboarding and troubleshooting challenges. These long-term relationships built upon years of working together with these world leading home entertainment companies continued to be strengthened with these feature enhancements and give us further confidence in our success going forward. Now to the financials. Bryan, please go ahead.\n\nBryan Hackworth: Thank you, Paul. First, I'll review the results for the first quarter of 2024 compared to the first quarter of 2023. Net sales were $91.9 million within guidance. This compares to $108.4 million for the first quarter of 2023, reflecting cord cutting in the video service channel and in an environment where households for a variety of reasons are spending less on discretionary goods. Gross profit for the first quarter of 2024 was $27.2 million or 29.6% of sales, compared to 25.4% in the first quarter of 2023. For the past 2 years, our operations team has been focused on restructuring our manufacturing footprint and have executed well exceeding expectations. These efforts have resulted in significant reduction of manufacturing overhead, the main driver of the improvement in our gross margin. Our factory optimization plan is nearing completion. We closed 2023 strong, completing the first two phases, commencing operations in our new Vietnam facility and closing our factory in southwestern China ahead of schedule. Our Vietnam factory continues to scale and meet or exceed our expectations. We are currently streamlining our operations in Monterrey, Mexico, including moving into a smaller, more efficient facility that will supply product for certain North American customers. We remain on target for its completion in the second quarter of 2024. As we evolve as a company, we will continue to assess our global footprint and identify ways to operate more efficiently. For the first quarter of 2024, operating expenses were $29.4 million compared to $31.2 million in the first quarter of 2023, reflecting the execution of our cost savings initiatives. SG&A expenses decreased to $21.8 million compared to $23.1 million in the prior year quarter. R&D expenses decreased to $7.6 million compared to $8.1 million in the prior year's quarter. Operating loss was $2.2 million compared to $3.6 million in the first quarter of 2023. Our first quarter 2023 effective tax rate was 20.6% compared to 19.9% for the first quarter of 2023. Net loss for the first quarter of 2024 was $2.5 million or $0.19 per share compared to $3.5 million or $0.28 in the first quarter of 2023. Next, I'll review our cash flow and balance sheet. At March 31, 2024, cash and cash equivalents were $26.9 million compared to $42.8 million at December 31, 2023. Cash flows used by operating activities were $2.8 million for the first quarter of 2024, which includes a $5 million security deposit relating to a legal matter. This compares to $2 million cash used by operating activities in the prior year quarter. With interest rates at an elevated level, we repatriated foreign earnings, enabling us to reduce our outstanding debt from $55 million at December 31, 2023 to $46 million at March 31, 2024. We also repurchased approximately 95,000 shares in the open market for 843,000. Now, turning to our guidance. For the second quarter of 2024, we expect sales to range from $90 million to $100 million compared to $107.4 million in the second quarter of 2023. We expect to a range from a loss per share of $0.10 to breakeven compared to a loss of $0.06 per share in the second quarter of 2023. UEI continues to evolve as a company. While we remain committed to developing innovative solutions in the home entertainment space. In recent years, we've increased our focus in growth areas such as climate control and home automation. Paul mentioned several project wins in these channels with launches scheduled throughout the latter half of 2024 and 2025. We believe these project wins in the connected home channel, coupled with a more efficient factory footprint will yield bottom line growth and full year profitability. I would now like to turn the call back to Paul.\n\nPaul Arling: Thanks, Bryan. Our expansion into the connected home is broadening our market served and expanding our customer base. Our unique and innovative solutions supported by years of experience in bringing connected home configuration and control to major global brands, make our offerings attractive in these markets. As a result, our sales team and products are gaining traction as the leading brands are increasing their design awards with us. This process can take time, but as we experienced in home entertainment, one project leads to the next, and as we work more closely with these accounts and innovate to improve their product offering, they award more and more of their business to us. As noted, we have secured tangible wins that seek growth in the second half of 2024 and, importantly, into 2025, 2026 and beyond. We are very encouraged by numerous customer wins and are confident of many more to come. Based on our design wins and our customers' planned shipping schedules. We are also very encouraged by our customers' strong interest in our product roadmaps. The systems in our homes today, entertainment, climate control, health, safety, security and others are becoming increasingly interconnected. This brings great convenience functionality and value to consumers worldwide. Our customers, both current and potential, are very aware and interested in this change. Given our substantial experience in helping make these systems interconnected and interoperable, we continue to see significant interest from world leading brands in the markets we serve. As such, we will continue to invest to support the evolution of wireless home control. With our mounting project wins, along with our cost initiatives and global footprint optimization, we expect to be profitable for 2024. We believe our best years are ahead of us and our employees around the world remain hard at work to make this a reality. As always, stay tuned. Operator, we can now open up the call for questions.\n\nOperator: Thank you. At this time, we will conduct the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Greg Burns of Sidoti. Your line is now open.\n\nGregory Burns: Good afternoon. I guess, could we just start with the 10% customers for the quarter?\n\nBryan Hackworth: Yeah, we had two customers that exceeded the 10% threshold. First one is Daikin at 13.2% and the second company is Charter Communications (NASDAQ:CHTR) at 11.1%.\n\nGregory Burns: Okay. Good to see, I guess, a cable customer popping back on there. So maybe that leads me to my second question, what are you seeing in the cable market? Are you seeing signs of stabilization, maybe improvements in order patterns there? What's the near-term results in the view on the cable market?\n\nPaul Arling: Yes. Our view is that there's obviously change, platforms either have or are changing to hybrid platforms, some of which are delivered to set-top box, some to the TV directly. And we are fully supporting our customers in these changes. As far as the future of the traditional method, we would, of course, not have as part of our plan of growth to have a huge return to the historical pattern of set-top boxes with remotes. We do think that is still there. It frankly can't shrink at the pace it has the last 4 years. So that is clearly just mathematically going to level out somewhat, but there's a change underway. They're powering new televisions with OSs, we're part of that, particularly with the Xumo and others. And that will allow people to get these hybrid platforms, linear content, news, sports, et cetera, alongside all the apps they love and all through that, easy-to-use interface, which we power through QuickSet cloud. So that's the change that's occurring. Home entertainment will be around for the foreseeable future, both here at UEI and generally with people, people aren't watching less television is just the way that it's being delivered is changing and we're changing alongside that. So the home entertainment business is still good. The licensing business has been okay. We saw a drop off last year due to sales of TVs, but that's temporal TVs grow at a constant rate of single digits. So, over time, that will still be true. Home entertainment is going to be here for a while. It's a good basis, a good foundation for our business. But the connected home segments are growing. They're growing fast they're changing, and we have capabilities, as I said in the prepared remarks that are unmatched in that market to help these customers interconnect and make products interoperable with directly with the OEMs. We think we'll power the market into the long-term future.\n\nGregory Burns: Okay. Great. Thank you.\n\nOperator: Thank you for your question. [Operator Instructions] Please stand by for our next question. Our next question comes from the line of Bill Dezellem of Tieton Capital Management. Your line is now open.\n\nBill Dezellem: Thank you. I have a couple of questions related to your comment that you will be profitable this year. Is that on an adjusted basis or on a GAAP basis?\n\nBryan Hackworth: Adjusted.\n\nBill Dezellem: And then, how do you anticipate kind of that Q3 and Q4 unfolding? Would you anticipate that both of them would be profitable or that Q3 would essentially be breakeven and then Q4 would have a level of profitability that would override the losses in the first part of the year?\n\nBryan Hackworth: Yeah. I'm not going to give a guidance for Q3 and Q4 specifically. Basically, right now, our forecast for the full year is for us on an adjusted basis to be profitable.\n\nBill Dezellem: And then, I may have a little bit more fun and try to continue this, if I may, Bryan. Relative to 2025, do you anticipate that whatever the business level is in Q4, that will continue as a run rate into 2025 that you then build off of? Or are you anticipating that there will be some seasonality that will lead to the Q4 being higher, and then you'll have a step back as you move into 2025 and then build from there?\n\nBryan Hackworth: Bill, I'll answer that generally. With all the projects we're winning, there's going to be a layering effect. And as they layer, I expect the sale to continue to grow. Now, if you're comparing Q4 to Q1, sometime Q1 could have a drop-off. But in general, I expect sales to start to ramp. I mean, I know it's small, but sequentially you're seeing it go from just under $92 million in Q1, and we expect the midpoint to be $95 million. So that growth is mainly driven by the project wins that we have. So I expect that to continue the projects we'll layer. And I think when you get into 2025, I think we're going to be in good shape and I expect that 2025 to be a very good year.\n\nBill Dezellem: Great. That is helpful. Thank you for taking the questions.\n\nOperator: Thank you for your question. Please stand by for our next question. Our next question comes from the line of Benjamin Alexander of Alexander Capital Management. Your line is now open.\n\nBenjamin Alexander: Thank you. Good afternoon, Paul and Bryan. I wanted to ask you about the business that you have actually won. You've called out that number in the past as well as the potential opportunities that you're looking at, which is another number you called out on prior calls?\n\nPaul Arling: Right. Yeah, the one business exceeds $80 million of the potential, as we now call the sales tube rather than funnel is in excess of a few hundred million. Now, again, everyone has to remember that the one projects enter the system, they're not one until the end. Once they're one, we then develop them fully and then ship them. So the one projects are almost universally assured. The ones that are in qualification or quote are not yet. We win many of our quotes once they proceed to that level, but we don't win all of them. So the few hundred million will get converted into business, but not completely. In other words, some of those projects will be either considered by the customer and not move forward on. That's typically what happens when they don't move forward. But there's a lot of business out there. This is a very large market. HVAC alone exceeds by almost 2x the size of the home entertainment control market. So it's a very large market and growing. And there's, as I said in the prepared remarks, constructive change taking place there. Technologies in both the units themselves and the control units is changing. The world on this topic, heat pumps are becoming more popular. They're much more energy efficient, less fossil fuel, of course, and that change is underway. Governments are beginning to on and off, put incentives in place for consumers to buy these and install these systems because, again, they use much less energy. So there's a change underway. The same thing that's at our home entertainment market from analog to digital from non-HD to HD, from non-DVR to DVR. There's a change underway and we're there to help them power it and make these systems smarter than ever. And that's why we're getting the traction we are with project wins and a lot of projects entering our sales process. So we're very confident, we're very excited about what's going to happen in not just the coming quarters, but the coming years, because the lead time on these projects is, unfortunately, sometimes 1.5, 2 years, some of them can even stretch more than 2 years once you've won them. But once you've won them, it provides a layer of sales that usually stays with you for a while. And by the way, it's not that different than home entertainment, these projects last 4 years. So we're confident that what we're doing. We've rightsized our manufacturing footprint in contemplation of this business change to more of these types of products, our overhead, we've taken our development money towards these product lines and we're winning projects.\n\nOperator: Thank you. Thank you so much for your question. At this time, that does conclude our question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the call back over to the Chairman and CEO, Paul Arling.\n\nPaul Arling: Yeah, I just want to thank everybody for joining us today and for your continued support of Universal Electronics. Hope to talk to you soon. Have a great day.\n\nOperator: This does conclude today's conference.

Now I would like to turn the call over to Karen. Karen?\n\nKaren Zaderej: Thank you, Harold, and thank you all for joining us today as we discuss our 2024 first quarter financial results. We had a solid first quarter, and we are pleased with both the positive trends in revenue and bottom line. Our performance underscores the progress we continue to make towards profitability and generating positive cash flow. During today's call, I'm going to highlight the progress we've made across our business as well as some changes we've made on the disclosure and reporting side, which both Nir and I will discuss later on in the call. Revenue for the quarter increased by 12.9% to $41.4 million compared to last year. We are pleased with this quarter's top line performance, which was at a run rate above the midpoint of our annual guidance. Looking closely at the quarter, growth was broad-based across our products and applications. We saw a strong January and February, and our typical step up in volume occurred in April rather than March this year. We remain confident that we will achieve our 2024 top line guidance. As part of the disclosure and reporting changes I alluded to in my opening comments, we've made the strategic decision to remove our revenue breakdown between scheduled and emergent trauma applications. Our growth strategy continues to be focused on going deeper and high potential accounts and to build the nerve repair business in these accounts across all of our targeted nerve repair applications. We believe the performance and key metrics pertaining to sales productivity and our progress in our core accounts provide the most clarity on the business model versus estimates of revenue by application. We will continue to talk qualitatively about the applications for nerve repair and our growth to give you color on both the opportunities in front of us and the progress we are making. As I said earlier, our growth strategy continues to be focused on going deeper in our existing core accounts where we see significant opportunity to expand our footprint in multiple clinical applications as well as increasing the number of core accounts. Most of our core accounts have the opportunity for significant expansion across surgeon users and applications, resulting in upside in total revenue. As a reminder, core accounts are defined as those generating more than $100,000 in revenue over the trailing 12 months and represent approximately 65% of our total revenue. Today, our largest core accounts are over $1 million annualized, and we look to continue to grow our core accounts towards their full potential. We ended the first quarter with 115 direct sales representatives, down one sequentially and compared to a year ago. We believe our revenue growth can continue to be driven primarily by increased productivity of our sales force, and we will evaluate and add additional sales reps as their territories approach targeted levels. Our direct sales force is supplemented by independent sales agencies that represent approximately 10% of our total revenue. As the leader in the nerve repair market, driving innovation to provide advanced solutions for surgeons and their patients is a key pillar of our growth. We previously announced three innovations to our portfolio, which included two new products to the protection space and the Resensation technique for implant-based breast neurotization. We saw strong surgeon and patient interest in implant-based breast neurotization and grew the number of surgical teams trained in this new technique. We are on track to expand our education efforts with three national Resensation surgeon training programs in 2024. Nerve protection continues to represent a significant growth opportunity for AxoGen. As previously mentioned, we saw a need for multiple product solutions to address the diverse types of non-transected nerve injuries. Our first portfolio expansion with the launch of AxoGuard HA+ Nerve Protector, and we have been pleased with the surgeon acceptance of the product and the progress of the launch, including the positive impact we are seeing on surgeon activation and new use cases in targeted applications. We are continuing to expand our offering for nerve protection with a Avive+ Soft Tissue Matrix, which broadens our nerve protection portfolio and targets acutely traumatized nerves. Avive+ Soft Tissue Matrix is a resorbable nerve protection implant that functions as the barrier, providing temporary protection and tissue separation during the critical phase of healing. We are pleased with the initial surgeon feedback we've received in our limited market release and on track for a full launch in June. With these additions, we believe we offer the broadest portfolio -- a protection portfolio for nerve repair, and this will continue to drive growth in the nerve protection market. Moving on to updates to our growing body of clinical evidence. Over the years, we've made significant investments to develop quality clinical evidence to demonstrate the safety, performance, health care economics and utility of our nerve repair solutions. Our active clinical programs are progressing as expected. As of the end of the quarter, we had 258 peer-reviewed publications, including applications in trauma, breast, OMF and pain. This January, we announced positive top line results from the REPOSE clinical study comparing standard of care and neurectomy of symptomatic neuromas to neurectomy and protection of the terminated nerve and with our AxoGuard Nerve Cap. This post marketing study met its primary endpoint for reduction in pain as measured by the visual analog scale. In addition, the study investigators found that over the full 12-month course of follow-up, AxoGuard Nerve Cap demonstrated statistical superiority for reduction in the total pain reported by the subjects compared to the standard of care neurectomy. We believe that these findings will play an important role in surgeon clinical decision-making. Turning now to the BLA for Avance nerve grafts. We completed a productive pre-BLA meeting with FDA. We are encouraged by the positive interactions and have aligned with FDA on a rolling submission process and the content of the modules for submission. We believe we are on track for the BLA filing to be completed in the third quarter of 2024, and the submission time line will allow for a potential approval in mid 2025. In addition, as required under the Pediatric Research Equity Act, we've submitted and reached agreement with the FDA of an initial pediatric study plan proposal. A final decision of the proposed plan is made by the review division at the time of approval of the biologics marketing application. Another component of our transition to a biologic was the construction and validation of our new AxoGen processing center. At the end of 2023, we fully transitioned all advanced processing to our new center. We believe the advancements of our processing facility will provide the appropriate biologic processing environment as well as expand our processing capacity. As a reminder, a BLA approval will complete the regulatory transition of Avance nerve graft from a 361 tissue product to a 351 biological product. Importantly, we believe Avance will be designated as the reference product for potential biosimilars, providing 12 years of market exclusivity from the approval. In conclusion, we are pleased with our results from the first quarter, which reflects the execution of our growth strategy. The exceptional performance of AxoGen's talented team has been pivotal in achieving these outcomes. Looking ahead, we are focused on delivering and furthering our mission to revolutionize the science of nerve repair. I'll now hand the call over to Nir, who will provide further details on our reporting changes, review our financial highlights and provide guidance. Nir?\n\nNir Naor: Thank you, Karen. It's been very exciting 5 months since I joined the AxoGen team. I've been listening carefully to the various teams and quickly learning the vast details behind this robust and innovative business. As part of my diligence, I have seen several different opportunities and changes to enhance our reporting. All of these changes were strictly voluntary. And although our previous practices are acceptable alternatives, I believe that the new practices are more widely used in the industry and provide investors improved comparability of the company's financial statements to peers. In addition, these changes will provide better transparency and facilitate better resource allocation as we continue our journey to profitability. Our auditors have reviewed these changes and agree that they are acceptable. One of these changes involve our accounting policy for shipping and handling costs. As of the first quarter of 2024, our shipping and handling costs directly related to bringing our products to their final destination, including facility and warehousing overhead, are now included in cost of goods sold, whereas previously they were included in sales and marketing expenses. Additionally, as of the first quarter of 2024, we ceased allocating certain costs to and from certain departments. Previously, such costs had been allocated based on the company's estimate of the proportionate share of total expense to each line item. It is important to recognize that all of these changes, which were completely voluntary, had no impact on net revenue, loss from operations, net loss per common share or cash flows. We've made available our 2023 reclassified condensed consolidated statements of operations by quarter in our earnings release this morning to provide full transparency of these changes. Correspondingly, all the 2023 financial results that we refer to include all of these changes. In addition, we will no longer be disclosing the breakout on emerging versus scheduled procedure revenue. This disclosure was based on estimates and provided qualitative information about the applications where our products are used. After looking into this disclosure and speaking with investors and advisers, I came to the conclusion that this disclosure does not provide the best insights into our business model and successful execution of our commercial strategy. Our strategy is focused on increasing our sales productivity and penetration into high potential accounts across multiple surgeon specialties and procedural applications. As a result, we've decided to align our reporting more closely with our strategy. And now turning to our financial results. For this quarter, our revenue was $41.4 million, representing 12.9% growth from the first quarter of 2023. This growth is attributed to a 4.9% increase in unit volume added with a 5.3% mix favorability and a 2.6% increase in price. Our gross profit for the quarter was $32.6 million, an increase from the $28.5 million recorded in the first quarter of 2023. This represents gross margin of 78.8%, up from 77.7% in the same period last year. Our total operating expenses for the quarter increased by 3.8% to $37.2 million, up from $35.8 million in Q1 of 2023. Our sales and marketing expenses for the first quarter grew by 1.9% to $19.8 million. Sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of total revenue decreased to 47.9% from 53% in the first quarter of 2023 as we saw improved sales productivity as well as the termination of royalty payments on Avance. Research and development expenses increased by 17.1% to $7.4 million from $6.3 million in 2023, driven by costs related to the BLA. As a percentage of total revenue, total R&D expenses increased to 17.9%, up from 17.3% in the last quarter of the previous year. General and administrative expenses remained almost flat at $9.9 million in Q1 of 2024 compared to $10.1 million in the first quarter of 2023. The quarter ended with a net loss of $6.6 million or $0.15 per share compared to a net loss of $7.1 million or $0.17 per share in the first quarter of 2023. However, we recorded an adjusted net loss of $2.7 million for the quarter or $0.06 per share, a shift from adjusted net loss of $4.1 million or $0.10 per share in the same period last year. Adjusted first quarter EBITDA was $1 million compared to an adjusted EBITDA loss of $3.8 million in the previous year. This change stands as a testament to our focused execution and improvement in operational efficiency and underscores our commitment to optimizing our cost structure. As of March 31, our balance of cash, cash equivalents and investments was $23.6 million compared to $37 million at the end of the fourth quarter of 2023. Turning now to our guidance. As outlined in today's press release, we are maintaining our full year guidance for 2024. We expect revenue to be in the range of $177 million to $181 million, which represents an annual growth rate of approximately 11% to 14%. We also reiterate our gross margin guidance for the full year to be in the range of 76% to 79%. Additionally, we expect to be net cash flow positive cumulatively for the period from April 1 through year-end. In summary, we are pleased with our performance in the first quarter. We will continue to execute our strategies, invest in innovation, drive revenue growth and optimize resource allocation and profitability. At this time, we'd like to open the line for questions.\n\nOperator: Yes, thank you. [Operator Instructions] And the first question comes from Michael Sarcone with Jefferies.\n\nMichael Sarcone: Karen, just the first one, your comments on performance through the quarter, you talked about a strong January and February and then a volume uptick in April. Can you maybe give us a little bit of color on what happened in March and how that compares to what you've seen historically?\n\nKaren Zaderej: Yes. As you know, we historically have seen as the summer months start a sort of step up in the second quarter, and that usually leads in March. And this year, we did not see the lead in March. We saw it actually, as I said in my notes, get pushed into April is where we saw the step up. I'm going to hypothesize here that it had to do with the timing of the Easter holidays, but that's just a hypothesis on my part. We have talked to a number of hospital systems that have also said they saw a shift in the March time frame on their elective outpatient procedures that might support that. But what we just saw was a little difference in timing of when we saw that step up occur. Having said that, we are really pleased to see that we saw growth again across products, across applications, continuing to build this business with a real focus in building out those core accounts and driving penetration in core account.\n\nMichael Sarcone: Got it. Thanks. That's helpful. And just given that you saw the step up in April rather than March, does that have any implications for quarterly sales cadence through the balance of the year, particularly if it differs from prior years?\n\nKaren Zaderej: I think in the end, we are still going to see the cadence that you see a second quarter step up and a third quarter step up that we've seen in the past. So I think we are not seeing a difference there. It's just a slight difference in timing of the week that it occurred in.\n\nMichael Sarcone: Got it. And just one last one for me. Can you give us any updates on the CEO search?\n\nKaren Zaderej: CEO search is in process. There's a group of independent directors who are leading the search. They've hired an outside search firm who is sourcing candidates, and they're going through the interview process. So still work in process that ultimately we'll get an announcement as we finalize that. They want to be thoughtful in that selection. And then of course, if you remember, I'll still be available from a consulting standpoint for a period of time to support that transition.\n\nOperator: Thank you. And the next question comes from Mike Kratky with SMB Securities.\n\nMike Kratky: Can you just give a little bit more color on the decision to remove the schedule versus the emerging breakdown? I mean, was there anything you saw this quarter that was kind of at odds with what you expected? Or any changes to how we should be thinking about the split between those two moving forward?\n\nNir Naor: Yes. Thank you for the question. So as we mentioned, this breakout is based on estimates and provide this qualitative breakout between those two procedures. And after looking into that, especially with this emphasis on resource allocations that I promoted and talking to several analysts and investors, I got the conclusion that it doesn't provide the best insights and the best way to look at our business and our commercial strategy. Our commercial strategy has been to increase our penetration into high potential accounts, which each spend several procedures and applications and surgeon specialties. So that is basically the rationale.\n\nKaren Zaderej: And then in your question, again, from a color commentary standpoint, we continue to see growth across multiple applications and products were not isolated into one area or one product, frankly. We are excited to continue to see the growth that we see in the protection area. If you remember, protection is both part of trauma and part of our scheduled cases. And so we are pleased to see that we are seeing all of these areas continue to grow. And that's one of the shifts again is to say that growth is predominantly happening in these core accounts. That's where our focus is. So I'm just thinking that the core account metrics are going to be more indicative of how we're growing our business.\n\nMike Kratky: Got it. Yes, really appreciate the helpfully color there. And then maybe just a quick follow-up. But from a product mix standpoint, I know you're not going to give details on kind of the specifics. But how should we think about the contribution from some of the newer product launches in terms of 2024 and the second half of this year?\n\nKaren Zaderej: I'm sorry. So could you state the question again?\n\nMike Kratky: Yes, just in terms of how we should think about the contribution from some of the newer product launches that you've had for the second half of this year and 2024 in general.\n\nKaren Zaderej: Okay. Well, first, we consider them in our guidance, so they were included in the guidance that aren't part of a change in guidance with the launch of the two protection products. Avive+ will launch here in June, so it will be ramping up. So like all new products, I think the back half of the year, while surgeons are going to be excited to try it, the revenue impact is still going to be modest because you've got to go through value analysis committees to get it into the accounts. So there's work that has to happen before it can really start to impact revenue. HA+, on the other hand, we've gone through a lot of that value analysis submissions, getting it allowed to be bought -- either brought into or stocked in hospitals and we are starting to see good, steady use of the product and reuse of the product. I can't give you an exact contribution, but we are really pleased to see that it is taking its rightful place in some of the surgeons' treatment algorithms and is becoming a product that they regularly use in certain use applications.\n\nMike Kratky: Understood. Thanks very much.\n\nOperator: Thank you. And the next question comes from Catlin Cronin with Canaccord Genuity.\n\nUnidentified Analyst: Hey, guys. This is George on for Catlin. Yes, so I just have a couple of questions on our end. Just first, what was procedure growth like in the quarter on a percentage basis year-over-year? And then maybe talk a little bit about just the general health of the overall market you're seeing in '24.\n\nKaren Zaderej: I'm sorry, again. It was hard to hear the question. If you could repeat the question?\n\nUnidentified Analyst: Yes. Do you hear me now? Yes, so our first question was just understanding how procedure growth was like in the quarter on a year-over-year basis. And then just more generally, on the health of the overall market that you're seeing in '24.\n\nKaren Zaderej: Yes. We've seen good procedure growth in -- so let me break each of the segments. So trauma has seasonality to it. So we saw the seasonality that we would expect in a Q1 with the noted exception of the timing of the step up. As people start to get more active, we saw that pushed into April instead of the trail part of March. In terms of some of our scheduled areas, breast neurotization, we continue to see increasing demand by patients with strong interest in getting the Resensation technique as a part of their reconstruction, whether they have either an implant based or deep -- a flat-based reconstruction. So we continue to see interest and as we train surgeons and surgical teams, expansion in breast neurotization and growth in that area. In Oral Maxillofacial, we continue to see -- in Oral Maxillofacial and pain are two smaller areas. We continue to see surgeon interest and are seeing procedural growth continuing, where they're doing neurotization in those procedures or managing the pain with the surgical treatment of the nerves. So we saw a good cadence through the quarter in all of those areas and think that, again, we are on a trajectory of continuing to see growth, in particular, in breast as we train more surgeons and get more surgeon teams engaged.\n\nUnidentified Analyst: Yes. Great. That's very helpful. And then just one last one from us. Do you have any further clarity on the gross margin cadence in '24 as you kind of sell through your old inventory from your previous facility?\n\nNir Naor: Yes. So it's -- as we mentioned in the last earnings call, the gross margin in the first half of the year is going to be higher than that in the second half of the year, where the main reason is that the inventory sold in the first half of the year comes from the one produced last year in the previous facility at a bit of a lower cost. Whereas the ones sold in the second half of the year is for, once produced, will be produced at our current facility at a bit of a higher cost. And that said, again, the guidance we reiterated for the entire year of 76% to 79%.\n\nOperator: Thank you. And the next question comes from Ross Osborn with Cantor Fitzgerald.\n\nRoss Osborn: All right. Good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. Starting off in developed [indiscernible] on core channel, which you did touched a bit service mix from ...\n\nHarold Tamayo: Hi. Good morning. So starting off and given a focus on core accounts, would you discuss what the site of service mix looks like for core accounts and your penetration level in hospital outpatient?\n\nKaren Zaderej: Again, it must be our speaker, but we are -- if you could repeat the question. It was hard to hear.\n\nNir Naor: Sure. I was just asking what the site of service mix looks like for your core accounts and then the penetration level and hospital outpatient.\n\nKaren Zaderej: Yes. No, thank you. So our site of care, we -- in our core accounts, we tend to be Level 1, Level 2 or Level 3 trauma centers as the majority, and then some specialty hospitals where you may see it may be driven in that case by a breast center or it might be a military center that does nerve repair. So those are typically the best targets for us as well as, obviously, academic teaching hospitals. There are, however, in our core accounts, some freestanding ambulatory surgery centers. And that really is an artifact of the fact that the threshold is $100,000. That could be one active surgeon who's doing nerve repair. Obviously, if it is a freestanding ambulatory surgery center, it doesn't have the same potential as a large academic center. So when I say our biggest centers are over $1 million today, that's not going to be the ambulatory surgery center. That's going to be a Level 1, Level 2, Level 3, trauma center, hospital or academic center. So our focus, again, is continuing to build those high potential accounts, building out the core accounts and continue to drive that business. Now when I talk about a Level 1 trauma center, that's going to be a mix of inpatient and outpatient procedures. So we do see actually a fair amount of the surgery that's done in trauma is an outpatient procedure. Where that's possible, they're going to try and move that patient through the hospital in under 24 hours and technically be classified as an outpatient procedure. The ambulatory surgery centers are the ones that we have not typically been as focused on. And as I said, we have some, but we've not typically been as focused on that. Having said that, we have done quite a bit of reimbursement work. It's been an economic challenge for ambulatory surgery centers predominantly. We've done a lot of reimbursement work to make sure that there is a new structure where they can economically have it make sense for them to do nerve repair in these freestanding centers. And so under the new coding and payment structure that CMS has set up, it is now economically viable and certainly an attractive overall health care alternative to move these procedures into these ambulatory surgery centers. And we are starting to see some of that migration happen. It has been a migration, not a revolution. But we see -- quarter-over-quarter, we continue to see growth of the procedures that are done in these ambulatory surgery centers, and we do expect for the future that, that will continue.\n\nRoss Osborn: Great. That's very helpful. And then lastly for us. Would you just walk through how your conversations have gone with accounts, sort of Avive Soft Tissue, maybe relative to the year?\n\nKaren Zaderej: Sure. Well, we've done a limited market release, so it's not broadly available. But with some leading surgeons who are very anxious to get this product back into their treatment algorithm, we've provided it upfront. Feedback that we've gotten to date has been extremely positive. Surgeons are very happy to have this alternative for nerve protection. Again, meeting the need where there's a short-term resorbable protection need predominantly in acute trauma, although also sometimes in pain, surgical treatment of pain. And so we are excited to have this as an opportunity to provide them this added solution in their nerve treatment. Surgeon feedback has been very favorable, in fact, more positive. If you remember, we had a product called the Avive that we voluntarily withdrew from the market a number of years ago because of changes the FDA did in regulatory classifications of birth tissue products and ultimately decided that we would withdraw that product. Surgeons liked that product. They like this product better in terms of the handling and the characteristics of the product that they're using intraoperatively. And so we are really pleased to get it out there and excited to get in the hands of all of our sales reps and our customers to be able to use on these patients.\n\nOperator: Thank you. And there are no further questions at this time, so I would like to turn the floor back over to Karen Zaderej for any closing comments.\n\nKaren Zaderej: Well, thank you, Keith. Well, as we wrap up today's earnings call, I want to extend a thank you to our team here at AxoGen for their outstanding work and to everyone who participated on this call for their engagement and input. The commitment of our employees has been crucial in reaching the achievement we've talked about today as we continue to change the lives of patients with peripheral nerve injuries.

As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. Joining us today are Greg Marcus, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Chad Paris, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer of The Marcus Corporation. At this time, I'd like to turn the program over to Mr. Paris for his opening remarks. Please go ahead, sir.\n\nChad Paris: Thanks, Lauren. Good morning, and welcome to our fiscal 2024 first quarter conference call. I need to begin by stating that we plan to make a number of forward-looking statements on our call today, all of which we intend to qualify for the safe harbors from liability established by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act.

We also refer you to the disclosures we provided in today's earnings press release regarding the use of adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP measure used in evaluating our performance and its limitations. A reconciliation of adjusted EBITDA to the nearest GAAP measure is provided in today's release. All right. With that behind us, let's begin. This morning, I'll start by spending a few minutes sharing the results from our first quarter with you and discuss our balance sheet and liquidity. And then I'll turn the call over to Greg, who will focus his prepared remarks on where our businesses are today and what we are seeing ahead. We'll then open up the call for questions. This morning, we reported a quarter in which we expected to face significant headwinds. The first quarter is always a seasonally challenging quarter with slower leisure travel at our Midwestern hotels during the winter months and what is often a lighter movie slate coming out of Hollywood. In addition to the normal seasonality, this year, we knew we would face content supply challenges resulting from the prolonged movie production shutdown during last year's Hollywood strikes. With these challenges in mind, our teams were focused on closely managing our operations and the things that we can control. Our first quarter results were mixed in our two segments. Our hotel division delivered revenue, RevPAR and earnings growth on continued strength in our group business. While our theaters division was negatively impacted by the weaker film slate with significantly lower attendance, we managed expenses well on the lower revenues. I'll start with a few highlights from our consolidated results for the first quarter of fiscal 2024. Consolidated revenues of $138.5 million decreased $13.7 million or 9% compared to the prior year quarter, with revenue growth in our hotels and resorts division offset by the revenue decrease in our theater division. Operating loss for the quarter was $16.7 million, a decline of $7.7 million compared to the prior year quarter. Consolidated adjusted EBITDA for the fourth quarter was $2.3 million, a decrease of $7.2 million over the first quarter of fiscal 2023. Turning to our segment results. I'll start this morning with our hotels and resorts division. Revenues were $57.2 million for the first quarter of fiscal 2024, an increase of 2.5% compared to the prior year. Total revenue before cost reimbursements at our 7 owned hotels increased over $1.7 million or 3.8% over the first quarter of fiscal 2023. RevPAR for our comparable owned hotels grew 2.1% during the first quarter compared to the prior year, which resulted from an overall occupancy rate increase of 2.9 percentage points, partially offset by a 3.4% decrease in our average daily rate, or ADR. Our average fiscal 2024 first quarter occupancy rate for our owned hotels was 53.7%. The decrease in ADR resulted from an increase in our group rooms as a percentage of our overall room mix with growth in midweek group rooms sold, which generally increases occupancy at lower rates. Group rooms increased to 34.5% of our total room mix during the first quarter of fiscal 2024 compared to 28.9% in the prior year quarter. In addition, improved revenue management during slower weeks and midweek nights in the first quarter resulted in growing occupancy and RevPAR at lower daily rate offerings to optimize overall rooms revenue. Our success in growing group business and better revenue management was evident in our performance relative to our peers. According to data received from Smith Travel Research, comparable competitive hotels in our markets experienced effectively flat RevPAR growth of 0.1% for the fiscal first quarter of 2024 compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2023, indicating that our hotels outperformed their competitive set by 2.3 percentage points. When comparing our RevPAR results to comparable upper upscale hotels throughout the United States, the upper upscale segment experienced an increase in RevPAR of 2.0% during our first quarter compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2023, indicating that our hotels performed in line with the industry nationally. With the continued growth in group business and events, our banquet and catering operations continue to grow, with food and beverage revenues up 6.4% in the first quarter of fiscal 2024 compared to the prior year. Finally, hotels adjusted EBITDA increased slightly in the first quarter of fiscal 2024, an improvement of approximately $400,000 compared to the prior year quarter. Turning to theaters. Our first quarter fiscal 2024 total revenue of $81.3 million decreased 15.7% compared to the prior year first quarter. Comparable theater admission revenue decreased 13.8% over the first quarter of 2023, with comparable theater attendance decreasing 17.5%. Our first fiscal quarter began on December 29 and ended on March 28, and thus included three days between the holidays, but excluded the opening weekend of Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire at the end of March. When comparing our results to other exhibitors or industry data sources such as Box Office Mojo for the first quarter, it's important to note that the domestic box office decrease first calendar quarter was approximately 3.3 percentage points better than the domestic box office decrease for the comparable weeks in our first fiscal quarter. When using our comparable fiscal weeks according to data received from Comscore and compiled by us to evaluate our fiscal 2024 first quarter results, US box office receipts decreased 9% during our fiscal 2024 first quarter compared to US box office receipts during our fiscal 2023 first quarter, indicating that our performance lagged the industry by approximately 4.8 percentage points. We believe that our lower box office performance during the first quarter was primarily attributable to two factors, first, the biggest film of the quarter, Dune: Part Two, played exceptionally well on IMAX (NYSE: IMAX ) screens, resulting in IMAX screens taking market share from our UltraScreen and SuperScreen PLF formats in certain markets. While we believe the overall customer experience on our PLF screens with recliner seating, laser projection and Dolby Atmos sound is second to none, the market and promotion approach for this film negatively impacted our PLF market share this quarter. We also believe the IMAX significant outperformance was unique to Dune and its distribution strategy as we saw a return to historical norms for PLF market share on Ghostbusters: Frozen Empire. In addition, we believe this dynamic was amplified in a quarter without many other big films playing on PLFs. And given our high penetration of PLFs across our circuit, we tend to outperform in periods when there is a greater supply of PLF content. Second, the total box office in our top seven markets underperformed the overall decrease in the national box office. We believe this is attributable to an unfavorable film mix that was light on family content and due to the stronger relative performance of Dune in markets where we do not have a presence. Our average admission price increased by 4.9% during the first quarter of fiscal '24 compared to last year. The increase in our admission per caps was primarily due to strategic pricing actions taken during fiscal 2023, which were partially offset by a decrease in the percentage of 3D ticket sales during the first quarter of '24 compared to the first quarter last year, which was favorably impacted by high 3D ticket sales from Avatar: The Way Of Water. Our average concession food and beverage revenues per person at our comparable theaters increased by 0.8% during the first quarter of fiscal 2024 compared to last year's first quarter. The increase was primarily due to inflationary pricing changes implemented during 2023 and was partially offset by a decrease in the number of concession items purchased per customer, which we believe is the result of fewer blockbuster films in the quarter, which tend to result in larger average purchase sizes as customers make a bigger event out of going to see the bigger films. Our top 10 films in the quarter represented approximately 62% of the box office in the first quarter of fiscal 2024 compared to 71% for the top 10 films in the first quarter last year. The less concentrated film slate resulted in an approximately 3 percentage point decrease in overall film cost as a percentage of admission revenues. On the lower revenues, theater division adjusted EBITDA during the first quarter of fiscal 2024 was $6.2 million compared to $13.8 million in the prior year quarter. Given the soft film slate, we closely managed operating hours and labor throughout the quarter. Shifting to cash flow and the balance sheet. Our cash flow from operations was a use of cash of $15.1 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2024 compared to cash used by operations of $7.7 million in the prior year quarter, with the increase in cash used primarily due to the lower EBITDA. As a reminder, our cash flow from operations in the first quarter is historically impacted by seasonal changes in working capital resulting from the slowdown in our businesses following the peak holiday season and by the timing of various year-end accounts payable and compensation payments. Total capital expenditures during the first quarter of fiscal 2024 were $15.4 million compared to $8.9 million in the first quarter of fiscal '23. A large portion of our capital expenditures during the first quarter were invested in renovation projects in the hotel business at The Pfister Hotel and Grand Geneva Resort & Spa, with the balance going to maintenance projects in both businesses. Our capital investments and renovation projects have progressed as planned, and we continue to expect capital expenditures for fiscal 2024 of $60 million to $75 million, recognizing that the timing of several of our planned expenditures are still just estimates at this time. We are still finalizing the scope and timing of various projects and the actual timing of these projects will impact our final capital expenditures number for the year. We will update our capital expenditure estimates as the year progresses. In addition to our capital expenditures, during the first quarter, we also invested approximately $4 million in a joint venture that acquired the Loews Minneapolis Hotel, a 251-room full-service luxury hotel that Greg will discuss further. This investment and our ability to execute on this deal is a great example of the flexibility and strategic advantage that our strong balance sheet and liquidity provide, making us an attractive asset buyer to sellers in allowing us to move quickly when attractive investment opportunities become available. Our balance sheet remains strong, and we ended the first quarter with $17 million in cash and over $237 million in total liquidity with the debt to capitalization ratio of 27% and net leverage of 1.7 times net debt to adjusted EBITDA. With that, I will now turn the call over to Greg.\n\nGreg Marcus: Thanks, Chad. Good morning, everyone. We entered the year with a mixed short-term outlook in our two businesses. In hotels, we saw a continuing trend of strong group bookings, an overall healthy economy with steady travel demand, significant events and demand drivers in our markets and several recently renovated properties in our portfolio with strong positioning in their markets. By contrast, in theaters, we know we would have to navigate a short-term content supply disruption resulting from the shutdown of movie production during the 2023 Hollywood strikes that would likely create challenges for several quarters. As I shared on our last call, January and February got off to a slow start. And while I'm happy to share that March was better, it was still a tough quarter for the movies. We anticipated these short-term challenges in our industry, and we manage the business accordingly. While the comparisons to last year are certainly tough, the overall company first quarter results are actually slightly better than what we expected. We often get asked why we have these two different businesses. And this quarter, along with the last several years, have really illustrated the benefits of our diversified business model that can provide a counterbalance when we encounter periodic bumps in one of our businesses. While the short-term expectations for our theater and hotel divisions are going to differ this year, our long-term outlook for both businesses remains positive and optimistic, and we expect growing momentum in the back half of the year. I'll start today with our hotel and resorts division. You've seen the segment numbers, and Chad shared some additional detail on the performance metrics, including our outperformance to the comp sets and our in-line performance with upper upscale hotels nationally. As we've discussed in past years, there is significant seasonality in our hotel business, given that most of our company-owned hotels are located in the Midwest. We often lose money in this division during the winter months. And in the first quarter of fiscal 2024, we were at breakeven EBITDA, an improvement over our prior year EBITDA loss. There were a few notable trends in the quarter that I would like to highlight. I'll start with what we're seeing with average daily rates. Our average daily rates were down 3.4% in the first quarter compared to the first quarter last year, and the drivers of this are due to three factors; changes in our mix of business, changes in revenue management strategy and some market softening. I'll start with our mix of business. In the first quarter of 2024, group room revenue was over 34% of our overall mix of business compared with 29% of our mix last year. While group business is typically at lower rates and is dilutive to ADR, it allows us to grow midweek occupancy and is accretive to our overall RevPAR. In addition, the strength of our group business provides growth to our banquet and catering business, which grew 6.4% in the first quarter of 2024 compared to the first quarter last year. Secondly, we continue to refine and optimize revenue management. During the first quarter at select hotels, we adjusted our strategy to sell rooms at lower daily rates during low demand periods to drive occupancy and maximize revenue with our available room night capacity. This approach was particularly effective during the winter months when demand is seasonally low, and we were more aggressive on rates this year than we were last year. The net result was successful in growing our occupancy and overall RevPAR. Finally, we did see some general rate softening in the quarter at some of our properties. One quarter does not make a trend and the winter months are typically weak demand to begin with, but we do expect moderating ADR growth rates compared to last year, and we will continue to monitor the trend. RevPAR grew in three of our seven owned hotels with average daily rate growth at two hotels and occupancy growth at four out of seven hotels, resulting in overall RevPAR growth of 2.1%. Group business remains strong, and we're doing a great job capturing our share of group business. We have previously shared with you the strength in our group bookings over the last several quarters, and we're seeing that coming through the results. The bookings continue to look strong with our group room revenue bookings for the remainder of fiscal 2024, or group pace in the year, for the year, running approximately 23% ahead of where we were at this time last year. At approximately 11% of where we were at this time last year, excluding the impact of the upcoming Republican National Convention in Milwaukee this summer. Even more encouraging, our group pace for fiscal 2025 is running over 60% ahead of where we were at this time last year. Banquet and catering pace for the remainder of fiscal '24 and '25 is similarly ahead of where we were at this time last year. Chad mentioned our investments in renovations in our owned hotels this quarter. One benefit of our seasonality and slower winter months is it gives us an opportunity to complete these projects with limited disruption to hotel operations. We continue to make great progress on our renovation projects with most of the updated ballrooms and meeting space at Grand Geneva now back in service and the guest room renovation of the historic tower at The Pfister Hotel on track for completion in June. The updated spacing rooms look great, and our team has done a fantastic job executing these large and complex projects. As our hotel division heads into the busier spring and summer travel months, we are excited by what we see ahead. The investments we are making in our properties puts us in a great position to win in our markets. And of course, the Republican National Convention in July will be great for the entire city of Milwaukee and we're excited to showcase our wonderful community. Last quarter, I shared an update on our growth strategy in hotels and briefly commented on our pending acquisition of the Loews Minneapolis Hotel. Our joint venture closed on the hotel acquisition on March 1, and our team hit the ground running, taking over management of the hotel and executing our repositioning strategy for this property. The luxury lifestyle hotel was rebranded as The Lofton, a Tapestry Collection by Hilton Hotel. It was part of the Hilton reservation system on day 1 of our ownership and management. We will continue to make improvements at the hotel over the next year to create value and turn around what we believe is a property with great potential. Turning to theaters. Chad went over the numbers with you, including our continued increases in per person revenues. The beginning of the first quarter got off to a very different start than what we experienced last year when the industry benefited from strong holds on carryovers, Avatar: The Way of Water and Puss in Boots: The Last Wish. In fact, Avatar was the number one movie for the first 5 weeks of our fiscal 2023. While there were a number of good films in theaters over the holidays to continue to play into the new year, we didn't have a single blockbuster like Avatar that held as long and performed as strong in January this year. In terms of the quantity of wide-release films in the first quarter, we had a similar number of titles with 24 wide releases in the first quarter of fiscal 2024 compared to 23 in the first quarter last year. However, the first quarter slate this year was weaker overall, with lesser performances and fewer blockbuster films with no films in the first quarter opening over $100 million. And with an average opening weekend US box office gross per wide release film that was 25% lower than the same average in the first quarter last year. We believe this was another side effect of last year's Hollywood strikes with bigger titles getting pushed out on the film slate as a result of the moving production shutdown. And smaller films getting wide releases that would have normally been limited releases if the product supply were stronger. There were a few bright spots in the quarter with Dune: Part Two exceeding industry expectations and delivering on its potential, and Bob Marley: One Love surprising with a strong opening and a great run. Chad shared some of the market share dynamics that we believe impacted our market share on Dune with the film significantly outperforming on IMAX screens nationally, which only represents 3 of our 125 premium large-format screens. As Chad discussed, the IMAX performance on this film does appear to be unique to Dune and its distribution strategy as we saw a return to a more typical PLF market share with Ghostbusters: Frozen Empire. Chad also noted that our PLF strategy particularly benefits us when there are multiple significant films in the market at the same time. Our admission per caps were up 4.9% in the first quarter, and we were able to overcome the headwind from the high percentage of 3D tickets on Avatar last year. However, as we look forward, we expect our admission per cap growth rate to flatten as we have passed the 1-year anniversary of the pricing changes to our Value Tuesday promotion that we made in March last year. We will continue to review our regular non-Tuesday ticket prices in our markets to ensure we remain competitive and offer attractive value to all types of customers. This will be increasingly important as we work to incentivize customers to maintain the habit of moviegoing during periods of product gaps in the release calendar. In April, we were with our theater team at CinemaCon, and there were a few things I took away from this year's conference, first and most importantly, our studio partners. Film directors and talent all continue to reaffirm the importance of theatrical exhibition to the overall filmed entertainment ecosystem and our role in elevating their content. Second, we got a closer look at the film slate for the rest of the year and into 2025. And as we move past the supply chain issues from the strikes, there is a lot to be excited about with several great titles this summer and later this year that look really good, and we expect a strong -- a much stronger slate for 2025. The summer movie season kicks off tomorrow with the opening of The Fall Guy and is followed by a number of big titles, including Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes, Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga, Inside Out 2, Horizon: An American Saga, A Quiet Place: Day One, Despicable Me 4, Twisters and Deadpool & Wolverine. This fall, we are excited about Beetlejuice, Joker: Folie a Deux, Saw XI and Venom: The Last Dance. For the holidays, we look forward to Gladiator II, Moana 2, Wicked, The Lord of the Rings: The War of the Rohirrim, Kraven the Hunter, Mufasa and Sonic the Hedgehog 3. We continue to project 95 to 100 wide release films for 2024. As we look to next year, 2025, we'll feature several strong franchises, including Superman, Fast & Furious, Captain America, Mission: Impossible, Jurassic World, Karate Kid, The Fantastic Four, Snow White, Wicked 2 and Avatar 3, just to name a few. We've always taken a long-term view of managing our businesses. And as we look at the product supply ramping back up to and potentially exceeding 2023 levels in 2025, we remain very positive and optimistic about the long-term future for the industry and our theater business. Finally, I'd like to once again express my appreciation for our dedicated associates of The Marcus Corporation. Their outstanding work and commitment to serving our customers is responsible for our success, and we appreciate all that they do every day. They are our most important asset. So on behalf of our Board of Directors and our entire executive team, thank you to all of our associates. And with that, at this time, Chad and I would be happy to open up the call for any questions you may have.\n\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Eric Wold from B. Riley Securities.\n\nEric Wold: A few questions kind of based on some of the comments you made in your pre -- your opening remarks. I guess, one, other than the -- for the theater segment, other than the spending patterns around tickets and mostly concessions that are kind of influenced directly by the film slate. Can you talk about anything you're seeing from your theater customers in terms of their willingness to spend or changing their spending patterns? Any shifts in ticket price, any movements around upgrade, days of the week they visit, basket size, anything that would kind of give you more or less confidence in kind of the health of the consumer as you kind of enter hopefully a strengthened film slate in the coming quarters?\n\nGreg Marcus: It's -- look, it's hard to actually tell -- like, for example, do we know what days of the week they shift into, we don't know necessarily. We're not seeing a lot of -- it's hard to see where they've necessarily shifted from one or the other. We can see a little in our data from our loyalty stuff to see where people are moving. But look, I think the bigger thing that we want to be thoughtful about as we look forward and that is that the movie business tends to be a really -- if there is going to be weakness, and I think the jury is out. But if there's going to be weakness, the movie business tends to benefit from that in that they all saying, six out of the last eight recessions, the movie business got better. And that's -- because we become the most attractively priced out-of-home entertainment option for people. And so for us, we then make sure that our pricing is appropriate to capture that customer who may be feeling some economic stress and being smart about how we do that. But we don't have any -- it's still a little early.\n\nEric Wold: And then, Chad, you talked about, the theater segment -- sticking with the theater segment still, you talked about some of the market share loss around Dune 2, given the strength of IMAX and what IMAX did to kind of really promote and market that film as shot with IMAX cameras and the best way you could see it and all that. Knowing that IMAX's goal over the coming years, and they've got an increased slate of films shot with IMAX cameras that will be coming out later this year and into next year, even if we get a more robust film slate overall that can be playing in your PLF and you've got more versatility there, is there a risk of sustained share shift if that becomes an increasing part of IMAX's strategy and the studio strategy to use IMAX in that way?\n\nChad Paris: I mean, this -- Dune was a pretty unique movie, Eric, in the magnitude of the shift that we saw. And when we look back at films that were similar last year, we didn't see that shift. And then when we look at the other films that would be a good fit for PLFs in the first quarter, which -- that's a limited sample size, we didn't see it at all. In fact, we saw it go back to historical norms. So as I said in my prepared remarks, it really gets amplified when we don't have a lot of PLF content. And we -- as you know, we have such a high penetration of PLFs across our circuit that we do really well when there's more than one big film to show in any given quarter, and we just didn't have that this quarter. So we'll continue to monitor the dynamics here. But they've -- I would just say they've had that strategy with other films last year. Oppenheimer was one that I would point out. And even with Ghostbusters, it was -- it had similar -- shown an IMAX-type promotion, and we didn't see it there. So we'll continue to monitor it, but we feel pretty good about how our PLFs are set up in the customer experience.\n\nEric Wold: And then last question for me. I guess more of a corporate philosophical question. I mean, the stock price is at kind of the lowest level it's been in 10 years, excluding the pandemic hit. I guess, given the optimism you guys have, and I think we all have on the box office recovery path post this strike-impacted year along with your ability to kind of continue to grow the hotel segment. When do buybacks become a better use of cash flow? I know there is some uncertainty around CapEx needs with the hotel segment and one of your properties there. But just thinking about when does that become a better use of capital than maybe something else given what we could see in the coming years from both of your segments?\n\nChad Paris: I guess I'll start with, I think you're right. We certainly have strong conviction and optimism long term on both of these businesses. But we are weighing several things on capital allocation. The $60 million to $75 million of CapEx this year is certainly significant and a big ramp-up in the hotel business, and we've got some other reinvestments to consider as we head into next year also in the hotel business. But it creates a unique opportunity down here at the share price, and we want to clean up the capital structure. So there's a few different ways that you can look at share repurchases, and we've got to convert that is coming due next year that we're going to want to deal with over the course of the next one and half years. So those are all the things that we're thinking through, but we do have an open authorization on share repurchases and opportunistically that's always an option for us.\n\nOperator: Our next question comes from Jim Goss from Barrington Research.\n\nJim Goss: One question on the hotel side with this conversion and purchase in Minneapolis to the Tapestry Collection. I'm not so familiar with that particular brand. I think you mentioned it was a luxury lifestyle hotel. I wonder if you could talk about that in terms of the pricing level and the incremental benefit you think you're going to be able to get out of that particular property?\n\nGreg Marcus: Well, the Tapestry Collection hotel is -- Tapestry Collection, it's Hilton. The goal is to get into the -- on the Hilton reservation system and on the Hilton loyalty program. So that's -- and that's one of their, what they call, soft brand. So it's not -- doesn't have the Hilton -- it's not called the Hilton, but it's Tapestry by Hilton, so it's pretty close. And again, it gets the benefits of being in their system. And we don't discuss specific hotel projections and increases, but trust that we expect that by moving to a stronger system, we expect that, that will drive increased performance.\n\nJim Goss: And One follow-up on the -- to Eric's question about Dune. I was wondering if you feel that particular movie had more of an urban focus. And to the extent that most of the competition you would have with IMAX would be in a smaller subsector of your markets where that would be a conflict. Do you think that's part of the issue, too, that it's just the nature of the film itself relative to your markets?\n\nGreg Marcus: We believe -- and we believe, generally, we've had some -- one of the things contributing this quarter was just a film mix stuff. When you get to the smaller films, they don't play as well in the Midwest. And Dune is not a smaller film. But again, that one had more -- when you get more urban focus, that's not where we shine. And so it's -- you're right, we were facing headwinds from that. And we even saw -- we have an IMAX in a pretty isolated market and its performance was not as robust as some of the other ones. So we have some insight into what's going on with IMAX because we do have a few of them. But it performed really well on IMAX, but it was -- that was one time one analyst wrote something about a tax treatment we got. Asked the question, is it an aberration or a revelation? I'm not sure it's a revelation.\n\nJim Goss: Also, I wanted to ask about the impact of the footprint optimization you've executed over recent years, along with the rest of the industry. I think you've been a little more aggressive than some. And I wonder what sort of headwind do you think that might characterize or you might be able to quantify in terms of the revenues you've been able to generate out of the theaters. Has that been significant, do you think? Maybe this is a Chad question.\n\nChad Paris: just to clarify, when we talk about our growth rates and our comparisons year-over-year, those are same-store numbers. And so I'll start with that. Then generally, in the locations that we've closed, we often have other theaters in the market. And what we're really doing is consolidating customers into other capacity in the market. Now is there -- are there some customers who may not come anymore because the theater that we closed was really close to them and they have to drive another 5 miles to get to our next closest theater. Yes, there's some -- there may be some level of that. But our general view is that our recapture of displaced customers is quite good. So that all goes into our analysis as we think about pruning the portfolio and looking underperforming locations. And our conclusion on the bottom line is that it's accretive to earnings and a bit of a headwind, perhaps top line revenue, but we try to recapture as many of those customers as we can.\n\nGreg Marcus: And generally -- remember, the stuff that we're closing, not exactly robust numbers, that there's not a lot to -- generally, not a lot to capture, to be honest.\n\nJim Goss: And one last one. A number of the companies in your sector have been talking more about alternative content. And I'm just wondering in terms of your particular markets, if there are any particular types of content that you might put on, say, during the week, in particular, that might resonate best with your particular customers.\n\nGreg Marcus: Again, Midwest, the faith based stuff works better with our customers. Some of the retro stuff is, like, we did a Harry Potter series that really performed nicely on our -- with our new passport, to be honest. And we talked about that in a prior call. So it really -- it depends, but that tends to be what does perform better for us. But we've had some -- we're playing more stuff. We're throwing a lot of spaghetti at the wall right now to find out what sticks and stuff will stick and some stuff is sticking.\n\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Mike Hickey from The Benchmark Company.\n\nMike Hickey: Greg, you mentioned maybe some softening on the hotel side tying in to weakness in ADR. You said it wasn't too early to be a trend here. And I get the seasonality piece, but obviously, you're probably adjusting for that. But could you just sort of give us a little bit more insight into what piece of that market is softening and what implications it could have and adjustments you would make if it does become more of a trend?\n\nGreg Marcus: Well, let me be careful. One of the things -- I think that we may have not been -- I mean, I'm not have been as clear. When I say we were -- our -- when we change some strategy, I would potentially say, at least my revenue management people would say to me that maybe we got a little too aggressive with some things last year that we sort of -- we re-strategized and changed our approach on a few places. That's not really reacting to the market so much as who's reacting to what we had done last year and looked back and said, gee, in a low demand period, we probably weren't -- we probably were too aggressive so we altered our strategy and it paid off. And the other thing, as we said in the call -- as we said in the remarks, part of it is a mix issue. If we're going to see a move from transient -- leisure transient to more of a group mix, we are going to sacrifice a little bit of rate, but we're going to also pick up ancillary revenue banquets and catering things like that. So those are trades that we're making that are really strategic, not so much saying that we're seeing a weakness in the customer. But look, if there's a weakness in the customer, we're going to react to what's going on in the market. We're going to watch what's happening. I think historically, we've looked back over time and cutting rates generally does not solve the problem because it doesn't generate more demand, it's just share shift. And one of the things that the industry seemed to be very good about through the pandemic was they didn't just cut rates. And so -- because it ended up being a zero-sum game. And my hope would be if there is a softening, it's not then the response is, well, let's all just cut rates and to try and -- because it won't be -- it won't drive demand. But we'll have to look at what's [Technical Difficulty] to the market.\n\nMike Hickey: So it sounds like the -- I mean, it's a weird quarter, like you said, I mean, a winter in Milwaukee is not maybe the best leisure travel. But that said, is it the leisure piece that was sort of holding and then group was picking up or is it just leisure was down a bit in the quarter? Is that sort of the takeaway?\n\nChad Paris: Mike, I would say, certainly, leisure was down in our overall mix because just of how much more group we were driving into the middle of the week. In terms of demand side, leisure was holding, but if you think about the last couple of years, we've had really strong rate growth, particularly being driven by leisure customers. And those growth rates are sequentially coming down as we kind of normalize here. So I -- our expectation for the year was low single-digit kind of overall RevPAR growth. And it's probably going to come more from a little bit of occupancy than -- this year than it is going to be the ADR that's driving it as it has the last couple of years. But yes, leisure is the pocket that is probably not going to be as strong as it was, not saying that it's weak.\n\nMike Hickey: And then on your gross profit within your concession business, looks like sort of you and your peers that are showing some pressure there, there looks like you're down nearly 6 percentage points in your concession gross profit in the quarter. So just curious if you could sort of dig in there. And if what that means, I guess, is a trend moving forward. And I guess you look at your hotel, food and beverage, and it looks like your margin there is actually holding up really well year-over-year. I think maybe it expanded. So it looks like it's sort of just on your theater concession side where you're feeling some pressure. Just curious with that. Why? And what sort of trend we should extrapolate, if any, from that?\n\nChad Paris: You should not extrapolate a trend from that. In the theater -- the way we report the theater concessions numbers, we did make some immaterial changes on how we classify some of those expenses in other areas of the P&L and just line them up better with how we think they should be reported. And again, immaterial, but that's really all that's driving the change. It's not an underlying change in the profitability of our concessions business.\n\nGreg Marcus: And by the way, on the hotel side, you get a mixed [FYI], that's the benefit of a mix shift, too, because the leisure customer is eating in our outlets. When you get to more of a group mix, you're getting more in the banquets and catering business, which is just a more profitable food and beverage operation.\n\nMike Hickey: Just to confirm, the -- your gross profit margin in concessions in 1Q is 57%. That's down from 63% prior year, and your average margin prior year was 61.5%. So should we model that closer to the 57% moving forward given the category shift here? Or is that going to go back up to above 60%?\n\nChad Paris: You can model it at the 57% because that's where it will continue to come through going forward. But there is an offset in other operating expenses that will run rate at a lower number.\n\nMike Hickey: But it should be about the net neutral then you're saying or is there a discretionary pressure on...\n\nChad Paris: Exactly, net neutral on total profitability...\n\nMike Hickey: Last question, just on your convertible note, you have some time to deal with that, but just curious the scenarios you're thinking through. And how you think about managing the potential dilution from that note?\n\nChad Paris: So you're right. We do have some time, one and half years until we really have to move on this. Although, on dilution, I don't think people should be really worried about it because we've got a cap call transaction -- a derivative over the convert that mitigates the dilution below [17.75], I think is where it is currently. That number changes a little bit as we pay dividends. But at the current share price, investors should not be expecting dilution from that. And I think we'll continue to look at what's the right time to take it out, Mike, but it will -- high level thinking on it is it will be cash rather than shares in terms of how we settle this.\n\nOperator: Thank you. At this time, it appears there are no other questions. So I'd like to turn the call back to Mr. Paris for any additional or closing remarks.\n\nChad Paris: Great. Thanks, Lauren. We'd like to thank everybody for joining us again today, and we look forward to talking to you once again in early August when we release our second quarter results. Until then, thank you, and have a great day.\n\nOperator: That concludes today's call.

All participants will be in a listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] After today's presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions [Operator Instructions]. Please note this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Kelly Harvey, Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nKelly Harvey: Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us to discuss our first quarter 2024 results. The release and accompanying presentation was filed with the SEC and is posted on our website at stoneridge.com in the Investors Section under Presentations and Events. Joining me on today's call are Jim Zizelman, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Matt Horvath, our Chief Financial Officer. During today's call, we will be referring to certain non-GAAP financial measures. Please see the appendix for a reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures. In addition, I need to inform you that certain statements today may be forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements include statements that are not historical in nature and include information concerning our future results or plans. Although, we believe such statements are based upon reasonable assumptions, you should understand that these statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, and actual results may differ materially. Additional information about such factors and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ may be found in our 10-Q, which was filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission yesterday under the heading forward-looking Statements. After Jim and Matt have finished their formal remarks, we will then open up the call to questions. And with that, I will hand it over to Jim.\n\nJames Zizelman: Thank you, and good morning, everyone. Beginning on Page 3. Our first quarter financial performance was driven by continued strong topline growth in Electronics and progression across each of our key priorities for 2024. Our efforts to reduce material costs and improve our operating efficiency contributed to a 170 basis point improvement in gross margin, a 160 basis point improvement in operating margin and a 120 basis point improvement to EBITDA margin over the first quarter of last year. Additionally, we remain focused on cash performance and improvement in our leverage ratio. During the quarter, we generated $9.1 million of operating cash, an improvement of $18.3 million compared to the first quarter of last year. This is due in part to our continued efforts to reduce our inventory balance, which declined by $7.9 million. As a result, our leverage ratio improved by approximately a quarter of a turn relative to the end of 2023. Despite the significant momentum we have and the fundamentals of the business, we must continue to focus on mitigating some of the historical execution issues that resulted in $2 million of incremental warranty-related costs this quarter. Through recent actions taken to centralize and redesign product line and program management organizations, as well as our global engineering organization, we are specifically focused on improving built-in quality, reducing material costs and improving manufacturing efficiency to drive profitability. There is no question. We are seeing the positive impact of these structural changes and expect the momentum from these changes to drive improved profitability as we continue to grow. In fact, as a result of the improvement, we expect due to these changes, despite some of the challenges in the first quarter, we are maintaining our full-year 2024 guidance. Matt will provide further detail on our first quarter performance and our full-year guidance later in the call. While we continue to improve our existing programs, we remain focused on flawless execution of the program launches that will drive strong growth going forward. Our next MirrorEye OEM programs launched with Volvo in Europe and with Peterbilt in North America later this year, followed by two additional programs in North America in the first quarter of next year. Last week, Peterbilt announced the introduction of its new Digital Vision System-Mirrors as an option on both the Model 579 and Model 567 trucks, which helped improve driver safety and improve fuel economy by up to 1.5%. We will continue to work with all of our OEM customers, their dealer networks and the fleets to drive MirrorEye adoption. We are seeing good momentum across our MirrorEye end markets and applications and expect continued growth as we launch new OEM programs, increased take rates for existing OEM programs and continue to expand our fleet activities with both new and existing customers. Furthermore, we expect our next-generation tachograph, the Smart 2 to provide significant growth in both OEM and aftermarket applications over the next several years based on the requirements of the EU Mobility Package standard. I will provide more details of these regulation requirements and our expectations for our Smart 2 tachograph program later in the call. Page 4 summarizes our key financial metrics for the first quarter of this year compared to the first quarter of 2023. First quarter sales growth of 3% was driven by strong topline growth in our Electronics segment due in part to the ramp-up of the recently launched Smart 2 tachograph program in Europe. This was offset by lower sales in the North American passenger vehicle end market, primarily due to the slowing demand for electric vehicles as well as some end-of-life programs which we expected. Our growth of 3% compares to an approximately flat weighted average end market over the same time. We expect to continue to outperform our underlying end markets driven by new launches and the continued ramp-up of recently launched programs. Driven by continued progression on key company initiatives, margins continued to expand in the first quarter compared to last year. Material cost improvement actions and our focus on manufacturing efficiency contributed to the 170 basis point improvement in gross margin over the first quarter of last year. We will continue to implement material cost improvement opportunities to further enhance the impact of actions already taken. Operating margin improved by 160 basis points over the first quarter of last year due to our continued focus on a lean, efficient operating structure, including the centralization of certain functions to create more streamlined processes and reduced operating costs. Earlier this week, we continue to take action to improve our engineering organization by rebalancing our footprint to improve our capacity and our capabilities and reduce our total costs. Finally, EBITDA margin improved by 120 basis points compared to the first quarter of last year. This was despite non-operating foreign currency and equity interest expenses that unfavorably impacted the current quarter by approximately $2.3 million. Excluding the incremental warranty and non-operating expenses in the quarter, EBITDA would have been approximately $10.9 million or 4.6% of revenue. And Matt will provide additional details on our segment level performance later in the call. Turning to Page 5. This morning, I would like to provide an update on our Smart 2 tachograph program that continues to ramp up in Europe on both OEM and aftermarket applications. As discussed on prior calls, the Smart 2 tachograph is our next-generation tachograph that provides incremental capabilities to conform with the EU Mobility Package standards. The mobility package is a collection of European laws and regulations for the transport sector and then contains new rules to improve social conditions for drivers, increased road safety and provide equal access to European markets. As such, the regulation requires the adoption of the second-generation tachograph, Smart 2, on various vehicle types over the next several years. Beginning in mid-August of last year, the second-generation smart tachograph was required to be on all newly registered vehicles over 3.5 tons, which comprises our existing OEM market. In addition, before the end of 2024, all international transport vehicles with existing analog or 1B digital tachographs are required to retrofit their vehicles to this new technology, which is the basis for what drives our aftermarket opportunity this year. As a result of these requirements, the incremental content on next-generation product and our current estimates of addressable market, we are estimating Smart 2 tachograph revenue to be approximately $60 million in 2024 for both OEM and aftermarket applications. As this product is based on both OEM orders and aftermarket customer adoption, the timing of the revenue contribution is more variable than what is typical for purely OEM programs. As a result, we saw a slower ramp-up in aftermarket sales in the first quarter as end users hoped for a pushout of the regulatory requirements or are simply delaying adoption until closer to the deadline. Recently, the European Commission, which governs the adoption of the mobility package reiterated the existing deadlines and requirements. As such, we are expecting an uptick in aftermarket sales going forward as the addressable market this year has not changed and the regulations remain as previously communicated. This should provide both revenue growth and accretive margin benefit for the remainder of the year as our aftermarket channel continues to ramp up. Looking beyond 2024, there are incremental regulations requiring adoption on additional vehicles in Europe, which is expected to drive continued growth for the next few years. These incremental requirements come online in 2025 and 2026 and expand the requirements to more vehicles, including vehicles equipped with first-generation tachographs and smaller vehicles between 2.5 and 3.5 tons that are involved in international transport. Overall, the mobility package and the new Smart 2 tachograph legislation represent a significant step forward for the transportation industry in Europe. By increasing road safety, improving working conditions and ensuring fair competition, the EU is creating a more sustainable and efficient transport sector for the future, and Stoneridge is very excited to be part of it. Based on the regulatory requirements and the competitive landscape for this product, we expect significant growth over the next several years with at least a 30% market share and $100 million in peak annual revenue. This program is yet another example of our strong portfolio of technologies and vehicle systems aligned with global industry megatrends. As part of our long-term strategy, we remain focused on vehicle intelligence and connectivity as we expand our content per vehicle to drive continued long-term growth. Turning to Page 6. I'd like to take this opportunity to mention that I'm extremely proud that we recently released our inaugural Sustainability Report, detailing our latest efforts and our ongoing commitment to environmental, social and governance initiatives. Our commitment to sustainability and social responsibility is a core component of our business strategy. This begins with our well-positioned technology-forward product portfolio aligned with improving vehicle safety and efficiency as well as reducing greenhouse gas emissions. At Stoneridge, we strive for continual improvements in our operations that deliver a lasting impact on the environment and our society, benefiting our employees, our customers and the communities that we serve. Through our continued efforts, we have made meaningful progress towards our sustainability goals, including reducing our Scope 1 and Scope 2 greenhouse gas emissions by 18.6%, reducing our absolute water withdrawal by 5.8%, creating a safe workspace environment and minimizing our environmental footprint in our manufacturing facilities over time. Our Sustainability Report marks a significant step in Stoneridge's sustainability journey and reflects our dedication to transparency, accountability and continuous improvement. I would like to express my gratitude to the Stoneridge team for their efforts and contributions in this space and on publishing such a meaningful report. I encourage all of you to visit our sustainability website if you have not done so already. Turning to Page 7. We remain committed to the 2024 goals I outlined on our fourth quarter call. First, we are focused on driving continued growth and market outperformance. As discussed earlier on the call, we are maintaining our 2024 revenue guidance midpoint of $1 billion, which is expected to outperform our weighted average underlying end markets by 8 percentage points. As discussed earlier on the call, we outperformed our weighted average OEM end markets in the first quarter and expect this to continue driven primarily by Stoneridge specific growth drivers, including new programs, incremental content and the expansion of our existing opportunities. Second, we are focused on gross margin expansion through material cost improvement in an enterprise-wide operational excellence. We remain keenly focused on these initiatives as we achieved gross margin expansion of 170 basis points over the first quarter of 2023. As we continue to focus on quality-related costs and recognize the run rate benefits of these material costs and operational actions, we expect continued gross margin expansion. Third, we are focused on leveraging our global footprint to maximize our capabilities and output. Based on the actions taken last year to centralize many of our global functions and drive synergies between our business units from both a cost and efficiency perspective, we achieved 160 basis points of operating margin expansion in the first quarter, resulting in a 120 basis point improvement in EBITDA margin compared to the prior year. We continue to evaluate and optimize our organizational structure as shown by our recent actions taken in our engineering organization to rebalance our global footprint. Fourth, we are focused on efficient cash generation through effective inventory management. Through our focused efforts on reducing inventory to improve working capital and generate more cash, we reduced our inventory balance by $7.9 million, which translates to approximately an 8% improvement in inventory turns during the quarter. We remain focused on inventory reduction and cash performance. Finally, we are focused on efficient capital deployment, while maintaining an appropriate capital structure. This includes prioritizing our organic investment opportunities with a focus on return on engineering and investing in technology to develop new products for customers that will facilitate future growth. In 2024, we are targeting approximately $40 million of capital focused primarily on supporting organic growth initiatives. We remain on track to meet both our organic growth and capital expenditure targets for 2024. As evidenced by our progress made so far this year, this team is focused on executing against our priorities to drive strong growth, continued margin improvement and an improved balance sheet. We continue to see the benefits of the actions we took in 2023, and we'll continue to take actions aligned with our key priorities to drive performance. With that, I'll turn it over to Matt to discuss our financial results in more detail. Matt?\n\nMatthew Horvath: Thank you, Jim. Turning to Page 9. Sales in the first quarter were $239.2 million, an increase of 3% relative to the first quarter of 2023. Adjusted operating income was $300,000, which resulted in a 160 basis point improvement in operating margin relative to the first quarter of last year. As Jim discussed earlier in the call, we are maintaining our full-year 2024 guidance. Our full-year sales guidance midpoint of $1 billion is expected to outpace our weighted average OEM end markets by over 8 percentage points. We expect to outperform our end markets driven by the continued ramp-up of recently launched programs, including both the OEM and aftermarket applications of MirrorEye and the Smart 2 tachograph. We expect an improvement in our material costs for the remainder of the year will offset the incremental warranty costs we incurred in the first quarter. As such, we are maintaining our full-year gross margin expectations with a gross margin midpoint of 22.4%, which implies a 140 basis point expansion versus the prior year. Based on our efforts to drive a more efficient global operating structure, we expect that operating performance will remain within our previously provided range, but improved slightly relative to our prior expectations. As such, we are maintaining our full-year operating margin expectations with an operating margin midpoint of 3%, which implies a 130 basis point expansion versus last year. Similarly, we expect slightly improved operating performance to offset the non-operating foreign currency and equity interest expenses incurred in the first quarter. As a result, we are also maintaining our expectations for full-year EBITDA and EPS. Our expectation of approximately $67 million of EBITDA at the midpoint of our guidance range results in a 170 basis point improvement and 39% growth in EBITDA over 2023. We expect the revenue and EBITDA cadence for the year to be relatively consistent with previous expectations. However, we now expect the second quarter performance will be slightly better than previously expected to approximately breakeven EPS. Due to expanding MirrorEye sales in the second half of the year, primarily driven by new program launches and the continued ramp-up of the Smart 2 tachograph, we continue to expect revenue to be back half weighted. We expect slight growth from the first to the second quarter and relatively larger growth between the second and third quarter, aligned with these key program launches. Aligned with our revenue cadence for the year, we expect EBITDA to be more back half weighted as well. Based on the actions we have taken to improve our cost structure and our operating performance, we expect to continue to significantly outperform our underlying end markets and drive continued earnings expansion as the year progresses. Turning to Page 10. During the quarter, we were impacted by two warranty issues that accounted for approximately $2 million of incremental costs. Although, these issues are historical in nature, and we expect they have been contained through either reengineering or resourcing material, these incremental costs highlight the importance of our focus on execution to drive operational excellence and built-in quality going forward. We have taken actions that we expect to improve the operating structure and processes that have led to these issues historically, which resulted in the incremental warranty costs during the quarter. The quarter was also unfavorably impacted by approximately $2 million related to the non-operating impact that foreign currency had on intercompany balances and approximately $300,000 related to our minority interest in Autotech Ventures. Excluding the incremental warranty and non-operating expenses in the quarter, EBITDA would have been approximately $10.9 million or 4.6% of revenue. The first quarter was also impacted by unfavorable sales volume and product mix, primarily related to the reduced demand for electric vehicles compared to prior expectations and the retiming of Smart 2 tachograph aftermarket sales, as Jim discussed previously. However, these headwinds were generally offset by material cost improvement actions completed in the first quarter, primarily related to supplier negotiations and pricing and reduced operating expenses as a result of the actions taken in 2023 to centralize functions and reduce costs. In addition, EPS was impacted by slightly higher tax expense during the quarter, primarily due to our geographical mix of earnings. Despite the headwinds we faced in the first quarter, we continued to improve the foundation of the business and take actions that will drive run rate performance improvement going forward, helping us achieve our previously provided guidance. Page 11 summarizes our key financial metrics specific to Control Devices. Control Devices first quarter sales declined by approximately $8.7 million versus the first quarter of 2023, primarily related to the expected wind down of end-of-life programs and slower demand for electric vehicle platforms. This was slightly offset by higher sales in China. First quarter operating margin of 2.8% increased by 120 basis points compared to the first quarter of 2023, primarily as a result of favorable product mix and improvements in material and logistics costs. We continue to expect relatively flat end market performance and slow growth in actuation programs due to the continued slow ramp-up of electric vehicle platforms. As a result, we continue to expect Control Devices full-year sales to slightly decline this year relative to 2023. That said, and as demonstrated in the first quarter, we have identified several opportunities to reduce material costs through redesigns or supply chain strategies to help improve gross margin going forward and offset the slight decline in sales, resulting in a stable margin profile. Finally, as discussed on previous earnings calls, we remain focused on drivetrain agnostic technologies to drive new business awards as the market continues to evolve. We continue to focus on operational excellence and enterprise-wide cost reduction, including material cost reduction plans to drive margin improvement going forward. Page 12 summarizes our key financial metrics specific to Electronics. Electronics first quarter sales increased by $15.6 million or 11.1% compared to the first quarter of 2023. Sales growth was driven primarily by higher sales in both the European and North American commercial vehicle end markets, due in part to the ramp-up of the Smart 2 tachograph programs in Europe. We expect continued strong sales growth in 2024, driven by new program launches and the ramp-up of recently launched programs. Our next MirrorEye OEM programs launched with Volvo in Europe and with Peterbilt in North America later this year. Similarly, we expect significant growth related to the Smart 2 tachograph as regulatory requirements force adoption, both in OEM applications as well as in the aftermarket. First quarter operating margin expanded by approximately 330 basis points compared to the first quarter of the prior year, primarily due to contribution on incremental revenue and material cost improvement, partially offset by higher overhead costs. More specifically, $1.5 million of the $2 million of total incremental warranty-related costs impacted Electronics during the quarter. Looking forward, we expect continued margin expansion as we focus on improving our manufacturing performance and focus on quality-driven processes and efficient execution of new program launches as well as the continued ramp-up of existing programs. Electronics remains well positioned to take advantage of significant future growth and margin expansion as a result of a strong product portfolio, a substantial and growing backlog of awarded programs, continued improvement in material cost and cost structure and organizational optimization. Page 13 summarizes our key financial metrics, specific to Stoneridge Brazil. Stoneridge Brazil's first quarter sales totaled approximately $12.2 million, a decrease of $2 million relative to the first quarter of last year. This decrease was primarily as a result of two onetime revenue opportunities in the local OEM market totaling approximately $2.1 million in 2023 that were not expected to recur this year. First quarter operating profit declined by approximately $1.1 million relative to the first quarter of 2023, primarily driven by reduced fixed cost leverage on decreased sales. This decrease was partially offset by lower material costs as a result of favorable sales mix. We expect relatively stable revenue and operating margin in 2024 as we continue to shift our portfolio in Brazil to more closely align with our global growth initiatives and further expand our local OEM programs to support our global customers. Brazil has become a critical engineering center as we continue to align our global engineering capabilities and footprint. We will continue to utilize our global footprint to cost-effectively support our global business. Turning to Page 14. Net debt to trailing 12-month EBITDA, as calculated for compliance purposes, improved by quarter of a turn, resulting in a leverage ratio of approximately 2.86x. During the quarter, we generated $9.1 million of operating cash, an improvement of $18.3 million compared to the first quarter of last year. This is due in part to our continued efforts to reduce our inventory balance, which declined by $7.9 million in the quarter. We are focused on reducing net working capital to improve cash performance and reduce net debt and related interest expense. Based on our 2024 guidance and net working capital initiatives, we expect a compliance leverage ratio between 2x and 2.5x by the end of the year as both our earnings and inventory balance are expected to continue to improve. We are focused on maximizing cash performance to drive value to shareholders. Moving to Slide 15. In summary, our first quarter performance was driven by strong topline growth and progression across each of our key priorities for 2024. Our strategy sets us up for strong short-term and long-term performance through Stoneridge-specific growth drivers, including new programs, incremental content and expansion of our existing opportunities. We will continue to focus on enterprise-wide cost improvement and operational execution to drive strong contribution margin and focus on inventory reduction to improve our cash position and continue to reduce our leverage profile. Stoneridge remains well positioned to outpace our underlying end market growth and drive significant earnings expansion going forward. As always, driving shareholder value is at the forefront of all of Stoneridge's strategic initiatives. With that, I will open up the call for questions.\n\nOperator: We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Justin Long with Stephens. Please go ahead.\n\nJustin Long: So maybe to start, Matt, you gave some color on 2Q expectations for revenue and EPS. But I was wondering if you could provide a little bit more color around the EBITDA cadence. You mentioned it being more back half weighted. But as we move into the second quarter, would you expect EBITDA to improve relative to the $11 million number you talked about in the first quarter, if you exclude some of the non-operational items and maybe you could just talk about your visibility to that forecast as well.\n\nMatthew Horvath: Yes. Thanks for the question, Justin. So yes, we would expect it to improve from there. As we had said in the first quarter - on our prior call, we had previously expected kind of relatively flat performance between the first and second quarter. We now expect that to be improved. Even off of the adjusted number that you mentioned, really due to the base operating performance improvement that we expect not only in the second quarter but also for the remainder of the year. So yes, we would expect the second quarter to be improved. And then if you look forward, we would expect continued improvement. Certainly, as we launch the incremental programs, particularly the large MirrorEye programs in the back half of the year, particularly as the tachograph aftermarket continues to ramp up, that's generally at a pretty accretive margin on the aftermarket sales. So we have good visibility to improvement because of its fundamental base improvement in the business that we've already seen in the first quarter. And that would only be duplicative on the incremental revenue that we expect in the second half. So we do expect improvement in the second quarter, and we would expect that to continue on pretty strongly in the second half with the launch of those programs.\n\nJames Zizelman: And Matt, I'd add to that. When you think about all the work that we've been doing to drive excellence in execution and drive efficiencies within Stoneridge. And we've talked very specifically about some of those actions even today. Those things clearly had an impact on the first quarter. A lot of the performance that you are seeing are reflective in the numbers that we're seeing here relative to gross margin expansion and cash generation, et cetera. That stuff also becomes duplicative, right? As you start taking that into the second, third and fourth quarter and beyond, right, those things actually will begin to add more and more to the financial performance of Stoneridge. So I am very, very confident that we're going to have the right pathway here going forward.\n\nJustin Long: That's really helpful. And maybe to follow-up on some of the things you just mentioned, Jim, it sounds like first quarter was a messy quarter, lots of puts and takes, but there was some improvement in the underlying kind of operational performance that's maybe a little hard to see just looking at the headlines. So as we think about the full-year guidance, two things you mentioned were material cost tailwinds and pricing tailwinds. Is there a way to kind of quantify how meaningful those tailwinds could be or speak in a little bit more detail about some of the operational improvements and what that could translate to in terms of the bottom line?\n\nMatthew Horvath: Yes. So Justin, first on just kind of the quantification of that. We always talk about contribution margin as a good way to understand how much operational performance we're getting out of the business, right? Our typical contribution margin is 25% to 30% on incremental revenue. If you look at the first quarter, quarter-over-quarter, even including those incremental warranty issues, we had 50% contribution margin on $7 million of revenue growth, right? Excluding those warrant issues, we were like 80% contribution margin quarter-over-quarter. So that is an indication that the business is significantly improving at a fundamental level. And that's really driven by, like we said, those material cost improvements. Again, if you exclude that warranty issue, which we wouldn't expect to recur forward, gross margin would have been over 21% in the first quarter, okay? So fundamentally, material costs and the actions that we've taken on the operating side to centralize functions, get more out of the resources that we have, but also reduce cost at the same time, you're seeing that benefit quarter-over-quarter certainly, and we would expect that to carry forward. When you add the revenue growth to that, that contribution margin can get really accretive to the earnings power of the business in the second half of the year.\n\nJustin Long: Okay. Got it. And I guess the last one for me is on two of the big revenue drivers this year. You've got the Smart 2 tachograph and you've got MirrorEye. I guess on Smart 2, any color you can give us on the revenue cadence or ramp you're now expecting within the guidance? And then I'm just curious if there's been any change to your forecast for MirrorEye. I think you've talked about that being $100 million of revenue this year, but I just wanted to confirm that, that was still your expectation?\n\nMatthew Horvath: Yes, Justin. So I'll take the easy one of those two first. MirrorEye, yes, no change in expectation for the remainder of the year. We're seeing good progress with the OEs as we march towards those launches, particularly the very large launch with Volvo in the second half of the year...\n\nJames Zizelman: And on track on those launches.\n\nMatthew Horvath: Yes. That's right. And then - yes, so no change in the expectation for MirrorEye. The tachograph business, there's kind of two responses here. One, we haven't seen any change in the addressable market. And like Jim laid out in the prepared remarks, the market is timed such that this year has the first step in that adoption cycle. So within the year, we don't see any expectation of change relative to our prior expectations. Obviously, we talked about the first quarter being a little lighter from an aftermarket perspective, because just the law of the numbers, because the market hasn't changed and the first quarter was a little lighter, we obviously expect the second quarter and forward to be more than previously expected. And again, that aftermarket product generally has an accretive margin relative to overall margins. So it's also a little bit harder to time out that aftermarket adoption. Relative to an OEM program where you've got production volume and forecast, even if they fluctuate a little bit, there's a pretty structured cadence around that volume. The aftermarket - we have some ability to do things on the pricing side, with our distributors, their customers, et cetera, to push or pull adoption. But ultimately, there's a little bit more volatility and there will always be a little more volatility in the aftermarket. So in the short-term quarter-to-quarter, it's a little bit more volatile. But for the year, nothing has changed, which just means the second half of the year will be even stronger than we expected previously.\n\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Gary Prestopino with Barrington Research. Please go ahead.\n\nGary Prestopino: I kind of jumped on the call a little bit late and just kind of assimilating what you were saying on the tachograph, Jim. Was there - there were some issues with the fact that there wasn't as much on the adoption side in the quarter as you expected? Or - and could you just very simply just go through that again, please?\n\nJames Zizelman: Yes. So first off, Gary, we'll break it into two sections as well. On the OEM side, it's being adopted as expected. It's required for new vehicles being sold. If they're going to be registered for international transport, they have to have the next-generation tachograph. So the OEs are selecting this and they're 100% in line with the volume of vehicles that they're building. The variability, probably what you picked up was variability, and that's really coming from the aftermarket. As you know, trucks at 3.5 tons are higher have to be retrofit if they have the former analog or 1B digital tachographs in place. And just like anybody, if you have a deadline to get something finished or completed, oftentimes, people will push the compliance with that deadline to the deadline itself. And so it was a little slower here at the beginning as people were first required to make the change, but they do have to the end of 2024 to get it done. And so like Matt says, that regulation hasn't changed. The timing and the compliance date hasn't changed. The addressable market is already out there. These are existing vehicles. So we're expecting to see an uptick really in the sales into the aftermarket because it was a bit lighter in the first quarter.\n\nMatthew Horvath: Yes. And I would add to that, as Jim mentioned in the prepared remarks here, the European Commission, which governs this regulation has reiterated those deadlines and requirements.\n\nJames Zizelman: Yes.\n\nMatthew Horvath: So not only do we understand the addressable market and expect the second half to pick up. It's very clear from the regulatory agencies that that's the expectation of folks as well. So we feel pretty comfortable that we understand the addressable market. And because the first quarter was a little bit lighter, that just suggests there's more to come here in the second half or second quarter forward.\n\nGary Prestopino: Yes, yes. No, that's fine. I just wanted to clarify that. And in terms of the peak revenue, I mean, what year do you actually hit that? Is that somewhere in the 2026? Or does this keep going on? And I guess, I'm trying to get an idea of what is the actual size of the market and units? I know I realize it's all for international transport only, but when is that peak number hit?\n\nMatthew Horvath: Yes. So Gary, because the adoption started late last year, you obviously see a ramp-up this year. We really would expect to kind of hit those peak numbers in 2025, 2026. And then naturally, of course, you'll see a more stabilized number, there forward as the retrofits are completed and the OEM market remains strong. So we talked about market share a little bit on the slide there that at our peak annual revenue, we estimate we would have about 30% market share. Obviously, because that's an aftermarket product and not an OEM award, there is opportunity to improve that as we go forward, and we're working on that. But that gives you some idea of kind of the total addressable market for our product as these regulations roll through.\n\nGary Prestopino: So by July 2026, all vehicles above 2.5 tons we'll have to have this, whether they're retrofitted or OEM. And then once that happens, you start going - after you hit peak revenue, then it just basically becomes an OEM driven product. Is that the way to look at...\n\nMatthew Horvath: An OEM product with some service requirements as well going forward. Yes.\n\nGary Prestopino: Okay. All right. So next question revolves around the quarter. First of all, is your guidance for this year pegged off using a $6.6 million EBITDA number or an adjusted number of $10.9 million?\n\nMatthew Horvath: Gary, to be clear, the guidance includes those issues in the first quarter. So it's the $6.6 million number is what our guidance is based off of.\n\nGary Prestopino: Okay.\n\nMatthew Horvath: But because those things, one, are obviously non-operating on the FX side. And two, not expected to recur on the warranty side, we wanted to provide a kind of an estimate of what you should expect from a run rate forward in the true performance of the business. So the guidance includes the $6.6 million, but the performance of the business, obviously, was much, much better than that. We wanted to outline that in the remarks.\n\nGary Prestopino: So you can say with some certainty that there's not going to be any more warranty expense going forward?\n\nMatthew Horvath: So Gary, here's what I would say. There's never certainty - yes, there's never certainty that you can say that there won't be any more warranty expense going forward. As you would imagine, we have a typical warranty accrual on every product, right? These were two specific items in the quarter that we would not expect to recur going forward.\n\nGary Prestopino: Okay. And then just lastly, as I read back on my notes, I think you had said that you had expected Q1 adjusted EBITDA to be less than that of Q4, which was $15.6 million. As far as the quarter goes, the sales were better than we expected, but obviously, the adjusted EBITDA wasn't. But you didn't really give specific guidance for Q1. I mean, when you factor out these nonrecurring items, did the quarter come in about where you thought it was going to be on an adjusted EBITDA basis?\n\nMatthew Horvath: Yes. Generally, Gary. We did talk a little bit about the mix of tachograph in the aftermarket business. Like we said, that aftermarket business does have an accretive benefit to margin. So I would say that was the only thing outside of the normal - or I'm sorry, the things we called out between the warranty and the non-operating impacts. But generally speaking, the quarter would have been in line with our expectations, had it had not been for those unusual items or non-recurring non-operating items.\n\nGary Prestopino: Okay. And then just in general, when you start these new programs that are going to roll out well, the growth in the tachograph and then obviously, MirrorEye going from, what, $155 million to $100 million and $60 million of tachograph...\n\nMatthew Horvath: Yes.\n\nGary Prestopino: Those margins, especially on MirrorEye, as you go into 2025, those programs that you're rolling out, should those margins really start seeing really good improvement as you start scaling that business?\n\nMatthew Horvath: Yes, Gary, a couple of things to that. One, as with any program, as you approach more stable or peak annual revenue, the margin will be - will improve, right? The incremental volume, obviously, the margin will improve. And typically, there's a ramp-up of any program - any normal program, not just those two. Separately, like we said, the aftermarket tachograph product has an accretive margin profile. But also as we've talked about for quite a while now, incremental take rate to MirrorEye can be extremely accretive from a contribution margin, right? We - as everyone knows, we have spent the engineering and structured the organization for the amount of growth that we expect from these MirrorEye programs, right? So as they ramp up, not only will the typical program to kind of quoted volume improve margin, but we've always said we think that there's upside to that as adoption improves and take rate improves, and that can be very accretive as well.\n\nOperator: This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Jim Zizelman for any closing remarks.\n\nJames Zizelman: Thank you. Thanks, everyone, for joining us for the call this morning. I know your time is very important, and we truly appreciate your willingness to engage us today. As we discussed earlier on the call, we are delivering on the key priorities we outlined for 2024 and expect our efforts to continue to drive long-term profitable revenue growth and significant earnings expansion going forward. We will continue to deliver on our commitments by focusing on our long-term strategy, our broad operational improvements and excellence in execution. We expect that our performance, along with our unique mix of industry-changing product platforms will continue to drive stronger shareholder value. Thanks again, everyone.\n\nOperator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Jay Pfeiffer, Investor Relations. Thank you, Jay. You may begin.\n\nJay Pfeiffer: Good morning and welcome to the Where Food Comes From 2024 first quarter earnings call. Joining me on the call today are CEO John Saunders, President Leann Saunders, and Chief Financial Officer Danette Henning. During this call, we'll make forward-looking statements based on current expectations, estimates, and projections that are subject to risk. Statements about current and future financial performance, growth strategy, customers, business opportunities, market acceptance of our products and services, and potential acquisitions are forward-looking statements. Listeners should not place undue reliance on these statements as there are many factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from our forward-looking statements. We encourage you to review our publicly filed documents as well as our news releases and website for more information. Today, we'll also discuss adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP financial measure provided to complement the GAAP results. Please refer to today's earnings release for important disclosures regarding non-GAAP measures. I'll now turn the call over to John Saunders.\n\nJohn Saunders: Good morning and thanks for joining the call today. This morning, we released our first quarter financial results and we're pleased to report that the renewed momentum we generated in the fourth quarter has carried into 2024. Once again, our core verification services revenue more than offset lower product sales resulting for persistent headwinds in our beef business due to cyclical cattle trends, lingering drought effects, and smaller herd sizes. As we've said before, these headwinds are likely to persist to some extent throughout 2024, but we're hopeful to see improvements starting early next year. The solid growth and verification services coupled with careful management of our cost structure also led to improved profitability year-over-year. Our ability to continue delivering profitable growth in spite of ongoing challenges in our beef business reflects the strength and advantages of our unique business model. We are far and away the most diversified provider of food claims certifications in the United States. We provide thousands of producers, customers with best-in-class solutions to differentiate and add value to their products. These customers range from small family farms and ranches to large multinational CPGs. In turn, they respond to increasing consumer demand for products that are certified to any number of standards ranging from non-GMO, organic, and gluten-free to a growing number of sustainable-related certifications. Drilling down on our numbers for the quarter, verification and certification services revenue grew 17% to 4.4 million from 3.8 million. Product revenue reflecting smaller herd sizes and fewer source and age verifications was down 25% to 0.7 million from 1 million. Gross profit increased 9% to 2.3 million from 2.1 million year-over-year. Selling, general, and administrative expense increased only slightly to 2.1 million from 2 million, with the increase partially reflecting marketing spend. Operating income was 68% higher at $261,000 versus $155,000. Net income in the first quarter was up 47% to $178,000 or $0.03 per diluted share from $121,000 or $0.02 per diluted share in the same quarter last year. You may have noticed that we did not receive a Progressive Beef dividend in the third quarter that was strictly a timing issue as the $50,000 dividend was booked in early April. Progressive Beef Business and our relationship with Progressive Beef remain solid. Adjusted EBITDA in the first quarter increased 8% to $432,000 from $399,000. Cash provided by operations in the first quarter increased 48% to $0.7 million from $0.5 million. The company bought back 116,072 shares of its common stock during the first quarter at a cost of $1.5 million. That brings to nearly $11 million the total value we've returned to our stockholders over the past 13 quarters when factoring in buybacks in the special dividend. In addition to our commitment to value creation for stockholders and other stakeholders, we remain focused on our business priorities of delivering affordable, effective solutions to our customers through innovative and strategic investments in technology and complementary businesses. We believe this multi-pronged approach will continue to drive our industry leadership now and into the future. To date, we have closed more than a dozen small acquisitions, all of which are contributing to our success and to the widening moat around our business. The most recent example is our Q4 acquisition of the Upcycled Certified Program from the Upcycled Food Association. I know we mentioned this on our last call, but we recently updated investors with news that upcycling is among the fastest-growing certifications for us and the certification industry at large. Upcycled Certified provides consumers a tangible solution to shop sustainably and avoid food waste. Today, there are roughly 100 companies with 531 products certified to the standard, a 110% increase over the 484 products just a few months ago. The top three certification categories are snack foods, pet foods, and beverages. Products like these are responsible for diverting an average of 390,000 tons of food waste annually in 14 countries since the program's launch in 2021. We view Upcycled Certified as one of the most exciting and promising sustainability trends we've seen in a long time, and we think it can become a meaningful component and diversify our revenue mix over time. There are compelling reasons, both financial and environmental, that support our optimism that upcycling is in the early stages of a longer-term growth trend. If you haven't done so already, go back and look at our April 22nd press release on Upcycled Certified and check out some statistics that support that thesis. In closing, I want to reiterate that we believe ours is a resilient, durable, and sustainable business model, one that would be very difficult to replicate and one that is in the early innings of a long-term growth trend. We are consistently strengthening our market position with new revenue streams through organic and inquisitive growth initiatives in order to meet the evolving needs of our customers. So we are very excited about the future of our business, and as always, we appreciate our stockholders, customers, and other stakeholders for their loyalty and support. And with that, I'll turn the call back over to the operator for questions.\n\nOperator: Q - Unidentified Analyst A - John Saunders\n\nJohn Saunders: Well, once again, we'd like to thank you for all your support and your participation, and we'll talk to you again in three months.

(NASDAQ:AXGN), a global leader in peripheral nerve repair, has announced a 12.9% increase in revenue to $41.4 million for the first quarter of 2024. This growth is attributed to strong performance across the company's product lines and applications, particularly in January and February. Despite a net loss of $6.6 million for the quarter, AxoGen maintains its revenue guidance for the full year between $177 million and $181 million, with a gross margin forecast of 76% to 79%. The company is advancing its growth strategy by focusing on core accounts and expanding its sales team, while also driving innovation with new product launches.\n\nIn conclusion, AxoGen, Inc. is making significant strides in the peripheral nerve repair market, with a clear strategy for growth and innovation. The company's financials reflect both the challenges and potential in the evolving medical landscape, as it continues to invest in product development and market expansion. With the anticipated completion of the BLA for Avance nerve graft and the positive reception of its products, AxoGen remains committed to its mission of revolutionizing nerve repair and improving patient outcomes.\n\nAxoGen, Inc. (AXGN) has shown a commendable increase in revenue for Q1 2024, with a reported 12.9% growth. This positive trend is also reflected in the company's revenue growth over the last twelve months, which stands at 13.51%. Despite the reported net loss for the quarter, the company's gross profit margin remains strong at 80.62%, indicating efficient management of production costs relative to sales.\n\nInvestingPro Data metrics provide deeper insight into AxoGen's financial health:\n\nAn InvestingPro Tip highlights that AXGN's Relative Strength Index (RSI) suggests the stock is currently in oversold territory. This could be an indicator for potential investors that the stock might be undervalued at its current trading price. Additionally, the company's liquid assets exceed its short-term obligations, which is a reassuring sign of financial stability.\n\nFor readers interested in a more comprehensive analysis, there are additional InvestingPro Tips available. For instance, despite the recent uptick in price over the last six months, analysts do not anticipate the company will be profitable this year, and the stock has taken a significant hit over the last week and month. These insights could be crucial for investors contemplating short-term positions or considering the stock's volatility.\n\nTo explore these tips further and gain access to exclusive metrics, visit InvestingPro at https://www.investing.com/pro/AXGN.

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. It's now my pleasure to introduce your host, Harold Tamayo, Vice President of Finance and Investor Relations. Thank you, Harold. You may begin.\n\nHarold Tamayo: Thank you, Keith. Good morning, everyone. Joining me on today's call is Karen Zaderej, AxoGen's Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and President; and Nir Naor, Chief Financial Officer. Karen will discuss the first quarter of 2024 financial results, and Nir will provide an analysis of our financial performance and guidance and discuss our outlook for the year, followed by a question-and-answer session. Today's call is being broadcast live via webcast, which is available on the Investors section of the AxoGen's website. Following the end of the live call, a replay will be available in the Investors section of the company's website at www.axogeninc.com. Before we get started, I'd like to remind you that during this conference call, the company will make projections and forward-looking statements, including our financial guidance, our expectations regarding our ability to expand our footprint and expand revenue from core accounts, anticipated growth for revenue categories, marketing opportunities with nerve applications associated with breast, OMF protection and surgical treatment of pain and new products; our expectations regarding the timing of the launch of Avive+; our statement regarding the timing of the complete biologics license application submission for Avance nerve graft as well as a statement regarding the timing for approval of the BLA. Our expectation is that assuming approval of the BLA, Avance nerve graft will be designated as a reference product and the expected market exclusivity of such designation and our expectations around cash flow, including that we will continue trending towards cash flow breakeven and profitability. Forward-looking statements are based on current beliefs and assumptions and are not guarantees of future performance and are subject to risks and uncertainties, including, not without limitation, the risks and uncertainties reflected in the company's annual and periodic reports such as hospital staffing issues, regulatory processes and approvals, surgeon and product adoption and market awareness of our products. The forward-looking statements are representative only as of the date they are made and except as required by applicable law. We assume no responsibility to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements. In addition for a reconciliation of non-GAAP measures, please reference today's press release in our corporate presentation on the Investors section of the company's website. Now I would like to turn the call over to Karen. Karen?\n\nKaren Zaderej: Thank you, Harold, and thank you all for joining us today as we discuss our 2024 first quarter financial results. We had a solid first quarter, and we are pleased with both the positive trends in revenue and bottom line. Our performance underscores the progress we continue to make towards profitability and generating positive cash flow. During today's call, I'm going to highlight the progress we've made across our business as well as some changes we've made on the disclosure and reporting side, which both Nir and I will discuss later on in the call. Revenue for the quarter increased by 12.9% to $41.4 million compared to last year. We are pleased with this quarter's top line performance, which was at a run rate above the midpoint of our annual guidance. Looking closely at the quarter, growth was broad-based across our products and applications. We saw a strong January and February, and our typical step up in volume occurred in April rather than March this year. We remain confident that we will achieve our 2024 top line guidance. As part of the disclosure and reporting changes I alluded to in my opening comments, we've made the strategic decision to remove our revenue breakdown between scheduled and emergent trauma applications. Our growth strategy continues to be focused on going deeper and high potential accounts and to build the nerve repair business in these accounts across all of our targeted nerve repair applications. We believe the performance and key metrics pertaining to sales productivity and our progress in our core accounts provide the most clarity on the business model versus estimates of revenue by application. We will continue to talk qualitatively about the applications for nerve repair and our growth to give you color on both the opportunities in front of us and the progress we are making. As I said earlier, our growth strategy continues to be focused on going deeper in our existing core accounts where we see significant opportunity to expand our footprint in multiple clinical applications as well as increasing the number of core accounts. Most of our core accounts have the opportunity for significant expansion across surgeon users and applications, resulting in upside in total revenue. As a reminder, core accounts are defined as those generating more than $100,000 in revenue over the trailing 12 months and represent approximately 65% of our total revenue. Today, our largest core accounts are over $1 million annualized, and we look to continue to grow our core accounts towards their full potential. We ended the first quarter with 115 direct sales representatives, down one sequentially and compared to a year ago. We believe our revenue growth can continue to be driven primarily by increased productivity of our sales force, and we will evaluate and add additional sales reps as their territories approach targeted levels. Our direct sales force is supplemented by independent sales agencies that represent approximately 10% of our total revenue. As the leader in the nerve repair market, driving innovation to provide advanced solutions for surgeons and their patients is a key pillar of our growth. We previously announced three innovations to our portfolio, which included two new products to the protection space and the Resensation technique for implant-based breast neurotization. We saw strong surgeon and patient interest in implant-based breast neurotization and grew the number of surgical teams trained in this new technique. We are on track to expand our education efforts with three national Resensation surgeon training programs in 2024. Nerve protection continues to represent a significant growth opportunity for AxoGen. As previously mentioned, we saw a need for multiple product solutions to address the diverse types of non-transected nerve injuries. Our first portfolio expansion with the launch of AxoGuard HA+ Nerve Protector, and we have been pleased with the surgeon acceptance of the product and the progress of the launch, including the positive impact we are seeing on surgeon activation and new use cases in targeted applications. We are continuing to expand our offering for nerve protection with a Avive+ Soft Tissue Matrix, which broadens our nerve protection portfolio and targets acutely traumatized nerves. Avive+ Soft Tissue Matrix is a resorbable nerve protection implant that functions as the barrier, providing temporary protection and tissue separation during the critical phase of healing. We are pleased with the initial surgeon feedback we've received in our limited market release and on track for a full launch in June. With these additions, we believe we offer the broadest portfolio -- a protection portfolio for nerve repair, and this will continue to drive growth in the nerve protection market. Moving on to updates to our growing body of clinical evidence. Over the years, we've made significant investments to develop quality clinical evidence to demonstrate the safety, performance, health care economics and utility of our nerve repair solutions. Our active clinical programs are progressing as expected. As of the end of the quarter, we had 258 peer-reviewed publications, including applications in trauma, breast, OMF and pain. This January, we announced positive top line results from the REPOSE clinical study comparing standard of care and neurectomy of symptomatic neuromas to neurectomy and protection of the terminated nerve and with our AxoGuard Nerve Cap. This post marketing study met its primary endpoint for reduction in pain as measured by the visual analog scale. In addition, the study investigators found that over the full 12-month course of follow-up, AxoGuard Nerve Cap demonstrated statistical superiority for reduction in the total pain reported by the subjects compared to the standard of care neurectomy. We believe that these findings will play an important role in surgeon clinical decision-making. Turning now to the BLA for Avance nerve grafts. We completed a productive pre-BLA meeting with FDA. We are encouraged by the positive interactions and have aligned with FDA on a rolling submission process and the content of the modules for submission. We believe we are on track for the BLA filing to be completed in the third quarter of 2024, and the submission time line will allow for a potential approval in mid 2025. In addition, as required under the Pediatric Research Equity Act, we've submitted and reached agreement with the FDA of an initial pediatric study plan proposal. A final decision of the proposed plan is made by the review division at the time of approval of the biologics marketing application. Another component of our transition to a biologic was the construction and validation of our new AxoGen processing center. At the end of 2023, we fully transitioned all advanced processing to our new center. We believe the advancements of our processing facility will provide the appropriate biologic processing environment as well as expand our processing capacity. As a reminder, a BLA approval will complete the regulatory transition of Avance nerve graft from a 361 tissue product to a 351 biological product. Importantly, we believe Avance will be designated as the reference product for potential biosimilars, providing 12 years of market exclusivity from the approval. In conclusion, we are pleased with our results from the first quarter, which reflects the execution of our growth strategy. The exceptional performance of AxoGen's talented team has been pivotal in achieving these outcomes. Looking ahead, we are focused on delivering and furthering our mission to revolutionize the science of nerve repair. I'll now hand the call over to Nir, who will provide further details on our reporting changes, review our financial highlights and provide guidance. Nir?\n\nNir Naor: Thank you, Karen. It's been very exciting 5 months since I joined the AxoGen team. I've been listening carefully to the various teams and quickly learning the vast details behind this robust and innovative business. As part of my diligence, I have seen several different opportunities and changes to enhance our reporting. All of these changes were strictly voluntary. And although our previous practices are acceptable alternatives, I believe that the new practices are more widely used in the industry and provide investors improved comparability of the company's financial statements to peers. In addition, these changes will provide better transparency and facilitate better resource allocation as we continue our journey to profitability. Our auditors have reviewed these changes and agree that they are acceptable. One of these changes involve our accounting policy for shipping and handling costs. As of the first quarter of 2024, our shipping and handling costs directly related to bringing our products to their final destination, including facility and warehousing overhead, are now included in cost of goods sold, whereas previously they were included in sales and marketing expenses. Additionally, as of the first quarter of 2024, we ceased allocating certain costs to and from certain departments. Previously, such costs had been allocated based on the company's estimate of the proportionate share of total expense to each line item. It is important to recognize that all of these changes, which were completely voluntary, had no impact on net revenue, loss from operations, net loss per common share or cash flows. We've made available our 2023 reclassified condensed consolidated statements of operations by quarter in our earnings release this morning to provide full transparency of these changes. Correspondingly, all the 2023 financial results that we refer to include all of these changes. In addition, we will no longer be disclosing the breakout on emerging versus scheduled procedure revenue. This disclosure was based on estimates and provided qualitative information about the applications where our products are used. After looking into this disclosure and speaking with investors and advisers, I came to the conclusion that this disclosure does not provide the best insights into our business model and successful execution of our commercial strategy. Our strategy is focused on increasing our sales productivity and penetration into high potential accounts across multiple surgeon specialties and procedural applications. As a result, we've decided to align our reporting more closely with our strategy. And now turning to our financial results. For this quarter, our revenue was $41.4 million, representing 12.9% growth from the first quarter of 2023. This growth is attributed to a 4.9% increase in unit volume added with a 5.3% mix favorability and a 2.6% increase in price. Our gross profit for the quarter was $32.6 million, an increase from the $28.5 million recorded in the first quarter of 2023. This represents gross margin of 78.8%, up from 77.7% in the same period last year. Our total operating expenses for the quarter increased by 3.8% to $37.2 million, up from $35.8 million in Q1 of 2023. Our sales and marketing expenses for the first quarter grew by 1.9% to $19.8 million. Sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of total revenue decreased to 47.9% from 53% in the first quarter of 2023 as we saw improved sales productivity as well as the termination of royalty payments on Avance. Research and development expenses increased by 17.1% to $7.4 million from $6.3 million in 2023, driven by costs related to the BLA. As a percentage of total revenue, total R&D expenses increased to 17.9%, up from 17.3% in the last quarter of the previous year. General and administrative expenses remained almost flat at $9.9 million in Q1 of 2024 compared to $10.1 million in the first quarter of 2023. The quarter ended with a net loss of $6.6 million or $0.15 per share compared to a net loss of $7.1 million or $0.17 per share in the first quarter of 2023. However, we recorded an adjusted net loss of $2.7 million for the quarter or $0.06 per share, a shift from adjusted net loss of $4.1 million or $0.10 per share in the same period last year. Adjusted first quarter EBITDA was $1 million compared to an adjusted EBITDA loss of $3.8 million in the previous year. This change stands as a testament to our focused execution and improvement in operational efficiency and underscores our commitment to optimizing our cost structure. As of March 31, our balance of cash, cash equivalents and investments was $23.6 million compared to $37 million at the end of the fourth quarter of 2023. Turning now to our guidance. As outlined in today's press release, we are maintaining our full year guidance for 2024. We expect revenue to be in the range of $177 million to $181 million, which represents an annual growth rate of approximately 11% to 14%. We also reiterate our gross margin guidance for the full year to be in the range of 76% to 79%. Additionally, we expect to be net cash flow positive cumulatively for the period from April 1 through year-end. In summary, we are pleased with our performance in the first quarter. We will continue to execute our strategies, invest in innovation, drive revenue growth and optimize resource allocation and profitability. At this time, we'd like to open the line for questions.\n\nOperator: Yes, thank you. [Operator Instructions] And the first question comes from Michael Sarcone with Jefferies.\n\nMichael Sarcone: Karen, just the first one, your comments on performance through the quarter, you talked about a strong January and February and then a volume uptick in April. Can you maybe give us a little bit of color on what happened in March and how that compares to what you've seen historically?\n\nKaren Zaderej: Yes. As you know, we historically have seen as the summer months start a sort of step up in the second quarter, and that usually leads in March. And this year, we did not see the lead in March. We saw it actually, as I said in my notes, get pushed into April is where we saw the step up. I'm going to hypothesize here that it had to do with the timing of the Easter holidays, but that's just a hypothesis on my part. We have talked to a number of hospital systems that have also said they saw a shift in the March time frame on their elective outpatient procedures that might support that. But what we just saw was a little difference in timing of when we saw that step up occur. Having said that, we are really pleased to see that we saw growth again across products, across applications, continuing to build this business with a real focus in building out those core accounts and driving penetration in core account.\n\nMichael Sarcone: Got it. Thanks. That's helpful. And just given that you saw the step up in April rather than March, does that have any implications for quarterly sales cadence through the balance of the year, particularly if it differs from prior years?\n\nKaren Zaderej: I think in the end, we are still going to see the cadence that you see a second quarter step up and a third quarter step up that we've seen in the past. So I think we are not seeing a difference there. It's just a slight difference in timing of the week that it occurred in.\n\nMichael Sarcone: Got it. And just one last one for me. Can you give us any updates on the CEO search?\n\nKaren Zaderej: CEO search is in process. There's a group of independent directors who are leading the search. They've hired an outside search firm who is sourcing candidates, and they're going through the interview process. So still work in process that ultimately we'll get an announcement as we finalize that. They want to be thoughtful in that selection. And then of course, if you remember, I'll still be available from a consulting standpoint for a period of time to support that transition.\n\nOperator: Thank you. And the next question comes from Mike Kratky with SMB Securities.\n\nMike Kratky: Can you just give a little bit more color on the decision to remove the schedule versus the emerging breakdown? I mean, was there anything you saw this quarter that was kind of at odds with what you expected? Or any changes to how we should be thinking about the split between those two moving forward?\n\nNir Naor: Yes. Thank you for the question. So as we mentioned, this breakout is based on estimates and provide this qualitative breakout between those two procedures. And after looking into that, especially with this emphasis on resource allocations that I promoted and talking to several analysts and investors, I got the conclusion that it doesn't provide the best insights and the best way to look at our business and our commercial strategy. Our commercial strategy has been to increase our penetration into high potential accounts, which each spend several procedures and applications and surgeon specialties. So that is basically the rationale.\n\nKaren Zaderej: And then in your question, again, from a color commentary standpoint, we continue to see growth across multiple applications and products were not isolated into one area or one product, frankly. We are excited to continue to see the growth that we see in the protection area. If you remember, protection is both part of trauma and part of our scheduled cases. And so we are pleased to see that we are seeing all of these areas continue to grow. And that's one of the shifts again is to say that growth is predominantly happening in these core accounts. That's where our focus is. So I'm just thinking that the core account metrics are going to be more indicative of how we're growing our business.\n\nMike Kratky: Got it. Yes, really appreciate the helpfully color there. And then maybe just a quick follow-up. But from a product mix standpoint, I know you're not going to give details on kind of the specifics. But how should we think about the contribution from some of the newer product launches in terms of 2024 and the second half of this year?\n\nKaren Zaderej: I'm sorry. So could you state the question again?\n\nMike Kratky: Yes, just in terms of how we should think about the contribution from some of the newer product launches that you've had for the second half of this year and 2024 in general.\n\nKaren Zaderej: Okay. Well, first, we consider them in our guidance, so they were included in the guidance that aren't part of a change in guidance with the launch of the two protection products. Avive+ will launch here in June, so it will be ramping up. So like all new products, I think the back half of the year, while surgeons are going to be excited to try it, the revenue impact is still going to be modest because you've got to go through value analysis committees to get it into the accounts. So there's work that has to happen before it can really start to impact revenue. HA+, on the other hand, we've gone through a lot of that value analysis submissions, getting it allowed to be bought -- either brought into or stocked in hospitals and we are starting to see good, steady use of the product and reuse of the product. I can't give you an exact contribution, but we are really pleased to see that it is taking its rightful place in some of the surgeons' treatment algorithms and is becoming a product that they regularly use in certain use applications.\n\nMike Kratky: Understood. Thanks very much.\n\nOperator: Thank you. And the next question comes from Catlin Cronin with Canaccord Genuity.\n\nUnidentified Analyst: Hey, guys. This is George on for Catlin. Yes, so I just have a couple of questions on our end. Just first, what was procedure growth like in the quarter on a percentage basis year-over-year? And then maybe talk a little bit about just the general health of the overall market you're seeing in '24.\n\nKaren Zaderej: I'm sorry, again. It was hard to hear the question. If you could repeat the question?\n\nUnidentified Analyst: Yes. Do you hear me now? Yes, so our first question was just understanding how procedure growth was like in the quarter on a year-over-year basis. And then just more generally, on the health of the overall market that you're seeing in '24.\n\nKaren Zaderej: Yes. We've seen good procedure growth in -- so let me break each of the segments. So trauma has seasonality to it. So we saw the seasonality that we would expect in a Q1 with the noted exception of the timing of the step up. As people start to get more active, we saw that pushed into April instead of the trail part of March. In terms of some of our scheduled areas, breast neurotization, we continue to see increasing demand by patients with strong interest in getting the Resensation technique as a part of their reconstruction, whether they have either an implant based or deep -- a flat-based reconstruction. So we continue to see interest and as we train surgeons and surgical teams, expansion in breast neurotization and growth in that area. In Oral Maxillofacial, we continue to see -- in Oral Maxillofacial and pain are two smaller areas. We continue to see surgeon interest and are seeing procedural growth continuing, where they're doing neurotization in those procedures or managing the pain with the surgical treatment of the nerves. So we saw a good cadence through the quarter in all of those areas and think that, again, we are on a trajectory of continuing to see growth, in particular, in breast as we train more surgeons and get more surgeon teams engaged.\n\nUnidentified Analyst: Yes. Great. That's very helpful. And then just one last one from us. Do you have any further clarity on the gross margin cadence in '24 as you kind of sell through your old inventory from your previous facility?\n\nNir Naor: Yes. So it's -- as we mentioned in the last earnings call, the gross margin in the first half of the year is going to be higher than that in the second half of the year, where the main reason is that the inventory sold in the first half of the year comes from the one produced last year in the previous facility at a bit of a lower cost. Whereas the ones sold in the second half of the year is for, once produced, will be produced at our current facility at a bit of a higher cost. And that said, again, the guidance we reiterated for the entire year of 76% to 79%.\n\nOperator: Thank you. And the next question comes from Ross Osborn with Cantor Fitzgerald.\n\nRoss Osborn: All right. Good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. Starting off in developed [indiscernible] on core channel, which you did touched a bit service mix from ...\n\nHarold Tamayo: Hi. Good morning. So starting off and given a focus on core accounts, would you discuss what the site of service mix looks like for core accounts and your penetration level in hospital outpatient?\n\nKaren Zaderej: Again, it must be our speaker, but we are -- if you could repeat the question. It was hard to hear.\n\nNir Naor: Sure. I was just asking what the site of service mix looks like for your core accounts and then the penetration level and hospital outpatient.\n\nKaren Zaderej: Yes. No, thank you. So our site of care, we -- in our core accounts, we tend to be Level 1, Level 2 or Level 3 trauma centers as the majority, and then some specialty hospitals where you may see it may be driven in that case by a breast center or it might be a military center that does nerve repair. So those are typically the best targets for us as well as, obviously, academic teaching hospitals. There are, however, in our core accounts, some freestanding ambulatory surgery centers. And that really is an artifact of the fact that the threshold is $100,000. That could be one active surgeon who's doing nerve repair. Obviously, if it is a freestanding ambulatory surgery center, it doesn't have the same potential as a large academic center. So when I say our biggest centers are over $1 million today, that's not going to be the ambulatory surgery center. That's going to be a Level 1, Level 2, Level 3, trauma center, hospital or academic center. So our focus, again, is continuing to build those high potential accounts, building out the core accounts and continue to drive that business. Now when I talk about a Level 1 trauma center, that's going to be a mix of inpatient and outpatient procedures. So we do see actually a fair amount of the surgery that's done in trauma is an outpatient procedure. Where that's possible, they're going to try and move that patient through the hospital in under 24 hours and technically be classified as an outpatient procedure. The ambulatory surgery centers are the ones that we have not typically been as focused on. And as I said, we have some, but we've not typically been as focused on that. Having said that, we have done quite a bit of reimbursement work. It's been an economic challenge for ambulatory surgery centers predominantly. We've done a lot of reimbursement work to make sure that there is a new structure where they can economically have it make sense for them to do nerve repair in these freestanding centers. And so under the new coding and payment structure that CMS has set up, it is now economically viable and certainly an attractive overall health care alternative to move these procedures into these ambulatory surgery centers. And we are starting to see some of that migration happen. It has been a migration, not a revolution. But we see -- quarter-over-quarter, we continue to see growth of the procedures that are done in these ambulatory surgery centers, and we do expect for the future that, that will continue.\n\nRoss Osborn: Great. That's very helpful. And then lastly for us. Would you just walk through how your conversations have gone with accounts, sort of Avive Soft Tissue, maybe relative to the year?\n\nKaren Zaderej: Sure. Well, we've done a limited market release, so it's not broadly available. But with some leading surgeons who are very anxious to get this product back into their treatment algorithm, we've provided it upfront. Feedback that we've gotten to date has been extremely positive. Surgeons are very happy to have this alternative for nerve protection. Again, meeting the need where there's a short-term resorbable protection need predominantly in acute trauma, although also sometimes in pain, surgical treatment of pain. And so we are excited to have this as an opportunity to provide them this added solution in their nerve treatment. Surgeon feedback has been very favorable, in fact, more positive. If you remember, we had a product called the Avive that we voluntarily withdrew from the market a number of years ago because of changes the FDA did in regulatory classifications of birth tissue products and ultimately decided that we would withdraw that product. Surgeons liked that product. They like this product better in terms of the handling and the characteristics of the product that they're using intraoperatively. And so we are really pleased to get it out there and excited to get in the hands of all of our sales reps and our customers to be able to use on these patients.\n\nOperator: Thank you. And there are no further questions at this time, so I would like to turn the floor back over to Karen Zaderej for any closing comments.\n\nKaren Zaderej: Well, thank you, Keith. Well, as we wrap up today's earnings call, I want to extend a thank you to our team here at AxoGen for their outstanding work and to everyone who participated on this call for their engagement and input. The commitment of our employees has been crucial in reaching the achievement we've talked about today as we continue to change the lives of patients with peripheral nerve injuries. Thank you.\n\nOperator: Thank you. This concludes today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time.

[Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Mike Morrison, CFO. You may begin.\n\nMike Morrison: Thank you, Justin, and thank you for joining the NCS Multistage first quarter 2024 conference call. Our call today will be led by our CEO, Ryan Hummer, and I will also provide comments. I want to remind listeners that some of today's comments include forward-looking statements such as our financial guidance and comments regarding our future expectations for financial results and business operations. These statements are subject to many risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from any expectation expressed herein. Please refer to our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and our latest SEC filings for risk factors and cautions regarding forward-looking statements. Our comments today, as well as the results of operations included in our earnings release, contain the following non-GAAP financial measures, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA margin, adjusted gross profit, adjusted gross margin, free cashflow less distributions to non-controlling interests, and net working capital. The underlying details and reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP financial measures are provided in our first quarter earnings release, which can be found on our website, ncsmultistage.com. I'll now turn the call over to Ryan.\n\nRyan Hummer: Thank you, Mike, and welcome to our investors, analysts, and employees joining our first quarter 2024 earnings conference call. NCS is off to a strong start in 2024. Our first quarter revenue of $43.9 million, exceeded the high end of our guided range by nearly $4 million. The strength was broad-based as we achieved or exceeded the high end of our guided revenue range for each of our US, Canadian, and international markets, with the largest relative outperformance coming from Canada. Our adjusted gross margin of 40%, which excludes depreciation and amortization expense, was within our guided range for the quarter. Our SG&A expense of $13.8 million for the quarter was $2.3 million lower than in the first quarter of 2023, resulting from cost savings measures that demonstrate our commitment to control expenses and a year-over-year reduction in litigation-related professional fees. We also benefited from an increase in other income as compared to the first quarter of last year, primarily royalty income related to licensing our intellectual property, and the benefits from a technical services agreement with a local partner in Oman. Our adjusted EBITDA for the first quarter of $6.1 million, exceeded our estimate of $3 million to $4 million, and represents a year-over-year improvement of $1.2 million and a sequential improvement of $3.5 million. In prior earnings calls. I've referenced NCS's core strategies for creating value for our stakeholders. We've included a new slide in our investor presentation, which is available on our website, Slide 13, that helps to illustrate our strategy and provide examples of our progress. The first core strategy is to build upon our leading market positions. We've demonstrated our commitment to this strategy in Canada thus far in 2024. Our Q1 revenue in Canada of $32 million, increased by 3% as compared to the first quarter of 2023, despite a reduction in the average rig count in Canada of 6% for the same period. This performance reflects the initiatives to leverage the strength of our market position and customer relationships developed over time in our fracturing systems business, and to pull through additional revenue opportunities across our other product lines. In particular, we continue to capture additional well construction opportunities with our fracturing systems customers and to grow the customer base for our purple seal frack plugs and fracture express systems and plug-and-perf completions in Canada. Our second core strategy is to capitalize on international and offshore opportunities. We've previously discussed our efforts to grow our customer base in the North Sea and to position the company for long-term growth opportunities in the Middle East in particular. We are now benefiting from these strategic investments. We're off to a good start so far this year, having sold sliding sleeves to a new North Sea customer in the first quarter. As we move to the second quarter, we expect activity in the North Sea to improve on a seasonal basis, with installation and completion activity increasing, including the expected delivery of sliding sleeves to yet another new North Sea customer. In addition, we are experiencing a meaningful increase in Tracer Diagnostics activity in the Middle East. In April, we completed tracing the first of multiple pads for a leading national oil company in the Middle East, supporting development plans for their unconventional resource base. We expect to participate in at least two similar projects over the remainder of 2024. In addition, NCS has been awarded the opportunity to trace additional conventional wells for the same customer, supporting activity between the unconventional well pads. This is only possible because of the tireless effort of individuals across our organization to educate our customer on the value that our tracer diagnostic services can bring to tackle the procurement and logistical challenges of the work, and to provide outstanding customer service throughout the jobs and for the reporting process. Including the expected midpoint for international revenue guidance for the second quarter, our international revenues would approximate $7.2 million for the first half of 2024. This compares to $3.3 million in the first half of 2023, and would exceed our full-year 2023 international revenue of $6.5 million. As a reminder, full-year international revenue for NCS exceeded $10 million for each of 2018 through 2021, reaching a high of over $15 million during that period, highlighting our opportunity outside of North America. The third core strategy for NCS is to commercialize innovative solutions to complex customer challenges. We have internal objectives this year tied to obtaining field trials for new products and successfully entering new markets and regions. I spoke to this extensively on our prior call, so will just briefly highlight some of these exciting projects. We had a successful onshore trial during the first quarter for a completion system designed for deep water operations. This was developed in conjunction with an international oil company, with potential applications in the Gulf of Mexico and other deepwater regions. We've completed initial field trials for our pinpoint oriented perforating gun system at Repeat Precision, and we continue to advance further testing and validation, aligned with an influential customer's requirements. In the second quarter, we expect to install a well that will represent our highest ever sleeve count in the US at over 200 sleeves. The well will be utilizing fiber optic technology to help the customer optimize a horizontal water flood program. We had a successful entry into the SAGD market in Canada for our fracturing systems technology earlier this year. This is a first for NCS, and we expect to utilize our technology for additional applications and customers in this market over time. In addition to these projects, we have several other technology developments underway across our various product lines, which I'm looking forward to discussing as they roll out. Mike will now review our results for the first quarter and our guidance for the second quarter.\n\nMike Morrison: Thank you, Ryan. As reported in yesterday's earnings release, our first quarter revenues were $43.9 million, a 1% increase year-over-year, with our Canadian and international revenues up 3% and 39%, respectively, and our US revenues down 12%. Despite a slight decrease in the average rig count, we saw a modest increase in our Canadian revenues. Additionally, our international revenues experienced growth, driven by the sale of a frac systems to a customer in the North Sea. Our US revenues continued to be impacted by lower natural gas prices that have curtailed some customer activity. Sequentially, our revenues in the first quarter increased by 24%, with Canada up 27%, and the US up 10%, while international revenues nearly doubled. Our adjusted gross profit, defined as total revenues less total cost of sales, excluding depreciation and amortization expense, was $17.6 million in the first quarter of 2024. Our adjusted gross margin was 40%, down compared to our adjusted gross margin of 43% for the same period in 2023, but up sequentially from 37% for the fourth quarter of 2023. Selling, general, and administrative costs were $13.8 million for the first quarter, down by $2.3 million compared to the same period last year. The significant reduction was due in part to our restructuring efforts in 2023 to streamline operations and better leverage our SG&A spend. For the first quarter, we reported net income of $2.1 million or diluted earnings per share of $0.82, compared to a net loss of $15 million or a loss per share of $6.10 for the same period in 2023. Our prior year net loss was impacted by a $17.5 million litigation provision we recorded in the first quarter of 2023 that was later settled and reversed in the fourth quarter of 2023. Adjusted EBITDA for the first quarter was $6.1 million, an improvement to the $4.9 million in the same period in 2023. Now, turning to cashflow items on the balance sheet. Cashflow from operating activities and free cashflows less distributions to non-controlling interest, were uses of cash of $1.9 million and $2.5 million, respectively. Our forecast for the full year of 2024 is to be free cashflow-positive. However, similar to the first quarter of 2023, our negative cashflow was primarily due to an increase in net working capital of approximately $6 million. This was due in part to an increase in our accounts receivable, partially offset by a reduction in our inventory balances. On March 31, we had $14 million in cash, and total debt of $8.9 million, which consists primarily of finance lease obligations, resulting in a positive net cash position of $5.1 million. At the end of March 2024, the borrowing base availability under our undrawn ABL facility was $20.4 million, and Repeat had $6 million of outstanding borrowings under a promissory note that was repaid in full in April. Now, turning to a few points of guidance for the second quarter. We currently expect second quarter total revenue in the range of $27 million to $30 million. We expect Canadian revenue in the range of $12.5 million to $13.5 million, US revenue of $10 million to $11 million, and international revenues of $4.5 million to $5.5 million. We expect our adjusted gross margin to be between 36% and 38%, an improvement to our adjusted gross margin for the second quarter of 2023. Due to the Canadian seasonal impact of spring breakup, we expect our adjusted EBITDA to be between breakeven and a negative $2 million, and our second quarter depreciation and amortization expense to be approximately $1.2 million. With that, I'll hand it back over to Ryan to discuss our 2024 full-year guidance and for closing remarks.\n\nRyan Hummer: Thanks, Mike. We're making only slight adjustments to our full-year guidance for 2024 at this time. We currently expect full-year revenue of $150 million to $160 million. This guidance increases the low end of the revenue range by $5 million, and maintains the top end of the range. As a reminder, we expect our revenue growth will primarily result from increased sales at Repeat Precision and our fracturing systems product line in the US, and in international markets, the North Sea and Middle East in particular. We're cautiously optimistic about Canadian activity as well. There are fundamental drivers supporting customer activity in Canada, including the TMX oil pipeline coming online this quarter, and the Canada LNG facility due to come online in 2025, which is driving activity increases to support increased natural gas production in advance of this facility's commissioning. In addition, the strong US dollar supports Canadian activity, as our Canadian customers have operating expenses in Canadian dollars, but can sell oil and condensate at prices linked to the strong US dollar. These positive fundamental factors are tempered by the drought conditions that continue to exist in Western Canada. If we have a dry spring or an active wildfire season like we did in 2023, access to fresh water for our customers could be reduced, which could result in lower completions activity, as firefighting and agricultural activity would have preferential access to fresh water. At this point, our guidance incorporates at least some disruption from the drought conditions and wildfire prospects. So, there can certainly be more favorable Canadian customer activity levels if we continue to benefit from a wet spring, as we have thus far, and a less active fire season. We've increased our adjusted EBITDA range to $14.5 million to $17.5 million, with a midpoint of $16 million. The increase to the midpoint of the range is $1 million, with increases to both the bottom and top end. Due to the seasonality of our business, and consistent with prior years, we anticipate that the achievement of our annual adjusted EBITDA guidance range will be weighted to the second half of the year. The $4 million year-over-year increase in adjusted EBITDA at the midpoint of the current range, represents an incremental adjusted EBITDA margin of over 32% on the $12.4 million increase implied by the midpoint of our revenue guidance range, reflecting the impact of the business optimization initiatives undertaken by NCS in 2023, and our relatively fixed operating expenses. We expect our gross capital expenditures for the year to be between $1.5 million and $2.5 million, and we expect to generate over $5 million in free cashflow in 2024, after distributions to non-con controlling interests, despite the modest investment in net working capital that could result from supporting our revenue growth. We believe that our expectation for revenue and earnings growth in the current industry environment, paired with our strong balance sheet, positions us favorably amongst other publicly-traded oil field services and equipment peers. This is illustrated on Slide 19 of our investor presentation, which benchmarks analyst consensus revenue and EBITDA growth for 2024 for us and a group of publicly-traded peers with a market capitalization of below $1 billion. The charts illustrate that NCS is expected to generate revenue and earnings growth that is above the median of the peer set. Another chart on the slide demonstrates that our debt to capitalization ratio at December 31, 2023, was below the median for the peer set, reflecting our resilient balance sheet. However, this favorable growth in balance sheet profile is not reflected in our trading multiple, which at 3.4x enterprise value the 2024 EBITDA, was one multiple turn below that of the peer with the next lowest multiple, and approximately two multiple turns below the peer median. Before we open the call to Q&A, I'll close with a couple of brief comments. We're benefiting from the core strategies that we put in place in 2022 aimed at generating value for our stakeholders through organic growth and technology development. We have the infrastructure in place to support revenue growth in each of our geographic markets, providing leverage to growth future earnings. As demonstrated by our current guidance for 2024, achieving the midpoint of our guidance range would grow our annual revenue by 9% and our adjusted EBITDA by over 30%. We maintain a strong balance sheet and liquidity position, with a cash balance of over $14 million at the end of the first quarter. In addition, we expect to add to that cash balance by generating positive free cashflow in 2024, providing us with financial and strategic flexibility. Finally, we continue to benefit from the successful introduction of new technologies that meet the needs of our customers, adding to our portfolio, and expanding our addressable market. With that, we'd welcome any questions.\n\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Dave Storms from Stonegate. Your line is now open.\n\nDave Storms: Good morning. Just hoping we could start with the top-line guidance. It's great to see that you've raised the low end. What would you need to see either in the international markets or elsewhere to also raise the top end of that guidance?\n\nRyan Hummer: Sure, thanks, Dave. Appreciate the question. I think for us, the biggest thing right now is that we are taking a relatively conservative approach to the Canadian market. I outlined during the call what we think is a really, really strong fundamental backdrop for Canada, and I think that'll persist throughout the year. However, we certainly are aware that coming into 2024, you had a couple of years of extended drought conditions. There was a very active wildfire season last year. We're fortunate that there's been a relatively wet spring so far, but it's easy. So, I think we're just being a little bit cautious right now around the potential prospects for some potential reduced activity on the completion side if our customers find that it's a bit more difficult to access fresh water for their completions as you move into the summer months. So, I think as we move through the second quarter and understand whether - what the extent of that impact will be, if any, I think that's where we have a bit more confidence in really assessing whether there's some upsides to the top end of the range as well.\n\nDave Storms: Understood. Very helpful. And then you mentioned that international markets used to operate around $15 million or so a year. What's the pathway to get back to that? Is that going to be getting cataloged with current companies? Is that going to be addressing new markets? What does that look like?\n\nRyan Hummer: Yes, thanks. Another great question, Dave. I think the path to that is the path we're on, quite frankly, and there are two components to it. I think first is, during that period, we had one customer who was very active in the North Sea, an Aker BP (NYSE:BP), who we've referred to as kind of our anchor customer in the North Sea over time. And as you know and as we've discussed, we've been really active in adding to our customer base for the North Sea. We think we'll work with at least five different companies this year. And what we're really looking forward to is both Aker and one of the other customers have field development projects that they're looking to bring online as we move forward into 2005 and 2026, which would represent more consistent work and would look a lot more like the level of activity that we saw back in those months or those prior years. And you pair that with the work that we've been doing in the Middle East, and we're in a really good spot right now with Tracer Diagnostics in the Middle East. We're getting additional well construction products qualified to be called out there. So, with the North Sea back to historical activity levels that we saw during that period, tied together with the additional opportunities in the Middle East, I think we are on the path towards hitting those sorts of - that revenue profile that we saw in those prior years.\n\nDave Storms: That's very helpful. Thank you. I'll get back in queue.\n\nOperator: And thank you. And one moment for our next question and our next question comes from Blake McLean from Daniel Energy Partners. Your line is now open.\n\nBlake McLean: Hey guys, thanks for taking my call. So, I was hoping you could provide a little bit more color on kind of how we should think about the offshore opportunity set, timing associated with that, and kind of what that sort of path forward to incremental revenue looks like over the next year or two or whatever timeframe works.\n\nRyan Hummer: Sure, yes, happy to do the best I can there. So, again, this year we're going to work for more customers in the North Sea than we ever have before. It will not be a large well count with any customers individually, but I think that sets the stage for some more work going forward. And I mentioned that there are two customers in particular operating in the North Sea, really one on the Norwegian side, one on the UK side, that have some larger development programs that we would expect to participate in, and we would see the work on those programs starting to ramp up, more so next year, but could represent pretty consistent work for multiple-year timeframe. We pair that with the technology development project that we have for the deepwater application. That's a little bit longer to develop, and I'd say the number of wells per year is not necessarily the same scope the North Sea is, but they're very attractive well opportunities for us on a single well basis. So, that could move forward and be a small handful of wells per year, but those individual well opportunities would be pretty impactful for us as a company. And again, that would develop over a longer term timeframe. I don't think you'd see that ramping up really until - we may have a first well in 2025, but that would pick up more in 2026 and beyond.\n\nBlake McLean: That's helpful. Thank you. Maybe just one more, just building on the last set of questions, and again, maybe zooming out a little bit, how should we think about the opportunity set internationally, and specifically in the Middle East? And how do you sort of tee yourselves up to be successful there? What does the sales and business development sort of team look like? How do you sort of execute well over there? Do you have that team in place? You have a plan to kind of build that out? And where do you think that the Tracer Diagnostics and some of the things you guys are doing out there, where do you think it really makes sense of if we think about it from a sort of multi-year perspective?\n\nRyan Hummer: Yes, no, another really good question. So, what I'd say is that at the highest level, we've got the right teams and strategies in place when we think about the leadership for our international group and the business development teams from the international group. We are aligned with what we think are very strong local partners in the various geographies and in Oman and in Saudi particularly, who are helping us to navigate that process of getting each of our product lines cataloged and in a position where the asset managers in the various international regions can kind of call out our work very quickly and without getting additional approvals from procurement and whatever the case may be. So, moving it from, call it a technology trial into having our products and services utilized in production mode. The big opportunity for us that we're executing on this year are these unconventional Tracer projects for a Middle East customer. I'd say that customer is very early in their development of their unconventional resource. And the opportunity there with - that's really that period where utilizing Tracer Diagnostics in particular is very, very valuable for a customer to help them understand the resource and optimize their development plans. So, I think there's a good runway there. Where we'll probably need to support that development over time will be with additional operations personnel. Right now, we're mobilizing people from North America, from Argentina, from China, to service some of that well work in the Middle East. So, we'll probably need to make some more investments in personnel, both within our own headcount, but also some folks within our local partners. And over time, we may look to make some strategic investments in the region as well, whether that's what I'd call sort of a relatively light footprint Tracer lab or some other types of investment there. But we'd only do that once we've established the track record and have sort of several years of relatively robust revenue and earnings in those markets before we deploy additional capital into supporting that business.\n\nBlake McLean: Got it. Thanks for walking through that in some detail. I've got just one more if you don't mind. Could you provide a bit more color on the sleeve that you guys highlighted in your prepared remarks?\n\nRyan Hummer: Sure. I think you're talking about the one in the US with the fiber optics, is that right?\n\nBlake McLean: Yes.\n\nRyan Hummer: Yes. So, that's a pretty interesting project. So, what we're able to do there, the customer wants to run a fiber optic line in that well, and it's - they're really - it's somewhat unique project, especially in the US where historically, water flood projects have used vertical injectors. This is an area that was developed horizontally. So, they're looking to execute a horizontal water flood program and optimize that. The well that's going to be installed will have a very large number of sliding sleeves, and it'll have a fiber optic cable clamp to it. And part of the reason that the customer would use sleeves for that is, one, to be able to have as many well-known access points along that lateral, but more importantly, as opposed to if you were going to plug-and-perf that well, there's a risk of having your perforation, if it's not aligned properly, accidentally shoot that cable and cut off your ability to acquire the data. So, we're able to channel that fiber in between the ports of our sleeves to take that risk off the table. So, yes, the customer will benefit in a number of ways. And the other piece with that, by installing sliding sleeves and specifically our reclosable sleeves, if the customer sees water breakthrough in parts of that well that's indicated by the fiber, what we can do is go in and help the customer manipulate those sleeves to shut off water breakthrough in certain areas and again, just maximize the value for that area through the deployment of the technology.\n\nBlake McLean: Okay. Thanks for that detail, you all. I'll kick it back to you all.\n\nOperator: [Operator instructions]. And am showing no further questions. I would now like to turn the call back over to Ryan Hummer, CEO, for closing remarks.\n\nRyan Hummer: All right. Thank you, Justin. All right. On behalf of our management team and board, we'd like to thank everyone on the call today, including our shareholders, analysts, and especially our employees. I truly appreciate the tremendous work and dedication demonstrated by our team here at NCS and Repeat Precision as we implement our long-term strategy. We're only as good as our people, and I believe we have the best team in the industry. Our team continues to provide excellent service to our customers and is developing new products and services that will enable our customers to be more successful. We appreciate everyone's interest to NCS Multistage, and we look forward to talking again on our next quarterly earnings call.\n\nOperator: This concludes today's conference call.

Omar will summarize our first quarter results and provide commentary on the operating landscape and Bill will provide additional detail on the financial results, before we open up the call for questions. With that, I'll turn the call over to Omar.\n\nOmar Asali: Thank you, Sara. Good morning, everyone. I appreciate you all joining us today. Our first quarter financial results were largely in line with our expectations as we experienced 4.4% top line growth and meaningfully improved profitability to start the year. We are pleased to report that we experienced our third consecutive quarter of volume growth in PPS as activity levels continue to improve. While the overall operating landscape remains uneven, we are pleased to see continued moderate general improvement. Our gross margins on a constant currency basis improved by 400 basis points year-over-year and adjusted EBITDA margins improved 500 bps on a constant currency due to the favorable paper pricing environment compared to a year ago and higher volumes flowing through the complex. Overall, we are happy with the start of the year and believe it sets us on a path to achieve our targeted results for 2024. Consistent with much of our recent operating history, we expect the first half of the year will be a lower contributor to 2024 top line performance compared to the back half as we expect more large account activity to ramp up as the year progresses and traditional seasonality to drive higher volumes in the second half of the year. North American sales were up 2.6% in the quarter versus last year, driven by improved void-fill and automation sales year-over-year. At a more macro level, box shipments were flat to slightly up for the quarter, while freight and trucking data remains mixed. The industrial and manufacturing sector remains sluggish, while we are seeing some improvement in e-commerce activity. The impacts of higher rates constraining housing activity and all of the spend that goes with it as well as inflationary pressures impacting consumer discretionary spend remain present. This has led to activity levels in North America being okay but inconsistent from month to month. On a positive note, more recently we've seen improvements in consumer confidence, so hopefully that will inspire additional demand for goods. While that is the macro picture, we try to focus on driving outcomes that are within our control at Ranpak such as executing on our strategic account plan. We are pleased with our progress and optimistic that the ramp-up in the plastic to paper shift provides us with solid volume momentum for the remainder of the year while the macro hopefully stabilizes and improves. We said in our first quarter call last year that the plastic-to-paper shift was a longer sales cycle given the complexity of some of the organizations involved but that we believed it was only a matter of time before the volumes start to reflect the shift in thinking. I'm pleased to say that in April, we're seeing a pickup in activity from our strategic account initiative and many accounts are beginning the transition away from plastic. Europe, APAC activity levels in the first quarter were solid, with sales up 5.4% versus the prior year, driven by higher volumes in void-fill and wrapping. Activity levels in the region continue to improve slowly, although manufacturing and industrial activity remains subdued, impacting cushioning utilization. Consumer confidence in the region has been improving since the end of the third quarter but is still well below pre-COVID levels. Geographically speaking, we've seen strength in Southern Europe in countries like Spain and Italy as well as improvement in the U.K. While the central part of Europe that is more manufacturing heavy like Poland, Belgium and Germany are weaker. In APAC, Japan and Australia continue to be bright spots. The input cost environment provides us with a benefit for the first half of the year as paper pricing moved lower throughout the year before reaching a trough in Q4. We expect paper pricing in the first half of the year to be in line with Q4 as pricing flattened out to start the year. We are, however, seeing some producers in North America and Europe making a push to increase pricing as we get deeper into the year. Overall, we are targeting to maintain a gross margin in 2024 that is in line with our finish in 2023. So we're working closely with our vendors to plan accordingly and determine if we need to make pricing adjustments based on the commodity environment. The freight market has been roughly flat to start the year and in the U.S. has remained favorable given the freight recession that has been present for the past 2 years. Freight market participants have struck a more optimistic tone recently. So we're monitoring that closely to see how potential improvement in freight level activity, along with rising tensions in the Middle East, driving oil higher may impact pricing and availability. Inventory levels at our distributors and end users remain tight, with many in our value chain in North America and Europe keeping tight lids on the amount of product on hand given the increased cost of capital and uneven environment. Destocking is no longer an issue but we continue to watch inventories at our customers across the globe. Now with that, let me turn it over to Bill for some financial detail.\n\nBill Drew: Thank you, Omar. In the deck, you'll see a summary of some of our key performance indicators. We'll also be filing our 10-Q which provides further information on Ranpak's operating results. Machine placement increased 0.9% year-over-year to approximately 140,800 machines globally. Cushioning systems declined 0.9%, while void-fill installed systems increased 1.3% and wrapping systems increased 1.8% year-over-year. Growth in the machine field population had been lower this year due to a combination of lower activity levels generally, particularly related to industrial and manufacturing sectors in Europe as well as our efforts to optimize our fleet. To maximize capital efficiency, we are focused on getting underutilized converters back and redeploying them to more productive areas. Overall, net revenue for the company in the first quarter was up 4.4% year-over-year on a constant currency basis, driven by increased volumes and contribution from automation, offset by slightly lower price. In North America, net revenue increased 2.6% year-over-year, with void-fill and automation up versus the prior year, offset by decreases in cushioning and wrapping. Volumes were lower versus prior year driven by a softer March but we expect those to pick up in the region as the year progresses driven by our strategic account activity. In Europe and APAC, net revenue on a constant currency basis was up 5.4% year-over-year, driven by void-fill, wrapping and automation, offset by lower cushioning revenue as the industrial sector in Europe remains pressured. We are pleased to see the general continued recovery in this reporting unit as volumes increased 10% year-over-year and businesses begin to recover. We believe a part of the recovery we are seeing is due to the increased confidence stemming from the continued favorable natural gas pricing in Europe with Dutch Nat gas hovering around \u20ac30 per megawatt. There has been some volatility recently due to rising geopolitical tensions but we believe the amount of expected LNG capacity coming online and becoming available to Europe beginning in 2025 should help to keep a lid on pricing. Our gross profit increased 16.7% on a constant currency basis, implying a margin of 38% compared to 34% in the prior year. This is in line with our expectations as we expected gross margin to be roughly in line with Q4 throughout the year. As Omar mentioned, we are monitoring the commodity environment closely and are extremely focused on maintaining the gross margin profile we sought to regain after 2022. Adjusted EBITDA increased 33.8% year-over-year to $20.2 million, implying a 22.8% margin driven by a higher gross profit flow-through and controlled G&A spend. We are pleased with the continued overall improvement in the financial profile and are optimistic as more volumes flow through the complex and automation grows, we will continue to work our way back towards an attractive high-margin and cash-generative profile. Capital expenditures for the quarter were $9.8 million, driven by converter placement and investments related to our Malaysia production facility. We are keeping tight controls on capital expenditures this year as we are moving beyond our infrastructure investment cycle that brought us a world-class technology platform and fully invested and funded physical infrastructure assets across the globe. Moving briefly to the balance sheet and liquidity. We completed Q1 with a strong liquidity position, including a cash balance of $55 million to end the quarter and no drawings on our revolving credit facility. We continue to make steady progress on our goal of deleveraging and reached 4.4 turns at the end of the quarter, down from 4.6x at 2023 year-end and 5.7x as of Q2 2023. We expect to build cash in the back half of the year as we enter the traditionally stronger holiday season and volumes pick up. The Malaysia production facility go live this summer marks the end of our multiyear infrastructure investment initiative and enables us to focus on getting a return on our investments as we scale our PPS and automation businesses. Our capital expenditure plans in 2024 are much more modest compared to recent prior years at less than $35 million which we expect will enable us to generate cash in 2024 and help us deleverage further. Following quarter end, in April we settled the litigation matter and sold 2 patents which resulted in total cash proceeds of \u20ac20 million, bolstering our cash position and implying a pro forma leverage ratio of 4.1x on a constant currency basis, including the additional cash proceeds. Based on our adjusted EBITDA guide and expected cash generation, we expect leverage to be below 4 turns on a constant currency basis by year-end, with an ultimate goal to getting to 3 turns or below. We believe our recent commercial and financial progress along with a focus on deleveraging and cash generation positions us well to address our term loan maturities well before their maturities in June of 2026. Ranpak has a long history in the credit markets from years of private equity ownership and I think would be well received by credit investors. For those of you who have spent time with us over the past few years, you know our goal is to have the cap structure not be a topic of conversation. This means a simple structure and a conservative leverage profile that addresses needs well in advance. With that, I'll turn it back to Omar before we move on to questions.\n\nOmar Asali: Thank you, Bill. In closing, I'm pleased with the continued progress and third quarter in a row of volume growth. While the macro remains unclear, I believe our company-specific drivers such as our strategic account activity and momentum in automation will enable us to continue to drive the top line and improve profitability. Driving volumes in PPS, scaling automation and generating cash are the top priorities at Ranpak in 2024 and going into 2025. Automation continues to get the traction that we are seeking with large accounts as our systems are in facilities this year as the first step to larger follow-through opportunities. We continue to anticipate revenue growth of more than 50% in automation this year and I continue to strongly believe the investments we have made in this area will be a critical growth driver and differentiator for Ranpak in the upcoming years. Our long-term objective remains to have a business that is steadily growing revenue in the high single to low double-digit area, the gross margins in the high 30% to 40% area and adjusted EBITDA margins in the high 20s to low 30s area, with substantial cash being generated along the way. We have a strong platform in place supported by our state-of-the-art digital infrastructure and facilities that can support our growth ambitions. With these multiyear projects behind us, the focus can be solely on execution of our strategic initiatives and gaining efficiencies. I'm energized by what I see happening within Ranpak and across the world. The team is invigorated by the narrower scope of objectives and what we all read about seemingly every day regarding the tailwinds related to the shift from plastic to paper and warehouse automation needs. This year's Earth Day theme is Planet versus Plastics and has a goal of raising awareness to drive a 60% plastic reduction by 2040. There has been a plethora of great yet alarming content created this year that aims to promote widespread public awareness of the damage done by plastic to human, animal and all biodiversities' health. Earthday.org is also trying to achieve a phase-out of all single-use plastics by 2030 and achieving that commitment at the United Nations treaty on plastic pollution in 2024. At Ranpak, we are extremely proud to be at the forefront of this movement and we are doing our part to deliver a better world. With that, let's open the call up for some questions. Operator?\n\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from the line of Greg Palm with Craig-Hallum Capital Group.\n\nDanny Eggerichs: This is Danny Eggerichs on for Greg today. I was hoping to maybe just start with a little bit more on the strategic accounts. I guess it seems like it's improved. But how would you say your visibility into those accounts has changed over, say, the last couple of months? It seems like it's improved. And does it feel like you're even more confident on kind of that second half step-up, especially with the, I guess, comments on a few of these accounts already beginning to transition away from plastic in Q2?\n\nOmar Asali: Yes, sure. I feel -- and obviously, as I said, some of these conversations in particular with very large sizable accounts take some time. I said in our last quarter call that we expect things to start ramping up in early Q2. And as I said on the call today, in April, we're starting to see that. So I would say the level of activity in strategic accounts moving from trial, pipeline, funnel, sort of early install activity to accounts purchasing our product, expanding the installed and scaling up, that's starting to occur in this quarter in Q2. We feel really good about the visibility that we have. Obviously, the macro environment is always a factor. But in terms of large accounts, in particular, in the U.S. making meaningful moves and switches from plastic to paper, that's occurring. And we think, frankly, every month starting in, again, the beginning of Q2, that, that ramp-up will continue. So we feel we've made tremendous progress. And as we've said for a while, we're hoping that you're going to start seeing that in the volume and results starting in Q2 of '24.\n\nDanny Eggerichs: Got it. And then I guess just in terms of Q2, normal seasonality, kind of some moderate sequential growth. I guess as we think about that and some of these strategic accounts starting in Q2, I guess is it fair to say that there could be some incremental revenue on top of that typical seasonality there in Q2?\n\nOmar Asali: I'll let Bill provide a bit more detail. But I would just say where we are, again, we've provided the guidance for the year early on. We're just sticking to that guidance. We feel pretty confident. I think I've said in the last quarter that we feel there's even upside. So that's how we continue to view the world. But I'll let maybe Bill provide a bit more color.\n\nBill Drew: Yes, Danny. I'd say typically what you see in Q2 is built in North America and then somewhat of a step down at times in Europe and APAC just given the seasonality. I think for us, we are expecting something similar like that to continue. But again, as Omar mentioned, we're expecting a little bit more of a 47%, 48% contribution to the top line first half versus back half. So getting back to that kind of cadence.\n\nDanny Eggerichs: Okay. That's helpful. Maybe one more for me on automation, I guess. Maybe an update on the pipeline there, order activity. I don't know if I missed it. But how are the bookings this quarter? I know we've kind of been seeing record bookings over the last couple. So any additional color there would be helpful.\n\nOmar Asali: Yes. Honestly, we continue to perform very, very well. In Q1, we did have another record booking. Our level of activity, our funnel activity is pretty high. We feel very confident that for the year top line growth in automation globally will be north of 50% which is important for us. And frankly, our visibility -- as you can imagine, we're working with our funnel and our pipeline toward some 25 activity and that activity is looking good as we keep sort of ramping up our installed base and, hopefully, have more and more repeat customers which is really important in automation, in particular, with large customers. So I would say we're on track. In automation, level of activity is good. Our bookings continue to be very healthy. And we're pretty confident in the 50%-plus growth profile this year.\n\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Ghansham Panjabi with Baird.\n\nGhansham Panjabi: I guess, Omar, maybe stepping back a little bit just from a macroeconomic standpoint, we saw what you did in the first quarter with North America, Europe and APAC, etcetera. But from an end market standpoint, adjusting for some of the new initiatives and so on and so forth that you have underway, especially in North America, how do you see the momentum across the end markets as you think about the regions globally?\n\nOmar Asali: Yes. I think if -- from an end market standpoint and this applies to North America and, frankly, other geographies, we continue to see healthy trends and recovery in e-commerce, Ghansham. We continue to see relatively decent activity with retailers doing more with shipping and sort of building their online capabilities. I think industrial activity is a little bit more uneven. Frankly, the largest probably sluggishness we see are in markets like in Germany and Central Europe. I visited the regions a couple of times already. This year, I do think CEOs are nervous in some of these markets given the macro backdrop, etcetera. But there's a lot of chatter in Europe about how important manufacturing and industrial activity is and I'm expecting that we will start seeing some pickup and some improvement, whether it's driven by companies, by governments, by both. I don't expect Europe to just accept that -- their most important sector is going to be slow. So I think we're expecting that, that level of activity will become a little bit better. But there's no doubt what we're seeing some strength at is more around e-commerce and around different areas in e-commerce, whether you're seeing that in books and in publishing, whether you're seeing it in some level in beauty or in guys that are just general merchandise. That level of business feels a little bit better than where it was a few quarters ago.\n\nGhansham Panjabi: And then in terms of your market positioning, right, because you had a very strong first-to-market advantage. The markets have normalized. Your competitors, including those that sell different substrates have been kind of reorganizing and trying to come back with some sort of fiber-based offering for protective packaging, etcetera. Just your thoughts in terms of any change in the competitor backdrop as you think about your major end markets? And then just, lastly, in terms of raw material cost inflation. I mean, upstream pulp prices have picked up quite a bit. And I know you've been benefiting from some level of deflation and rightfully so, just given how you came off the peak inflation cycle from a few quarters back. But just your thoughts in terms of the forward-looking indicators for inflation specific to Ranpak as well.\n\nOmar Asali: Sure. So on the first point, Ghansham, let's call it the competitive landscape, I really like where we are for a couple of reasons. One, I am convinced we're in the right substrate and that gives us a competitive advantage. Paper and fiber-based solutions are 100% of our thinking and execution. And we continue to see the shift from plastic to paper. Frankly, it's very pronounced in the U.S. now. It's been pronounced in other geographies that I visited and that we've been seeing those trends there for a while. So I like how we're positioned there. I also like that our investment cycle is behind us. From a strategic standpoint, Ranpak is stable. We're in execution mode. We're very focused on driving key initiatives like driving PPS volume, driving automation, generating cash flow. I feel our team is focused. And our organization, honestly, has not been in a better spot in a long time than the spot that we're in right now. It's literally down to execution, execution, execution. And I think that sets us apart. I do see that in a lot of account activity, some of it large strategic account activity that we mentioned a lot on this call, some of it is small and medium-sized, where I feel our ability to win these accounts to expand our business with them is terrific. And I feel competitively we're very well positioned. I think the combination of PPS and automation is going to accrete a lot more value for us. We are truly a full-service solution for end-of-line needs for automation. We're a full solution for PPS that's fiber-based for -- needs for so many industries. And I think what we bring to the table to a lot of our customers and I see it in our dialogue, Ghansham, I think it's very compelling. And now it's up to us as a team to basically work our asset base and execute on the plan that's ahead of us. As far as your second question on inflation and pricing, I would say from a Ranpak perspective, the first half of the year we pretty much have very good visibility in terms of pricing and the environment and where our deals are from a commodity standpoint and we feel very good about how we're positioned. We have secured supply for part of our needs for the second half of the year. We are negotiating other parts. I would say the landscape is a little bit shifting, as we mentioned in the call, where you're starting to see with consolidation in the paper industry, with the dynamic -- with geopolitical risks and the dynamic of, frankly, the switch to paper, you're starting to see some pricing pressure and increases. I feel very good, Ghansham, that we will be able to negotiate and secure the supply that we want in the second half of the year given our size, that we will be able to get sort of the cost structure that we want. And if there is a little bit of pressure from a cost standpoint, we will react from a pricing standpoint. So our expectations is that we will be able to deliver the margin profile that, as Bill said, we fought so hard to get to. And I think this is a year where we will be able to manage what happens in the landscape but it may require a little bit more work in the second half of the year than in the first half. Does that give you a good sense?\n\nGhansham Panjabi: It does, it does. Thank you, Omar. Appreciate that.\n\nOperator: And your next question comes from the line of Adam Samuelson with Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS).\n\nAdam Samuelson: Maybe first something that, Bill, you alluded to in the prepared remarks, I just wanted to clarify. So there was a litigation settlement that was -- it was \u20ac20 million of cash that you received in April. Can you just maybe elaborate a little bit on that? Is there a tax impact on that, just to make sure we're clear? It's not something that had been previously in any of the filings. So any additional color would be helpful.\n\nBill Drew: Sure, Adam. So this was a litigation matter that had been ongoing for a number of years just related to some patent infringement. So it was great to get this settled, get it behind us, get the cash proceeds in. At this point, right, the proceeds are gross. So we'll have the tax impact when we go to file our tax returns in the following year. But for now, that cash goes straight to the balance sheet. So it's nice to get some additional yield on that cash and be able to maximize liquidity ahead of any potential refinancing later this year.\n\nOmar Asali: And Adam, just to add, the \u20ac20 million settlement is \u20ac15 million settlement on the litigation and about \u20ac5 million on us giving them some rights to a couple of patents we have. So the total proceeds will be -- as Bill said, is the \u20ac20 million. But it's these 2 separate things that got us there. And then in terms of tax impact, obviously, that's something that we will be assessing based on the 2 transactions that I outlined for the rest of the year. But this was a real good conclusion for us. And we get to move on and as I said a little bit earlier, just execute on our business plan and not have too many open matters.\n\nAdam Samuelson: Okay. No, that's very helpful. And then as we think about some of the strategic accounts, Omar, that are starting to kind of come to fruition in the core business in the second quarter, how should we think about installed base trends rolling forward? Is that going to drive a pickup in void-fill and in cushioning machine placements through the year? Or is there a little bit further decline before those start to re-accelerate?\n\nOmar Asali: We have been laser-focused, Adam, as you know, about redeploying, refurbishing and working our asset base to the extent possible. And that continues to be our priority, given in the last couple of years we did feel that some accounts were overcapitalized. And the world changed and we needed to react. And we continue to do that. So that's priority one. With some of the large strategic accounts and as we're ramping those up, just given the scale of some of these accounts, redeploying and refurbing, etcetera, may not be enough to meet the demands that we're seeing. So you will see some pickup that we've already planned for in Q1 because we're, frankly, ramping up as we speak some of these accounts. I don't think you're going to see something that's going to move the needle at 140,000 installed base. It will be maybe a modest increase from the last couple of quarters for us to fulfill the needs of these customers. But we're trying to be very, very prudent with our CapEx and how we fulfill these customer demands. And the beauty of some of these large accounts, Adam, is the efficiency per converter, the efficiency per machine, given volume, sometimes tends to be above what we've offered other customers just given sheer needs. So they tend to be pretty efficient from a CapEx standpoint.\n\nOperator: That concludes the Q&A session. I will now turn the conference back over to Bill Drew for closing remarks.\n\nBill Drew: Thanks, Benjamin. And thank you everybody for joining us today. We look forward to catching up next quarter.\n\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes today's call. Thank you all for joining.

All participants will be in a listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] After the today's presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Please note this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Chris Witty, Investor Relations Adviser. Please go ahead, sir.\n\nChris Witty: Thank you, and good morning. With me on the call today are Jeff Woosnam, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Rich Ambury, Chief Financial Officer.

I'd now like to turn the call over to Jeff Woosnam. Jeff?\n\nJeff Woosnam: Thanks, Chris, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us to discuss our second quarter and fiscal year-to-date results. Temperatures in the second quarter were 15.2% warmer than normal throughout Star's footprint. While slightly colder than the same period last year, it was unfortunately not enough to drive higher delivery volumes. However, we were able to move the impact on adjusted EBITDA, even with a lower weather hedge benefit and some ongoing inflationary pressures, by improving per gallon margins and employing solid expense control. We also kept net customer attrition at modest levels during the quarter and, as previously noted, closed on two strategic acquisitions in February on Long Island, giving us a total of four transactions thus far in the current fiscal year. Our team has remained very busy evaluating various heating oil and propane opportunities that align with our goal of strengthening and broadening our portfolio of brands. Through the first six months of fiscal 2024, temperatures were 0.2% warmer than the same period last year and 14.7% warmer than normal. While there is nothing we can do to control the weather, we believe our team is quite adept at adjusting to it and making the most of the conditions. An area of note is the year-over-year improvement we've made in service and equipment installation profitability, which has been an area of focus for us. I'm quite pleased with our progress, which I believe is evidence of the quality of service that we provide, and certainly a direct result of the hard work and dedication of our employees. With the heating season now behind us, we believe we are well positioned for the remainder of fiscal 2024, as well as the opportunities that summer brings to further invest in our people and business development activities. With that, I'll turn the call over to Rich to provide additional comments on the quarter's results. Rich?\n\nRich Ambury: Thanks, Jeff, and good morning, everyone. For the second quarter, our home heating oil and propane volume decreased by 4 million gallons, or roughly 3%, to 117 million gallons, as the additional volume provided from acquisitions and colder weather was more than offset by net customer attrition and other factors. Temperatures for the fiscal 2024 second quarter were 7% colder than last year, but still 15% warmer than normal. Our product gross profit increased by $3 million, or 1.5%, to $206 million, as an increase in per gallon margins was reduced by the 3% decline in home heating oil and propane volume sold. Delivery and branch expenses increased by $8 million year-over-year, of which $6.4 million was attributable to our weather hedging program. In the second quarter of fiscal 2024, we recorded a benefit of $6.5 million under our weather hedge, compared to a benefit of $12.5 million recorded in the comparable period last year. Recent acquisitions accounted for an increase of $1.8 million in operating expenses. We posted a net income of $68 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2024, or $6 million more than the prior year period, reflecting the after-tax impact of a noncash, favorable change in the fair value of derivative instruments of $15 million, and a $6 million decrease in adjusted EBITDA. Adjusted EBITDA declined by $6 million to $96 million, as an increase in home heating oil and propane per gallon margins was more than offset by the 4 million gallon decrease in home heating oil and propane volume sold, and a $6.4 million decline in our weather hedge benefit. Turning to the results for the first half of fiscal 2024, our home heating oil and propane volume declined by 13 million gallons, or 6%, to 197 million gallons, again as the additional volume provided from acquisitions was reduced by slightly warmer temperatures, net customer attrition, and other factors. Temperatures for the first half of fiscal 2024 were just 0.2% warmer than last year and 15% warmer than normal. Our product gross profit decreased by $3 million, or 1%, to $351 million, as the impact of higher home heating oil and propane per gallon margins was largely offset by lower motor fuel gross profit and a 6% decline in home heating oil and propane volume. Delivery, branch, and G&A expenses rose by $4.8 million year-over-year, of which $5 million was attributable to our weather hedging program. In fiscal 2024, we recorded a benefit of $7.5 million under our weather hedge, compared to a $12.5 million benefit recorded in the first half of fiscal 2023. We had net income of $81 million for the first six months of fiscal 2024, or $6 million higher than the prior year period, largely due to the after-tax impact of a noncash favorable change in the fair value of derivative instruments of $13 million, partially offset by a decrease in adjusted EBITDA of $6 million. Adjusted EBITDA declined by $6 million to $145 million as an increase in home heating oil and propane per gallon margins was more than offset by a 13 million gallon decrease in home heating oil and propane volume sold and a $5 million decline in the weather hedge benefit year-over-year. The decrease in adjusted EBITDA of $6 million was muted by a $2 million favorable change in net interest expense. As a result, our after-tax cash flow declined by approximately $2.7 million. And we'd like everyone to note that for fiscal 2025, we have put in $15 million of weather hedges. If we had the same amount of coverage in place during 2024 and the same temperatures, we would have been paid an additional $7.5 million more in fiscal 2024 for a total of $15 million under the weather hedges. And with that, I'll turn the call back to Jeff.\n\nJeff Woosnam: Thanks, Rich. At this time, we're pleased to address any questions you may have. Anthony, please open the phone lines for questions.\n\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from Tim Mullen (NASDAQ: MULN ) with Laurelton Management.\n\nTim Mullen: First, just given the larger size of the acquisitions that you've completed more recently, I was just wondering if you could provide any color on those businesses in terms of their strategic objective. I mean, obviously, from a geographical standpoint, they seem like natural fits for you all, but just wanted to see if you could provide any color, types of customers, product fit, any financial information regarding the acquisitions.\n\nJeff Woosnam: Sure. So, we closed on two acquisitions in November. Both of those were heating oil acquisitions, smaller opportunities that are tuck-ins to our existing New Jersey operations, and then we closed on two businesses in February -- in early February, one was a propane business and the other one a heating oil business, as I mentioned, both located in Long Island.\n\nTim Mullen: I know typically you don't like to give any financial information, but is there any color you can provide on multiples or kind of anything along those lines?\n\nRich Ambury: No, not at this time.\n\nTim Mullen: Okay. And then, just when you think about the business more kind of on a medium and longer-term basis, how do you think about the possibility of homes transitioning away from using home heating oil as their energy source, and does that impact M&A strategy or how you think about organic growth?\n\nJeff Woosnam: Yes. I guess what I'd say is, I don't want to necessarily comment on specific state or federal legislation and how that might impact our business long-term. We as a business and as an industry feel like we've made a very strong commitment to bioheat, which is a blend of renewable biodiesel and ultra-low-sulfur heating oil, and have increased our sales of that product and have committed to continue to do that. We all have, I guess, our views on the whole energy transition and how quickly it's going to occur, but we feel like we're properly positioned to deal with those changes.\n\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question will come from Michael Prouting with 10K Capital.\n\nMichael Prouting: Yes. I had a question related actually to the prior questions on acquisitions. It seems like the pace of acquisitions has picked up recently. Jeff, I'm just wondering if that's a reflection of sellers being or rather [harnessing] more willing to sell. And then, I guess, related to that, even though you might not want to comment on the valuations of the acquisitions you've closed, I'm just wondering what you're seeing in the market as far as multiples are concerned, and I guess also related to the prior question, if multiples are reflecting both the warmer weather environment as well as transition risks.\n\nJeff Woosnam: Sure, Michael. Yes. So, our team has been very busy. As I mentioned, we've closed on four transactions already this year that we feel are high quality. What I'd say is, it kind of goes ebbs and flows, the activity level and the businesses that are on the market. What I would note is that what we've been evaluating more recently over the last six months have been what we would consider some very high-quality businesses that seem to be a very good fit for us. And it's hard to predict what is actually going to come to fruition from that. We have to go through our process. We're going to remain very disciplined in that regard. And we'll just have to see how that plays out. I have not seen multiples depressed in any way as a result of weather. And we typically, when we're evaluating a business, we'll kind of normalize the results when we value the business.\n\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] At this point, there appears to be no further questions in the queue, so I'll turn it back to Mr. Woosnam for any closing remarks.\n\nJeff Woosnam: Well, thank you for taking the time to join us today and for your ongoing interest in Star Group. We look forward to sharing our 2024 fiscal third quarter results in August. Thank you, everyone.\n\nOperator: The conference is now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation.

And welcome to The Marcus Corporation First Quarter Earnings Conference Call. My name is Lauren, and I will be your operator for today [Operator Instructions]. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. Joining us today are Greg Marcus, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Chad Paris, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer of The Marcus Corporation. At this time, I'd like to turn the program over to Mr. Paris for his opening remarks. Please go ahead, sir.\n\nChad Paris: Thanks, Lauren. Good morning, and welcome to our fiscal 2024 first quarter conference call. I need to begin by stating that we plan to make a number of forward-looking statements on our call today, all of which we intend to qualify for the safe harbors from liability established by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act. Our forward-looking statements may generally be identified by our use of words such as we believe, anticipate, expect or words of similar import. Our forward-looking statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties, which may cause our actual results to differ materially from those expected. Listeners are cautioned not to place undue reliance on our forward-looking statements. The risks and uncertainties, which could impact our ability to achieve our expectations identified in our forward-looking statements are included under the heading Forward-Looking Statements in the press release we issued this morning announcing our fiscal 2024 first quarter results and in the Risk Factors section of our fiscal 2023 annual report on Form 10-K, which you can access on the SEC's Web site. We will also post all Regulation G disclosures when applicable on our Web site at marcuscorp.com. The forward-looking statements made during this conference call are only made as of the date of this conference call, and we disclaim any obligation to publicly update such forward-looking statements to reflect subsequent events or circumstances. In addition, we routinely post news releases and other information regarding developments at our company that impact our investors, customers, vendors and other stakeholders. You should look at our Web site, marcuscorp.com, as an important source of information regarding our company. We also refer you to the disclosures we provided in today's earnings press release regarding the use of adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP measure used in evaluating our performance and its limitations. A reconciliation of adjusted EBITDA to the nearest GAAP measure is provided in today's release. All right. With that behind us, let's begin. This morning, I'll start by spending a few minutes sharing the results from our first quarter with you and discuss our balance sheet and liquidity. And then I'll turn the call over to Greg, who will focus his prepared remarks on where our businesses are today and what we are seeing ahead. We'll then open up the call for questions. This morning, we reported a quarter in which we expected to face significant headwinds. The first quarter is always a seasonally challenging quarter with slower leisure travel at our Midwestern hotels during the winter months and what is often a lighter movie slate coming out of Hollywood. In addition to the normal seasonality, this year, we knew we would face content supply challenges resulting from the prolonged movie production shutdown during last year's Hollywood strikes. With these challenges in mind, our teams were focused on closely managing our operations and the things that we can control. Our first quarter results were mixed in our two segments. Our hotel division delivered revenue, RevPAR and earnings growth on continued strength in our group business. While our theaters division was negatively impacted by the weaker film slate with significantly lower attendance, we managed expenses well on the lower revenues. I'll start with a few highlights from our consolidated results for the first quarter of fiscal 2024. Consolidated revenues of $138.5 million decreased $13.7 million or 9% compared to the prior year quarter, with revenue growth in our hotels and resorts division offset by the revenue decrease in our theater division. Operating loss for the quarter was $16.7 million, a decline of $7.7 million compared to the prior year quarter. Consolidated adjusted EBITDA for the fourth quarter was $2.3 million, a decrease of $7.2 million over the first quarter of fiscal 2023. Turning to our segment results. I'll start this morning with our hotels and resorts division. Revenues were $57.2 million for the first quarter of fiscal 2024, an increase of 2.5% compared to the prior year. Total revenue before cost reimbursements at our 7 owned hotels increased over $1.7 million or 3.8% over the first quarter of fiscal 2023. RevPAR for our comparable owned hotels grew 2.1% during the first quarter compared to the prior year, which resulted from an overall occupancy rate increase of 2.9 percentage points, partially offset by a 3.4% decrease in our average daily rate, or ADR. Our average fiscal 2024 first quarter occupancy rate for our owned hotels was 53.7%. The decrease in ADR resulted from an increase in our group rooms as a percentage of our overall room mix with growth in midweek group rooms sold, which generally increases occupancy at lower rates. Group rooms increased to 34.5% of our total room mix during the first quarter of fiscal 2024 compared to 28.9% in the prior year quarter. In addition, improved revenue management during slower weeks and midweek nights in the first quarter resulted in growing occupancy and RevPAR at lower daily rate offerings to optimize overall rooms revenue. Our success in growing group business and better revenue management was evident in our performance relative to our peers. According to data received from Smith Travel Research, comparable competitive hotels in our markets experienced effectively flat RevPAR growth of 0.1% for the fiscal first quarter of 2024 compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2023, indicating that our hotels outperformed their competitive set by 2.3 percentage points. When comparing our RevPAR results to comparable upper upscale hotels throughout the United States, the upper upscale segment experienced an increase in RevPAR of 2.0% during our first quarter compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2023, indicating that our hotels performed in line with the industry nationally. With the continued growth in group business and events, our banquet and catering operations continue to grow, with food and beverage revenues up 6.4% in the first quarter of fiscal 2024 compared to the prior year. Finally, hotels adjusted EBITDA increased slightly in the first quarter of fiscal 2024, an improvement of approximately $400,000 compared to the prior year quarter. Turning to theaters. Our first quarter fiscal 2024 total revenue of $81.3 million decreased 15.7% compared to the prior year first quarter. Comparable theater admission revenue decreased 13.8% over the first quarter of 2023, with comparable theater attendance decreasing 17.5%. Our first fiscal quarter began on December 29 and ended on March 28, and thus included three days between the holidays, but excluded the opening weekend of Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire at the end of March. When comparing our results to other exhibitors or industry data sources such as Box Office Mojo for the first quarter, it's important to note that the domestic box office decrease first calendar quarter was approximately 3.3 percentage points better than the domestic box office decrease for the comparable weeks in our first fiscal quarter. When using our comparable fiscal weeks according to data received from Comscore and compiled by us to evaluate our fiscal 2024 first quarter results, US box office receipts decreased 9% during our fiscal 2024 first quarter compared to US box office receipts during our fiscal 2023 first quarter, indicating that our performance lagged the industry by approximately 4.8 percentage points. We believe that our lower box office performance during the first quarter was primarily attributable to two factors, first, the biggest film of the quarter, Dune: Part Two, played exceptionally well on IMAX (NYSE:IMAX) screens, resulting in IMAX screens taking market share from our UltraScreen and SuperScreen PLF formats in certain markets. While we believe the overall customer experience on our PLF screens with recliner seating, laser projection and Dolby Atmos sound is second to none, the market and promotion approach for this film negatively impacted our PLF market share this quarter. We also believe the IMAX significant outperformance was unique to Dune and its distribution strategy as we saw a return to historical norms for PLF market share on Ghostbusters: Frozen Empire. In addition, we believe this dynamic was amplified in a quarter without many other big films playing on PLFs. And given our high penetration of PLFs across our circuit, we tend to outperform in periods when there is a greater supply of PLF content. Second, the total box office in our top seven markets underperformed the overall decrease in the national box office. We believe this is attributable to an unfavorable film mix that was light on family content and due to the stronger relative performance of Dune in markets where we do not have a presence. Our average admission price increased by 4.9% during the first quarter of fiscal '24 compared to last year. The increase in our admission per caps was primarily due to strategic pricing actions taken during fiscal 2023, which were partially offset by a decrease in the percentage of 3D ticket sales during the first quarter of '24 compared to the first quarter last year, which was favorably impacted by high 3D ticket sales from Avatar: The Way Of Water. Our average concession food and beverage revenues per person at our comparable theaters increased by 0.8% during the first quarter of fiscal 2024 compared to last year's first quarter. The increase was primarily due to inflationary pricing changes implemented during 2023 and was partially offset by a decrease in the number of concession items purchased per customer, which we believe is the result of fewer blockbuster films in the quarter, which tend to result in larger average purchase sizes as customers make a bigger event out of going to see the bigger films. Our top 10 films in the quarter represented approximately 62% of the box office in the first quarter of fiscal 2024 compared to 71% for the top 10 films in the first quarter last year. The less concentrated film slate resulted in an approximately 3 percentage point decrease in overall film cost as a percentage of admission revenues. On the lower revenues, theater division adjusted EBITDA during the first quarter of fiscal 2024 was $6.2 million compared to $13.8 million in the prior year quarter. Given the soft film slate, we closely managed operating hours and labor throughout the quarter. Shifting to cash flow and the balance sheet. Our cash flow from operations was a use of cash of $15.1 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2024 compared to cash used by operations of $7.7 million in the prior year quarter, with the increase in cash used primarily due to the lower EBITDA. As a reminder, our cash flow from operations in the first quarter is historically impacted by seasonal changes in working capital resulting from the slowdown in our businesses following the peak holiday season and by the timing of various year-end accounts payable and compensation payments. Total capital expenditures during the first quarter of fiscal 2024 were $15.4 million compared to $8.9 million in the first quarter of fiscal '23. A large portion of our capital expenditures during the first quarter were invested in renovation projects in the hotel business at The Pfister Hotel and Grand Geneva Resort & Spa, with the balance going to maintenance projects in both businesses. Our capital investments and renovation projects have progressed as planned, and we continue to expect capital expenditures for fiscal 2024 of $60 million to $75 million, recognizing that the timing of several of our planned expenditures are still just estimates at this time. We are still finalizing the scope and timing of various projects and the actual timing of these projects will impact our final capital expenditures number for the year. We will update our capital expenditure estimates as the year progresses. In addition to our capital expenditures, during the first quarter, we also invested approximately $4 million in a joint venture that acquired the Loews Minneapolis Hotel, a 251-room full-service luxury hotel that Greg will discuss further. This investment and our ability to execute on this deal is a great example of the flexibility and strategic advantage that our strong balance sheet and liquidity provide, making us an attractive asset buyer to sellers in allowing us to move quickly when attractive investment opportunities become available. Our balance sheet remains strong, and we ended the first quarter with $17 million in cash and over $237 million in total liquidity with the debt to capitalization ratio of 27% and net leverage of 1.7 times net debt to adjusted EBITDA. With that, I will now turn the call over to Greg.\n\nGreg Marcus: Thanks, Chad. Good morning, everyone. We entered the year with a mixed short-term outlook in our two businesses. In hotels, we saw a continuing trend of strong group bookings, an overall healthy economy with steady travel demand, significant events and demand drivers in our markets and several recently renovated properties in our portfolio with strong positioning in their markets. By contrast, in theaters, we know we would have to navigate a short-term content supply disruption resulting from the shutdown of movie production during the 2023 Hollywood strikes that would likely create challenges for several quarters. As I shared on our last call, January and February got off to a slow start. And while I'm happy to share that March was better, it was still a tough quarter for the movies. We anticipated these short-term challenges in our industry, and we manage the business accordingly. While the comparisons to last year are certainly tough, the overall company first quarter results are actually slightly better than what we expected. We often get asked why we have these two different businesses. And this quarter, along with the last several years, have really illustrated the benefits of our diversified business model that can provide a counterbalance when we encounter periodic bumps in one of our businesses. While the short-term expectations for our theater and hotel divisions are going to differ this year, our long-term outlook for both businesses remains positive and optimistic, and we expect growing momentum in the back half of the year. I'll start today with our hotel and resorts division. You've seen the segment numbers, and Chad shared some additional detail on the performance metrics, including our outperformance to the comp sets and our in-line performance with upper upscale hotels nationally. As we've discussed in past years, there is significant seasonality in our hotel business, given that most of our company-owned hotels are located in the Midwest. We often lose money in this division during the winter months. And in the first quarter of fiscal 2024, we were at breakeven EBITDA, an improvement over our prior year EBITDA loss. There were a few notable trends in the quarter that I would like to highlight. I'll start with what we're seeing with average daily rates. Our average daily rates were down 3.4% in the first quarter compared to the first quarter last year, and the drivers of this are due to three factors; changes in our mix of business, changes in revenue management strategy and some market softening. I'll start with our mix of business. In the first quarter of 2024, group room revenue was over 34% of our overall mix of business compared with 29% of our mix last year. While group business is typically at lower rates and is dilutive to ADR, it allows us to grow midweek occupancy and is accretive to our overall RevPAR. In addition, the strength of our group business provides growth to our banquet and catering business, which grew 6.4% in the first quarter of 2024 compared to the first quarter last year. Secondly, we continue to refine and optimize revenue management. During the first quarter at select hotels, we adjusted our strategy to sell rooms at lower daily rates during low demand periods to drive occupancy and maximize revenue with our available room night capacity. This approach was particularly effective during the winter months when demand is seasonally low, and we were more aggressive on rates this year than we were last year. The net result was successful in growing our occupancy and overall RevPAR. Finally, we did see some general rate softening in the quarter at some of our properties. One quarter does not make a trend and the winter months are typically weak demand to begin with, but we do expect moderating ADR growth rates compared to last year, and we will continue to monitor the trend. RevPAR grew in three of our seven owned hotels with average daily rate growth at two hotels and occupancy growth at four out of seven hotels, resulting in overall RevPAR growth of 2.1%. Group business remains strong, and we're doing a great job capturing our share of group business. We have previously shared with you the strength in our group bookings over the last several quarters, and we're seeing that coming through the results. The bookings continue to look strong with our group room revenue bookings for the remainder of fiscal 2024, or group pace in the year, for the year, running approximately 23% ahead of where we were at this time last year. At approximately 11% of where we were at this time last year, excluding the impact of the upcoming Republican National Convention in Milwaukee this summer. Even more encouraging, our group pace for fiscal 2025 is running over 60% ahead of where we were at this time last year. Banquet and catering pace for the remainder of fiscal '24 and '25 is similarly ahead of where we were at this time last year. Chad mentioned our investments in renovations in our owned hotels this quarter. One benefit of our seasonality and slower winter months is it gives us an opportunity to complete these projects with limited disruption to hotel operations. We continue to make great progress on our renovation projects with most of the updated ballrooms and meeting space at Grand Geneva now back in service and the guest room renovation of the historic tower at The Pfister Hotel on track for completion in June. The updated spacing rooms look great, and our team has done a fantastic job executing these large and complex projects. As our hotel division heads into the busier spring and summer travel months, we are excited by what we see ahead. The investments we are making in our properties puts us in a great position to win in our markets. And of course, the Republican National Convention in July will be great for the entire city of Milwaukee and we're excited to showcase our wonderful community. Last quarter, I shared an update on our growth strategy in hotels and briefly commented on our pending acquisition of the Loews Minneapolis Hotel. Our joint venture closed on the hotel acquisition on March 1, and our team hit the ground running, taking over management of the hotel and executing our repositioning strategy for this property. The luxury lifestyle hotel was rebranded as The Lofton, a Tapestry Collection by Hilton Hotel. It was part of the Hilton reservation system on day 1 of our ownership and management. We will continue to make improvements at the hotel over the next year to create value and turn around what we believe is a property with great potential. Turning to theaters. Chad went over the numbers with you, including our continued increases in per person revenues. The beginning of the first quarter got off to a very different start than what we experienced last year when the industry benefited from strong holds on carryovers, Avatar: The Way of Water and Puss in Boots: The Last Wish. In fact, Avatar was the number one movie for the first 5 weeks of our fiscal 2023. While there were a number of good films in theaters over the holidays to continue to play into the new year, we didn't have a single blockbuster like Avatar that held as long and performed as strong in January this year. In terms of the quantity of wide-release films in the first quarter, we had a similar number of titles with 24 wide releases in the first quarter of fiscal 2024 compared to 23 in the first quarter last year. However, the first quarter slate this year was weaker overall, with lesser performances and fewer blockbuster films with no films in the first quarter opening over $100 million. And with an average opening weekend US box office gross per wide release film that was 25% lower than the same average in the first quarter last year. We believe this was another side effect of last year's Hollywood strikes with bigger titles getting pushed out on the film slate as a result of the moving production shutdown. And smaller films getting wide releases that would have normally been limited releases if the product supply were stronger. There were a few bright spots in the quarter with Dune: Part Two exceeding industry expectations and delivering on its potential, and Bob Marley: One Love surprising with a strong opening and a great run. Chad shared some of the market share dynamics that we believe impacted our market share on Dune with the film significantly outperforming on IMAX screens nationally, which only represents 3 of our 125 premium large-format screens. As Chad discussed, the IMAX performance on this film does appear to be unique to Dune and its distribution strategy as we saw a return to a more typical PLF market share with Ghostbusters: Frozen Empire. Chad also noted that our PLF strategy particularly benefits us when there are multiple significant films in the market at the same time. Our admission per caps were up 4.9% in the first quarter, and we were able to overcome the headwind from the high percentage of 3D tickets on Avatar last year. However, as we look forward, we expect our admission per cap growth rate to flatten as we have passed the 1-year anniversary of the pricing changes to our Value Tuesday promotion that we made in March last year. We will continue to review our regular non-Tuesday ticket prices in our markets to ensure we remain competitive and offer attractive value to all types of customers. This will be increasingly important as we work to incentivize customers to maintain the habit of moviegoing during periods of product gaps in the release calendar. In April, we were with our theater team at CinemaCon, and there were a few things I took away from this year's conference, first and most importantly, our studio partners. Film directors and talent all continue to reaffirm the importance of theatrical exhibition to the overall filmed entertainment ecosystem and our role in elevating their content. Second, we got a closer look at the film slate for the rest of the year and into 2025. And as we move past the supply chain issues from the strikes, there is a lot to be excited about with several great titles this summer and later this year that look really good, and we expect a strong -- a much stronger slate for 2025. The summer movie season kicks off tomorrow with the opening of The Fall Guy and is followed by a number of big titles, including Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes, Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga, Inside Out 2, Horizon: An American Saga, A Quiet Place: Day One, Despicable Me 4, Twisters and Deadpool & Wolverine. This fall, we are excited about Beetlejuice, Joker: Folie a Deux, Saw XI and Venom: The Last Dance. For the holidays, we look forward to Gladiator II, Moana 2, Wicked, The Lord of the Rings: The War of the Rohirrim, Kraven the Hunter, Mufasa and Sonic the Hedgehog 3. We continue to project 95 to 100 wide release films for 2024. As we look to next year, 2025, we'll feature several strong franchises, including Superman, Fast & Furious, Captain America, Mission: Impossible, Jurassic World, Karate Kid, The Fantastic Four, Snow White, Wicked 2 and Avatar 3, just to name a few. We've always taken a long-term view of managing our businesses. And as we look at the product supply ramping back up to and potentially exceeding 2023 levels in 2025, we remain very positive and optimistic about the long-term future for the industry and our theater business. Finally, I'd like to once again express my appreciation for our dedicated associates of The Marcus Corporation. Their outstanding work and commitment to serving our customers is responsible for our success, and we appreciate all that they do every day. They are our most important asset. So on behalf of our Board of Directors and our entire executive team, thank you to all of our associates. And with that, at this time, Chad and I would be happy to open up the call for any questions you may have.\n\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Eric Wold from B. Riley Securities.\n\nEric Wold: A few questions kind of based on some of the comments you made in your pre -- your opening remarks. I guess, one, other than the -- for the theater segment, other than the spending patterns around tickets and mostly concessions that are kind of influenced directly by the film slate. Can you talk about anything you're seeing from your theater customers in terms of their willingness to spend or changing their spending patterns? Any shifts in ticket price, any movements around upgrade, days of the week they visit, basket size, anything that would kind of give you more or less confidence in kind of the health of the consumer as you kind of enter hopefully a strengthened film slate in the coming quarters?\n\nGreg Marcus: It's -- look, it's hard to actually tell -- like, for example, do we know what days of the week they shift into, we don't know necessarily. We're not seeing a lot of -- it's hard to see where they've necessarily shifted from one or the other. We can see a little in our data from our loyalty stuff to see where people are moving. But look, I think the bigger thing that we want to be thoughtful about as we look forward and that is that the movie business tends to be a really -- if there is going to be weakness, and I think the jury is out. But if there's going to be weakness, the movie business tends to benefit from that in that they all saying, six out of the last eight recessions, the movie business got better. And that's -- because we become the most attractively priced out-of-home entertainment option for people. And so for us, we then make sure that our pricing is appropriate to capture that customer who may be feeling some economic stress and being smart about how we do that. But we don't have any -- it's still a little early.\n\nEric Wold: And then, Chad, you talked about, the theater segment -- sticking with the theater segment still, you talked about some of the market share loss around Dune 2, given the strength of IMAX and what IMAX did to kind of really promote and market that film as shot with IMAX cameras and the best way you could see it and all that. Knowing that IMAX's goal over the coming years, and they've got an increased slate of films shot with IMAX cameras that will be coming out later this year and into next year, even if we get a more robust film slate overall that can be playing in your PLF and you've got more versatility there, is there a risk of sustained share shift if that becomes an increasing part of IMAX's strategy and the studio strategy to use IMAX in that way?\n\nChad Paris: I mean, this -- Dune was a pretty unique movie, Eric, in the magnitude of the shift that we saw. And when we look back at films that were similar last year, we didn't see that shift. And then when we look at the other films that would be a good fit for PLFs in the first quarter, which -- that's a limited sample size, we didn't see it at all. In fact, we saw it go back to historical norms. So as I said in my prepared remarks, it really gets amplified when we don't have a lot of PLF content. And we -- as you know, we have such a high penetration of PLFs across our circuit that we do really well when there's more than one big film to show in any given quarter, and we just didn't have that this quarter. So we'll continue to monitor the dynamics here. But they've -- I would just say they've had that strategy with other films last year. Oppenheimer was one that I would point out. And even with Ghostbusters, it was -- it had similar -- shown an IMAX-type promotion, and we didn't see it there. So we'll continue to monitor it, but we feel pretty good about how our PLFs are set up in the customer experience.\n\nEric Wold: And then last question for me. I guess more of a corporate philosophical question. I mean, the stock price is at kind of the lowest level it's been in 10 years, excluding the pandemic hit. I guess, given the optimism you guys have, and I think we all have on the box office recovery path post this strike-impacted year along with your ability to kind of continue to grow the hotel segment. When do buybacks become a better use of cash flow? I know there is some uncertainty around CapEx needs with the hotel segment and one of your properties there. But just thinking about when does that become a better use of capital than maybe something else given what we could see in the coming years from both of your segments?\n\nChad Paris: I guess I'll start with, I think you're right. We certainly have strong conviction and optimism long term on both of these businesses. But we are weighing several things on capital allocation. The $60 million to $75 million of CapEx this year is certainly significant and a big ramp-up in the hotel business, and we've got some other reinvestments to consider as we head into next year also in the hotel business. But it creates a unique opportunity down here at the share price, and we want to clean up the capital structure. So there's a few different ways that you can look at share repurchases, and we've got to convert that is coming due next year that we're going to want to deal with over the course of the next one and half years. So those are all the things that we're thinking through, but we do have an open authorization on share repurchases and opportunistically that's always an option for us.\n\nOperator: Our next question comes from Jim Goss from Barrington Research.\n\nJim Goss: One question on the hotel side with this conversion and purchase in Minneapolis to the Tapestry Collection. I'm not so familiar with that particular brand. I think you mentioned it was a luxury lifestyle hotel. I wonder if you could talk about that in terms of the pricing level and the incremental benefit you think you're going to be able to get out of that particular property?\n\nGreg Marcus: Well, the Tapestry Collection hotel is -- Tapestry Collection, it's Hilton. The goal is to get into the -- on the Hilton reservation system and on the Hilton loyalty program. So that's -- and that's one of their, what they call, soft brand. So it's not -- doesn't have the Hilton -- it's not called the Hilton, but it's Tapestry by Hilton, so it's pretty close. And again, it gets the benefits of being in their system. And we don't discuss specific hotel projections and increases, but trust that we expect that by moving to a stronger system, we expect that, that will drive increased performance.\n\nJim Goss: And One follow-up on the -- to Eric's question about Dune. I was wondering if you feel that particular movie had more of an urban focus. And to the extent that most of the competition you would have with IMAX would be in a smaller subsector of your markets where that would be a conflict. Do you think that's part of the issue, too, that it's just the nature of the film itself relative to your markets?\n\nGreg Marcus: We believe -- and we believe, generally, we've had some -- one of the things contributing this quarter was just a film mix stuff. When you get to the smaller films, they don't play as well in the Midwest. And Dune is not a smaller film. But again, that one had more -- when you get more urban focus, that's not where we shine. And so it's -- you're right, we were facing headwinds from that. And we even saw -- we have an IMAX in a pretty isolated market and its performance was not as robust as some of the other ones. So we have some insight into what's going on with IMAX because we do have a few of them. But it performed really well on IMAX, but it was -- that was one time one analyst wrote something about a tax treatment we got. Asked the question, is it an aberration or a revelation? I'm not sure it's a revelation.\n\nJim Goss: Also, I wanted to ask about the impact of the footprint optimization you've executed over recent years, along with the rest of the industry. I think you've been a little more aggressive than some. And I wonder what sort of headwind do you think that might characterize or you might be able to quantify in terms of the revenues you've been able to generate out of the theaters. Has that been significant, do you think? Maybe this is a Chad question.\n\nChad Paris: just to clarify, when we talk about our growth rates and our comparisons year-over-year, those are same-store numbers. And so I'll start with that. Then generally, in the locations that we've closed, we often have other theaters in the market. And what we're really doing is consolidating customers into other capacity in the market. Now is there -- are there some customers who may not come anymore because the theater that we closed was really close to them and they have to drive another 5 miles to get to our next closest theater. Yes, there's some -- there may be some level of that. But our general view is that our recapture of displaced customers is quite good. So that all goes into our analysis as we think about pruning the portfolio and looking underperforming locations. And our conclusion on the bottom line is that it's accretive to earnings and a bit of a headwind, perhaps top line revenue, but we try to recapture as many of those customers as we can.\n\nGreg Marcus: And generally -- remember, the stuff that we're closing, not exactly robust numbers, that there's not a lot to -- generally, not a lot to capture, to be honest.\n\nJim Goss: And one last one. A number of the companies in your sector have been talking more about alternative content. And I'm just wondering in terms of your particular markets, if there are any particular types of content that you might put on, say, during the week, in particular, that might resonate best with your particular customers.\n\nGreg Marcus: Again, Midwest, the faith based stuff works better with our customers. Some of the retro stuff is, like, we did a Harry Potter series that really performed nicely on our -- with our new passport, to be honest. And we talked about that in a prior call. So it really -- it depends, but that tends to be what does perform better for us. But we've had some -- we're playing more stuff. We're throwing a lot of spaghetti at the wall right now to find out what sticks and stuff will stick and some stuff is sticking.\n\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Mike Hickey from The Benchmark Company.\n\nMike Hickey: Greg, you mentioned maybe some softening on the hotel side tying in to weakness in ADR. You said it wasn't too early to be a trend here. And I get the seasonality piece, but obviously, you're probably adjusting for that. But could you just sort of give us a little bit more insight into what piece of that market is softening and what implications it could have and adjustments you would make if it does become more of a trend?\n\nGreg Marcus: Well, let me be careful. One of the things -- I think that we may have not been -- I mean, I'm not have been as clear. When I say we were -- our -- when we change some strategy, I would potentially say, at least my revenue management people would say to me that maybe we got a little too aggressive with some things last year that we sort of -- we re-strategized and changed our approach on a few places. That's not really reacting to the market so much as who's reacting to what we had done last year and looked back and said, gee, in a low demand period, we probably weren't -- we probably were too aggressive so we altered our strategy and it paid off. And the other thing, as we said in the call -- as we said in the remarks, part of it is a mix issue. If we're going to see a move from transient -- leisure transient to more of a group mix, we are going to sacrifice a little bit of rate, but we're going to also pick up ancillary revenue banquets and catering things like that. So those are trades that we're making that are really strategic, not so much saying that we're seeing a weakness in the customer. But look, if there's a weakness in the customer, we're going to react to what's going on in the market. We're going to watch what's happening. I think historically, we've looked back over time and cutting rates generally does not solve the problem because it doesn't generate more demand, it's just share shift. And one of the things that the industry seemed to be very good about through the pandemic was they didn't just cut rates. And so -- because it ended up being a zero-sum game. And my hope would be if there is a softening, it's not then the response is, well, let's all just cut rates and to try and -- because it won't be -- it won't drive demand. But we'll have to look at what's [Technical Difficulty] to the market.\n\nMike Hickey: So it sounds like the -- I mean, it's a weird quarter, like you said, I mean, a winter in Milwaukee is not maybe the best leisure travel. But that said, is it the leisure piece that was sort of holding and then group was picking up or is it just leisure was down a bit in the quarter? Is that sort of the takeaway?\n\nChad Paris: Mike, I would say, certainly, leisure was down in our overall mix because just of how much more group we were driving into the middle of the week. In terms of demand side, leisure was holding, but if you think about the last couple of years, we've had really strong rate growth, particularly being driven by leisure customers. And those growth rates are sequentially coming down as we kind of normalize here. So I -- our expectation for the year was low single-digit kind of overall RevPAR growth. And it's probably going to come more from a little bit of occupancy than -- this year than it is going to be the ADR that's driving it as it has the last couple of years. But yes, leisure is the pocket that is probably not going to be as strong as it was, not saying that it's weak.\n\nMike Hickey: And then on your gross profit within your concession business, looks like sort of you and your peers that are showing some pressure there, there looks like you're down nearly 6 percentage points in your concession gross profit in the quarter. So just curious if you could sort of dig in there. And if what that means, I guess, is a trend moving forward. And I guess you look at your hotel, food and beverage, and it looks like your margin there is actually holding up really well year-over-year. I think maybe it expanded. So it looks like it's sort of just on your theater concession side where you're feeling some pressure. Just curious with that. Why? And what sort of trend we should extrapolate, if any, from that?\n\nChad Paris: You should not extrapolate a trend from that. In the theater -- the way we report the theater concessions numbers, we did make some immaterial changes on how we classify some of those expenses in other areas of the P&L and just line them up better with how we think they should be reported. And again, immaterial, but that's really all that's driving the change. It's not an underlying change in the profitability of our concessions business.\n\nGreg Marcus: And by the way, on the hotel side, you get a mixed [FYI], that's the benefit of a mix shift, too, because the leisure customer is eating in our outlets. When you get to more of a group mix, you're getting more in the banquets and catering business, which is just a more profitable food and beverage operation.\n\nMike Hickey: Just to confirm, the -- your gross profit margin in concessions in 1Q is 57%. That's down from 63% prior year, and your average margin prior year was 61.5%. So should we model that closer to the 57% moving forward given the category shift here? Or is that going to go back up to above 60%?\n\nChad Paris: You can model it at the 57% because that's where it will continue to come through going forward. But there is an offset in other operating expenses that will run rate at a lower number.\n\nMike Hickey: But it should be about the net neutral then you're saying or is there a discretionary pressure on...\n\nChad Paris: Exactly, net neutral on total profitability...\n\nMike Hickey: Last question, just on your convertible note, you have some time to deal with that, but just curious the scenarios you're thinking through. And how you think about managing the potential dilution from that note?\n\nChad Paris: So you're right. We do have some time, one and half years until we really have to move on this. Although, on dilution, I don't think people should be really worried about it because we've got a cap call transaction -- a derivative over the convert that mitigates the dilution below [17.75], I think is where it is currently. That number changes a little bit as we pay dividends. But at the current share price, investors should not be expecting dilution from that. And I think we'll continue to look at what's the right time to take it out, Mike, but it will -- high level thinking on it is it will be cash rather than shares in terms of how we settle this.\n\nOperator: Thank you. At this time, it appears there are no other questions. So I'd like to turn the call back to Mr. Paris for any additional or closing remarks.\n\nChad Paris: Great. Thanks, Lauren. We'd like to thank everybody for joining us again today, and we look forward to talking to you once again in early August when we release our second quarter results. Until then, thank you, and have a great day.\n\nOperator: That concludes today's call.

Beginning on Page 3. Our first quarter financial performance was driven by continued strong topline growth in Electronics and progression across each of our key priorities for 2024. Our efforts to reduce material costs and improve our operating efficiency contributed to a 170 basis point improvement in gross margin, a 160 basis point improvement in operating margin and a 120 basis point improvement to EBITDA margin over the first quarter of last year. Additionally, we remain focused on cash performance and improvement in our leverage ratio. During the quarter, we generated $9.1 million of operating cash, an improvement of $18.3 million compared to the first quarter of last year. This is due in part to our continued efforts to reduce our inventory balance, which declined by $7.9 million. As a result, our leverage ratio improved by approximately a quarter of a turn relative to the end of 2023. Despite the significant momentum we have and the fundamentals of the business, we must continue to focus on mitigating some of the historical execution issues that resulted in $2 million of incremental warranty-related costs this quarter. Through recent actions taken to centralize and redesign product line and program management organizations, as well as our global engineering organization, we are specifically focused on improving built-in quality, reducing material costs and improving manufacturing efficiency to drive profitability. There is no question. We are seeing the positive impact of these structural changes and expect the momentum from these changes to drive improved profitability as we continue to grow. In fact, as a result of the improvement, we expect due to these changes, despite some of the challenges in the first quarter, we are maintaining our full-year 2024 guidance. Matt will provide further detail on our first quarter performance and our full-year guidance later in the call. While we continue to improve our existing programs, we remain focused on flawless execution of the program launches that will drive strong growth going forward. Our next MirrorEye OEM programs launched with Volvo in Europe and with Peterbilt in North America later this year, followed by two additional programs in North America in the first quarter of next year. Last week, Peterbilt announced the introduction of its new Digital Vision System-Mirrors as an option on both the Model 579 and Model 567 trucks, which helped improve driver safety and improve fuel economy by up to 1.5%. We will continue to work with all of our OEM customers, their dealer networks and the fleets to drive MirrorEye adoption. We are seeing good momentum across our MirrorEye end markets and applications and expect continued growth as we launch new OEM programs, increased take rates for existing OEM programs and continue to expand our fleet activities with both new and existing customers. Furthermore, we expect our next-generation tachograph, the Smart 2 to provide significant growth in both OEM and aftermarket applications over the next several years based on the requirements of the EU Mobility Package standard. I will provide more details of these regulation requirements and our expectations for our Smart 2 tachograph program later in the call. Page 4 summarizes our key financial metrics for the first quarter of this year compared to the first quarter of 2023. First quarter sales growth of 3% was driven by strong topline growth in our Electronics segment due in part to the ramp-up of the recently launched Smart 2 tachograph program in Europe. This was offset by lower sales in the North American passenger vehicle end market, primarily due to the slowing demand for electric vehicles as well as some end-of-life programs which we expected. Our growth of 3% compares to an approximately flat weighted average end market over the same time. We expect to continue to outperform our underlying end markets driven by new launches and the continued ramp-up of recently launched programs. Driven by continued progression on key company initiatives, margins continued to expand in the first quarter compared to last year. Material cost improvement actions and our focus on manufacturing efficiency contributed to the 170 basis point improvement in gross margin over the first quarter of last year. We will continue to implement material cost improvement opportunities to further enhance the impact of actions already taken. Operating margin improved by 160 basis points over the first quarter of last year due to our continued focus on a lean, efficient operating structure, including the centralization of certain functions to create more streamlined processes and reduced operating costs. Earlier this week, we continue to take action to improve our engineering organization by rebalancing our footprint to improve our capacity and our capabilities and reduce our total costs. Finally, EBITDA margin improved by 120 basis points compared to the first quarter of last year. This was despite non-operating foreign currency and equity interest expenses that unfavorably impacted the current quarter by approximately $2.3 million. Excluding the incremental warranty and non-operating expenses in the quarter, EBITDA would have been approximately $10.9 million or 4.6% of revenue. And Matt will provide additional details on our segment level performance later in the call. Turning to Page 5. This morning, I would like to provide an update on our Smart 2 tachograph program that continues to ramp up in Europe on both OEM and aftermarket applications. As discussed on prior calls, the Smart 2 tachograph is our next-generation tachograph that provides incremental capabilities to conform with the EU Mobility Package standards. The mobility package is a collection of European laws and regulations for the transport sector and then contains new rules to improve social conditions for drivers, increased road safety and provide equal access to European markets. As such, the regulation requires the adoption of the second-generation tachograph, Smart 2, on various vehicle types over the next several years. Beginning in mid-August of last year, the second-generation smart tachograph was required to be on all newly registered vehicles over 3.5 tons, which comprises our existing OEM market. In addition, before the end of 2024, all international transport vehicles with existing analog or 1B digital tachographs are required to retrofit their vehicles to this new technology, which is the basis for what drives our aftermarket opportunity this year. As a result of these requirements, the incremental content on next-generation product and our current estimates of addressable market, we are estimating Smart 2 tachograph revenue to be approximately $60 million in 2024 for both OEM and aftermarket applications. As this product is based on both OEM orders and aftermarket customer adoption, the timing of the revenue contribution is more variable than what is typical for purely OEM programs. As a result, we saw a slower ramp-up in aftermarket sales in the first quarter as end users hoped for a pushout of the regulatory requirements or are simply delaying adoption until closer to the deadline. Recently, the European Commission, which governs the adoption of the mobility package reiterated the existing deadlines and requirements. As such, we are expecting an uptick in aftermarket sales going forward as the addressable market this year has not changed and the regulations remain as previously communicated. This should provide both revenue growth and accretive margin benefit for the remainder of the year as our aftermarket channel continues to ramp up. Looking beyond 2024, there are incremental regulations requiring adoption on additional vehicles in Europe, which is expected to drive continued growth for the next few years. These incremental requirements come online in 2025 and 2026 and expand the requirements to more vehicles, including vehicles equipped with first-generation tachographs and smaller vehicles between 2.5 and 3.5 tons that are involved in international transport. Overall, the mobility package and the new Smart 2 tachograph legislation represent a significant step forward for the transportation industry in Europe. By increasing road safety, improving working conditions and ensuring fair competition, the EU is creating a more sustainable and efficient transport sector for the future, and Stoneridge is very excited to be part of it. Based on the regulatory requirements and the competitive landscape for this product, we expect significant growth over the next several years with at least a 30% market share and $100 million in peak annual revenue. This program is yet another example of our strong portfolio of technologies and vehicle systems aligned with global industry megatrends. As part of our long-term strategy, we remain focused on vehicle intelligence and connectivity as we expand our content per vehicle to drive continued long-term growth. Turning to Page 6. I'd like to take this opportunity to mention that I'm extremely proud that we recently released our inaugural Sustainability Report, detailing our latest efforts and our ongoing commitment to environmental, social and governance initiatives. Our commitment to sustainability and social responsibility is a core component of our business strategy. This begins with our well-positioned technology-forward product portfolio aligned with improving vehicle safety and efficiency as well as reducing greenhouse gas emissions. At Stoneridge, we strive for continual improvements in our operations that deliver a lasting impact on the environment and our society, benefiting our employees, our customers and the communities that we serve. Through our continued efforts, we have made meaningful progress towards our sustainability goals, including reducing our Scope 1 and Scope 2 greenhouse gas emissions by 18.6%, reducing our absolute water withdrawal by 5.8%, creating a safe workspace environment and minimizing our environmental footprint in our manufacturing facilities over time. Our Sustainability Report marks a significant step in Stoneridge's sustainability journey and reflects our dedication to transparency, accountability and continuous improvement. I would like to express my gratitude to the Stoneridge team for their efforts and contributions in this space and on publishing such a meaningful report. I encourage all of you to visit our sustainability website if you have not done so already. Turning to Page 7. We remain committed to the 2024 goals I outlined on our fourth quarter call. First, we are focused on driving continued growth and market outperformance. As discussed earlier on the call, we are maintaining our 2024 revenue guidance midpoint of $1 billion, which is expected to outperform our weighted average underlying end markets by 8 percentage points. As discussed earlier on the call, we outperformed our weighted average OEM end markets in the first quarter and expect this to continue driven primarily by Stoneridge specific growth drivers, including new programs, incremental content and the expansion of our existing opportunities. Second, we are focused on gross margin expansion through material cost improvement in an enterprise-wide operational excellence. We remain keenly focused on these initiatives as we achieved gross margin expansion of 170 basis points over the first quarter of 2023. As we continue to focus on quality-related costs and recognize the run rate benefits of these material costs and operational actions, we expect continued gross margin expansion. Third, we are focused on leveraging our global footprint to maximize our capabilities and output. Based on the actions taken last year to centralize many of our global functions and drive synergies between our business units from both a cost and efficiency perspective, we achieved 160 basis points of operating margin expansion in the first quarter, resulting in a 120 basis point improvement in EBITDA margin compared to the prior year. We continue to evaluate and optimize our organizational structure as shown by our recent actions taken in our engineering organization to rebalance our global footprint. Fourth, we are focused on efficient cash generation through effective inventory management. Through our focused efforts on reducing inventory to improve working capital and generate more cash, we reduced our inventory balance by $7.9 million, which translates to approximately an 8% improvement in inventory turns during the quarter. We remain focused on inventory reduction and cash performance. Finally, we are focused on efficient capital deployment, while maintaining an appropriate capital structure. This includes prioritizing our organic investment opportunities with a focus on return on engineering and investing in technology to develop new products for customers that will facilitate future growth. In 2024, we are targeting approximately $40 million of capital focused primarily on supporting organic growth initiatives. We remain on track to meet both our organic growth and capital expenditure targets for 2024. As evidenced by our progress made so far this year, this team is focused on executing against our priorities to drive strong growth, continued margin improvement and an improved balance sheet. We continue to see the benefits of the actions we took in 2023, and we'll continue to take actions aligned with our key priorities to drive performance. With that, I'll turn it over to Matt to discuss our financial results in more detail. Matt?\n\nMatthew Horvath: Thank you, Jim. Turning to Page 9. Sales in the first quarter were $239.2 million, an increase of 3% relative to the first quarter of 2023. Adjusted operating income was $300,000, which resulted in a 160 basis point improvement in operating margin relative to the first quarter of last year. As Jim discussed earlier in the call, we are maintaining our full-year 2024 guidance. Our full-year sales guidance midpoint of $1 billion is expected to outpace our weighted average OEM end markets by over 8 percentage points. We expect to outperform our end markets driven by the continued ramp-up of recently launched programs, including both the OEM and aftermarket applications of MirrorEye and the Smart 2 tachograph. We expect an improvement in our material costs for the remainder of the year will offset the incremental warranty costs we incurred in the first quarter. As such, we are maintaining our full-year gross margin expectations with a gross margin midpoint of 22.4%, which implies a 140 basis point expansion versus the prior year. Based on our efforts to drive a more efficient global operating structure, we expect that operating performance will remain within our previously provided range, but improved slightly relative to our prior expectations. As such, we are maintaining our full-year operating margin expectations with an operating margin midpoint of 3%, which implies a 130 basis point expansion versus last year. Similarly, we expect slightly improved operating performance to offset the non-operating foreign currency and equity interest expenses incurred in the first quarter. As a result, we are also maintaining our expectations for full-year EBITDA and EPS. Our expectation of approximately $67 million of EBITDA at the midpoint of our guidance range results in a 170 basis point improvement and 39% growth in EBITDA over 2023. We expect the revenue and EBITDA cadence for the year to be relatively consistent with previous expectations. However, we now expect the second quarter performance will be slightly better than previously expected to approximately breakeven EPS. Due to expanding MirrorEye sales in the second half of the year, primarily driven by new program launches and the continued ramp-up of the Smart 2 tachograph, we continue to expect revenue to be back half weighted. We expect slight growth from the first to the second quarter and relatively larger growth between the second and third quarter, aligned with these key program launches. Aligned with our revenue cadence for the year, we expect EBITDA to be more back half weighted as well. Based on the actions we have taken to improve our cost structure and our operating performance, we expect to continue to significantly outperform our underlying end markets and drive continued earnings expansion as the year progresses. Turning to Page 10. During the quarter, we were impacted by two warranty issues that accounted for approximately $2 million of incremental costs. Although, these issues are historical in nature, and we expect they have been contained through either reengineering or resourcing material, these incremental costs highlight the importance of our focus on execution to drive operational excellence and built-in quality going forward. We have taken actions that we expect to improve the operating structure and processes that have led to these issues historically, which resulted in the incremental warranty costs during the quarter. The quarter was also unfavorably impacted by approximately $2 million related to the non-operating impact that foreign currency had on intercompany balances and approximately $300,000 related to our minority interest in Autotech Ventures. Excluding the incremental warranty and non-operating expenses in the quarter, EBITDA would have been approximately $10.9 million or 4.6% of revenue. The first quarter was also impacted by unfavorable sales volume and product mix, primarily related to the reduced demand for electric vehicles compared to prior expectations and the retiming of Smart 2 tachograph aftermarket sales, as Jim discussed previously. However, these headwinds were generally offset by material cost improvement actions completed in the first quarter, primarily related to supplier negotiations and pricing and reduced operating expenses as a result of the actions taken in 2023 to centralize functions and reduce costs. In addition, EPS was impacted by slightly higher tax expense during the quarter, primarily due to our geographical mix of earnings. Despite the headwinds we faced in the first quarter, we continued to improve the foundation of the business and take actions that will drive run rate performance improvement going forward, helping us achieve our previously provided guidance. Page 11 summarizes our key financial metrics specific to Control Devices. Control Devices first quarter sales declined by approximately $8.7 million versus the first quarter of 2023, primarily related to the expected wind down of end-of-life programs and slower demand for electric vehicle platforms. This was slightly offset by higher sales in China. First quarter operating margin of 2.8% increased by 120 basis points compared to the first quarter of 2023, primarily as a result of favorable product mix and improvements in material and logistics costs. We continue to expect relatively flat end market performance and slow growth in actuation programs due to the continued slow ramp-up of electric vehicle platforms. As a result, we continue to expect Control Devices full-year sales to slightly decline this year relative to 2023. That said, and as demonstrated in the first quarter, we have identified several opportunities to reduce material costs through redesigns or supply chain strategies to help improve gross margin going forward and offset the slight decline in sales, resulting in a stable margin profile. Finally, as discussed on previous earnings calls, we remain focused on drivetrain agnostic technologies to drive new business awards as the market continues to evolve. We continue to focus on operational excellence and enterprise-wide cost reduction, including material cost reduction plans to drive margin improvement going forward. Page 12 summarizes our key financial metrics specific to Electronics. Electronics first quarter sales increased by $15.6 million or 11.1% compared to the first quarter of 2023. Sales growth was driven primarily by higher sales in both the European and North American commercial vehicle end markets, due in part to the ramp-up of the Smart 2 tachograph programs in Europe. We expect continued strong sales growth in 2024, driven by new program launches and the ramp-up of recently launched programs. Our next MirrorEye OEM programs launched with Volvo in Europe and with Peterbilt in North America later this year. Similarly, we expect significant growth related to the Smart 2 tachograph as regulatory requirements force adoption, both in OEM applications as well as in the aftermarket. First quarter operating margin expanded by approximately 330 basis points compared to the first quarter of the prior year, primarily due to contribution on incremental revenue and material cost improvement, partially offset by higher overhead costs. More specifically, $1.5 million of the $2 million of total incremental warranty-related costs impacted Electronics during the quarter. Looking forward, we expect continued margin expansion as we focus on improving our manufacturing performance and focus on quality-driven processes and efficient execution of new program launches as well as the continued ramp-up of existing programs. Electronics remains well positioned to take advantage of significant future growth and margin expansion as a result of a strong product portfolio, a substantial and growing backlog of awarded programs, continued improvement in material cost and cost structure and organizational optimization. Page 13 summarizes our key financial metrics, specific to Stoneridge Brazil. Stoneridge Brazil's first quarter sales totaled approximately $12.2 million, a decrease of $2 million relative to the first quarter of last year. This decrease was primarily as a result of two onetime revenue opportunities in the local OEM market totaling approximately $2.1 million in 2023 that were not expected to recur this year. First quarter operating profit declined by approximately $1.1 million relative to the first quarter of 2023, primarily driven by reduced fixed cost leverage on decreased sales. This decrease was partially offset by lower material costs as a result of favorable sales mix. We expect relatively stable revenue and operating margin in 2024 as we continue to shift our portfolio in Brazil to more closely align with our global growth initiatives and further expand our local OEM programs to support our global customers. Brazil has become a critical engineering center as we continue to align our global engineering capabilities and footprint. We will continue to utilize our global footprint to cost-effectively support our global business. Turning to Page 14. Net debt to trailing 12-month EBITDA, as calculated for compliance purposes, improved by quarter of a turn, resulting in a leverage ratio of approximately 2.86x. During the quarter, we generated $9.1 million of operating cash, an improvement of $18.3 million compared to the first quarter of last year. This is due in part to our continued efforts to reduce our inventory balance, which declined by $7.9 million in the quarter. We are focused on reducing net working capital to improve cash performance and reduce net debt and related interest expense. Based on our 2024 guidance and net working capital initiatives, we expect a compliance leverage ratio between 2x and 2.5x by the end of the year as both our earnings and inventory balance are expected to continue to improve. We are focused on maximizing cash performance to drive value to shareholders. Moving to Slide 15. In summary, our first quarter performance was driven by strong topline growth and progression across each of our key priorities for 2024. Our strategy sets us up for strong short-term and long-term performance through Stoneridge-specific growth drivers, including new programs, incremental content and expansion of our existing opportunities. We will continue to focus on enterprise-wide cost improvement and operational execution to drive strong contribution margin and focus on inventory reduction to improve our cash position and continue to reduce our leverage profile. Stoneridge remains well positioned to outpace our underlying end market growth and drive significant earnings expansion going forward. As always, driving shareholder value is at the forefront of all of Stoneridge's strategic initiatives. With that, I will open up the call for questions.\n\nOperator: We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Justin Long with Stephens. Please go ahead.\n\nJustin Long: So maybe to start, Matt, you gave some color on 2Q expectations for revenue and EPS. But I was wondering if you could provide a little bit more color around the EBITDA cadence. You mentioned it being more back half weighted. But as we move into the second quarter, would you expect EBITDA to improve relative to the $11 million number you talked about in the first quarter, if you exclude some of the non-operational items and maybe you could just talk about your visibility to that forecast as well.\n\nMatthew Horvath: Yes. Thanks for the question, Justin. So yes, we would expect it to improve from there. As we had said in the first quarter - on our prior call, we had previously expected kind of relatively flat performance between the first and second quarter. We now expect that to be improved. Even off of the adjusted number that you mentioned, really due to the base operating performance improvement that we expect not only in the second quarter but also for the remainder of the year. So yes, we would expect the second quarter to be improved. And then if you look forward, we would expect continued improvement. Certainly, as we launch the incremental programs, particularly the large MirrorEye programs in the back half of the year, particularly as the tachograph aftermarket continues to ramp up, that's generally at a pretty accretive margin on the aftermarket sales. So we have good visibility to improvement because of its fundamental base improvement in the business that we've already seen in the first quarter. And that would only be duplicative on the incremental revenue that we expect in the second half. So we do expect improvement in the second quarter, and we would expect that to continue on pretty strongly in the second half with the launch of those programs.\n\nJames Zizelman: And Matt, I'd add to that. When you think about all the work that we've been doing to drive excellence in execution and drive efficiencies within Stoneridge. And we've talked very specifically about some of those actions even today. Those things clearly had an impact on the first quarter. A lot of the performance that you are seeing are reflective in the numbers that we're seeing here relative to gross margin expansion and cash generation, et cetera. That stuff also becomes duplicative, right? As you start taking that into the second, third and fourth quarter and beyond, right, those things actually will begin to add more and more to the financial performance of Stoneridge. So I am very, very confident that we're going to have the right pathway here going forward.\n\nJustin Long: That's really helpful. And maybe to follow-up on some of the things you just mentioned, Jim, it sounds like first quarter was a messy quarter, lots of puts and takes, but there was some improvement in the underlying kind of operational performance that's maybe a little hard to see just looking at the headlines. So as we think about the full-year guidance, two things you mentioned were material cost tailwinds and pricing tailwinds. Is there a way to kind of quantify how meaningful those tailwinds could be or speak in a little bit more detail about some of the operational improvements and what that could translate to in terms of the bottom line?\n\nMatthew Horvath: Yes. So Justin, first on just kind of the quantification of that. We always talk about contribution margin as a good way to understand how much operational performance we're getting out of the business, right? Our typical contribution margin is 25% to 30% on incremental revenue. If you look at the first quarter, quarter-over-quarter, even including those incremental warranty issues, we had 50% contribution margin on $7 million of revenue growth, right? Excluding those warrant issues, we were like 80% contribution margin quarter-over-quarter. So that is an indication that the business is significantly improving at a fundamental level. And that's really driven by, like we said, those material cost improvements. Again, if you exclude that warranty issue, which we wouldn't expect to recur forward, gross margin would have been over 21% in the first quarter, okay? So fundamentally, material costs and the actions that we've taken on the operating side to centralize functions, get more out of the resources that we have, but also reduce cost at the same time, you're seeing that benefit quarter-over-quarter certainly, and we would expect that to carry forward. When you add the revenue growth to that, that contribution margin can get really accretive to the earnings power of the business in the second half of the year.\n\nJustin Long: Okay. Got it. And I guess the last one for me is on two of the big revenue drivers this year. You've got the Smart 2 tachograph and you've got MirrorEye. I guess on Smart 2, any color you can give us on the revenue cadence or ramp you're now expecting within the guidance? And then I'm just curious if there's been any change to your forecast for MirrorEye. I think you've talked about that being $100 million of revenue this year, but I just wanted to confirm that, that was still your expectation?\n\nMatthew Horvath: Yes, Justin. So I'll take the easy one of those two first. MirrorEye, yes, no change in expectation for the remainder of the year. We're seeing good progress with the OEs as we march towards those launches, particularly the very large launch with Volvo in the second half of the year...\n\nJames Zizelman: And on track on those launches.\n\nMatthew Horvath: Yes. That's right. And then - yes, so no change in the expectation for MirrorEye. The tachograph business, there's kind of two responses here. One, we haven't seen any change in the addressable market. And like Jim laid out in the prepared remarks, the market is timed such that this year has the first step in that adoption cycle. So within the year, we don't see any expectation of change relative to our prior expectations. Obviously, we talked about the first quarter being a little lighter from an aftermarket perspective, because just the law of the numbers, because the market hasn't changed and the first quarter was a little lighter, we obviously expect the second quarter and forward to be more than previously expected. And again, that aftermarket product generally has an accretive margin relative to overall margins. So it's also a little bit harder to time out that aftermarket adoption. Relative to an OEM program where you've got production volume and forecast, even if they fluctuate a little bit, there's a pretty structured cadence around that volume. The aftermarket - we have some ability to do things on the pricing side, with our distributors, their customers, et cetera, to push or pull adoption. But ultimately, there's a little bit more volatility and there will always be a little more volatility in the aftermarket. So in the short-term quarter-to-quarter, it's a little bit more volatile. But for the year, nothing has changed, which just means the second half of the year will be even stronger than we expected previously.\n\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Gary Prestopino with Barrington Research. Please go ahead.\n\nGary Prestopino: I kind of jumped on the call a little bit late and just kind of assimilating what you were saying on the tachograph, Jim. Was there - there were some issues with the fact that there wasn't as much on the adoption side in the quarter as you expected? Or - and could you just very simply just go through that again, please?\n\nJames Zizelman: Yes. So first off, Gary, we'll break it into two sections as well. On the OEM side, it's being adopted as expected. It's required for new vehicles being sold. If they're going to be registered for international transport, they have to have the next-generation tachograph. So the OEs are selecting this and they're 100% in line with the volume of vehicles that they're building. The variability, probably what you picked up was variability, and that's really coming from the aftermarket. As you know, trucks at 3.5 tons are higher have to be retrofit if they have the former analog or 1B digital tachographs in place. And just like anybody, if you have a deadline to get something finished or completed, oftentimes, people will push the compliance with that deadline to the deadline itself. And so it was a little slower here at the beginning as people were first required to make the change, but they do have to the end of 2024 to get it done. And so like Matt says, that regulation hasn't changed. The timing and the compliance date hasn't changed. The addressable market is already out there. These are existing vehicles. So we're expecting to see an uptick really in the sales into the aftermarket because it was a bit lighter in the first quarter.\n\nMatthew Horvath: Yes. And I would add to that, as Jim mentioned in the prepared remarks here, the European Commission, which governs this regulation has reiterated those deadlines and requirements.\n\nJames Zizelman: Yes.\n\nMatthew Horvath: So not only do we understand the addressable market and expect the second half to pick up. It's very clear from the regulatory agencies that that's the expectation of folks as well. So we feel pretty comfortable that we understand the addressable market. And because the first quarter was a little bit lighter, that just suggests there's more to come here in the second half or second quarter forward.\n\nGary Prestopino: Yes, yes. No, that's fine. I just wanted to clarify that. And in terms of the peak revenue, I mean, what year do you actually hit that? Is that somewhere in the 2026? Or does this keep going on? And I guess, I'm trying to get an idea of what is the actual size of the market and units? I know I realize it's all for international transport only, but when is that peak number hit?\n\nMatthew Horvath: Yes. So Gary, because the adoption started late last year, you obviously see a ramp-up this year. We really would expect to kind of hit those peak numbers in 2025, 2026. And then naturally, of course, you'll see a more stabilized number, there forward as the retrofits are completed and the OEM market remains strong. So we talked about market share a little bit on the slide there that at our peak annual revenue, we estimate we would have about 30% market share. Obviously, because that's an aftermarket product and not an OEM award, there is opportunity to improve that as we go forward, and we're working on that. But that gives you some idea of kind of the total addressable market for our product as these regulations roll through.\n\nGary Prestopino: So by July 2026, all vehicles above 2.5 tons we'll have to have this, whether they're retrofitted or OEM. And then once that happens, you start going - after you hit peak revenue, then it just basically becomes an OEM driven product. Is that the way to look at...\n\nMatthew Horvath: An OEM product with some service requirements as well going forward. Yes.\n\nGary Prestopino: Okay. All right. So next question revolves around the quarter. First of all, is your guidance for this year pegged off using a $6.6 million EBITDA number or an adjusted number of $10.9 million?\n\nMatthew Horvath: Gary, to be clear, the guidance includes those issues in the first quarter. So it's the $6.6 million number is what our guidance is based off of.\n\nGary Prestopino: Okay.\n\nMatthew Horvath: But because those things, one, are obviously non-operating on the FX side. And two, not expected to recur on the warranty side, we wanted to provide a kind of an estimate of what you should expect from a run rate forward in the true performance of the business. So the guidance includes the $6.6 million, but the performance of the business, obviously, was much, much better than that. We wanted to outline that in the remarks.\n\nGary Prestopino: So you can say with some certainty that there's not going to be any more warranty expense going forward?\n\nMatthew Horvath: So Gary, here's what I would say. There's never certainty - yes, there's never certainty that you can say that there won't be any more warranty expense going forward. As you would imagine, we have a typical warranty accrual on every product, right? These were two specific items in the quarter that we would not expect to recur going forward.\n\nGary Prestopino: Okay. And then just lastly, as I read back on my notes, I think you had said that you had expected Q1 adjusted EBITDA to be less than that of Q4, which was $15.6 million. As far as the quarter goes, the sales were better than we expected, but obviously, the adjusted EBITDA wasn't. But you didn't really give specific guidance for Q1. I mean, when you factor out these nonrecurring items, did the quarter come in about where you thought it was going to be on an adjusted EBITDA basis?\n\nMatthew Horvath: Yes. Generally, Gary. We did talk a little bit about the mix of tachograph in the aftermarket business. Like we said, that aftermarket business does have an accretive benefit to margin. So I would say that was the only thing outside of the normal - or I'm sorry, the things we called out between the warranty and the non-operating impacts. But generally speaking, the quarter would have been in line with our expectations, had it had not been for those unusual items or non-recurring non-operating items.\n\nGary Prestopino: Okay. And then just in general, when you start these new programs that are going to roll out well, the growth in the tachograph and then obviously, MirrorEye going from, what, $155 million to $100 million and $60 million of tachograph...\n\nMatthew Horvath: Yes.\n\nGary Prestopino: Those margins, especially on MirrorEye, as you go into 2025, those programs that you're rolling out, should those margins really start seeing really good improvement as you start scaling that business?\n\nMatthew Horvath: Yes, Gary, a couple of things to that. One, as with any program, as you approach more stable or peak annual revenue, the margin will be - will improve, right? The incremental volume, obviously, the margin will improve. And typically, there's a ramp-up of any program - any normal program, not just those two. Separately, like we said, the aftermarket tachograph product has an accretive margin profile. But also as we've talked about for quite a while now, incremental take rate to MirrorEye can be extremely accretive from a contribution margin, right? We - as everyone knows, we have spent the engineering and structured the organization for the amount of growth that we expect from these MirrorEye programs, right? So as they ramp up, not only will the typical program to kind of quoted volume improve margin, but we've always said we think that there's upside to that as adoption improves and take rate improves, and that can be very accretive as well.\n\nOperator: This concludes our question-and-answer session.

The 10-Q will be available through the SEC or on the Investor Relations section of our website. With me today, I have Omar Asali, our Chairman and CEO; and Bill Drew, our CFO. Omar will summarize our first quarter results and provide commentary on the operating landscape and Bill will provide additional detail on the financial results, before we open up the call for questions. With that, I'll turn the call over to Omar.\n\nOmar Asali: Thank you, Sara. Good morning, everyone. I appreciate you all joining us today. Our first quarter financial results were largely in line with our expectations as we experienced 4.4% top line growth and meaningfully improved profitability to start the year. We are pleased to report that we experienced our third consecutive quarter of volume growth in PPS as activity levels continue to improve. While the overall operating landscape remains uneven, we are pleased to see continued moderate general improvement. Our gross margins on a constant currency basis improved by 400 basis points year-over-year and adjusted EBITDA margins improved 500 bps on a constant currency due to the favorable paper pricing environment compared to a year ago and higher volumes flowing through the complex. Overall, we are happy with the start of the year and believe it sets us on a path to achieve our targeted results for 2024. Consistent with much of our recent operating history, we expect the first half of the year will be a lower contributor to 2024 top line performance compared to the back half as we expect more large account activity to ramp up as the year progresses and traditional seasonality to drive higher volumes in the second half of the year. North American sales were up 2.6% in the quarter versus last year, driven by improved void-fill and automation sales year-over-year. At a more macro level, box shipments were flat to slightly up for the quarter, while freight and trucking data remains mixed. The industrial and manufacturing sector remains sluggish, while we are seeing some improvement in e-commerce activity. The impacts of higher rates constraining housing activity and all of the spend that goes with it as well as inflationary pressures impacting consumer discretionary spend remain present. This has led to activity levels in North America being okay but inconsistent from month to month. On a positive note, more recently we've seen improvements in consumer confidence, so hopefully that will inspire additional demand for goods. While that is the macro picture, we try to focus on driving outcomes that are within our control at Ranpak such as executing on our strategic account plan. We are pleased with our progress and optimistic that the ramp-up in the plastic to paper shift provides us with solid volume momentum for the remainder of the year while the macro hopefully stabilizes and improves. We said in our first quarter call last year that the plastic-to-paper shift was a longer sales cycle given the complexity of some of the organizations involved but that we believed it was only a matter of time before the volumes start to reflect the shift in thinking. I'm pleased to say that in April, we're seeing a pickup in activity from our strategic account initiative and many accounts are beginning the transition away from plastic. Europe, APAC activity levels in the first quarter were solid, with sales up 5.4% versus the prior year, driven by higher volumes in void-fill and wrapping. Activity levels in the region continue to improve slowly, although manufacturing and industrial activity remains subdued, impacting cushioning utilization. Consumer confidence in the region has been improving since the end of the third quarter but is still well below pre-COVID levels. Geographically speaking, we've seen strength in Southern Europe in countries like Spain and Italy as well as improvement in the U.K. While the central part of Europe that is more manufacturing heavy like Poland, Belgium and Germany are weaker. In APAC, Japan and Australia continue to be bright spots. The input cost environment provides us with a benefit for the first half of the year as paper pricing moved lower throughout the year before reaching a trough in Q4. We expect paper pricing in the first half of the year to be in line with Q4 as pricing flattened out to start the year. We are, however, seeing some producers in North America and Europe making a push to increase pricing as we get deeper into the year. Overall, we are targeting to maintain a gross margin in 2024 that is in line with our finish in 2023. So we're working closely with our vendors to plan accordingly and determine if we need to make pricing adjustments based on the commodity environment. The freight market has been roughly flat to start the year and in the U.S. has remained favorable given the freight recession that has been present for the past 2 years. Freight market participants have struck a more optimistic tone recently. So we're monitoring that closely to see how potential improvement in freight level activity, along with rising tensions in the Middle East, driving oil higher may impact pricing and availability. Inventory levels at our distributors and end users remain tight, with many in our value chain in North America and Europe keeping tight lids on the amount of product on hand given the increased cost of capital and uneven environment. Destocking is no longer an issue but we continue to watch inventories at our customers across the globe. Now with that, let me turn it over to Bill for some financial detail.\n\nBill Drew: Thank you, Omar. In the deck, you'll see a summary of some of our key performance indicators. We'll also be filing our 10-Q which provides further information on Ranpak's operating results. Machine placement increased 0.9% year-over-year to approximately 140,800 machines globally. Cushioning systems declined 0.9%, while void-fill installed systems increased 1.3% and wrapping systems increased 1.8% year-over-year. Growth in the machine field population had been lower this year due to a combination of lower activity levels generally, particularly related to industrial and manufacturing sectors in Europe as well as our efforts to optimize our fleet. To maximize capital efficiency, we are focused on getting underutilized converters back and redeploying them to more productive areas. Overall, net revenue for the company in the first quarter was up 4.4% year-over-year on a constant currency basis, driven by increased volumes and contribution from automation, offset by slightly lower price. In North America, net revenue increased 2.6% year-over-year, with void-fill and automation up versus the prior year, offset by decreases in cushioning and wrapping. Volumes were lower versus prior year driven by a softer March but we expect those to pick up in the region as the year progresses driven by our strategic account activity. In Europe and APAC, net revenue on a constant currency basis was up 5.4% year-over-year, driven by void-fill, wrapping and automation, offset by lower cushioning revenue as the industrial sector in Europe remains pressured. We are pleased to see the general continued recovery in this reporting unit as volumes increased 10% year-over-year and businesses begin to recover. We believe a part of the recovery we are seeing is due to the increased confidence stemming from the continued favorable natural gas pricing in Europe with Dutch Nat gas hovering around \u20ac30 per megawatt. There has been some volatility recently due to rising geopolitical tensions but we believe the amount of expected LNG capacity coming online and becoming available to Europe beginning in 2025 should help to keep a lid on pricing. Our gross profit increased 16.7% on a constant currency basis, implying a margin of 38% compared to 34% in the prior year. This is in line with our expectations as we expected gross margin to be roughly in line with Q4 throughout the year. As Omar mentioned, we are monitoring the commodity environment closely and are extremely focused on maintaining the gross margin profile we sought to regain after 2022. Adjusted EBITDA increased 33.8% year-over-year to $20.2 million, implying a 22.8% margin driven by a higher gross profit flow-through and controlled G&A spend. We are pleased with the continued overall improvement in the financial profile and are optimistic as more volumes flow through the complex and automation grows, we will continue to work our way back towards an attractive high-margin and cash-generative profile. Capital expenditures for the quarter were $9.8 million, driven by converter placement and investments related to our Malaysia production facility. We are keeping tight controls on capital expenditures this year as we are moving beyond our infrastructure investment cycle that brought us a world-class technology platform and fully invested and funded physical infrastructure assets across the globe. Moving briefly to the balance sheet and liquidity. We completed Q1 with a strong liquidity position, including a cash balance of $55 million to end the quarter and no drawings on our revolving credit facility. We continue to make steady progress on our goal of deleveraging and reached 4.4 turns at the end of the quarter, down from 4.6x at 2023 year-end and 5.7x as of Q2 2023. We expect to build cash in the back half of the year as we enter the traditionally stronger holiday season and volumes pick up. The Malaysia production facility go live this summer marks the end of our multiyear infrastructure investment initiative and enables us to focus on getting a return on our investments as we scale our PPS and automation businesses. Our capital expenditure plans in 2024 are much more modest compared to recent prior years at less than $35 million which we expect will enable us to generate cash in 2024 and help us deleverage further. Following quarter end, in April we settled the litigation matter and sold 2 patents which resulted in total cash proceeds of \u20ac20 million, bolstering our cash position and implying a pro forma leverage ratio of 4.1x on a constant currency basis, including the additional cash proceeds. Based on our adjusted EBITDA guide and expected cash generation, we expect leverage to be below 4 turns on a constant currency basis by year-end, with an ultimate goal to getting to 3 turns or below. We believe our recent commercial and financial progress along with a focus on deleveraging and cash generation positions us well to address our term loan maturities well before their maturities in June of 2026. Ranpak has a long history in the credit markets from years of private equity ownership and I think would be well received by credit investors. For those of you who have spent time with us over the past few years, you know our goal is to have the cap structure not be a topic of conversation. This means a simple structure and a conservative leverage profile that addresses needs well in advance. With that, I'll turn it back to Omar before we move on to questions.\n\nOmar Asali: Thank you, Bill. In closing, I'm pleased with the continued progress and third quarter in a row of volume growth. While the macro remains unclear, I believe our company-specific drivers such as our strategic account activity and momentum in automation will enable us to continue to drive the top line and improve profitability. Driving volumes in PPS, scaling automation and generating cash are the top priorities at Ranpak in 2024 and going into 2025. Automation continues to get the traction that we are seeking with large accounts as our systems are in facilities this year as the first step to larger follow-through opportunities. We continue to anticipate revenue growth of more than 50% in automation this year and I continue to strongly believe the investments we have made in this area will be a critical growth driver and differentiator for Ranpak in the upcoming years. Our long-term objective remains to have a business that is steadily growing revenue in the high single to low double-digit area, the gross margins in the high 30% to 40% area and adjusted EBITDA margins in the high 20s to low 30s area, with substantial cash being generated along the way. We have a strong platform in place supported by our state-of-the-art digital infrastructure and facilities that can support our growth ambitions. With these multiyear projects behind us, the focus can be solely on execution of our strategic initiatives and gaining efficiencies. I'm energized by what I see happening within Ranpak and across the world. The team is invigorated by the narrower scope of objectives and what we all read about seemingly every day regarding the tailwinds related to the shift from plastic to paper and warehouse automation needs. This year's Earth Day theme is Planet versus Plastics and has a goal of raising awareness to drive a 60% plastic reduction by 2040. There has been a plethora of great yet alarming content created this year that aims to promote widespread public awareness of the damage done by plastic to human, animal and all biodiversities' health. Earthday.org is also trying to achieve a phase-out of all single-use plastics by 2030 and achieving that commitment at the United Nations treaty on plastic pollution in 2024. At Ranpak, we are extremely proud to be at the forefront of this movement and we are doing our part to deliver a better world. With that, let's open the call up for some questions. Operator?\n\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from the line of Greg Palm with Craig-Hallum Capital Group.\n\nDanny Eggerichs: This is Danny Eggerichs on for Greg today. I was hoping to maybe just start with a little bit more on the strategic accounts. I guess it seems like it's improved. But how would you say your visibility into those accounts has changed over, say, the last couple of months? It seems like it's improved. And does it feel like you're even more confident on kind of that second half step-up, especially with the, I guess, comments on a few of these accounts already beginning to transition away from plastic in Q2?\n\nOmar Asali: Yes, sure. I feel -- and obviously, as I said, some of these conversations in particular with very large sizable accounts take some time. I said in our last quarter call that we expect things to start ramping up in early Q2. And as I said on the call today, in April, we're starting to see that. So I would say the level of activity in strategic accounts moving from trial, pipeline, funnel, sort of early install activity to accounts purchasing our product, expanding the installed and scaling up, that's starting to occur in this quarter in Q2. We feel really good about the visibility that we have. Obviously, the macro environment is always a factor. But in terms of large accounts, in particular, in the U.S. making meaningful moves and switches from plastic to paper, that's occurring. And we think, frankly, every month starting in, again, the beginning of Q2, that, that ramp-up will continue. So we feel we've made tremendous progress. And as we've said for a while, we're hoping that you're going to start seeing that in the volume and results starting in Q2 of '24.\n\nDanny Eggerichs: Got it. And then I guess just in terms of Q2, normal seasonality, kind of some moderate sequential growth. I guess as we think about that and some of these strategic accounts starting in Q2, I guess is it fair to say that there could be some incremental revenue on top of that typical seasonality there in Q2?\n\nOmar Asali: I'll let Bill provide a bit more detail. But I would just say where we are, again, we've provided the guidance for the year early on. We're just sticking to that guidance. We feel pretty confident. I think I've said in the last quarter that we feel there's even upside. So that's how we continue to view the world. But I'll let maybe Bill provide a bit more color.\n\nBill Drew: Yes, Danny. I'd say typically what you see in Q2 is built in North America and then somewhat of a step down at times in Europe and APAC just given the seasonality. I think for us, we are expecting something similar like that to continue. But again, as Omar mentioned, we're expecting a little bit more of a 47%, 48% contribution to the top line first half versus back half. So getting back to that kind of cadence.\n\nDanny Eggerichs: Okay. That's helpful. Maybe one more for me on automation, I guess. Maybe an update on the pipeline there, order activity. I don't know if I missed it. But how are the bookings this quarter? I know we've kind of been seeing record bookings over the last couple. So any additional color there would be helpful.\n\nOmar Asali: Yes. Honestly, we continue to perform very, very well. In Q1, we did have another record booking. Our level of activity, our funnel activity is pretty high. We feel very confident that for the year top line growth in automation globally will be north of 50% which is important for us. And frankly, our visibility -- as you can imagine, we're working with our funnel and our pipeline toward some 25 activity and that activity is looking good as we keep sort of ramping up our installed base and, hopefully, have more and more repeat customers which is really important in automation, in particular, with large customers. So I would say we're on track. In automation, level of activity is good. Our bookings continue to be very healthy. And we're pretty confident in the 50%-plus growth profile this year.\n\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Ghansham Panjabi with Baird.\n\nGhansham Panjabi: I guess, Omar, maybe stepping back a little bit just from a macroeconomic standpoint, we saw what you did in the first quarter with North America, Europe and APAC, etcetera. But from an end market standpoint, adjusting for some of the new initiatives and so on and so forth that you have underway, especially in North America, how do you see the momentum across the end markets as you think about the regions globally?\n\nOmar Asali: Yes. I think if -- from an end market standpoint and this applies to North America and, frankly, other geographies, we continue to see healthy trends and recovery in e-commerce, Ghansham. We continue to see relatively decent activity with retailers doing more with shipping and sort of building their online capabilities. I think industrial activity is a little bit more uneven. Frankly, the largest probably sluggishness we see are in markets like in Germany and Central Europe. I visited the regions a couple of times already. This year, I do think CEOs are nervous in some of these markets given the macro backdrop, etcetera. But there's a lot of chatter in Europe about how important manufacturing and industrial activity is and I'm expecting that we will start seeing some pickup and some improvement, whether it's driven by companies, by governments, by both. I don't expect Europe to just accept that -- their most important sector is going to be slow. So I think we're expecting that, that level of activity will become a little bit better. But there's no doubt what we're seeing some strength at is more around e-commerce and around different areas in e-commerce, whether you're seeing that in books and in publishing, whether you're seeing it in some level in beauty or in guys that are just general merchandise. That level of business feels a little bit better than where it was a few quarters ago.\n\nGhansham Panjabi: And then in terms of your market positioning, right, because you had a very strong first-to-market advantage. The markets have normalized. Your competitors, including those that sell different substrates have been kind of reorganizing and trying to come back with some sort of fiber-based offering for protective packaging, etcetera. Just your thoughts in terms of any change in the competitor backdrop as you think about your major end markets? And then just, lastly, in terms of raw material cost inflation. I mean, upstream pulp prices have picked up quite a bit. And I know you've been benefiting from some level of deflation and rightfully so, just given how you came off the peak inflation cycle from a few quarters back. But just your thoughts in terms of the forward-looking indicators for inflation specific to Ranpak as well.\n\nOmar Asali: Sure. So on the first point, Ghansham, let's call it the competitive landscape, I really like where we are for a couple of reasons. One, I am convinced we're in the right substrate and that gives us a competitive advantage. Paper and fiber-based solutions are 100% of our thinking and execution. And we continue to see the shift from plastic to paper. Frankly, it's very pronounced in the U.S. now. It's been pronounced in other geographies that I visited and that we've been seeing those trends there for a while. So I like how we're positioned there. I also like that our investment cycle is behind us. From a strategic standpoint, Ranpak is stable. We're in execution mode. We're very focused on driving key initiatives like driving PPS volume, driving automation, generating cash flow. I feel our team is focused. And our organization, honestly, has not been in a better spot in a long time than the spot that we're in right now. It's literally down to execution, execution, execution. And I think that sets us apart. I do see that in a lot of account activity, some of it large strategic account activity that we mentioned a lot on this call, some of it is small and medium-sized, where I feel our ability to win these accounts to expand our business with them is terrific. And I feel competitively we're very well positioned. I think the combination of PPS and automation is going to accrete a lot more value for us. We are truly a full-service solution for end-of-line needs for automation. We're a full solution for PPS that's fiber-based for -- needs for so many industries. And I think what we bring to the table to a lot of our customers and I see it in our dialogue, Ghansham, I think it's very compelling. And now it's up to us as a team to basically work our asset base and execute on the plan that's ahead of us. As far as your second question on inflation and pricing, I would say from a Ranpak perspective, the first half of the year we pretty much have very good visibility in terms of pricing and the environment and where our deals are from a commodity standpoint and we feel very good about how we're positioned. We have secured supply for part of our needs for the second half of the year. We are negotiating other parts. I would say the landscape is a little bit shifting, as we mentioned in the call, where you're starting to see with consolidation in the paper industry, with the dynamic -- with geopolitical risks and the dynamic of, frankly, the switch to paper, you're starting to see some pricing pressure and increases. I feel very good, Ghansham, that we will be able to negotiate and secure the supply that we want in the second half of the year given our size, that we will be able to get sort of the cost structure that we want. And if there is a little bit of pressure from a cost standpoint, we will react from a pricing standpoint. So our expectations is that we will be able to deliver the margin profile that, as Bill said, we fought so hard to get to. And I think this is a year where we will be able to manage what happens in the landscape but it may require a little bit more work in the second half of the year than in the first half. Does that give you a good sense?\n\nGhansham Panjabi: It does, it does. Thank you, Omar. Appreciate that.\n\nOperator: And your next question comes from the line of Adam Samuelson with Goldman Sachs (NYSE: GS ).\n\nAdam Samuelson: Maybe first something that, Bill, you alluded to in the prepared remarks, I just wanted to clarify. So there was a litigation settlement that was -- it was \u20ac20 million of cash that you received in April. Can you just maybe elaborate a little bit on that? Is there a tax impact on that, just to make sure we're clear? It's not something that had been previously in any of the filings. So any additional color would be helpful.\n\nBill Drew: Sure, Adam. So this was a litigation matter that had been ongoing for a number of years just related to some patent infringement. So it was great to get this settled, get it behind us, get the cash proceeds in. At this point, right, the proceeds are gross. So we'll have the tax impact when we go to file our tax returns in the following year. But for now, that cash goes straight to the balance sheet. So it's nice to get some additional yield on that cash and be able to maximize liquidity ahead of any potential refinancing later this year.\n\nOmar Asali: And Adam, just to add, the \u20ac20 million settlement is \u20ac15 million settlement on the litigation and about \u20ac5 million on us giving them some rights to a couple of patents we have. So the total proceeds will be -- as Bill said, is the \u20ac20 million. But it's these 2 separate things that got us there. And then in terms of tax impact, obviously, that's something that we will be assessing based on the 2 transactions that I outlined for the rest of the year. But this was a real good conclusion for us. And we get to move on and as I said a little bit earlier, just execute on our business plan and not have too many open matters.\n\nAdam Samuelson: Okay. No, that's very helpful. And then as we think about some of the strategic accounts, Omar, that are starting to kind of come to fruition in the core business in the second quarter, how should we think about installed base trends rolling forward? Is that going to drive a pickup in void-fill and in cushioning machine placements through the year? Or is there a little bit further decline before those start to re-accelerate?\n\nOmar Asali: We have been laser-focused, Adam, as you know, about redeploying, refurbishing and working our asset base to the extent possible. And that continues to be our priority, given in the last couple of years we did feel that some accounts were overcapitalized. And the world changed and we needed to react. And we continue to do that. So that's priority one. With some of the large strategic accounts and as we're ramping those up, just given the scale of some of these accounts, redeploying and refurbing, etcetera, may not be enough to meet the demands that we're seeing. So you will see some pickup that we've already planned for in Q1 because we're, frankly, ramping up as we speak some of these accounts. I don't think you're going to see something that's going to move the needle at 140,000 installed base. It will be maybe a modest increase from the last couple of quarters for us to fulfill the needs of these customers. But we're trying to be very, very prudent with our CapEx and how we fulfill these customer demands. And the beauty of some of these large accounts, Adam, is the efficiency per converter, the efficiency per machine, given volume, sometimes tends to be above what we've offered other customers just given sheer needs. So they tend to be pretty efficient from a CapEx standpoint.\n\nOperator: That concludes the Q&A session. I will now turn the conference back over to Bill Drew for closing remarks.\n\nBill Drew: Thanks, Benjamin. And thank you everybody for joining us today. We look forward to catching up next quarter.\n\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes today's call. Thank you all for joining.

Welcome to the Silicom First Quarter 2024 Results Conference Call. All participants are at present in listen-only mode. Following management's formal presentation, instructions will be given for the question-and-answer session. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. You should have all received by now the company's press release. If you have not received it, please contact Silicom's Investor Relations team at EK Global Investor Relations at 1212378-8040 or view it in the news section of the company's website, www.silicom-usa.com. I would now like to hand over the call to Mr. Kenny Green of EK Global Investor Relations. Mr. Green, would you like to begin, please?\n\nKenny Green: Thank you, operator. I would like to welcome all of you to Silicom's first quarter 2024 results conference call. Before we start, I would like to draw your attention to the following safe harbor statement. This conference call contains forward-looking statements. Such statements may include, but are not limited to, anticipated future financial operating results and Silicom's outlook and prospects. Those statements are based on management's current beliefs, expectations and assumptions, which may be affected by subsequent business, political, environmental, regulatory, economic and other conditions and are subject to known and unknown risks and uncertainties and other factors, many of which are outside of Silicom's control.\n\nThese may cause actual results to differ materially from expectations expressed or implied in the forward-looking statements and which include, but are not limited to, Silicom's increasing dependence for a substantial amount of revenue growth on a limited number of customers, the speed and extent to which Silicom solutions are adopted by relevant markets, difficulty in commercializing and marketing of Silicom's products and services, maintaining and protecting brand recognition, protection of intellectual property, competition, disruptions to manufacturing, sales and marketing, development and customer support activities, the impact of oil in Israel and in the Ukraine, rising inflation, rising interest rates, volatile exchange rates as well as any continuing or new effects resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic and the global economic uncertainty, which may impact customer demand through the exercising greater caution and selectivity of short-term IT investment plans.\n\nThe factors noted are not exhaustive. Further information about the company's businesses, including information about factors that could materially affect Silicom's results of operations and financial condition are discussed in the annual report filed on Form 20-F and other documents filed by the company that may be subsequently filed by the company from time to time with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Therefore, there could be no assurance that actual or future results would not differ significantly from anticipated results. Consequently, investors are cautioned not to rely on these forward-looking statements. Silicom does not undertake to update any forward-looking statements as a result of new information or future events or developments, except as may be required by law.\n\nIn addition, following the company's disclosure of certain non-GAAP financial measures in today's earnings release, such non-GAAP financial measures will be discussed during this call. Such non-GAAP measures are used by management to make strategic decisions, forecast future results and evaluate the company's current performance. Management believes the presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures are useful to investors' understanding and assessment of the company's ongoing core operations and prospects for the future. Unless otherwise stated, it should be assumed that financials discussed in this conference call will be on a non-GAAP basis. Non-GAAP financial measures disclosed by management are provided as additional information to investors in order to provide them with an alternative method for assessing financial conditions and operating results.\n\nThese measures are not in accordance with or a substitute for GAAP. And a full reconciliation of non-GAAP to GAAP financial measures are included in today's earnings press release, which you can find on Silicom's website. With us on the line today are Mr. Liron Eizenman, President and CEO; and Mr. Eran Gilad, CFO. Liron, will begin with an overview of the results followed by Eran, who will provide the analysis of the financials, we'll then turn the call over to a question-and-answer session. And with that, I would like to hand the call over to Liron. Liron, please go ahead.\n\nLiron Eizenman: Thank you, Kenny. Welcome, everyone, to our financial results conference call for the first quarter of 2024. As we move through 2024, as many of you know, we are currently in the midst of significant headwinds, all coming together at the same time and strongly impacting our revenues. While I discussed them in detail last quarter, the factors are affecting us are number one, excess customer inventory of our products, which were previously built up during post-COVID and component shortages era when the supply chains were tight. Number two, macroeconomic and an industry slowdown generally delaying IT infrastructure investments and ultimately slowing down or pausing customer orders of our products; and number three, in some cases, customer-specific factors causing them to delay or not to make new purchases under existing design wins.\n\nIn light of those factors, as we explained last quarter, we launched a 5-year strategic plan whose goal is to generate significant value for our shareholders even under the new market reality of today. Our 5-year strategic plan is aimed at returning Silicom to gradual and steady top line and EPS growth with a financial long-term objective to increase our earnings per share to about $3 in 2028. A key element is to use our $80 million plus cash position to increase shareholder value through an aggressive share buyback, which would reduce share count by leveraging our strong balance to ensure our long-term growth potential remains intact. Our plan calls for purchasing 1.6 million shares during 2024 and 2025, which represented approximately a quarter of our full share count as of when we announced it.\n\nIn the first quarter, we repurchased approximately 250,000 shares, representing a return to shareholders at a cost of $4.1 million. The Board of Directors has approved a new repurchase plan for the coming year, and our aggressive buyback will continue. I would like to stress that our very strong balance sheet and cash position allows us to continue business investment at an adequate pace without compromising our future. It supports a broad and deep pipeline as well as allows us to continue with our core R&D efforts while not being significantly impacted by a loss of a few million dollars over the upcoming transition period. At the same time, an important factor in our strategic plan was to stabilize OpEx at the level that, on the one hand, maintains continuous support and educate investment into our main growth drivers, while on the other hand, conservatively balances our expenses footprint with today's expected revenue level under the current market environment.\n\nWe continue to strongly believe in the long-term potential of our main product lines, namely server adapters and Edge systems, and this includes investments in the development of two strategic new product families with significant revenues potential that we believe will increase our future success. A further step in our strategic plan was to shift focus for our sales and marketing efforts to a broader range of potential design wins, including smaller ones, which have the potential to ramp up quicker and ultimately bring greater diversification to our revenues. We, therefore, made changes to our salespeople compensation package to create the right incentives. We are already seeing the initial momentum of small to medium design wins, and we see a broader pipeline for future potential design wins.\n\nIn terms of our financial performance for the first quarter we reported revenue of $14.4 million, within our expected guidance range which we shared last quarter. On the bottom line, we reported a net loss of $2.4 million. Despite this loss, demonstrating the strength and quality of our working capital, we generated an impressive positive operating cash flow of over $13 million, contributing to our very strong net cash position of over $80 million, which I discussed earlier. I want to stress that our current working capital and marketable securities as of the end of Q1 is $133 million with a very high quality of inventory amounting to $46 million. Accounts receivable, net of accounts payables of $7 million, as well as the $80 million in cash.\n\nAll this represents about $21 per share. Looking towards the near term, we expect that second quarter 2024 revenues will be between $15 million to $17 million. We continue to expect that our 2024 revenues will be at about $70 million impacted mainly by the headwinds and issues I mentioned earlier. We believe that the excess customer inventory in global economy headwinds will ease as we move forward throughout 2024. And thus, second half revenues will be higher than those of the first half. Looking further out towards 2025 and beyond, we are modeling an approximate 20% compound average annual growth from 2024 baseline over the course of the 5 years plan. We expect that this growth will come from the ramp-up of already achieved SD-WAN and SASE design wins, additional Edge system sales to leading telcos and service providers and from increased revenues related to our large roster of design wins and pipeline of potential design wins for server adapters and Edge products with leading networking security and service providers globally.\n\nThis growth rate does not consider potential significant individual upside that we may experience from very large projects like the ones we had in the past, which may provide additional incremental growth for our business. To summarize, as you know, our environment is much more challenging going into 2024 for all players in the industry. I want to stress that Silicom is very well positioned as a key player in our industry with over $80 million on the balance sheet, a deep pipeline and a design win roster, I'm confident that our long-term growth story remains intact, and we will achieve renewed growth starting from 2025 and beyond. We have a strong strategic plan in place, which focuses on ultimately bringing value to our shareholders, not just by returning to revenue growth, reducing expenses and growing profitability, but also by enhancing it through an aggressive buyback and a strong reduction in share count over 2 years.\n\nWe have a very dedicated and loyal management team with a lot of experience in the hardware business, most members of our management team and Board of Directors have been with us for many years and have already navigated our business to success through many market prices and transformation in 2008 and 2017, just to name a few. I strongly believe that the target that I outlined are attainable by Silicom. I'm optimistic in our ability to successfully execute on this 5-year plan and bring earnings per share in excess of $3 by 2028. With that, I will now hand over the call to Eran for a detailed review of the quarter results. Eran, please go ahead.\n\nEran Gilad: Thank you, Liron, and good day to everyone. Revenues for the first quarter of 2024 were $14.4 million, a decline from revenues of $37.2 million as reported in the first quarter of last year. The geographical revenue breakdown over the last 12 months was as follows: North America, 82%; Europe and Israel, 15%; Far East and rest of the world, 3%. During the last 12 months, we had two over 10% customers, and our top three customers together accounted for about 40% of our revenues. I will be presenting the rest of the financial results on a non-GAAP basis, which excludes the noncash compensation expenses in respect of options and RSUs granted to directors, officers and employees, acquisition-related adjustments as well as these liabilities, financial income.\n\nFor the full reconciliation from GAAP to non-GAAP numbers, please refer to the press release we issued earlier today. Gross profit for the first quarter of 2024 was $4.1 million, representing a gross margin of 28.5% and compared to a gross profit of $11.9 million or gross margin of 32% in the first quarter of 2023. As discussed last quarter, for the near term, our gross margin is expected to be at the lower end of our 27% to 32% expected range. And as our revenues grow from current levels over the longer term it will increase towards the upper end. Operating expenses in the first quarter of 2024 were $6.8 million compared to $7.1 million reported in the first quarter of 2023. We believe that this level represents our expected quarterly operating expenses during the rest of the year.\n\nOperating loss for the first quarter of 2024 was $2.7 million compared to operating income of $4.8 million as reported in the first quarter of 2023. Net loss for the quarter was $2.4 million compared to net income of $4.2 million in the first quarter of 2023. Loss per share in the quarter was $0.38. This is compared with diluted earnings per share of $0.61 as reported in the first quarter of last year. Now turning to the balance sheet. As of March 31, 2024, the company's cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaled $80.7 million with no debt. This represents an increase of $9.2 million just in the first quarter, a result of a positive operational cash flow of $13.3 million, net of share repurchase cost of $4.1 million. During the quarter, Silicom repurchased approximately 250,000 shares under our current share repurchase plan.\n\nAs mentioned by Liron, based on our strong balance sheet and improved cash position, we intend to continue repurchasing our shares at a full pace. That ends my summary. I would like to hand back over to the operator for the questions-and-answer session. Operator?", "source": {"uri": "finance.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo!

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Jay Pfeiffer, Investor Relations. Thank you, Jay. You may begin.\n\nJay Pfeiffer: Good morning and welcome to the Where Food Comes From 2024 first quarter earnings call. Joining me on the call today are CEO John Saunders, President Leann Saunders, and Chief Financial Officer Danette Henning. During this call, we'll make forward-looking statements based on current expectations, estimates, and projections that are subject to risk. Statements about current and future financial performance, growth strategy, customers, business opportunities, market acceptance of our products and services, and potential acquisitions are forward-looking statements. Listeners should not place undue reliance on these statements as there are many factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from our forward-looking statements. We encourage you to review our publicly filed documents as well as our news releases and website for more information. Today, we'll also discuss adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP financial measure provided to complement the GAAP results. Please refer to today's earnings release for important disclosures regarding non-GAAP measures. I'll now turn the call over to John Saunders.\n\nJohn Saunders: Good morning and thanks for joining the call today. This morning, we released our first quarter financial results and we're pleased to report that the renewed momentum we generated in the fourth quarter has carried into 2024. Once again, our core verification services revenue more than offset lower product sales resulting for persistent headwinds in our beef business due to cyclical cattle trends, lingering drought effects, and smaller herd sizes. As we've said before, these headwinds are likely to persist to some extent throughout 2024, but we're hopeful to see improvements starting early next year. The solid growth and verification services coupled with careful management of our cost structure also led to improved profitability year-over-year. Our ability to continue delivering profitable growth in spite of ongoing challenges in our beef business reflects the strength and advantages of our unique business model. We are far and away the most diversified provider of food claims certifications in the United States. We provide thousands of producers, customers with best-in-class solutions to differentiate and add value to their products. These customers range from small family farms and ranches to large multinational CPGs. In turn, they respond to increasing consumer demand for products that are certified to any number of standards ranging from non-GMO, organic, and gluten-free to a growing number of sustainable-related certifications. Drilling down on our numbers for the quarter, verification and certification services revenue grew 17% to 4.4 million from 3.8 million. Product revenue reflecting smaller herd sizes and fewer source and age verifications was down 25% to 0.7 million from 1 million. Gross profit increased 9% to 2.3 million from 2.1 million year-over-year. Selling, general, and administrative expense increased only slightly to 2.1 million from 2 million, with the increase partially reflecting marketing spend. Operating income was 68% higher at $261,000 versus $155,000. Net income in the first quarter was up 47% to $178,000 or $0.03 per diluted share from $121,000 or $0.02 per diluted share in the same quarter last year. You may have noticed that we did not receive a Progressive Beef dividend in the third quarter that was strictly a timing issue as the $50,000 dividend was booked in early April. Progressive Beef Business and our relationship with Progressive Beef remain solid. Adjusted EBITDA in the first quarter increased 8% to $432,000 from $399,000. Cash provided by operations in the first quarter increased 48% to $0.7 million from $0.5 million. The company bought back 116,072 shares of its common stock during the first quarter at a cost of $1.5 million. That brings to nearly $11 million the total value we've returned to our stockholders over the past 13 quarters when factoring in buybacks in the special dividend. In addition to our commitment to value creation for stockholders and other stakeholders, we remain focused on our business priorities of delivering affordable, effective solutions to our customers through innovative and strategic investments in technology and complementary businesses. We believe this multi-pronged approach will continue to drive our industry leadership now and into the future. To date, we have closed more than a dozen small acquisitions, all of which are contributing to our success and to the widening moat around our business. The most recent example is our Q4 acquisition of the Upcycled Certified Program from the Upcycled Food Association. I know we mentioned this on our last call, but we recently updated investors with news that upcycling is among the fastest-growing certifications for us and the certification industry at large. Upcycled Certified provides consumers a tangible solution to shop sustainably and avoid food waste. Today, there are roughly 100 companies with 531 products certified to the standard, a 110% increase over the 484 products just a few months ago. The top three certification categories are snack foods, pet foods, and beverages. Products like these are responsible for diverting an average of 390,000 tons of food waste annually in 14 countries since the program's launch in 2021. We view Upcycled Certified as one of the most exciting and promising sustainability trends we've seen in a long time, and we think it can become a meaningful component and diversify our revenue mix over time. There are compelling reasons, both financial and environmental, that support our optimism that upcycling is in the early stages of a longer-term growth trend. If you haven't done so already, go back and look at our April 22nd press release on Upcycled Certified and check out some statistics that support that thesis. In closing, I want to reiterate that we believe ours is a resilient, durable, and sustainable business model, one that would be very difficult to replicate and one that is in the early innings of a long-term growth trend. We are consistently strengthening our market position with new revenue streams through organic and inquisitive growth initiatives in order to meet the evolving needs of our customers. So we are very excited about the future of our business, and as always, we appreciate our stockholders, customers, and other stakeholders for their loyalty and support. And with that, I'll turn the call back over to the operator for questions.\n\nOperator: Q - Unidentified Analyst A - John Saunders\n\nJohn Saunders: Well, once again, we'd like to thank you for all your support and your participation, and we'll talk to you again in three months.

(FTDR) has reported a robust first quarter for 2024, with significant growth in revenue and adjusted EBITDA despite facing headwinds in the home warranty market. The company noted a 3% increase in revenue to $378 million and a 33% rise in adjusted EBITDA to $71 million. This performance is a result of higher prices, service fees, and improved processes, which led to a 14% increase in gross profit to $195 million.\n\nHowever, Frontdoor also acknowledged a decline in demand due to a challenging real estate market and consumer confusion in the direct-to-consumer channel. The company is actively addressing these issues with a brand relaunch and a focus on customer service enhancements. Looking ahead, Frontdoor expects higher revenue and adjusted EBITDA in the second quarter and has raised its full-year outlook for 2024.\n\nKey Takeaways\n\nCompany Outlook\n\nBearish Highlights\n\nBullish Highlights\n\nMisses\n\nQ&A Highlights\n\nFrontdoor Inc. is navigating a complex market environment with strategic initiatives aimed at revitalizing its brand and enhancing customer engagement.

I will now turn the call over to Bill Cobb for opening comments. Bill?\n\nWilliam Cobb: Thank you very much, Matt Davis and hello again, everybody, Frontdoor Inc. continues to operate extremely well, and we are off to a great start in 2024 as we delivered another quarter of record results. As you can see on slide 4, revenue grew 3% to $378 million. Gross margin increased 510 basis points to 51%. Adjusted EBITDA rose 33% to an all-time first quarter high of $71 million. And as a result of our strong first quarter financial performance, we are increasing our full year 2024 adjusted EBITDA outlook. So while we continue to exceed expectations on the margin side, our top priority remains growing our customer base. Let's be clear, right upfront. Demand for home warranties has been down due to some challenging market conditions, but we view this as a temporary cyclical issue. The main cause of lower demand has been real estate. As I've said before, we sell our products as part of the real estate process and as the number of existing homes has declined from 6 million in 2022 to just over 4 million homes today, we have had significantly fewer opportunities to sell our products. This was due in part to rising mortgage rates, which recently reached a one year high. At the same time, existing home inventory has been extremely tight. This is not only limited existing home sales, but it has also resisted in a significant power shift to the seller over the last several years. As a result, our real estate channel sales are less than half of what they were five years ago. And this continues to impact our customer count, revenue growth, profitability and cash flows. And from everything that we see. This is true for the rest of the home warranty category. So while we are still optimistic that the real estate channel will eventually come back, we are waiting to see more tangible proof of the turnaround. Now turning to the direct-to-consumer channel, where we have also seen lower demand. For those of you new to our story, home warranties have historically been sold primarily through the real estate channel. It was only about 25 years ago when we started marketing and selling directly to homeowners. This was a powerful growth engine for us as we saw a strong correlation between marketing spend and our sales. However, about a year after COVID, and we began seeing a decline in consumer demand as the recent indicator of this Google (NASDAQ: GOOGL ) searches for the short term, Home Warranty were down 7% this past March. We have known that something needed to change and here's some of the things we learned from really digging into consumer research. First, consumers have a hard time understanding home warranties, they easily confuse it with homeowners insurance or other products. Second, consumers want to feel like they've got someone in their corner. What really resonated with our focus groups is when we grounded them in the higher level benefits of a home warranty like peace of mind, freedom and happiness. Third, we have not done enough to stand out from our competition. The category has been defined by what we call a sea of sameness among providers, and we realize we needed to take action to break out from the competition. Additionally, consumer behavior has been impacted by the larger macroenvironment as a result of rising inflation and higher costs. This has been echoed by several of the other companies as recently as this morning was mentioned, consumers are pulling back on spending. We view this as a temporary reset of consumer spending. As consumers have not been prioritizing the budget protection and convenience of home warranties. I will go into how we are addressing this shortly. Now turning to renewals, which continues to be a bright spot for us. For the first quarter 2024, our retention rate grew to 76.3%. While this includes a lower mix of real estate customers. Retention continues to perform very well. Our team has done a great job of implementing a wide range of initiatives to improve retention, such as better engaging our consumers, specifically during the onboarding process, expanding dynamic pricing to minimize churn, continuing to improve the customer experience with a large part of that effort coming from increasing utilization of our preferred contractors. This is a dual benefit of lowering costs while delivering a better experience. And finally, we have increased the number of customers on AutoPay, which remained at a record 86% in the first quarter, which makes them much more likely to renew their home warranty. We know there is more we can do to improve our customer service and we are diligently working on those initiatives, but I am super proud of our team's accomplishments in this area. We've also been very proud of our new HVAC sales program, which delivered over $50 million of revenue in 2023. As you would imagine, much of this came in the second and third quarter, and we are expecting a similar pattern this year as we head into our peak summer season. In fact, we recently enhanced the Frontdoor app so that all users can now buy a new HVAC system. We are also continuing to grow into alternative revenue streams by building out our technology capabilities for additional on-demand services. Our vision is to provide a consolidated ecosystem where customers have access to video chats with an expert which might then turn into purchasing a-la-carte repair and maintenance services or even new systems and appliances all through our app, more to come here, but we know that the market opportunity is significant, and we will continue to work to find ways to monetize that demand. Let's now turn to slide 6 and our opportunity. As I said on our last call, there are about 5 million homes in the US that have a warranty. We believe that figure could be approximately three times higher if consumers better understood the value of a home warranty, which brings us to the American Home Shield brand relaunch, which is a primary component of our strategy to increase demand. And I'm very excited that we successfully kicked off the relaunch in early April, we took a holistic approach to the relaunch, which has the following components. At the highest level we wanted to break out from that sea of sameness in the home warranty category. And that starts with a new strategy that truly brings a refreshed and high energy look to our brand. We also wanted to connect to new and larger audiences. So we came up with an innovative ad campaign with a new voice and a new brand visual identity. We wanted to have a catchy recognizable tag line. And that's why we came up with Don't Worry. Be Warranty. This tag line captures that feeling. We want homeowners to take away peace of mind, freedom and happiness. It's proactive and goes right at the main word that defines our services. We also needed a new logo so that consumers can better distinguish us from our competition. So we refreshed with brighter, bolder colors and a more modern look, we wanted to use comedy and a strong well-known personality to do something different to break through to consumers. That's why we are extremely excited about our new celebrity spokesperson for 'Warrantina, starring Rachel dredge, which we believe will drive greater interest in our products. And finally, we wanted a comprehensive media campaign with new marketing partners, as shown on Slide 8. This is now a true omnichannel campaign that is highly visible. We are we develop great new partnerships that are better reflected our customer base for example, we launched a campaign on WrestleMania. We were also on CNN's coverage of the solar eclipse in a big way with our website traffic hitting new highs that day. Speaking of the website, I encourage all of you to visit ahs.com and hope you notice it not only has an updated look, but it also has a more intuitive interface and navigation tools that will improve conversion. In summary, we are truly bringing a refreshed and high energy look to our brand. However, we know we have relaunched our brand in the face of a challenging macroenvironment for home warranties. But that is the point as the leader in our category is our job to turn demand around and we are optimistic this relaunch will improve the growth trajectory for home warranties for years to come. With this much change, it would be premature to talk results thus far. However, we are excited about what we are seeing in web traffic and in other areas and look forward to providing you more details on our next call. Before I turn the call over to Jessica, I want to reiterate that we are off to a great start in 2024. And our first quarter performance continues to show that Frontdoor Inc. is operating extremely well. Jessica?\n\nJessica Ross: Thanks Bill, and good morning, everyone. Before I get into the details, I wanted to first build on Bill's remarks with a few high-level thoughts about a quarter and outlook. First, we want to celebrate that we had another record quarter, which was primarily driven by better than expected margins as the team continues to drive operational excellence across the business through our margin expansion initiatives. Second, in response to our strong first quarter performance, I'm pleased to share that we are raising our full year outlook for gross margin and adjusted EBITDA. Now let's turn to Slide 9, where I'll review our first quarter 2024 financial summary. First quarter revenue increased 3% versus the prior year period to $378 million. Net income increased 56% to $34 million and adjusted EBITDA increased 33% to $71 million, which both represent records for first quarter performance. Now moving to Slide 10, where gross profit for the quarter increased 14% versus the prior year period to $195 million and gross margin improved 510 basis points to 51%. The gross profit improvement was primarily driven by higher realized price, a transition to higher service fees and continued process improvement initiatives and was partially offset by inflationary cost pressures. Let's now move to the adjusted EBITDA bridge on Slide 11, where I'll provide more context for the year-over-year improvement in first quarter adjusted EBITDA, starting at the top, we had $14 million of favorable revenue conversion, driven by an 11% increase in price over the prior year period. This was partially offset by an 8% decline in volume primarily driven by lower sales in our first year channels. This also includes a $6 million increase in other revenue due to higher on-demand home services, primarily from the new HVAC program. Contract claims costs decreased $10 million, which was better than expected. This includes a transition to higher service fees that had two impacts. Third, higher service fees resulted in a lower number of service requests per customer as we typically see a temporary change in customer behavior until they become accustomed to the new fee amounts. Second, higher service fees also resulted in a lower net cost per service request, and these fees are a contra cost to claims expense on our income statement. Additionally, our contract claims costs improved over the prior year period in part due to our ongoing process improvement initiative. This includes improving our planning processes, moving more of our service requests to our preferred contractors. Our new high cost claims review program and leveraging our bulk purchasing power. These improvements were partially offset by ongoing inflation as well as a $5 million unfavorable change in claims cost development year over year. Now moving to sales and marketing costs, which increased $7 million over the prior year period, primarily due to better pacing of our marketing investments to drive growth in our direct to consumer channel. And finally, general and administrative costs increased $3 million, primarily due to increased personnel costs. To some of our bridge, all of this resulted in adjusted EBITDA increasing $18 million to $71 million. With these results, we exceeded the midpoint of our outlook by approximately $25 million. And I want to take a moment to provide some context here. First, remember, when we provided our outlook, we were working with the late February data and assumed normal weather from March, but then March came in much more favorable than anticipated which was the primary driver of lower incidence or about a $10 million favorable impact compared to our guide. As a result, our net cost per service request came in much lower than anticipated in the first quarter. With a better than expected incidence rate, we were able to allocate more jobs to our preferred contractor network which handled 84% of our service requests in the first quarter. Additionally, we continue to benefit from our process improvements and rigorous cost management by our contractor relations team. We also benefited from some favorable timing around our marketing. Let's now turn to slide 12 for a review of our statement of cash flow. Net cash provided from operating activities was $84 million for the three months ended March 31st as a result of our exceptionally strong earnings and was comprised of $51 million in earnings adjusted for noncash charges and $34 million in cash provided from working capital that was primarily driven by seasonality. Net cash used for investing activities was $10 million and was primarily comprised of capital expenditures related to investments in technology. Net cash used for financing activities was $21 million and was comprised of $13 million of share repurchases as well as $4 million of scheduled debt payments. We ended the quarter with $378 million. This was comprised of $165 million of restricted cash and $213 million of unrestricted cash. We were also extremely pleased with our free cash flow conversion of $73 million for the three months ended March 31st. The majority of the increase over the prior year period was driven by higher earnings, and I believe this number speaks to the cash generating power of our business. Now turning to Slide 13, where I'll provide an update on our current capital structure. We continue to have an extremely strong financial position and a consistent capital allocation framework. Our number one priority remains to focus on growth, and we continue to prioritize investments that expand units as well as grow revenue and adjusted EBITDA, both organically and through opportunistic M&A. Our second objective is to ensure we have a solid financial profile, which includes maintaining appropriate levels of liquidity to run the business and a prudent long-term debt structure. We currently have a very modest level of debt, and we have a low net leverage ratio of 1.1x. And finally, our third objective is to return cash to shareholders. Through the end of April, we repurchased $33 million worth of shares, which brings our total to $314 million since we initiated our share repurchase program in 2021. Let me conclude this section by saying that I recognize that our unrestricted cash of over $200 million is above our targeted range of between $100 million to $150 million required to run the business. This higher cash balance was driven by our better results, coupled with timing and seasonality. This in turn drove our net leverage ratio down to 1.1x, which is below our targeted net leverage ratio of around 2x to 2.5x. We are coming off of some very volatile earnings, and it was not that long ago that our net leverage ratio was closer to 3x, I want to ensure that investors know, we do not plan on keeping our unrestricted cash or leverage ratio at the current level. We have a significant amount of financial flexibility and we will continue to follow the capital allocation strategy I just walk through when making decisions about utilizing our cash which is focused on growth and share repurchase. And now turning to slide 14, where I will walk through our second quarter and full year 2024 outlook. We expect our second quarter revenue to be between $530 million and $540 million, which reflects a mid-single digit increase in our renewal channel, a decline in our real estate channel of approximately 15% to 20% and roughly 16% decline in our DTC channel, which reflects an expected improvement from our first quarter results and a $10 million increase in other revenue to $34 million. Second quarter adjusted EBITDA is expected to range between $130 million and $140 million, a 12% increase over the prior year period. Now turning to our full year 2024 outlook, starting with revenue, where we are maintaining our range of $1.81 billion to $1.84 billion. This assumes a mid-single digit increase in the renewals channel, a 10% decline in the DTC channel and a 15% to 20% decline in the real estate channel. As a reminder, there is a timing difference between the time of sale occurs and reported revenue, which we recognize over 12 months. It also assumes other revenue will increase approximately 30% to a $100 million, primarily driven by higher on-demand revenue mainly sales from our new HVAC program. We continue to expect a mid-single digit increase in realized price, which will be offset by a mid-single digit decline in realized volume from lower member count. As a reminder, our 2023 home warranty count was down 6%, and we expect this to decline 1% to 3% in 2024 to approximately $1.95 million. We are raising our full year gross profit margin outlook to be approximately 50% as we continue to stabilize margins in our core business. This outlook assumes normal weather as we enter into our peak season. When our system is typically more strict. We are also saying that inflation will be in the low to mid-single digits on a net cost per service request basis and the number of service requests will decline 5% to approximately $3.7 million. We are maintaining our full year SG&A range to be between $580 million and $595 million as our 2024 plan includes a previously announced transition of marketing investments from the Frontdoor brand to the American Home Shield brand to support the relaunch. As Bill mentioned earlier, we are very excited about the brand relaunch as we anticipate it will play a critical role in increasing demand and growing revenue for the long term. Based on these updated inputs, we are increasing our full year adjusted EBITDA range to be between $360 million and $370 million. Our full year outlook also includes $13 million of interest income and this led to stock compensation expense of approximately $30 million. And finally, we expect our full year capital expenditures to range between $35 million and $45 million and the annual effective tax rate to be approximately 25%. In conclusion, we are very pleased with our first quarter financial results. We continue to deliver better than expected adjusted EBITDA as a result of the rigorous work the team has done to execute on our margin expansion initiatives, and we remain committed to finding new and innovative ways to continuously improve our business. I will now turn the call back over to Bill for a few closing remarks before we open up the line for questions. Bill?\n\nWilliam Cobb: Thanks Jessica. One final note before we go to your questions, you've heard me on the last call, talk about how we think our stock is undervalued. I still firmly believe that. Our first quarter performance demonstrates the exceptionally strong earnings power of our platform. We generate a lot of cash that we will use to grow or to buy back stock. And finally, I am confident that we are on the right path to increasing the growth trajectory of our customer base. There are so many upsides to this category in our company that we have decided to hold another Investor Day to share our vision and strategy with investors and analysts. The date we have chosen is November 7th in New York City. I think it will be well worth your time to attend and we will share more information as we get closer to November. Operator, let's now please open up for those who are on the line for questions.\n\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question goes to Jeff Schmitt of William Blair.\n\nJeff Schmitt: Hi, good morning. Unit volume continued decline in the mid-single digits. Do you think it's going to take a better just kind of a real estate environment lower inflation kind of better macro for to improve or could you potentially cut prices just given our strong gross margins are now? I mean, seems maybe you shot overshot a little bit pricing.\n\nWilliam Cobb: Yes, I think, Jeff, let me answer your question because I think you've hit on the right point here, real estate had service, there is no doubt about it. We have been increasing our level of discounting for DTC. one, and that is something that is underway. And hopefully we're going to realize the benefits of that. With the guide that we put together, obviously we think things are going to improve. We have not seen real estate improved to date, but everything everyone I talk to in the real estate industry says this current turn, it's going to turn, it's going to turn. So I think based on the guide we put together for the rest of the year, we do have confidence that real estate will start to lessen the decline and the turnaround in DTC as we relaunch the brand, we will start to be felt over the coming quarters.\n\nJeff Schmitt: Okay. And then yes. I guess on your '24 guide, so you have revenue growth of 2% to 3%. You have DTC revenues declining 10% unit growth down one to three. So obviously, they both had a kind of a tougher first quarter. So do you have either that kind of turning growth turning positive by yearend or maybe not quite that far. What's the kind of trend there?\n\nWilliam Cobb: I think trended-wise, it continues to get better. I'm not ready to commit to when we turn positive, but that clearly, the math would indicate that we're going to start to improve quarter by quarter. And certainly as we head into '25, I think we feel pretty good about where we're going to be.\n\nOperator: And your next question is from Cory Carpenter of JPMorgan (NYSE: JPM ).\n\nCory Carpente: Thanks. You announced the Frontdoor averaged the $2 million download mark a few days ago. Could you just address what's driving the engagement given you did shift some marketing dollars away from that towards American Home Shield? And so is that mostly organic demand and then where are you with some of your conversion optimization efforts there? Thank you.\n\nWilliam Cobb: Yes. So we've been pleased that I think the Frontdoor proposition has taken hold. So I think despite the shift of money, the download pieces continue to grow as have people signing up. The goal here has always been to get more customers and we now view Frontdoor as a holistic business. We run everything through the Frontdoor model for both our in-person services, our new HVAC upgrades, we have the unlimited product out there now. We just in the last week enable the any basic user in the app to be able to get there, get it and they track upgrade. So it's kind of the way we've evolved the Frontdoor model is to really make this the centerpiece of our on-demand services. So that's so it's really not about the conversion per se from the app. It's more about how do we continue to grow users and how do we grow engagement with them for the variety of services that we offer.\n\nCory Carpente: Thank you. And just a quick follow-up maybe for Jessica. The 11% price increase in 1Q, I know you expected it to be higher relative to the mid-single digit percent guide for the full year. Did you take another round of pricing? Was that above expectations or could you just talk about how you expect pricing and increasing the growth of the year? Thank you.\n\nJessica Ross: Yes. Now if you remember, Cory, the space is still coming off of those pricing actions that we took in 2022, which again, does take 12 to 18 months to flow through, the peak of that was Q4 and Q1. And so this is really the hit of the peak and you're going to see that decline over the years. Again, those 2022 pricing actions are just tapering off and throughout the year.\n\nOperator: The next question goes to Ian Zaffino of Oppenheimer.\n\nIan Zaffino: Hi, great. Thank you very much. And I guess two questions. I mean, first one would be on just the DTC business. When you think about maybe adjusting prices here, what type of magnitude do you think you need to adjust prices and to kind of restore growth in that business. And I know you have like a lot of R&D going on to so that probably mitigates the need to maybe adjust prices. But as analysts and we look at this, what should we kind of expect and how do we think about that? And then just could just on inflation. Can you maybe give us a breakdown between maybe labor parts by trade or something on those lines? Thank you.\n\nWilliam Cobb: Yes, I'll take the first one and then Jessica, you take the second one. As far as DTC and pricing, we are doing a blend of discounting as well as all the elements of the brand relaunch that we've talked about. We think we're starting to connect on some of the discounting work that we've done. Based on the guide, we do feel good about where DTC is headed, it's come through a tough trough here. The whole industry is down in overall home warranties. We've talked about real estate before, but I think the array of options. I think we needed to break out from what we keep calling the sea of sameness. I think we're doing that with the relaunch elements. And so I feel good about where we're headed, not only on those elements, but also the pricing actions we've decided to take. So I'll turn it over to Jessica for the inflation piece.\n\nJessica Ross: Hey, thanks, Ian. Remember, as we communicate Frontdoor inflation, it is on a net cost per service request basis. And so we don't communicate that individually. But rather that includes everything from uncontracted related cost, parts and equipment, impact of regulatory changes, process improvement initiatives and the impact of our trade service fees. So what I will say is that for Q1 inflation really came in relatively flat, which was a bit lower. I think it's continuing to moderate, which is why we adjusted our guide for the full year to be from, I think previously, we communicated mid to low and now we're at more of a low to mid.\n\nIan Zaffino: Okay. Thank you very much.\n\nJessica Ross: About mid, sorry, let me just clarify to mid. So we've continued to see some improvements there and hopefully that's helpful.\n\nOperator: The next question goes to Sergio Secura of KeyBank.\n\nSergio Segura: Thank you. Good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. First, Bill, hoping you could just talk about the American Shield brand relaunch so far, just what you're seeing? I know it's early, but just what you're seeing your expectations for how this will increase demand for the service over the course of the year. And if you think ultimately, just kind of the macroeconomic environment that you guys have been speaking to is going to impact the trajectory of the customer growth for this year?\n\nWilliam Cobb: Okay. Obviously, it's too early to tell to give specific results. We'll talk about that in the Q2 call. I do think what's happened and that's very encouraging is all the elements of the relaunch of come together and fit together really well. I think, again, all the things I went through in the call, I think the new logo looks great. I think our media plan has been terrific. I think the advertising has been great. The website, we're really pleased with what's been going on there. So the elements are in place for us to really start to kick start out of the sea of sameness that we've talked about. I think the other piece is that we believe real estate is going to get better but there's not much we can do about the macro on that, but we're not sitting back and just waiting for, hope real estate gets better and we are working very hard as you've seen with all the work we've done on our renewals business. I'm really, as I said in the call, I'm super proud of the efforts. The team has done there from our marketing efforts, our pricing team, our contractor relations team, our service ops team, everybody, has really pulled together to really drive, these are our customers and we want to continue to keep them as part of our company. And then supplemented by the initiative really from a standing start where our new HVAC program has really taken off as another vector in our overall revenue stream. So while we are going through this trough, new user counts being tough, we are not sitting idly by and hoping for the best. We are working across all elements, trying to come up with new initiatives and new way of thinking. And as you can see by our chart, overall '24 guide. We know we're coming through a tough piece in Q1, Q2 is going to get a little better, but I think it's going to be continuing that phase. But at the second half, I think we're going to have improved numbers and leading into 2025.\n\nSergio Segura: Great. Thanks, Bill. And then maybe a follow-up for Jesscia. I know you guys had very strong performance on margin side and raised your outlook for the year. I guess how should we think about that upside flowing down to profitability and increasing the pace of buybacks versus opportunities to invest even more behind growth initiatives to accelerate revenue growth. Thanks.\n\nJessica Ross: No, thanks, Sergio. I think it's a great question. I think as I said in my remarks, we recognize that we are sitting at a very low leverage ratio and a pretty strong unrestricted cash balance. And it's not our intention to sit here for the long term. I think where we really want to be as a longer-term target of about 2x to 2.5x on our leverage ratio and really focused on the $100 million to $150 million that we used to run the business. So we are very focused on sticking to our capital allocation strategy, which is really focused on growth and whether that be organically through or through opportunistic M&A. And absent that, excess cash is to buy back shares. So we've consistently been doing that since we launched the program and there was a little bit of timing and seasonality here for Q1, but it is our concern, our intention to continue to do that.\n\nOperator: And our next question goes to Mark Hughes of Truist.\n\nMark Hughes: Yes, thank you. Good morning. And thinking about the opportunistic M&A, would that typically be bringing new capabilities perhaps? Or is that -- are those deals normally they get that policyholder base and so it's more of a, call it, financial transaction. How do you look at that?\n\nWilliam Cobb: Yes, I think, Mark, I think we tried to look at it in a holistic manner. So we have a BD Group that takes a look at a variety of opportunities that can run the gamut of which you're exactly talking about. We don't have a stated policy of what we are specifically looking for because as an industry leader, I think we have the opportunity to look broadly at opportunities that may enhance the value of our company. So that's really the approach we're taking right now.\n\nMark Hughes: And you've touched on the other revenue, the HVAC opportunity. Could you maybe flesh that out what gives you confidence or visibility that should continue to expand? I think you perhaps in the past pointed out that there's some penetration of that program with some of your contractors, but there is more to do, do I have that right? How do you think about that growth?\n\nWilliam Cobb: We have, yes, I know fair point. We have a couple of tailwinds here. First of all, there is the environmental change or the regulatory change around refrigerant, which is going to render some of the refrigerant I know for older equipment obsolete. So people are going to have to upgrade their equipment. So that's a macro that's going to help us. Second is our relations with our contractor team in the sense of and there is great enthusiasm with our HR contractors engaged in this program and it's really simple economics for them. They'd much rather do a lot of $5,000 installed and come and then grow a truck for a couple of hundred dollars repair. So we have great enthusiasm from contractors. And then finally, the consumer receptivity to this and the value proposition with our ability to interact with our contractors to buy well with the OEMs. And then obviously our marketing abilities really adds up to a terrific business proposition for us. So that's why we're pretty pumped up about this area.\n\nJessica Ross: And one thing that I would add too is I think the contractor relations team has really been out there and doing a roadshow also expanding the adoption with the contractors and they continue to be really excited about that. So I think it's both the consumer, what we're anticipating from a consumer perspective, but we are doing everything we can here on the ground to make sure that the program is scaling.\n\nMark Hughes: And then, Jesscia, the claim development or reserve development. I think it was the $1 million tailwind this quarter. Is there anything structurally that you can talk about there? I think maybe in the past when inflation improved you ended up kind of coming in better than expected in your earlier accruals ended up being too high. But [inaudible] speaking, is there where do we stand on that?\n\nJessica Ross: Yes, no, I think it's a great point. It's actually something that I've been reflecting on. I think when that first quarter that I came in, so Q4 2022 and delivered results, we had an adjusted EBITDA beat of about $24 million. And I think we had about $25 million of claim costs for home at that quarter. And coming down to that one, I think as we've gotten off the volatility of that inflation, it's really stabilized and narrowed. So that same quarter we had about 15% or that year a Frontdoor inflation tailing down to flat. I think that really aligns with why you're seeing the tightening up of that claims cost development. And again, remember, fair, thank you.\n\nMark Hughes: Okay. What was the point again.\n\nJessica Ross: I was just going to say I think there's inflationary pressures. I just want to reiterate the work that the team is doing in terms of driving process improvements across the board that are also tightening up our costs. So I think there's, again getting to everything firing on all cylinders. It's just a holistic profit working together.\n\nOperator: The next question goes to Brian Fitzgerald of Wells Fargo (NYSE: WFC ).\n\nBrian Fitzgerald: Thanks. A couple of follow-ups. When you guys think of the strengths and weaknesses of the brand historically talking about the marketing campaign across regions and demographics, how are you thinking about the opportunities to maybe address regional or demographic opportunities that may have been underserved in the past? And then I have one follow-up.\n\nWilliam Cobb: Yes, I think the core of this is with any 50 year old brand, you got to revitalize it and but I think Frontdoor is extremely resilient. So I think that we've had a really good look at trying to revitalize, a brand. Kind of fire alarm in our building. I didn't set it off Brian, I really will answer your question, Anyway. I'll keep going go. We'll go find out what's going on here, but of course, perfect timing. Anyway, to your point about targeting, I think that there is and Kathy Collins and the marketing group have done a lot of work around new demographics. The Latino market is one that we're particularly interested in as they become a larger part of homeownership overall, we have a Spanish-language website now, and that's just some of the elements. That's just one example of ways we are trying to get more specific on our targeting efforts, but it's the right point to bring up. I think from a regional perspective, we still think there is a lot of opportunity and beyond the Sun Valley and kind of the Smile States where we have traditionally been very strong. So that is something that we are also trying to drive is greater penetration into some more northern markets. But that is part of the opportunity set that we think we're going to help to grow into.\n\nBrian Fitzgerald: Thanks, Bill, and then the other question we had was around the gross margin benefits from the service fee change. Could you give us some color on your expectations for how long that tailwind potential persists.\n\nWilliam Cobb: One thing I would say, and I'll let Jessica answer the specific is, the trade service fee increase was really an outcome of, as contractor costs and increased labor costs and fuel and insurance and all those elements. We raised the trade service fee really in response to staying current with where contractor costs were. Now as far as how it flows through the P&L, I'll let Jessica --.\n\nJessica Ross: I mean, again, these are behavior shifts and so they debate can take time so we've anticipated this in our plans throughout 2024.\n\nOperator: Thank you. We have no further questions. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you again for joining Frontdoor's First Quarter 2024 Earnings Call.

(FTDR) has reported a robust first quarter for 2024, with significant growth in revenue and adjusted EBITDA despite facing headwinds in the home warranty market. The company noted a 3% increase in revenue to $378 million and a 33% rise in adjusted EBITDA to $71 million. This performance is a result of higher prices, service fees, and improved processes, which led to a 14% increase in gross profit to $195 million.\n\nHowever, Frontdoor also acknowledged a decline in demand due to a challenging real estate market and consumer confusion in the direct-to-consumer channel. The company is actively addressing these issues with a brand relaunch and a focus on customer service enhancements. Looking ahead, Frontdoor expects higher revenue and adjusted EBITDA in the second quarter and has raised its full-year outlook for 2024.\n\nFrontdoor Inc. is navigating a complex market environment with strategic initiatives aimed at revitalizing its brand and enhancing customer engagement. The company's record performance in the first quarter, coupled with its positive outlook for the remainder of the year, reflects its resilience and adaptability in the face of industry challenges. Frontdoor's commitment to process improvement and cost management, as well as its focus on growth initiatives such as M&A opportunities and the HVAC program, positions the company to capitalize on potential market improvements and drive long-term growth.\n\nFrontdoor Inc. (FTDR) has demonstrated a solid performance in the first quarter of 2024, and InvestingPro data provides further context to the company's financial health and market position. With a market capitalization of $2.7 billion, Frontdoor is trading at a P/E ratio of 15.15, which is considered attractive when compared to its near-term earnings growth. This is underscored by an adjusted P/E ratio for the last twelve months as of Q1 2024 of 13.87, suggesting investors are getting value for their money relative to the company's earnings.\n\nInvestingPro Tips highlight that Frontdoor has a perfect Piotroski Score of 9, indicating strong financial health and suggesting that the company is well-positioned to withstand market downturns. Additionally, management's aggressive share buyback strategy is a positive sign, reflecting confidence in the company's future prospects. This is further supported by analysts revising their earnings upwards for the upcoming period, a bullish indicator for potential investors.\n\nDespite the challenges in the real estate market, Frontdoor's revenue growth over the last twelve months has been 6.73%, with a gross profit margin of 50.75%, aligning with the company's reported increase in gross profit in Q1 2024. The company's significant return over the last week, with a price total return of 10.77%, and over the last month, with a return of 12.68%, emphasizes the strong investor confidence in the stock's short-term performance.\n\nFor those looking for more insights, there are additional InvestingPro Tips available, which can be accessed through the dedicated Frontdoor Inc. page on InvestingPro.

I will now turn the call over to Bill Cobb for opening comments. Bill?\n\nWilliam Cobb: Thank you very much, Matt Davis and hello again, everybody, Frontdoor Inc. continues to operate extremely well, and we are off to a great start in 2024 as we delivered another quarter of record results. As you can see on slide 4, revenue grew 3% to $378 million. Gross margin increased 510 basis points to 51%. Adjusted EBITDA rose 33% to an all-time first quarter high of $71 million. And as a result of our strong first quarter financial performance, we are increasing our full year 2024 adjusted EBITDA outlook. So while we continue to exceed expectations on the margin side, our top priority remains growing our customer base. Let's be clear, right upfront. Demand for home warranties has been down due to some challenging market conditions, but we view this as a temporary cyclical issue. The main cause of lower demand has been real estate. As I've said before, we sell our products as part of the real estate process and as the number of existing homes has declined from 6 million in 2022 to just over 4 million homes today, we have had significantly fewer opportunities to sell our products. This was due in part to rising mortgage rates, which recently reached a one year high. At the same time, existing home inventory has been extremely tight. This is not only limited existing home sales, but it has also resisted in a significant power shift to the seller over the last several years. As a result, our real estate channel sales are less than half of what they were five years ago. And this continues to impact our customer count, revenue growth, profitability and cash flows. And from everything that we see. This is true for the rest of the home warranty category. So while we are still optimistic that the real estate channel will eventually come back, we are waiting to see more tangible proof of the turnaround. Now turning to the direct-to-consumer channel, where we have also seen lower demand. For those of you new to our story, home warranties have historically been sold primarily through the real estate channel. It was only about 25 years ago when we started marketing and selling directly to homeowners. This was a powerful growth engine for us as we saw a strong correlation between marketing spend and our sales. However, about a year after COVID, and we began seeing a decline in consumer demand as the recent indicator of this Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) searches for the short term, Home Warranty were down 7% this past March. We have known that something needed to change and here's some of the things we learned from really digging into consumer research. First, consumers have a hard time understanding home warranties, they easily confuse it with homeowners insurance or other products. Second, consumers want to feel like they've got someone in their corner. What really resonated with our focus groups is when we grounded them in the higher level benefits of a home warranty like peace of mind, freedom and happiness. Third, we have not done enough to stand out from our competition. The category has been defined by what we call a sea of sameness among providers, and we realize we needed to take action to break out from the competition. Additionally, consumer behavior has been impacted by the larger macroenvironment as a result of rising inflation and higher costs. This has been echoed by several of the other companies as recently as this morning was mentioned, consumers are pulling back on spending. We view this as a temporary reset of consumer spending. As consumers have not been prioritizing the budget protection and convenience of home warranties. I will go into how we are addressing this shortly. Now turning to renewals, which continues to be a bright spot for us. For the first quarter 2024, our retention rate grew to 76.3%. While this includes a lower mix of real estate customers. Retention continues to perform very well. Our team has done a great job of implementing a wide range of initiatives to improve retention, such as better engaging our consumers, specifically during the onboarding process, expanding dynamic pricing to minimize churn, continuing to improve the customer experience with a large part of that effort coming from increasing utilization of our preferred contractors. This is a dual benefit of lowering costs while delivering a better experience. And finally, we have increased the number of customers on AutoPay, which remained at a record 86% in the first quarter, which makes them much more likely to renew their home warranty. We know there is more we can do to improve our customer service and we are diligently working on those initiatives, but I am super proud of our team's accomplishments in this area. We've also been very proud of our new HVAC sales program, which delivered over $50 million of revenue in 2023. As you would imagine, much of this came in the second and third quarter, and we are expecting a similar pattern this year as we head into our peak summer season. In fact, we recently enhanced the Frontdoor app so that all users can now buy a new HVAC system. We are also continuing to grow into alternative revenue streams by building out our technology capabilities for additional on-demand services. Our vision is to provide a consolidated ecosystem where customers have access to video chats with an expert which might then turn into purchasing a-la-carte repair and maintenance services or even new systems and appliances all through our app, more to come here, but we know that the market opportunity is significant, and we will continue to work to find ways to monetize that demand. Let's now turn to slide 6 and our opportunity. As I said on our last call, there are about 5 million homes in the US that have a warranty. We believe that figure could be approximately three times higher if consumers better understood the value of a home warranty, which brings us to the American Home Shield brand relaunch, which is a primary component of our strategy to increase demand. And I'm very excited that we successfully kicked off the relaunch in early April, we took a holistic approach to the relaunch, which has the following components. At the highest level we wanted to break out from that sea of sameness in the home warranty category. And that starts with a new strategy that truly brings a refreshed and high energy look to our brand. We also wanted to connect to new and larger audiences. So we came up with an innovative ad campaign with a new voice and a new brand visual identity. We wanted to have a catchy recognizable tag line. And that's why we came up with Don't Worry. Be Warranty. This tag line captures that feeling. We want homeowners to take away peace of mind, freedom and happiness. It's proactive and goes right at the main word that defines our services. We also needed a new logo so that consumers can better distinguish us from our competition. So we refreshed with brighter, bolder colors and a more modern look, we wanted to use comedy and a strong well-known personality to do something different to break through to consumers. That's why we are extremely excited about our new celebrity spokesperson for 'Warrantina, starring Rachel dredge, which we believe will drive greater interest in our products. And finally, we wanted a comprehensive media campaign with new marketing partners, as shown on Slide 8. This is now a true omnichannel campaign that is highly visible. We are we develop great new partnerships that are better reflected our customer base for example, we launched a campaign on WrestleMania. We were also on CNN's coverage of the solar eclipse in a big way with our website traffic hitting new highs that day. Speaking of the website, I encourage all of you to visit ahs.com and hope you notice it not only has an updated look, but it also has a more intuitive interface and navigation tools that will improve conversion. In summary, we are truly bringing a refreshed and high energy look to our brand. However, we know we have relaunched our brand in the face of a challenging macroenvironment for home warranties. But that is the point as the leader in our category is our job to turn demand around and we are optimistic this relaunch will improve the growth trajectory for home warranties for years to come. With this much change, it would be premature to talk results thus far. However, we are excited about what we are seeing in web traffic and in other areas and look forward to providing you more details on our next call. Before I turn the call over to Jessica, I want to reiterate that we are off to a great start in 2024. And our first quarter performance continues to show that Frontdoor Inc. is operating extremely well. Jessica?\n\nJessica Ross: Thanks Bill, and good morning, everyone. Before I get into the details, I wanted to first build on Bill's remarks with a few high-level thoughts about a quarter and outlook. First, we want to celebrate that we had another record quarter, which was primarily driven by better than expected margins as the team continues to drive operational excellence across the business through our margin expansion initiatives. Second, in response to our strong first quarter performance, I'm pleased to share that we are raising our full year outlook for gross margin and adjusted EBITDA. Now let's turn to Slide 9, where I'll review our first quarter 2024 financial summary. First quarter revenue increased 3% versus the prior year period to $378 million. Net income increased 56% to $34 million and adjusted EBITDA increased 33% to $71 million, which both represent records for first quarter performance. Now moving to Slide 10, where gross profit for the quarter increased 14% versus the prior year period to $195 million and gross margin improved 510 basis points to 51%. The gross profit improvement was primarily driven by higher realized price, a transition to higher service fees and continued process improvement initiatives and was partially offset by inflationary cost pressures. Let's now move to the adjusted EBITDA bridge on Slide 11, where I'll provide more context for the year-over-year improvement in first quarter adjusted EBITDA, starting at the top, we had $14 million of favorable revenue conversion, driven by an 11% increase in price over the prior year period. This was partially offset by an 8% decline in volume primarily driven by lower sales in our first year channels. This also includes a $6 million increase in other revenue due to higher on-demand home services, primarily from the new HVAC program. Contract claims costs decreased $10 million, which was better than expected. This includes a transition to higher service fees that had two impacts. Third, higher service fees resulted in a lower number of service requests per customer as we typically see a temporary change in customer behavior until they become accustomed to the new fee amounts. Second, higher service fees also resulted in a lower net cost per service request, and these fees are a contra cost to claims expense on our income statement. Additionally, our contract claims costs improved over the prior year period in part due to our ongoing process improvement initiative. This includes improving our planning processes, moving more of our service requests to our preferred contractors. Our new high cost claims review program and leveraging our bulk purchasing power. These improvements were partially offset by ongoing inflation as well as a $5 million unfavorable change in claims cost development year over year. Now moving to sales and marketing costs, which increased $7 million over the prior year period, primarily due to better pacing of our marketing investments to drive growth in our direct to consumer channel. And finally, general and administrative costs increased $3 million, primarily due to increased personnel costs. To some of our bridge, all of this resulted in adjusted EBITDA increasing $18 million to $71 million. With these results, we exceeded the midpoint of our outlook by approximately $25 million. And I want to take a moment to provide some context here. First, remember, when we provided our outlook, we were working with the late February data and assumed normal weather from March, but then March came in much more favorable than anticipated which was the primary driver of lower incidence or about a $10 million favorable impact compared to our guide. As a result, our net cost per service request came in much lower than anticipated in the first quarter. With a better than expected incidence rate, we were able to allocate more jobs to our preferred contractor network which handled 84% of our service requests in the first quarter. Additionally, we continue to benefit from our process improvements and rigorous cost management by our contractor relations team. We also benefited from some favorable timing around our marketing. Let's now turn to slide 12 for a review of our statement of cash flow. Net cash provided from operating activities was $84 million for the three months ended March 31st as a result of our exceptionally strong earnings and was comprised of $51 million in earnings adjusted for noncash charges and $34 million in cash provided from working capital that was primarily driven by seasonality. Net cash used for investing activities was $10 million and was primarily comprised of capital expenditures related to investments in technology. Net cash used for financing activities was $21 million and was comprised of $13 million of share repurchases as well as $4 million of scheduled debt payments. We ended the quarter with $378 million. This was comprised of $165 million of restricted cash and $213 million of unrestricted cash. We were also extremely pleased with our free cash flow conversion of $73 million for the three months ended March 31st. The majority of the increase over the prior year period was driven by higher earnings, and I believe this number speaks to the cash generating power of our business. Now turning to Slide 13, where I'll provide an update on our current capital structure. We continue to have an extremely strong financial position and a consistent capital allocation framework. Our number one priority remains to focus on growth, and we continue to prioritize investments that expand units as well as grow revenue and adjusted EBITDA, both organically and through opportunistic M&A. Our second objective is to ensure we have a solid financial profile, which includes maintaining appropriate levels of liquidity to run the business and a prudent long-term debt structure. We currently have a very modest level of debt, and we have a low net leverage ratio of 1.1x. And finally, our third objective is to return cash to shareholders. Through the end of April, we repurchased $33 million worth of shares, which brings our total to $314 million since we initiated our share repurchase program in 2021. Let me conclude this section by saying that I recognize that our unrestricted cash of over $200 million is above our targeted range of between $100 million to $150 million required to run the business. This higher cash balance was driven by our better results, coupled with timing and seasonality. This in turn drove our net leverage ratio down to 1.1x, which is below our targeted net leverage ratio of around 2x to 2.5x. We are coming off of some very volatile earnings, and it was not that long ago that our net leverage ratio was closer to 3x, I want to ensure that investors know, we do not plan on keeping our unrestricted cash or leverage ratio at the current level. We have a significant amount of financial flexibility and we will continue to follow the capital allocation strategy I just walk through when making decisions about utilizing our cash which is focused on growth and share repurchase. And now turning to slide 14, where I will walk through our second quarter and full year 2024 outlook. We expect our second quarter revenue to be between $530 million and $540 million, which reflects a mid-single digit increase in our renewal channel, a decline in our real estate channel of approximately 15% to 20% and roughly 16% decline in our DTC channel, which reflects an expected improvement from our first quarter results and a $10 million increase in other revenue to $34 million. Second quarter adjusted EBITDA is expected to range between $130 million and $140 million, a 12% increase over the prior year period. Now turning to our full year 2024 outlook, starting with revenue, where we are maintaining our range of $1.81 billion to $1.84 billion. This assumes a mid-single digit increase in the renewals channel, a 10% decline in the DTC channel and a 15% to 20% decline in the real estate channel. As a reminder, there is a timing difference between the time of sale occurs and reported revenue, which we recognize over 12 months. It also assumes other revenue will increase approximately 30% to a $100 million, primarily driven by higher on-demand revenue mainly sales from our new HVAC program. We continue to expect a mid-single digit increase in realized price, which will be offset by a mid-single digit decline in realized volume from lower member count. As a reminder, our 2023 home warranty count was down 6%, and we expect this to decline 1% to 3% in 2024 to approximately $1.95 million. We are raising our full year gross profit margin outlook to be approximately 50% as we continue to stabilize margins in our core business. This outlook assumes normal weather as we enter into our peak season. When our system is typically more strict. We are also saying that inflation will be in the low to mid-single digits on a net cost per service request basis and the number of service requests will decline 5% to approximately $3.7 million. We are maintaining our full year SG&A range to be between $580 million and $595 million as our 2024 plan includes a previously announced transition of marketing investments from the Frontdoor brand to the American Home Shield brand to support the relaunch. As Bill mentioned earlier, we are very excited about the brand relaunch as we anticipate it will play a critical role in increasing demand and growing revenue for the long term. Based on these updated inputs, we are increasing our full year adjusted EBITDA range to be between $360 million and $370 million. Our full year outlook also includes $13 million of interest income and this led to stock compensation expense of approximately $30 million. And finally, we expect our full year capital expenditures to range between $35 million and $45 million and the annual effective tax rate to be approximately 25%. In conclusion, we are very pleased with our first quarter financial results. We continue to deliver better than expected adjusted EBITDA as a result of the rigorous work the team has done to execute on our margin expansion initiatives, and we remain committed to finding new and innovative ways to continuously improve our business. I will now turn the call back over to Bill for a few closing remarks before we open up the line for questions. Bill?\n\nWilliam Cobb: Thanks Jessica. One final note before we go to your questions, you've heard me on the last call, talk about how we think our stock is undervalued. I still firmly believe that. Our first quarter performance demonstrates the exceptionally strong earnings power of our platform. We generate a lot of cash that we will use to grow or to buy back stock. And finally, I am confident that we are on the right path to increasing the growth trajectory of our customer base. There are so many upsides to this category in our company that we have decided to hold another Investor Day to share our vision and strategy with investors and analysts. The date we have chosen is November 7th in New York City. I think it will be well worth your time to attend and we will share more information as we get closer to November. Operator, let's now please open up for those who are on the line for questions.\n\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question goes to Jeff Schmitt of William Blair.\n\nJeff Schmitt: Hi, good morning. Unit volume continued decline in the mid-single digits. Do you think it's going to take a better just kind of a real estate environment lower inflation kind of better macro for to improve or could you potentially cut prices just given our strong gross margins are now? I mean, seems maybe you shot overshot a little bit pricing.\n\nWilliam Cobb: Yes, I think, Jeff, let me answer your question because I think you've hit on the right point here, real estate had service, there is no doubt about it. We have been increasing our level of discounting for DTC. one, and that is something that is underway. And hopefully we're going to realize the benefits of that. With the guide that we put together, obviously we think things are going to improve. We have not seen real estate improved to date, but everything everyone I talk to in the real estate industry says this current turn, it's going to turn, it's going to turn. So I think based on the guide we put together for the rest of the year, we do have confidence that real estate will start to lessen the decline and the turnaround in DTC as we relaunch the brand, we will start to be felt over the coming quarters.\n\nJeff Schmitt: Okay. And then yes. I guess on your '24 guide, so you have revenue growth of 2% to 3%. You have DTC revenues declining 10% unit growth down one to three. So obviously, they both had a kind of a tougher first quarter. So do you have either that kind of turning growth turning positive by yearend or maybe not quite that far. What's the kind of trend there?\n\nWilliam Cobb: I think trended-wise, it continues to get better. I'm not ready to commit to when we turn positive, but that clearly, the math would indicate that we're going to start to improve quarter by quarter. And certainly as we head into '25, I think we feel pretty good about where we're going to be.\n\nOperator: And your next question is from Cory Carpenter of JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM).\n\nCory Carpente: Thanks. You announced the Frontdoor averaged the $2 million download mark a few days ago. Could you just address what's driving the engagement given you did shift some marketing dollars away from that towards American Home Shield? And so is that mostly organic demand and then where are you with some of your conversion optimization efforts there? Thank you.\n\nWilliam Cobb: Yes. So we've been pleased that I think the Frontdoor proposition has taken hold. So I think despite the shift of money, the download pieces continue to grow as have people signing up. The goal here has always been to get more customers and we now view Frontdoor as a holistic business. We run everything through the Frontdoor model for both our in-person services, our new HVAC upgrades, we have the unlimited product out there now. We just in the last week enable the any basic user in the app to be able to get there, get it and they track upgrade. So it's kind of the way we've evolved the Frontdoor model is to really make this the centerpiece of our on-demand services. So that's so it's really not about the conversion per se from the app. It's more about how do we continue to grow users and how do we grow engagement with them for the variety of services that we offer.\n\nCory Carpente: Thank you. And just a quick follow-up maybe for Jessica. The 11% price increase in 1Q, I know you expected it to be higher relative to the mid-single digit percent guide for the full year. Did you take another round of pricing? Was that above expectations or could you just talk about how you expect pricing and increasing the growth of the year? Thank you.\n\nJessica Ross: Yes. Now if you remember, Cory, the space is still coming off of those pricing actions that we took in 2022, which again, does take 12 to 18 months to flow through, the peak of that was Q4 and Q1. And so this is really the hit of the peak and you're going to see that decline over the years. Again, those 2022 pricing actions are just tapering off and throughout the year.\n\nOperator: The next question goes to Ian Zaffino of Oppenheimer.\n\nIan Zaffino: Hi, great. Thank you very much. And I guess two questions. I mean, first one would be on just the DTC business. When you think about maybe adjusting prices here, what type of magnitude do you think you need to adjust prices and to kind of restore growth in that business. And I know you have like a lot of R&D going on to so that probably mitigates the need to maybe adjust prices. But as analysts and we look at this, what should we kind of expect and how do we think about that? And then just could just on inflation. Can you maybe give us a breakdown between maybe labor parts by trade or something on those lines? Thank you.\n\nWilliam Cobb: Yes, I'll take the first one and then Jessica, you take the second one. As far as DTC and pricing, we are doing a blend of discounting as well as all the elements of the brand relaunch that we've talked about. We think we're starting to connect on some of the discounting work that we've done. Based on the guide, we do feel good about where DTC is headed, it's come through a tough trough here. The whole industry is down in overall home warranties. We've talked about real estate before, but I think the array of options. I think we needed to break out from what we keep calling the sea of sameness. I think we're doing that with the relaunch elements. And so I feel good about where we're headed, not only on those elements, but also the pricing actions we've decided to take. So I'll turn it over to Jessica for the inflation piece.\n\nJessica Ross: Hey, thanks, Ian. Remember, as we communicate Frontdoor inflation, it is on a net cost per service request basis. And so we don't communicate that individually. But rather that includes everything from uncontracted related cost, parts and equipment, impact of regulatory changes, process improvement initiatives and the impact of our trade service fees. So what I will say is that for Q1 inflation really came in relatively flat, which was a bit lower. I think it's continuing to moderate, which is why we adjusted our guide for the full year to be from, I think previously, we communicated mid to low and now we're at more of a low to mid.\n\nIan Zaffino: Okay. Thank you very much.\n\nJessica Ross: About mid, sorry, let me just clarify to mid. So we've continued to see some improvements there and hopefully that's helpful.\n\nOperator: The next question goes to Sergio Secura of KeyBank.\n\nSergio Segura: Thank you. Good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. First, Bill, hoping you could just talk about the American Shield brand relaunch so far, just what you're seeing? I know it's early, but just what you're seeing your expectations for how this will increase demand for the service over the course of the year. And if you think ultimately, just kind of the macroeconomic environment that you guys have been speaking to is going to impact the trajectory of the customer growth for this year?\n\nWilliam Cobb: Okay. Obviously, it's too early to tell to give specific results. We'll talk about that in the Q2 call. I do think what's happened and that's very encouraging is all the elements of the relaunch of come together and fit together really well. I think, again, all the things I went through in the call, I think the new logo looks great. I think our media plan has been terrific. I think the advertising has been great. The website, we're really pleased with what's been going on there. So the elements are in place for us to really start to kick start out of the sea of sameness that we've talked about. I think the other piece is that we believe real estate is going to get better but there's not much we can do about the macro on that, but we're not sitting back and just waiting for, hope real estate gets better and we are working very hard as you've seen with all the work we've done on our renewals business. I'm really, as I said in the call, I'm super proud of the efforts. The team has done there from our marketing efforts, our pricing team, our contractor relations team, our service ops team, everybody, has really pulled together to really drive, these are our customers and we want to continue to keep them as part of our company. And then supplemented by the initiative really from a standing start where our new HVAC program has really taken off as another vector in our overall revenue stream. So while we are going through this trough, new user counts being tough, we are not sitting idly by and hoping for the best. We are working across all elements, trying to come up with new initiatives and new way of thinking. And as you can see by our chart, overall '24 guide. We know we're coming through a tough piece in Q1, Q2 is going to get a little better, but I think it's going to be continuing that phase. But at the second half, I think we're going to have improved numbers and leading into 2025.\n\nSergio Segura: Great. Thanks, Bill. And then maybe a follow-up for Jesscia. I know you guys had very strong performance on margin side and raised your outlook for the year. I guess how should we think about that upside flowing down to profitability and increasing the pace of buybacks versus opportunities to invest even more behind growth initiatives to accelerate revenue growth. Thanks.\n\nJessica Ross: No, thanks, Sergio. I think it's a great question. I think as I said in my remarks, we recognize that we are sitting at a very low leverage ratio and a pretty strong unrestricted cash balance. And it's not our intention to sit here for the long term. I think where we really want to be as a longer-term target of about 2x to 2.5x on our leverage ratio and really focused on the $100 million to $150 million that we used to run the business. So we are very focused on sticking to our capital allocation strategy, which is really focused on growth and whether that be organically through or through opportunistic M&A. And absent that, excess cash is to buy back shares. So we've consistently been doing that since we launched the program and there was a little bit of timing and seasonality here for Q1, but it is our concern, our intention to continue to do that.\n\nOperator: And our next question goes to Mark Hughes of Truist.\n\nMark Hughes: Yes, thank you. Good morning. And thinking about the opportunistic M&A, would that typically be bringing new capabilities perhaps? Or is that -- are those deals normally they get that policyholder base and so it's more of a, call it, financial transaction. How do you look at that?\n\nWilliam Cobb: Yes, I think, Mark, I think we tried to look at it in a holistic manner. So we have a BD Group that takes a look at a variety of opportunities that can run the gamut of which you're exactly talking about. We don't have a stated policy of what we are specifically looking for because as an industry leader, I think we have the opportunity to look broadly at opportunities that may enhance the value of our company. So that's really the approach we're taking right now.\n\nMark Hughes: And you've touched on the other revenue, the HVAC opportunity. Could you maybe flesh that out what gives you confidence or visibility that should continue to expand? I think you perhaps in the past pointed out that there's some penetration of that program with some of your contractors, but there is more to do, do I have that right? How do you think about that growth?\n\nWilliam Cobb: We have, yes, I know fair point. We have a couple of tailwinds here. First of all, there is the environmental change or the regulatory change around refrigerant, which is going to render some of the refrigerant I know for older equipment obsolete. So people are going to have to upgrade their equipment. So that's a macro that's going to help us. Second is our relations with our contractor team in the sense of and there is great enthusiasm with our HR contractors engaged in this program and it's really simple economics for them. They'd much rather do a lot of $5,000 installed and come and then grow a truck for a couple of hundred dollars repair. So we have great enthusiasm from contractors. And then finally, the consumer receptivity to this and the value proposition with our ability to interact with our contractors to buy well with the OEMs. And then obviously our marketing abilities really adds up to a terrific business proposition for us. So that's why we're pretty pumped up about this area.\n\nJessica Ross: And one thing that I would add too is I think the contractor relations team has really been out there and doing a roadshow also expanding the adoption with the contractors and they continue to be really excited about that. So I think it's both the consumer, what we're anticipating from a consumer perspective, but we are doing everything we can here on the ground to make sure that the program is scaling.\n\nMark Hughes: And then, Jesscia, the claim development or reserve development. I think it was the $1 million tailwind this quarter. Is there anything structurally that you can talk about there? I think maybe in the past when inflation improved you ended up kind of coming in better than expected in your earlier accruals ended up being too high. But [inaudible] speaking, is there where do we stand on that?\n\nJessica Ross: Yes, no, I think it's a great point. It's actually something that I've been reflecting on. I think when that first quarter that I came in, so Q4 2022 and delivered results, we had an adjusted EBITDA beat of about $24 million. And I think we had about $25 million of claim costs for home at that quarter. And coming down to that one, I think as we've gotten off the volatility of that inflation, it's really stabilized and narrowed. So that same quarter we had about 15% or that year a Frontdoor inflation tailing down to flat. I think that really aligns with why you're seeing the tightening up of that claims cost development. And again, remember, fair, thank you.\n\nMark Hughes: Okay. What was the point again.\n\nJessica Ross: I was just going to say I think there's inflationary pressures. I just want to reiterate the work that the team is doing in terms of driving process improvements across the board that are also tightening up our costs. So I think there's, again getting to everything firing on all cylinders. It's just a holistic profit working together.\n\nOperator: The next question goes to Brian Fitzgerald of Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC).\n\nBrian Fitzgerald: Thanks. A couple of follow-ups. When you guys think of the strengths and weaknesses of the brand historically talking about the marketing campaign across regions and demographics, how are you thinking about the opportunities to maybe address regional or demographic opportunities that may have been underserved in the past? And then I have one follow-up.\n\nWilliam Cobb: Yes, I think the core of this is with any 50 year old brand, you got to revitalize it and but I think Frontdoor is extremely resilient. So I think that we've had a really good look at trying to revitalize, a brand. Kind of fire alarm in our building. I didn't set it off Brian, I really will answer your question, Anyway. I'll keep going go. We'll go find out what's going on here, but of course, perfect timing. Anyway, to your point about targeting, I think that there is and Kathy Collins and the marketing group have done a lot of work around new demographics. The Latino market is one that we're particularly interested in as they become a larger part of homeownership overall, we have a Spanish-language website now, and that's just some of the elements. That's just one example of ways we are trying to get more specific on our targeting efforts, but it's the right point to bring up. I think from a regional perspective, we still think there is a lot of opportunity and beyond the Sun Valley and kind of the Smile States where we have traditionally been very strong. So that is something that we are also trying to drive is greater penetration into some more northern markets. But that is part of the opportunity set that we think we're going to help to grow into.\n\nBrian Fitzgerald: Thanks, Bill, and then the other question we had was around the gross margin benefits from the service fee change. Could you give us some color on your expectations for how long that tailwind potential persists.\n\nWilliam Cobb: One thing I would say, and I'll let Jessica answer the specific is, the trade service fee increase was really an outcome of, as contractor costs and increased labor costs and fuel and insurance and all those elements. We raised the trade service fee really in response to staying current with where contractor costs were. Now as far as how it flows through the P&L, I'll let Jessica --.\n\nJessica Ross: I mean, again, these are behavior shifts and so they debate can take time so we've anticipated this in our plans throughout 2024.\n\nOperator: Thank you. We have no further questions. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you again for joining Frontdoor's First Quarter 2024 Earnings Call.

See the company's earnings release for a reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures as well as additional information about the company's reliance on non-GAAP financial measures. I will now turn the call over to Paul.\n\nPaul Badawi: Thanks, Trip. We continue to advance our mission of developing transformative, interventional technologies that allow eye care providers to procedurally elevate the standards of care, empowering people to keep seeing. In the first quarter, we saw an increase in the utilization of our Surgical Glaucoma technologies as compared to the previous quarter and the first quarter of 2023 and continue to demonstrate operational excellence with our strong gross margins and disciplined expense management. We are executing on our strategic initiatives to facilitate appropriate and equitable market access and expand our clinical evidence portfolio in both segments. Our first quarter performance only increases our excitement about 2024 and the long-term opportunities in front of us. We believe that our compelling commercial strategies into multibillion-dollar market opportunities, robust clinical efficacy supporting our differentiated interventional portfolio and experienced management team have created a tremendous opportunity to drive durable and profitable growth over the coming years. We generated total revenue of $19.3 million in the first quarter, representing a record for our first quarter period. Growth was 3% sequentially from the fourth quarter of 2023 and 2% compared to the first quarter of 2023. At the same time, we significantly decreased our cash usage to $10.8 million in the first quarter of 2024, compared to $17.7 million in the first quarter of 2023, while still investing in our commercial and R&D value drivers and after taking into account our debt restructuring payments and typical first quarter bonus payments. I will now turn to a more detailed discussion of our business segments, starting with our Surgical Glaucoma segment. We are pleased with our quarterly performance with Surgical Glaucoma revenue of $18.3 million, representing sequential growth of 6% compared to the fourth quarter of 2023 and growth of 5% compared to the same period in the prior year. OMNI is positioned as an important MIGS technology that surgeons rely on to treat their glaucoma patients and our recovery trajectory attracting to our expectations. We remain confident in our ability to continue expanding our position in the Surgical Glaucoma market for both combination cataract uses and stand-alone uses. We have strategically focused on a few critical drivers to build long-term success within our Surgical Glaucoma segment. Our main priorities are to increase surgeon utilization across all accounts and reengage accounts who ceased or decreased their orders during the LCD uncertainty period. We also continue to focus our efforts on increasing the pipeline of new surgeons to be trained on OMNI and SION. Growth in the first quarter of 2024 was driven primarily by increased utilization from existing accounts of OMNI and SION, which had both sequential growth and growth when compared to the same period in the prior year. This is a testament in large part to the leading clinical profile of OMNI, which demonstrates the efficacy of OMNI at lowering both IOP and IOP-reducing medications, for a broad set of primary open-angle glaucoma patients. In parallel, we are actively reengaging with accounts that have ceased or decreased their orders during the LCD uncertainty period, during the second half of 2023, before the LCDs were withdrawn in late December 2023. As a reminder, we experienced net account attrition of approximately 6% during that period, which we believe was primarily due to the uncertainty caused by the LCDs in the same period. We expect returning accounts to contribute toward further regaining momentum in the second quarter to help drive low double-digit sequential growth from the first quarter of 2024 and toward double-digit growth in the second half of the year versus the comparable period in the prior year. Another core aspect of our strategy is building our funnel of surgeons to be trained on procedures enabled by our OMNI technology. We are pleased to see that our funnel has increased over the past few months and we expect this funnel to continue to strengthen throughout the remainder of 2024. Producing robust clinical data also remains a critical piece of our strategy to drive increased adoption and utilization of OMNI. The compelling results from the prospective multicenter GEMINI 2 study demonstrated sustained and clinically significant IOP reduction of 29% at three years and clinically significant reduction of IOP-lowering medication use, as 74% of study patients were medication-free at three years. Most recently, we announced the publication of a large-scale real-world clinical outcome study of patients treated by the three most common MIGS technologies in AJO International. The results further demonstrated OMNI's strong efficacy profile. Using the American Academy of Ophthalmology's IRIS Registry, the largest specialty society clinical data registry in all of medicine, and the first comprehensive eye disease clinical registry in the United States, this large-scale MIGS study evaluated long-term two-year, postsurgical outcomes among patients with primary open-angle glaucoma treated with the three most commonly used FDA approved or cleared ab interno MIGS devices in the U.S., OMNI, Hydrus Microstent and iStent inject combined with cataract surgery, as well as for cataract surgery alone. The results from this study reported that the comprehensive outflow procedure performed with the OMNI Surgical System technology was effective at lowering both IOP and IOP-reducing medication use at two years. The results were further evidence of the OMNI procedure durable efficacy at two years and were consistent with our many prior published studies. We are excited to see that large-scale real-world studies of MIGS standards of care provide further evidence of the robust IOP reduction and medication reduction, associated with the comprehensive outflow procedure enabled by OMNI. The body of evidence supporting OMNI's clinical efficacy continues to expand, continuing to strengthen our belief that the comprehensive outflow procedure enabled by OMNI is a critical procedure in the field of glaucoma that is elevating the standard of care. We will continue prioritizing the production of powerful long-term clinical data, and we anticipate delivering additional compelling results in the future. We are very proud of our published high-quality, long-term data, including the GEMINI 2 and IRIS studies. Should new proposed LCDs emerge, we believe these data along with our existing body of clinical evidence will continue to support coverage of the procedure enabled by OMNI for the appropriate patient population. I want to emphasize our belief that the reimbursement profile for OMNI today is sufficient to drive high growth. At the same time, when we look at the clinical profile of the procedure enabled by our technology, we believe there are opportunities to better align OMNI''s coding coverage and payment profiles with the clinical value OMNI actually delivers. We look forward to continued engagement with the MACs, CMS, commercial payers and other stakeholders, as part of our ongoing efforts to maintain and improve appropriate and equitable market access for glaucoma patients and their surgeons to the procedures enabled by our OMNI technology. To close our Surgical Glaucoma discussion, I want to comment on the recent results from the patent trial that concluded last week in Delaware. As we noted in our press release earlier this week, the Jury found that Sight Sciences' three asserted patents were willfully infringed and awarded monetary damages for past infringement. The monetary damages included $5.5 million in lost profits and $28.5 million in royalty damages for sales of the Hydrus Microstent from its commercial launch through trial. As far as next steps, the District Court will entertain post-trial briefings by both parties, including with respect to potential enhancements to the damages and other remedies. And the court's final judgment will be subject to appeal. We have invested considerable capital in research and development to create new and innovative technologies, striving to pioneer novel treatments for chronic eye disease. Our commitment to these investments underscores our mission to expand patient access to transformative and interventional technologies that enhance patient outcomes. Given the substantial investments we have made in our surgical innovations, on behalf of our surgeon customers in glaucoma patients, we have a duty to our stakeholders to safeguard our intellectual property portfolio, and we are pleased with the Jury's verdict. Our attention remains steadfast on equipping eye care providers with efficacious technologies and executing on our long-term growth strategy in Surgical Glaucoma and Dry Eye disease. Now I will turn to our Dry Eye business. We believe the TearCare System represents a transformative technology that will elevate the standard of care for evaporative Dry Eye disease treatment. Our long-term strategy has been to pioneer the field of interventional Dry Eye. The interventional dry eye procedure performed with TearCare is designed to address the root cause of evaporative Dry Eye disease, and the growing body of TearCare clinical results strongly support our belief in its safety and efficacy. Clinical trial data has evidenced that TearCare provided patients with a comprehensive, consistent, fast-acting and durable treatment and the SAHARA RCT showed superiority on our primary objective endpoint, tear breakup time, versus the market-leading prescription eye drop RESTASIS. There are over 11 million diagnosed patients, who we think could benefit from the procedure, which we believe creates an approximate $2.5 billion core addressable U.S. market opportunity. Over the last five years, we have sold over 55,000 TearCare SmartLids, developed meaningful relationships with important Dry Eye key opinion leaders and achieved the successful six and 12-month results of our landmark SAHARA RCT. These developments were critical to build a foundation prior to seeking equitable market access. As part of our original long-term strategy, we are now focused on driving equitable market access for patients that can benefit from the procedures enabled by the TearCare technology. We shifted our resources away from cash pay commercialization efforts toward market access, while reducing our overall commercial spend and infrastructure in the Dry Eye segment, until we have some coverage wins. This year, we have begun discussions with payers with the goal of receiving coverage decisions starting in 2025. Our strategy for these payer discussions is based on articulating the value of TearCare from both clinical and health economic perspectives. We believe the combination of the strong clinical data from our SAHARA RCT and the findings of our budget impact analysis to be discussed in more detail shortly, create a compelling case for payers to cover treatments performed with TearCare at an appropriate reimbursement level. We recently presented at the ASCRS Conference in April, the 12-month results of the SAHARA RCT, demonstrating improved signs and symptoms of dry eye disease for TearCare patients crossed over from RESTASIS. The Phase 2 crossover of the SAHARA RCT showed subjects who were previously treated with RESTASIS for six months and then subsequently taken off of RESTASIS and received a single TearCare treatment, experienced further statistically significant improvements in the signs and symptoms of dry eye disease. The first two phases of the SAHARA RCT month six and month 12 endpoints suggest that the effectiveness of TearCare appeared to be the same, whether or not a study patient had prior treatment with RESTASIS, and that similar results could be expected when TearCare is used as a primary or secondary treatment for dry eye disease. We are extremely pleased that Phase 2 of the RCT, again demonstrates the strong clinical efficacy of the TearCare procedure. In the final phase of the SAHARA RCT, patients from the TearCare cohort will be followed for a total period of 24 months from baseline with repeat TearCare treatments as needed according to protocol-specified treatment with the goal of understanding treatment frequency. We expect results from this final phase of the SAHARA RCT to be published in 2025. In addition, we believe there are benefits associated with the dry eye treatment technology like TearCare that is not reliant on patient adherence. The ability to avoid the risk of patient noncompliance with a drop regimen further supports the case for prioritizing an interventional in-office treatment over a prescription-based approach. In addition to clinical data, our conversations with payers include our budget impact analysis, which will be presented this month at ISPOR, the International Society for Pharmacoeconomics and Outcomes Research, a leading health economics conference. We anticipate that the compelling model showcasing the health economic impact and savings for TearCare versus prescription drops, will be a powerful tool as we work to establish broad coverage for TearCare. Another part of our strategy to achieve positive coverage decisions is for our customers to properly submit claims for TearCare treatments to payers in a manner that appropriately reflects the value of the procedure. We are happy to report that we are seeing early positive traction with our customers' efforts, and we expect this momentum to continue. Again, our goal is to begin receiving positive coverage decisions from payers starting in 2025. And until then, we will continue working diligently to articulate the clinical and economic benefits of TearCare technology. Looking ahead to the rest of 2024, we believe we are in a position to continue to execute on our strategic priorities and capitalize on our upcoming catalysts as we scale our business with the intent to return to double-digit growth in the second half of 2024 and into 2025. In our Surgical Glaucoma segment, we expect OMNI to capture market share in combo cataract procedures and lead the development of the stand-alone MIGS market. We also remain committed to producing long-term clinical evidence for OMNI. In our Dry Eye segment, we will continue to lay the foundation for market access to interventional eyelid procedures with TearCare. We believe we have an incredible opportunity ahead of us, along with the right strategy and the right team to execute and deliver value for our patients and stakeholders. I will now turn the call over to Ali to discuss our financials.\n\nAlison Bauerlein: Thanks, Paul. Before I turn to the first quarter financial results, I want to reiterate that we feel we are well positioned to support our financial and strategic goals for the future and are pleased with both our commercial and operational execution throughout the quarter. We plan on achieving cash flow breakeven without the need to raise additional equity capital and are excited about our long-term growth opportunity. Moving back to the first quarter. Total revenue for the first quarter was $19.3 million. This reflects an increase of 2% compared to the first quarter of 2023, primarily driven by increased utilization of OMNI and SION, and partially offset by the expected decline in Dry Eye revenue. Surgical Glaucoma revenue for the first quarter was $18.3 million, up 5% versus the comparable period in the prior year and 6% compared to the fourth quarter of 2023. 1,073 customers ordered Surgical Glaucoma products in the first quarter, up 1% from the fourth quarter of 2023 and up 5% from the first quarter of 2023. Utilization of ordering accounts was up about 10% from the fourth quarter of 2023 and up about 5% from the first quarter of 2023. We believe this improved utilization is a testament to the unique benefits of OMNI and SION and their importance to surgeons and patients. Our Dry Eye revenue for the first quarter was $1 million, down 32% compared to the first quarter of 2023. This expected decline was primarily due to fewer new accounts and related SmartHub sales, as a result of the reduced sales infrastructure after our restructuring in October of 2023, and the focus on the next phase of our commercial strategy for our Dry Eye segment towards achieving market access. For the first quarter of 2024, we had 288 active Dry Eye customers, a 9% increase versus the first quarter of 2023. We also sold about 4,000 Dry Eye treatment lids in the first quarter, a 7% decrease versus the comparable period in the prior year. Gross margins for the first quarter was 86% compared to 84% in the same period in the prior year. The increase in gross margin was primarily driven by higher Surgical Glaucoma gross margin, which was partially offset by lower Dry Eye gross margin. Surgical Glaucoma gross margin in the first quarter of 2024 increased to 88% compared to 86% in the same period in the prior year, primarily driven by a onetime prior year inventory scrap expense. Dry Eye gross margin in the first quarter of 2024 declined to 42% compared to 54% in the same period in the prior year, primarily due to higher overhead costs per unit in the current period primarily due to lower production volumes. Total operating expenses for the first quarter were $31.2 million, a decrease of 7% compared to $33.3 million in the first quarter of 2023, which reflects reduced selling, general and administrative operating expenses and improved operating expense leverage in the first quarter of 2024, as compared to the same period in the prior year. The decrease was primarily due to lower personnel-related expenses, partially offset by the expected increased legal expenses and stock-based compensation expenses. Adjusted operating expenses were $26.6 million for the first quarter, a decrease of 11% compared to $29.7 million in the same period in the prior year. Our loss from operations for the first quarter was $14.7 million compared to a loss of $17.6 million in the first quarter of 2023. Our net loss was $16.2 million or $0.33 per share in the first quarter compared to a net loss of $17.1 million or $0.35 per share for the first quarter of 2023. We ended the quarter with $127.3 million of cash and cash equivalents and $35 million of debt, excluding debt discounts and amortized debt issuance costs. We had $10.8 million of cash used in the first quarter, reflecting continued operating discipline, which included a payment of $3.2 million associated with our debt refinancing, annual bonus payments and higher legal expenses. This was a substantial improvement from $17.7 million cash used in the first quarter of 2023. Moving to our outlook for the full-year 2024. We are reiterating our revenue guidance of $81 million to $85 million, representing growth of approximately 0% to 5% compared to 2023. We expect second quarter 2024 revenue to be lower than the comparable period in the prior year, following the impact of the LCDs in the second half of 2023. However, we do expect low double-digit sequential revenue growth in the second quarter of 2024 versus the first quarter of 2024, primarily driven by increased OMNI utilization. We expect this will be followed by double-digit growth in the second half of the year versus the comparative period in the prior year as we regained commercial momentum and expand utilization and our customer base. We expect typical seasonality in 2024 where the second and fourth quarters tend to have stronger utilization than the first and third quarters. We still expect Dry Eye revenue to decline significantly in full-year 2024 compared to full-year 2023 due to the evolution of our commercial strategy towards market access activities and the restructuring of our Dry Eye team. We expect Dry Eye revenue to have accelerated growth in 2025, with reimbursement coverage and an expanded commercial presence. In terms of gross margin, we continue to expect overall gross margin to be in the mid-80s. However, we anticipate incurring increased overhead cost per unit due to lower production builds planned in 2024 for both segments, the larger impact in the Dry Eye segment. We are reiterating our full-year 2024 adjusted operating expense guidance of $107 million to $110 million, representing a decrease of approximately 0% to 3% compared to 2023. We believe we will return to double-digit revenue growth in the second half of 2024 and into 2025. We remain focused on further penetrating and expanding the Surgical Glaucoma and Dry Eye markets, as we execute and deliver on our long-term goals and build for our future. Operator, please open the line for questions.\n\nOperator: Thank you. At this time, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of David Saxon with Needham & Company. Your line is now open.\n\nDavid Saxon: Great, thanks for taking my questions. And good afternoon, Paul and Ali. So I just want to start on guidance. I get all the comments, sequential double-digit growth in the second quarter and then the second half should see double-digit year-on-year growth. I mean, pretty easily bumping up against the top end of the guidance. So my question is just given what you're seeing year-to-date? Why not raise the guide? Is there anything you're seeing that you view as a material risk to the guidance?\n\nAlison Bauerlein: Yes, I'm happy to take that question. And our general approach to guidance is to make sure that we set achievable targets based on what we're seeing in the business. We're only one quarter into 2024. And while we've seen great success through this point, we want to see consistent traction with that regaining momentum seeing utilization, continuing to improve as well as new accounts. But at this point in time, we are very happy with what we've seen, particularly in our Surgical Glaucoma segment. So as we get farther into the year, we'll obviously continue to look at what appropriate guidance is, but we are very pleased with the results we saw in Q1 and that we've seen starting into Q2. And we think it's important to put out achievable guidance.\n\nDavid Saxon: Okay, that makes sense. Maybe for my second question, I'll switch gears to Dry Eye. So I'd love to hear what you're seeing in terms of TearCare claims so far? Is the level of reimbursement in line with expectations and at a level you think could get doctors excited about the procedure? And then kind of secondarily to that, I mean we all know the Dry Eye drop market is very promotional and requires a lot of marketing. Your -- the kind of Dry Eye device, I guess, would have reimbursement to help the doctors economics. But to build patient awareness, do you think you need to spend heavily on marketing and promotional activities like we see in the Dry Eye drop category? Thanks so much.\n\nMatthew Link: Hi, this is Matt. I'll take that one, in two parts. First, on the claims. Obviously, we're very excited about the data from SAHARA. And as Paul referenced in his comments, we are preparing for the publication of our economic impact model, but still very, very early days as it relates to claims. It would be premature to really say anything, at this time. What we can say is based on the economic impact model we have, there's reasons to be optimistic around the level of reimbursement, and we believe that level of reimbursement to be both favorable from a provider's perspective and making the economics work within their practice and also favorable from a payer perspective relative to the current standard of care, which we compared the TearCare procedure too. So again, early in these conversations, early in the claims process, but certainly encouraged by what we're seeing and hearing at this stage, and we look forward to provide more feedback on that at a later date. As it relates to the marketing, we fully understand and appreciate that we're in a market-creating opportunity here. This is a pharmaceutical medication space as it relates to the treatment of dry eye. That is a generic disease state that isn't highly differentiated. I believe a lot of the promotional activity is to differentiate from other drops that are available on the market. And we've got this very unique opportunity to create an entire new category for procedural intervention in ocular surface disease, specifically due to meibomian gland disease. And so we absolutely know that there is a marketing opportunity. I think equally, if not more important, there's an education and outreach opportunity to providers. These patients are being seen in clinics across the United States. We know that they are underdiagnosed and undertreated. And so certainly, at the very beginning of this, we believe there is an opportunity for outreach and education to providers to identify the patients that are already in their clinic, when supported with reimbursement, we think that will be a very favorable opportunity for them and for us. And then moving forward, we'll continue to evaluate what the broader promotional opportunities are to expand that patient population in conjunction with market access, in sustainable reimbursement.\n\nDavid Saxon: Great, thanks so much guys.\n\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for our next question please. Our second question comes from the line of James Beers with William Blair. Your line is now open.\n\nJames Beers: Awesome, thanks for taking the questions. Maybe just to start on utilization, obviously, great to see things improving in Q1. Could you maybe speak to the exit rate in terms of utilization? I know you're saying low double-digit growth sequentially into Q2. Are you near historical levels yet? Or is that sort of the gating factor to giving you more confidence into, say, raising the guide? Thank you.\n\nAlison Bauerlein: Yes. So at a high level, when we think about utilization trends, typically, you would see the Q2 period seeing higher utilization versus the first quarter period. So that's a typical trend in the industry and that's something that we also see in our business and expect this year, as we said in our prepared remarks, we expect traditional seasonality this year with higher sales in the second quarter and the fourth quarter versus the first quarter and the third quarter. So that trend happens in our business, and that is consistent with what we're seeing from a utilization perspective. I do think that having another quarter under our belts will certainly give us more confidence about what we expect to see in the back half of the year, both in terms of number of accounts as well as increasing utilization across those accounts. So those are the critical metrics that we look at as a business in order to predict where we see the business going in the future. So of course, we will continue to reevaluate that as we get further into the year. Did you have a follow-up question? Are you...\n\nJames Beers: Sorry, I thought market might have been popping on. In terms of the account adds in the first quarter, I guess maybe a little bit lighter than we expected where most of those accounts -- the accounts may be you lost in the second half of 2023, and I know you're possibly saying -- or maybe saying less account adds factored into the guidance for the back half of the year, but it sounds like maybe you're a little bit more upbeat on that. So maybe could you just speak to the account adds in the first quarter and then how you expect that to transition into the second quarter and then throughout the rest of the year? Thank you.\n\nAlison Bauerlein: Yes. As we said in our last earnings call, we expected to see increased utilization to be the first improvement in the core metrics versus the account addition. So we do expect our active accounts to increase throughout 2024. That's a key focus of us. But in these early stages of rebuilding post the LTV uncertainty period, we were focusing our reps on the highest value activities. And that includes focusing on accounts that we're already ordering and getting those ordering patterns back up. So our long-term strategy is still the same. It's a mix of increasing utilization of existing customers, reengagement with the lost customers and training new customers. So it's kind of a mix. And when we look at going further into 2024, all three of those are contributors to our growth and getting back to double-digit growth. But in the first quarter, we were primarily focused on utilization and that was planned. That was what we intended to do.\n\nJames Beers: Great, thank you.\n\nOperator: Thank you so much. One moment for our next question please. Our next question comes from the line of Joanne Wuensch with Citi. Your line is now open.\n\nUnidentified Analyst: Hi, this is Felipe [ph] on for Joanne. Just quickly for accounts that you're looking to reengage with from the LCD withdrawal period. I was just wondering, how are those conversations going? And I guess, what are your expectations for conversions? And maybe like what is your biggest hurdle for converting those accounts back to using OMNI again?\n\nMatthew Link: Hi, this is Matt. I'll take that one. Look, our engagements overall have been very positive. I think the market overall has seen recovery in MIGS procedures and volumes on the heels of the withdrawal, the LCD. There's no real material limitation in terms of engaging those accounts and those engagements and conversations are ongoing. As Ali said, from the very beginning of the year, we anticipated the recovery coming in the form of increased utilization. Our sales force has done a phenomenal job, as I think was indicated and demonstrated in Q4 in the face of the LCDs to remain a high level of engagement with our core accounts. But there's also a capacity consideration here. As we talked about in -- the second half of last year, we didn't materially reduce headcount. We saw some modest headcount attrition that we did immediately moved to backfill. And in Q1, we spoke about how we would continue to build back into reinvestment within the sales organization. So we really think about that in terms of capacity more so than infrastructure. And so a lot of this is about building capacity. Sight Sciences is a growth company. We have been a growth company. And to some extent, that was interrupted, obviously, in the second half of last year with the uncertainty of the LCDs. And as we see the rate of recovery that's been demonstrated in Q1, as well as we see in early Q2, that certainly gives us some measure of confidence to continue our investment. And that's a key factor as we think about increasing not just utilization within active accounts, but new accounts and then new surgeon engagement through new surgeon training.\n\nUnidentified Analyst: Thank you.\n\nOperator: All right. Thank you. One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from the line of Thomas Stephan with Stifel. Your line is now open.\n\nThomas Stephan: Great, hey guys. Thanks for the questions. Congrats on the nice quarter. I'll start with competition. Maybe can you elaborate a bit on how, I guess mix competition is qualitatively factored into guidance and your long-term outlook as well. There's obviously a lot of innovation happening in glaucoma. So I guess, wondering if you can just talk about how this is contemplated in both the near-term and the long-term view? And then I have a follow-up.\n\nAlison Bauerlein: Yes, sure. I'll take that and let others jump in to add their thoughts as well. Our overall approach to guidance was to be prudent here and put out a capable targets as we were coming out of the LCD uncertainty period. So we think we have set the right bar for the company, given those dynamics as well as the dynamics on the Dry Eye side of the business this year. In terms of what we see from competitive dynamics, we think the MIGS market is a healthy market right now. It is a growing market. There's great innovation happening, and that brings more and more attention to doing stand-alone procedures, expanding the interventional mindset. All of that is great for us when we look at our products and the clinical efficacy profile that we provide, we think that, that will continue to help us and others in this industry continue to grow and shape the future of glaucoma patients. So those are longer-term dynamics in terms of our guidance for 2024. It's really focused on getting back the foundational work, the momentum back with our core accounts and reengaging with accounts. But we see the competitive dynamics to be favorable for OMNI's success in the short term and the medium term and the long-term. So we are happy to see that. Anything you guys want to add? Okay.\n\nThomas Stephan: Great. That's helpful. Thanks, Ali. And then maybe my follow-up would just be on utilization. Really encouraging to see the trends year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter. Ali, you talked about this a bit, but can you expand a little on sort of how those utilization trends look, I guess, across your surgeon base, how widespread or narrow are these recovery trends? Maybe has the sales force been able to move further into driving utilization in sort of those lower volume accounts? Any color there would be helpful.\n\nMatthew Link: Yes, Tom, this is Matt. I'll take that. Look, the good news is the trends in utilization we see are broadly across the organization. And I think the other thing really important to characterize is we talk about utilization. We sell through to a facility as the endpoint customer. But the RESTASIS, as you all are aware, there's in many instances, multiple surgeons within those facilities. And so the increased utilization is coming as best we can tell also is a mix between higher utilization on a per surgeon basis, but also surgeons within the facility. And so for our comments earlier, we really think this is a healthy underlying dynamic within the business and gives us an opportunity to really drive volume and density within key markets and really start to leverage some efficiency across our sales force through the increased volumes. Importantly, we recognized that there's still a large number of opportunities for competitive conversions. I think we have historically talked about having trained about 50% of the available MIGS surgeons on OMNI. Not all of those have fully adopted OMNI to the extent we believe they could. And so you really see a really large opportunity to continue to grow on this space that we're talking about, and this goes back to the comment I made a few minutes ago, we are excited to get back to investment into the sales force and driving incremental resources as the business justifies and warrants to continue this growth trajectory. It's not just going to happen on the sales force we have today, but what we will invest in the future. And so again, we talked a lot about at the end of last year and the beginning of this year in Q1, how prudently we managed our dollars and resources in the face of the uncertainty of the LCDs. I know that I speak for everyone, when we say we're a lot more excited to talk about getting back to investment in the organization to scale and sustain the double-digit growth that we're looking towards the back half of this year and into early next year.\n\nOperator: Thank you so much. One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from the line of Matthew O'Brien with Piper Sandler. Your line is now open.\n\nUnidentified Analyst: Hey, this is Phil on for Matt. Thanks for taking our questions. And congrats on the great quarter. I guess my first one on the trial and patent infringements on those three patents relating to the canicular scaffold. I was curious as far as future infringement goes with regard to Hydrus and their ability to continue to sell that product. And I understand you might not be able to say much there, but is that perhaps low-hanging share that you could capture in MIGS given similarities?\n\nAlison Bauerlein: Yes, we really can't comment on ongoing patent litigation matters about our patent litigation strategy at this point, or what that could potentially mean. Obviously, we were happy to see the results of the Jury verdict associated with tax damages and royalties. But the go-forward remedies and those things are all pending future hearing. So those will have to let play out in the court process over time.\n\nUnidentified Analyst: That's fair. I figured I'd ask. And then shifting gears, maybe you could just touch on the pipeline you have within the Surgical Glaucoma specifically. Any milestones or launches that investors should be made aware of over the next, call it, 12 to 18 months?\n\nPaul Badawi: Yes. Hi, this is Paul. Obviously, very excited about our pipeline. Products we have commercialized today, OMNI, SION and TearCare were all developed internally. We've proven our ability to innovate effectively and then commercialize effectively as well. So on the pipeline front, we can't share too much at this time, but we have shared in the past and we're continuing to work on intracanalicular scaffold, the Helix stent. That's in animals as we speak. We're excited about that. We'll share more in due course. We are in earlier stages of sustained release as well. Hopefully later this year, we'll hit some milestones that we'll be ready to share with everybody. But excited about what we're working on. I think we've proven our ability to innovate in a differentiated manner in a way that can elevate the standard of care and eye care and love what we're doing and looking forward to sharing more later this year.\n\nUnidentified Analyst: Great, thanks so much.\n\nOperator: Thank you. This concludes the question-and-answer session part. I would now like to turn it back to Paul Badawi for closing remarks.\n\nPaul Badawi: Thank you for attending today's call. We appreciate your interest in Sight Sciences, and we look forward to updating you on our progress in the future. Thank you all.\n\nOperator: Thank you for your participation in today's conference.

CEO Keith Maxwell and CFO Mike Barajas presented the company's financial results, which showed a decrease in adjusted EBITDA to $15.1 million from $18.8 million in the prior year.\n\nThe dip was attributed to lower unit margins and mild weather affecting gas volumes.

While the company faced headwinds in unit margins and weather-related volume decreases, strategic customer base growth and a forthcoming acquisition offer a potential boost to future earnings.\n\nThe company's focus on increasing its customer base in POR markets and its proactive hedging strategies have helped to mitigate risks and position it for potential growth. As Via Renewables continues to navigate the renewable energy market, stakeholders will be closely monitoring the impact of its acquisition strategy and market expansion efforts on its financial performance in the coming quarters.\n\nInvestingPro Insights\n\nVia Renewables, Inc. is trading at attractive valuation multiples, with a current P/E Ratio of 8.23 and an adjusted P/E Ratio for the last twelve months as of Q1 2024 at 6.11. This indicates that the company's earnings are priced lower relative to the market, which may interest value investors. Moreover, the PEG Ratio for the same period stands at 0.02, suggesting that the company's earnings growth is potentially undervalued when considering its low price-to-earnings growth ratio.\n\nThe company's stock has experienced a large price uptick over the last six months, as reflected by the 66.87% price total return, signaling a strong market performance in the recent period. This contrasts with the reported decline in adjusted EBITDA and could be indicative of investor confidence in the company's long-term strategy and upcoming acquisition.\n\nInvestingPro Tips highlight that Via Renewables is also trading at a low revenue valuation multiple, with a Revenue of 417.4M USD and a Revenue Growth of -10.27% over the last twelve months as of Q1 2024. Despite the decline in revenue, the company remains profitable with a Gross Profit Margin of 38.41%, which could be a reassuring factor for investors looking at the company's ability to generate earnings.\n\nInvestors interested in further analysis and additional InvestingPro Tips can explore https://www.investing.com/pro/VIA, where they can find 7 more tips to gain a comprehensive understanding of Via Renewables' financial health and stock performance.

This call is also being broadcast via webcast, which can be located in the Investor Relations section of our website at viarenewables.com. With us today from management is our CEO, Keith Maxwell; and our CFO, Mike Barajas. Please note that today's discussion may contain forward-looking statements, which are based on assumptions that we believe to be reasonable as of this date. Actual results may differ materially. We urge everyone to review the safe harbor statement in yesterday's earnings release as well as the risk factors in our SEC filings. We undertake no obligation to update these statements as a result of future events, except as required by law. In addition, we will refer to both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. For information regarding our non-GAAP financial measures and reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP measures, please refer to yesterday's earnings release. With that, I'll turn the call over to Keith Maxwell, our CEO.\n\nKeith Maxwell: Thank you, Stephen. I want to welcome everyone to today's call. I'll begin by providing a summary of results for the first quarter. And then our CFO, Mike Barajas will provide more details on the financials. In the first quarter, we reported adjusted EBITDA of $15.1 million which is a $3.7 million decrease from the prior year of $18.8 million, due to lower unit margins compounded by mild weather, which resulted in lower gas volumes. On a positive note, we grew our customer book to 338,000 RCEs compared to 335,000 RCEs at the start of the year. We also increased the percentage of our customer-based POR markets, which compared to the first quarter of 2023, which lowers our credit risk and bad debt exposure. Looking forward to our second quarter, we're happy to announce that we entered into an agreement to acquire approximately 12,500 RCEs in our existing markets. This acquisition will be accretive to our bottom line beginning in the second quarter of this year. This marks our first customer [indiscernible] acquisition since the end of 2022, and we will continue to be open to any potential future tuck-in acquisitions, and we are committed to growing our customer base in line with long-term growth strategies. That concludes my prepared remarks. And now I'll turn the call over to Mike for his financial review. Mike?\n\nMike Barajas: Thanks, Keith. Good morning. In the first quarter, we achieved $15.1 million in adjusted EBITDA compared to last year's first quarter of $18.8 million. Retail gross margin for the quarter was $35.7 million compared with $40.3 million last year. In our retail electricity segment, gross margin was $18.9 million compared to $20.5 million in the first quarter last year. The decrease due to lower unit margins, partially offset by higher volumes due to a higher RCE count. In our retail natural gas segment, gross margin was $16.2 million compared to $19.9 million in the first quarter last year. This was due to both lower unit margins and volumes year-over-year. G&A expenses were $17.3 million compared to $17.2 million in the first quarter last year, primarily due to increased sales and marketing expenses and legal fees. This was partially offset by a reduction in bad debt. We ended the quarter at 338,000 RCEs compared to 339,000 RCEs to end the first quarter of 2023 and up from 335,000 RCEs on December 31, 2023. Our attrition was 3.9%, which remained flat compared to the first quarter of 2023 due to lower attrition in our mass market book, offset by an uptick in commercial attrition. Our net income for the quarter was $19.1 million or income of $1.81 per fully diluted share compared to a net loss of $6.8 million or a loss of $1.26 per fully diluted share for the first quarter of 2023. The increase is mainly due to an increase in the mark-to-market on our hedges that we put in place to lock in margins on our retail contracts. We had a mark-to-market gain this quarter of $11.2 million compared to a mark-to-market loss of $22.6 million a year ago. We also had reductions in net asset optimization, depreciation and interest expenses of $1.4 million, $1.3 million and $800,000, respectively. The increase in net income was partially offset by a decrease in retail gross margin and increases in income tax and G&A expenses. Income tax expense increased to $4.8 million in the first quarter of 2024 compared to a benefit of $2 million in 2023. On April 15, we paid the quarterly cash dividend on our Series A preferred stock. On April 17, we declared a dividend in the amount of $0.76051 per share on our preferred stock to be paid on July 15. That's all I have. Back to Keith.\n\nKeith Maxwell: Thanks, Mike. I want to thank our employees and the care and the dedication to growing and supporting Via and to our suppliers and their continued support. I want to thank our customers for choosing us as their energy provider. We are excited about the future and look forward to connecting with you soon on our next call.\n\nOperator:", "source": {"uri": "in.investing.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Investing.com India"}, "authors": [{"uri": "earnings_call@in.investing.com", "name": "Earnings Call", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earnings_call", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Earnings call"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earnings_before_interest,_taxes,_depreciation,_and_amortization", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_financial_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Chief financial officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renewable_energy", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Renewable energy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Price\u2013earnings_ratio", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Price\u2013earnings ratio"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valuation_(finance)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Valuation (finance)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revenue", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Revenue"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accounting_standard", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Accounting standard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_investing", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Value investing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stakeholder_(corporate)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stakeholder (corporate)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hedge_(finance)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hedge (finance)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_growth", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Economic growth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Stock_Exchange", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York Stock Exchange"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nasdaq", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nasdaq"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_factor_(finance)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Risk factor (finance)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gross_income", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gross income"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bad_debt", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bad debt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gross_margin", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gross margin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SEC_filing", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "SEC filing"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks_and_Bonds", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks and Bonds", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Marketing_and_Advertising", "label": "dmoz/Business/Marketing and Advertising", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Marketing_and_Advertising/Consulting", "label": "dmoz/Business/Marketing and Advertising/Consulting", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/Marketing_and_Advertising", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/Marketing and Advertising", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://i-invdn-com.investing.com/news/https://i-invdn-com.investing.com/akapi-images/800x450/99396b849048be1e3e66e5a423088daa_w_800_h_450.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9542931", "eventUri": "eng-9542931", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-04-15", "textStart": 7639, "textEnd": 7647}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-04-17", "textStart": 7721, "textEnd": 7729}, {"amb": false, "date": "-07-15", "textStart": 7827, "textEnd": 7834}], "sentiment": 0.06666666666666665, "wgt": 143, "relevance": 1}

I would like to turn the call over to Roger Susi, President and Chief Executive Officer of IRADIMED CORPORATION. Mr. Susi?\n\nRoger Susi: Good morning. Thank you all for joining us on today's call. As recently reported, I'm once again very pleased to announce yet another consecutive quarter of record IRADIMED net revenue generated in our recent Q1 2024 quarter. This is our 11th revenue increase in a row. As this morning's press release announced, in the first quarter of 2024, revenue came in at $17.6 million, representing a 13.7% increase over the first quarter of '23. GAAP diluted earnings per share for the first quarter were $0.32. While non-GAAP diluted earnings were $0.36 per share, a 20% increase over Q1 of '23. All product lines performed well with our inside and outside teams executing exceptionally well. From the revenue standpoint in Q1, the MR patient monitor bested the IV pump and increased by 38%, compared to Q1 of '23. However, this doesn't show the strength of one product line over the other as bookings for the MR IV pump product in Q1, greatly exceeded expectations. So we actually expect that in Q2, the table may turn in favor of pump revenue. As I previously discussed, we notified customers with pumps seven years and older that our extended maintenance would no longer be offered for such older devices. This, as expected, has prompted the uptick in pump orders we've seen in Q1, which we hope to continue to see in the upcoming quarters as well. To be sure, our major products remain viable and fitting for their markets, while we continue to make inroads with our newer FMD product. Previously, I had spoken about reducing our delivery time for disposables and the associated reduction of backlog, though as seen in financial disclosures, the disposable business remains strong and growing, we have managed to reduce the lead time of these products and continue to work to improve these lead times, though orders continue growing, production is not outpaced. Along those lines, we recently began construction on our new 61,000 square foot manufacturing facility here in Orlando, Florida, to consolidate operations, improve efficiencies and prepare for the continued and expanding growth we foresee. We anticipate spending approximately $13 million on its development over the next 12 months. And we will keep you posted in these coming quarters as construction progresses towards a moving date. Now regarding the progress of our 510(k) submission for the new 3870 MRI IV pump. The team is focused and pushing very hard, yet we are still not quite there due primarily to some expanded testing. As previously reported, we have engaged a third-party consultant with two very recent ex-FDA reviewers on their staff, from whom we are getting excellent input. Their feedback has, however, driven us to repeat some of the previous tests, mainly because of devices under test for many months ago, and they have undergone some changes. Our ex-FDA consultants sleeve, the FDA would be much more comfortable with all testing done on the absolute final configuration of the device. Therefore, the aim is to have the test reports referenced, the very latest version of the device, thus removing any questions, is anticipated that these steps should impact the delivery of the 510(k) by approximately 9 to 10 weeks. Still remain on plan with expected clearance in Q1 2025 and plan to show the revenue from the new device in the back half of 2025. Now I'd like to present our expected financial performance guidance for the coming quarter and the balance of the year. For the second quarter of 2024 financial guidance, we expect revenues of $17.6 million to $17.8 million. GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.33 to $0.36 and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.36 to $0.39. We reiterate our guidance for the full year of 2024. We expect to report revenues of $72 million to $74 million, with GAAP diluted earnings per share of $1.37 to $1.47 and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $1.52 to $1.62. Lastly, I'm pleased to report that our Board of Directors has declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.15, payable on May 30, 2024. And we expect to pay the quarterly cash dividend going forward, to reward our loyal shareholders. Now I'd like to turn the call over to Jack Glenn, our CFO, to review the quarter's financial results.\n\nJack Glenn: Thank you, Roger, and good morning, everyone. As in the past, our results have been reported on both a GAAP and non-GAAP basis. You can find a description of our non-GAAP operating measures in this morning's earnings release and a reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to the GAAP measure on the last page of today's release. As we reported earlier this morning, revenue in the first quarter of 2024 was $17.6 million, an increase of 14% compared to the first quarter of 2023. Domestic sales increased 12% to $13.4 million and International sales increased 20% to $4.2 million. Overall, Domestic revenue accounted for 76% of total revenue for Q1 2024 compared to 77% for Q1 2023. Device revenue increased 13% to $11.9 million, driven by a 38% increase in Monitor revenue. Revenue from Disposables and Services increased 17% to a record $5.2 million for the first quarter of 2024, while our maintenance contracts remained stable at $487,000. The gross margin was 76.1% for the first 2024 quarter compared to 75.7% for the 2023 quarter. The increase in gross margin is primarily due to increased revenue, decreased raw material costs and direct labor efficiencies offset by overhead spending. Operating expenses were $8.6 million or 49% of revenue compared to $7.7 million or 50% of revenue for the first quarter of 2023. On a dollar basis, this increase is primarily due to higher sales and marketing expenses for higher sales commissions, sales activity expenses and payroll and benefit expenses. As a result, income from operations grew 18.5% to $4.7 million for the 2024 first quarter. We recognized a tax expense of approximately $1.1 million during the first quarter of 2024, resulting in an effective tax rate of 21.1% for the quarter, which was in line with the effective tax rate of 20.9% in 2023. On a GAAP basis, net income was $0.32 per diluted share compared to $0.27 for the 2023 quarter. On a non-GAAP basis, adjusted net income was $0.36 per diluted share for the 2024 first quarter, compared to $0.30 for the first quarter of 2023. Cash from operations was $3.9 million for the three months ending March 31, 2024, down from $4.6 million for the same period in 2023. For the three months ended March 31, 2024, our free cash flow, a non-GAAP measure, was $3.4 million. This compares to a negative free cash flow figure of $1.9 million in the first quarter of 2023, when we purchased the land for our future facility for $6.2 million. Our cash and cash equivalents totaled $45.1 million as of March 31, 2024. And with that, I will now turn the call over to the operator for questions.\n\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Jason Wittes of ROTH Capital Partners.\n\nJason Wittes: In terms of the Monitor business, yes, it did look quite strong, obviously. Have you sent any communications to the field about your Monitors and about the competition that may have spurred on some growth in this quarter?\n\nRoger Susi: Jason, good to hear from you. I'm not quite sure I understand the question, though. How about -- give it to me again?\n\nJason Wittes: I mean I know that you basically sounded a directive to the field or to your customers that you're no longer going to service the pumps after seven years. Have you done anything similar with Monitors that might have spurred on growth? Or how would you -- the growth was surprising this quarter. So I'm just curious if there were any -- what's behind it or what your thoughts are in terms of what's behind it?\n\nRoger Susi: No, it's -- maybe it was buried a little bit in my comments when I said it doesn't really show so much strength of one product line pump or monitor over the other. It's a matter of timing more than anything else. So -- but no, we absolutely -- the Monitor, actually, we've come out with the competitive nature of the Monitor is that it's quite advanced, and it's state-of-the-art as is. So we wouldn't be absolutely not putting out any sort of a letter obsoleting any facet of it, including support. There's -- we haven't even been selling them for five years. So yes, that's just -- I just have to say, it's just simply the strength of the team going out and selling monitors.\n\nJason Wittes: Sounds good. Yes, it's impressive. It was a strong number, much stronger than I was anticipating. And then in terms of what you said about the submission for the 510(k) for the new pump, I guess that would put it I think originally, it was last communication, it was sort of expected second quarter. And now I guess you're saying 9 to 10 weeks, I guess that would put it into the third quarter in terms of when you would submit that 510(k) ?\n\nRoger Susi: Yes, to put months on it, we'd anticipated getting it out of here by the end of this month. That's what we've been focusing on. But with this curve ball here, it's an abundance of caution to redo some of these tests. And of course, then getting them scheduled has been a delay because we rely on third parties and all of that. So, yes, we think it's going to add about 9, 10 weeks to that. So that puts us somewhere very end of July or early August. We think of it more monthly rather than something that's tied to a quarter.\n\nJason Wittes: I appreciate that precision. It's good to hear that. And then maybe a final question. I mean the communicate you put out, definitely seems to be spurring on growth in pumps. If you look at -- I don't know if you can give any color in terms of if you look at who's been upgrading or who's been replacing. Has it been many of those -- I mean I don't know if you can give us any parameters that can kind of show how many of those pumps that are getting replaced now are the ones that got to communicated that they're no longer to be service after seven years?\n\nRoger Susi: We were anticipating that very question just before the call. So we didn't -- we don't have some definitive metric to give you, but we will shortly. We'll pass that along. But generally, it's a substantial part of the bookings that I mentioned, this big -- a rather large booking uptick in in Q1. And it's pretty substantially from that. But like I say, we'll get some -- we'll have some numbers to share with you very shortly.\n\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Frank Takkinen of Lake Street Capital.\n\nFrank Takkinen: Roger, Jack, congrats on a good start to the year. I was hoping to ask one on the guidance. Obviously, you had a nice outperformance versus your Q1 expectations, and then you kind of hinted at the expectation for pumps to be strong next quarter from some of the Q1 ordering. I was curious kind of the thought process you went through when thinking about slightly increasing the guidance versus reiterating it? Was it just a function of conservatism? Or was there anything else baked into that thought process?\n\nJack Glenn: Well, I think, Chris, that yes, I think if you -- from our past experience here, I think we've tried to be somewhat conservative in the guidance we give. And I think that still is -- the second half of the year is certainly some much bigger numbers in order to hit that. So -- but we feel confident. And certainly, as we progressed throughout the year, we'll certainly maybe provide updates that. But for right now, we think that's the best position for us to reiterate our guidance for the year as is.\n\nFrank Takkinen: Perfect. Perfect. So then on the -- maybe just a follow-up on backlog, generally speaking. Obviously, a little plus/minus here. So I think if I heard correctly, you burned down some of the disposable backlog, but perhaps the pump commentary resulted in pump backlog increasing. Can you just net out total backlog, how much visibility you have and how that gives you confidence going through the rest of the year?\n\nJack Glenn: Well, of course, we don't give the exact numbers, as you know. But again, it's probably very much in line with where the backlog was as we came into the end of the year. So remains strong, gives us good visibility, for at least a quarter out for sure, but very strong and stable backlog. And especially, again, a lot of that, too, due to the pump backlog going into this Q2.\n\nRoger Susi: Yes. Maybe to add a little more color, Frank, to topic, though we are trying to shave that lead time and associated backlog with the with the disposable side, which we're making progress, as I said. Yes, due to the orders on the hardware side, what Jack saying is that the backlog remains pretty consistent as it's been in the last half a dozen quarters.\n\nFrank Takkinen: Got it. That's helpful. And then maybe just one more for me on the Monitor side. I think, Roger, we've talked about in the past, the day-to-day business or quarter-to-quarter business, you talk about the active systems being replaced on the Monitor side and your share of that market and then the broader 10,000 or so pieces of equipment install. Maybe just give us an update how you feel you're penetrated into those? How you feel about the low-hanging fruit opportunity still existing within those? And just anything else you could talk about in those monitoring markets.\n\nRoger Susi: Yes. Well, good question. So we still don't have the lion's share of the market. We're still the underdog. So that means there's still quite a bit to go. We estimate we're just nudging close to 30-ish percent of this business, right? So there's still plenty more for us to go. Having said that, of course, with every incremental percentage gains still against a well-entrenched competitor. The low-hanging fruit is a little higher on the tree. It's life. That's the way it works. So the team is jumping getting, getting their ladders and trying to reach up to a little bit more than they had to do the quarter before and the quarter before that, certainly. But we still are scratching away at that existing open share of what's the Monitor business, which is, by and large, one-to-one with magnets. And that's still where we're operating at. We have had a little luck. We're starting to -- the real upside, as we've mentioned and presented in the past is to have this multiplier effect for the transport strategy, like we developed with the pumps happen with the monitor. And we need to put maybe one or two more little features onto the pump to really make that very smooth, but we're already starting to get some nibbles there. And a few of these monitors each quarter that we bring in are related to let's say, more than one per magnet, an extra one. And there's leaning storage starting to adopt this transport theory. That's yet to be rolled out over the coming quarters, as I said, we still got our hands full just nipping away at the existing placements of monitors. So we'll eat pretty well for still a number of quarters doing what we've been doing. And then we hope to roll out this transport strategy and really get the multiplier effect on top of these monitors, so where they're not just one monitor per each MRI.\n\nOperator: This concludes the question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn it back to Roger Susi for closing remarks.\n\nRoger Susi: Well, thank you, operator. Good. Again, we are pleased with our Q1 2024 results, as stated. And we also say, as guided that we expect continued strong performance as the new year progresses. So we look forward to reporting our future successes to you, and thank you all.\n\nOperator: Thank you. This concludes the call.

I'd now like to turn the call over to Jeff Woosnam. Jeff?\n\nJeff Woosnam: Thanks, Chris, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us to discuss our second quarter and fiscal year-to-date results. Temperatures in the second quarter were 15.2% warmer than normal throughout Star's footprint. While slightly colder than the same period last year, it was unfortunately not enough to drive higher delivery volumes. However, we were able to move the impact on adjusted EBITDA, even with a lower weather hedge benefit and some ongoing inflationary pressures, by improving per gallon margins and employing solid expense control. We also kept net customer attrition at modest levels during the quarter and, as previously noted, closed on two strategic acquisitions in February on Long Island, giving us a total of four transactions thus far in the current fiscal year. Our team has remained very busy evaluating various heating oil and propane opportunities that align with our goal of strengthening and broadening our portfolio of brands. Through the first six months of fiscal 2024, temperatures were 0.2% warmer than the same period last year and 14.7% warmer than normal. While there is nothing we can do to control the weather, we believe our team is quite adept at adjusting to it and making the most of the conditions. An area of note is the year-over-year improvement we've made in service and equipment installation profitability, which has been an area of focus for us. I'm quite pleased with our progress, which I believe is evidence of the quality of service that we provide, and certainly a direct result of the hard work and dedication of our employees. With the heating season now behind us, we believe we are well positioned for the remainder of fiscal 2024, as well as the opportunities that summer brings to further invest in our people and business development activities. With that, I'll turn the call over to Rich to provide additional comments on the quarter's results. Rich?\n\nRich Ambury: Thanks, Jeff, and good morning, everyone. For the second quarter, our home heating oil and propane volume decreased by 4 million gallons, or roughly 3%, to 117 million gallons, as the additional volume provided from acquisitions and colder weather was more than offset by net customer attrition and other factors. Temperatures for the fiscal 2024 second quarter were 7% colder than last year, but still 15% warmer than normal. Our product gross profit increased by $3 million, or 1.5%, to $206 million, as an increase in per gallon margins was reduced by the 3% decline in home heating oil and propane volume sold. Delivery and branch expenses increased by $8 million year-over-year, of which $6.4 million was attributable to our weather hedging program. In the second quarter of fiscal 2024, we recorded a benefit of $6.5 million under our weather hedge, compared to a benefit of $12.5 million recorded in the comparable period last year. Recent acquisitions accounted for an increase of $1.8 million in operating expenses. We posted a net income of $68 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2024, or $6 million more than the prior year period, reflecting the after-tax impact of a noncash, favorable change in the fair value of derivative instruments of $15 million, and a $6 million decrease in adjusted EBITDA. Adjusted EBITDA declined by $6 million to $96 million, as an increase in home heating oil and propane per gallon margins was more than offset by the 4 million gallon decrease in home heating oil and propane volume sold, and a $6.4 million decline in our weather hedge benefit. Turning to the results for the first half of fiscal 2024, our home heating oil and propane volume declined by 13 million gallons, or 6%, to 197 million gallons, again as the additional volume provided from acquisitions was reduced by slightly warmer temperatures, net customer attrition, and other factors. Temperatures for the first half of fiscal 2024 were just 0.2% warmer than last year and 15% warmer than normal. Our product gross profit decreased by $3 million, or 1%, to $351 million, as the impact of higher home heating oil and propane per gallon margins was largely offset by lower motor fuel gross profit and a 6% decline in home heating oil and propane volume. Delivery, branch, and G&A expenses rose by $4.8 million year-over-year, of which $5 million was attributable to our weather hedging program. In fiscal 2024, we recorded a benefit of $7.5 million under our weather hedge, compared to a $12.5 million benefit recorded in the first half of fiscal 2023. We had net income of $81 million for the first six months of fiscal 2024, or $6 million higher than the prior year period, largely due to the after-tax impact of a noncash favorable change in the fair value of derivative instruments of $13 million, partially offset by a decrease in adjusted EBITDA of $6 million. Adjusted EBITDA declined by $6 million to $145 million as an increase in home heating oil and propane per gallon margins was more than offset by a 13 million gallon decrease in home heating oil and propane volume sold and a $5 million decline in the weather hedge benefit year-over-year. The decrease in adjusted EBITDA of $6 million was muted by a $2 million favorable change in net interest expense. As a result, our after-tax cash flow declined by approximately $2.7 million. And we'd like everyone to note that for fiscal 2025, we have put in $15 million of weather hedges. If we had the same amount of coverage in place during 2024 and the same temperatures, we would have been paid an additional $7.5 million more in fiscal 2024 for a total of $15 million under the weather hedges. And with that, I'll turn the call back to Jeff.\n\nJeff Woosnam: Thanks, Rich. At this time, we're pleased to address any questions you may have. Anthony, please open the phone lines for questions.\n\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from Tim Mullen (NASDAQ:MULN) with Laurelton Management.\n\nTim Mullen: First, just given the larger size of the acquisitions that you've completed more recently, I was just wondering if you could provide any color on those businesses in terms of their strategic objective. I mean, obviously, from a geographical standpoint, they seem like natural fits for you all, but just wanted to see if you could provide any color, types of customers, product fit, any financial information regarding the acquisitions.\n\nJeff Woosnam: Sure. So, we closed on two acquisitions in November. Both of those were heating oil acquisitions, smaller opportunities that are tuck-ins to our existing New Jersey operations, and then we closed on two businesses in February -- in early February, one was a propane business and the other one a heating oil business, as I mentioned, both located in Long Island.\n\nTim Mullen: I know typically you don't like to give any financial information, but is there any color you can provide on multiples or kind of anything along those lines?\n\nRich Ambury: No, not at this time.\n\nTim Mullen: Okay. And then, just when you think about the business more kind of on a medium and longer-term basis, how do you think about the possibility of homes transitioning away from using home heating oil as their energy source, and does that impact M&A strategy or how you think about organic growth?\n\nJeff Woosnam: Yes. I guess what I'd say is, I don't want to necessarily comment on specific state or federal legislation and how that might impact our business long-term. We as a business and as an industry feel like we've made a very strong commitment to bioheat, which is a blend of renewable biodiesel and ultra-low-sulfur heating oil, and have increased our sales of that product and have committed to continue to do that. We all have, I guess, our views on the whole energy transition and how quickly it's going to occur, but we feel like we're properly positioned to deal with those changes.\n\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question will come from Michael Prouting with 10K Capital.\n\nMichael Prouting: Yes. I had a question related actually to the prior questions on acquisitions. It seems like the pace of acquisitions has picked up recently. Jeff, I'm just wondering if that's a reflection of sellers being or rather [harnessing] more willing to sell. And then, I guess, related to that, even though you might not want to comment on the valuations of the acquisitions you've closed, I'm just wondering what you're seeing in the market as far as multiples are concerned, and I guess also related to the prior question, if multiples are reflecting both the warmer weather environment as well as transition risks.\n\nJeff Woosnam: Sure, Michael. Yes. So, our team has been very busy. As I mentioned, we've closed on four transactions already this year that we feel are high quality. What I'd say is, it kind of goes ebbs and flows, the activity level and the businesses that are on the market. What I would note is that what we've been evaluating more recently over the last six months have been what we would consider some very high-quality businesses that seem to be a very good fit for us. And it's hard to predict what is actually going to come to fruition from that. We have to go through our process. We're going to remain very disciplined in that regard. And we'll just have to see how that plays out. I have not seen multiples depressed in any way as a result of weather.

As we finished the first quarter of the 2024 fiscal year Patrick remains in a position of strength, as a result of the work our team has put in day in and day out and the strong performance and results that we have generated, while diligently managing our business and balance sheet. Our success would not be possible without the dedication of our incredible team members, and I thank them for their tremendous efforts and focus. Our family of trusted, independent brands building better component solutions is guiding our model as we strive to be the supplier of choice in the outdoor enthusiast and housing markets. Our accretive growth strategy has evolved over the years through our team's relentless pursuit of great customer service and building innovative high-quality product solutions. We have become a key supplier to RV, marine, manufactured housing, and now Powersports OEMs alike, and we believe our ability to scale and adapt to our customers' needs is unmatched. As we have further refined our business objectives, we identified and executed on the appeal of a more diversified end market ecosystem, which is proving resilient, especially in these uncertain market conditions. Our first quarter acquisition of Sportech further solidifies the foundation in the Powersports industry and serves as another platform for future strategic and organic growth. We are excited by the promising potential in this space, particularly in the utility side-by-side segment on which Sportech focuses. The Sportech acquisition brings in a team aligned with our purpose as passionate outdoor enthusiasts dedicated to creating highly engineered, innovative products in close partnership with our valued OEM customers. We are thrilled with the initiatives that Patrick and Sportech teams have already set in motion and the future growth potential we see ahead of us. Examples of our drive to immediately deliver synergies post-closing involves our team at Rockford Fosgate hosting Sportech to showcase the benefits of being connected to the Patrick ecosystem. And how our businesses are able to collaboratively leverage their processes and expertise, bringing additional value to their respective customers. We also invited our key plastics, metals, and harness and dash businesses to Sportech for a brainstorming session, including a production line walk-through to identify avenues of opportunity between business units, their best practices, and potential areas for collaboration, including logistics, sourcing and material synergies. While collaboration remains a crucial tenet of our success through our business model, we strive to maintain each business' individuality and passion as they drive forward, keeping the entrepreneurial spirit alive. We believe this strategy is key to our future success and empowers our businesses and the collective Patrick family to achieve new heights. We continue to seek out entrepreneurial businesses with strong, culturally-aligned leadership teams, solid organic growth prospects and accretive margins. Our ability to execute at the operational level at our brands exemplifies our balance sheet and working capital management, for which we also drive accountability. Our team has done a great job of working with our customer partners to manage our inventories and ensure we also remain focused on delivering strong cash flows, while maintaining a disciplined leverage position. Our inventories are balanced and well maintained, and our leverage position has already improved from just two months ago, following the Sportech acquisition, the largest acquisition in the company's history. Now moving on to our financial results. Our first quarter revenues increased 4% to $933 million. And on a trailing 12-month basis, our consolidated revenues were approximately $3.5 billion. Our net income in the first quarter improved 16% to $35 million, and net income per diluted share was $1.59. Excluding acquisition transaction costs, purchase accounting adjustments, our first quarter adjusted net income was $39 million and adjusted diluted earnings per share grew 31% to $1.79. Our team continues to anticipate and adjust to market and macroeconomic forces through the management of our highly variable cost structure, and our model performed well during a seasonally slow period also as a result of acquisitions completed over the past year, operational efficiencies gained through automation and better throughput and our diversification among other items, as shown by our continued solid margin performance. Excluding acquisition transaction costs, purchase accounting adjustments in both periods, operating margin improved 70 basis points to 7.0% and adjusted EBITDA margin increased to 110 basis points to 11.9% in the quarter. On an administrative level, I'd like to welcome Andy Roeder, our new CFO, who joined us in March. Andy has tremendous experience in the outdoor enthusiast space and brings his impressive skills and expertise into the Patrick family. We're pleased to have Andy on our team supporting our businesses growth objectives, while ensuring our balance sheet and financial foundation remains strong. I'd also like to thank Matt Filer, who filled the interim CFO role with confidence in execution and helped us successfully deliver on our operational and strategic plans. Matt has resumed his role as Senior Vice President of Finance, and we look forward to his continued contributions. I'll now turn the call over to Jeff, who will highlight the quarter and provide more detail on our end markets.\n\nJeffrey Rodino: Thanks, Andy. Good morning, everyone. We continue to experience dynamic conditions across all of our primary end markets. RV and MH trends have improved modestly after reaching what we believe was the bottom of the cycle in 2023. While shipments have improved in the market, interest rates continue to negatively impact demand of our end consumers and dealers across our markets as ownership and online costs remain relatively high. As a reminder, in the outdoor enthusiast space, RV has historically been first market to enter and exit economic cycles and the RV market typically precedes the recovery in marine and Powersports. In the first quarter, RV wholesale shipments have seen some sequential and year-over-year improvement. We except these positive trends to continue in the near-term, give the need for additional inventory and preparation for spring selling season and the coming 2025 model year change. However, the durability of positive trends will depend on retail sell-through. Our first quarter RV revenues increased 15% to $421 million when compared to the same period in 2023 and represented 45% of consolidated revenue. RV content per unit on a TTM basis was $4,859, off by about 9% from the record level we achieved for the first quarter of 2023. On a positive note, RV content per unit on a TTM basis increased sequentially in Q1 of 2024 from Q4 of 2023. According to the RVIA, RV wholesale unit shipments increased 9% to approximately 85,900 units from the first quarter of 2023. We currently estimate first quarter retail registrations were down approximately 14% to an estimated 73,100 units in the quarter. Our estimates further indicate that TTM dealer inventory weeks on hand at the end of Q1 of 2024 have increased by two to three weeks to approximately 20 to 22 weeks as dealers plan for the upcoming selling season. This is well below the historical averages of approximately 26 to 30 weeks. On the marine side of our business, OEMs have remained very disciplined in their production, which will help lessen the response time between inventory sell-through and replenishment in the eventual recovery. We expect to see our marine business bottom out in Q2 and then begin to stabilize in Q3 and into Q4, especially as consumers and dealers await the new model year product. We believe in the long-term durability of the marine industry as outdoor enthusiasts continue to see the appeal of boating and spending time on the water with family and friends. Our first quarter marine revenues were up 35% to $155 million, representing 17% of consolidated sales. This change in sales is in line with our expectations in the quarter, especially when considering our mix towards ski and wake and pontoon. We estimate wholesale powerboat unit shipments declined 34% to approximately 38,400 units from Q1 of 2023 with estimated ski and wake and pontoon unit shipments down approximately 52% and 41%, respectively. We currently estimate first quarter retail powerboat shipments were down approximately 10% to an estimated 31,200 units. Our estimated marine content for wholesale unit on a TTM basis was $4,049 compared to 4,433 in the same period last year. On a sequential basis, our first quarter content was roughly flat compared to the fourth quarter of 2023. It is important to note that in the prior periods, we reported both marine and Powersports revenue in our marine market, impacting both our marine revenue and content per unit. The current and prior-year figures have been recalculated for revenue and content per unit to reflect these adjustments. Our estimates indicate that the TTM dealer inventory weeks on hand at the end of Q1 of 2024 have increased approximately two to three weeks to an estimated 30 to 32 weeks. This is well below the historical average, which we estimate at 36 to 40 weeks on hand. Our housing businesses, both MH and residential site built demonstrated the resilience of our diversified platform and remained steady and performed well despite the headwinds in interest rates as consumers demand for affordable housing remains strong. Multifamily housing continues to experience softness, while single-family housing starts have improved. In Q1, our housing revenue was up 5% to $275 million, representing 29% of consolidated sales, and manufacturing which represents approximately 57% of our housing revenue in the quarter, we increased the content per unit on a TTM basis by 1% to $6,422. We estimate MH wholesale unit shipments increased 13% in the quarter, total residential housing starts for Q1 improved 1%. As we begin reporting on Powersports business, our focus will primarily be on the side-by-side golf cart and motorcycle sectors of the industry, and our market commentary will reflect this focus. Powersports is a broad space. And unlike our other end markets, there is no third-party source for industry-wide data on wholesale shipments. Although, our focus has shifted to side-by-side space, which includes golf carts, following the Sportech acquisition, we have had a presence in side-by-side and motorcycles, primarily through Rockford Fosgate's premium audio offerings. Of course, as we expand our presence in this space, the metrics we track will evolve along with our commentary to more accurately reflect our business within the industry. Ultimately, our intention is to provide business-relevant insight into the markets we serve is then providing an outlook on the broader Powersports industry as a whole. Anecdotally, Powersports dealer inventory levels appear elevated, particularly in the recreation segment. However, on the utility side of the industry, demand appears to be more resilient. This, coupled with Sportech's promising backlog supports our optimism as we move into this year and beyond. The demand for creature comforts like HVAC requires the doors and closure enclosures for tech manufacturers. With the potential to add audio and other high-value product solutions we produce down the road, both to the OEMs and in the aftermarket. Our Powersport revenues were $83 million in the quarter, which represents 9% of our first quarter 2024 consolidated sales, including approximately two months of Sportech revenue, which outperformed expectations. On the innovation front, our dedicated advanced product group, which we highlighted in the fourth quarter is off and running and remains intensely focused on collaborating with OEM customers, evaluating best-in-class solutions two and three model years out, in the RV, marine and Powersports market. We believe we are well timed with this strategic initiative as OEMs generally focus inward on product design and evolution during periods of softer retail demand. Two examples of our leading innovations as a testament to our progress Patrick's brands won two innovation awards this year at the Discover Boating Miami International Boat Show in February. TACO Marine won an innovation award for their open water internal and collapsible carbon fiber outrigger poles. Their sleek design and increased functionality results in more natural movement of bait in the water. We continue to believe both RV and boating experience can be enhanced through the use of carbon fiber products, which we have launched along with the potential of our outdoor enthusiast market. SeaDek also won an award for their patented lighted SeaDek, which can embed RGB lighting into their products providing additional opportunity for customization in marine flooring and padding. The sliding takes the superior traction of EVA foam decking, coaming pads and step pads, SeaDek is known for to a whole new level of comfort and visual appeal. I'll now turn the call over to Andy Roeder, who will provide additional comments on our financial performance.\n\nAndrew Roeder: Thanks, Jeff, and good morning, everybody. First, I'd like to thank Andy, Jeff, Matt and the rest of the team here for such a warm welcome. I'm thrilled to become part of the Patrick family at such an exciting time, and I'm ready to work with the stellar team here, maintaining our solid financial foundation and supporting Patrick's continued drive toward profitable organic and strategic growth. Now on to our financial results. Our consolidated first quarter net sales increased 4% and to $933 million, driven by 9% growth in RV wholesale shipments, an estimated 13% increase in manufactured housing wholesale shipments and our acquisition of Sportech, which together more than offset the impact of an estimated 34% decrease in marine wholesale powerboat unit shipments. Gross margin increased 30 basis points to 21.9%, which was the result of our strategic diversification, acquisitions, larger mix of higher engineered products and cost reduction initiatives, coupled with our investments in automation and continuous improvement initiatives. The first quarter gross margin includes 10 basis points of non-cash purchase accounting charges from the inventory step-up related to the Sportech acquisition. SG&A expenses increased $3 million or 3% to $85 million in the first quarter of 2024, but decreased 10 basis points as a percent of sales. The year-over-year increase in expense reflects transaction costs related to the Sportech acquisition. Excluding the nonrecurring acquisition transaction costs associated with the Sportech acquisition, SG&A expenses as a percent of sales decreased 60 basis points versus the quarter of 2023. Operating expenses were $146 million in the quarter compared to $138 million last year, primarily due to higher amortization costs and the impact of acquisition-related expenses on SG&A. Operating income grew $3 million to $59 million, while operating margin improved 20 basis points to 6.4%. Excluding acquisition transaction costs and purchase accounting adjustments related to acquisitions, adjusted operating margin improved 70 basis points to 7% in the first quarter. The improvement in operating margin was driven by higher revenue from our RV and housing businesses, coupled with the acquisition of Sportech among other factors previously discussed. These positive factors, while partially offset by the impact of lower marine revenue and higher amortization expense again reflected benefits of our strategic diversification. Net income increased 16% to $35 million, which equates to $1.59 per diluted share. Adjusting for the acquisition transaction costs and purchase accounting adjustments in both periods, adjusted net income improved 29% to $39 million or $1.79 per share. Our reported and adjusted EPS for the first quarter of 2024 include approximately $0.01 per share in additional accounting related dilution from our 2028 convertible notes. We have hedges in place which are expected to reduce or eliminate any potential dilution of the company's common stock upon any conversion of the convertible notes and/or offset any cash payments, that company is required to make in excess of the principal amount of any converted notes. For reporting purposes, these hedges are always anti-dilutive and therefore, cannot be included when reporting earnings per share. Adjusted EBITDA grew 14% to $111 million versus $98 million last year. Adjusted EBITDA margin expanded 110 basis points to 11.9% for the first quarter of 2024. Our overall effective tax rate was 10.6% for the first quarter compared to 20.1% in the prior year. The decrease in the tax rate in the first quarter was due to the tax benefit related to the vesting of share-based awards and the increase in Patrick's stock price. We expect our effective tax rate to be approximately 22% to 23% for the full-year, implying 25% to 26% for the next three quarters. Looking at cash flows. Cash provided by operations for the first three months of 2024 was approximately $35 million compared to an outflow of approximately $1 million in the prior year period, primarily due to working capital management and stronger net income. This quarter, purchases of property, plant and equipment were $15 million, reflecting maintenance CapEx, automation projects and select facility improvements. We remain committed to allocating capital to our automation initiatives as we reinforce innovation, efficiencies and long-term value for our customers and stakeholders. We estimate our 2024 capital expenditures will total $70 million to $80 million. Our goal is a disciplined capital allocation strategy, and we continue to evaluate possible organic growth initiatives, while maintaining a robust acquisition pipeline. We plan to continue to assess these growth initiatives, while maintaining a strong balance sheet with ample liquidity. Our net leverage at the end of the quarter was 2.8x, down from 2.9x on a pro forma basis at the closing of Sportech in January. During the quarter, we generated $20 million of free cash flow. For the trailing 12-month period, we generated $391 million of free cash flow compared to $352 million for the same period last year. At the end of the first quarter, our total net liquidity was $413 million, comprised of $18 million of cash on hand and unused capacity on our revolving credit facility of $395 million. With no major debt maturities until 2027, we continue to have the balance sheet strength, flexibility and liquidity to remain on offense and assess the potential to seize profitable strategic growth opportunities as they arise. We returned $13 million in the form of dividends during the quarter. We will remain opportunistic on share repurchases and have $78 million left authorized under our current plan at the end of the first quarter. Moving on to our end market outlook. We continue to expect the current interest rate environment to negatively impact consumer demand and dealers' willingness to hold inventory during the year. Based on recent trends, we estimate full-year RV wholesale unit shipments will approximate 320,000 to 340,000 units as dealers remain cautious about the carrying cost of inventory in this rate environment. We currently expect full-year RV retail shipments to be down approximately 5% to 10%, implying approximately 350,000 units at the midpoint. In our marine market, we estimate 2024 total industry retail will be down 5% to 10% and wholesale units for our overall product mix will be down 10% to 15%. In our Powersports end market on a pro forma basis, including Sportech, our full-year 2023 revenue was $385 million, and we estimate Powersports unit shipments in our product categories will be flat in 2024. For modeling purposes, we expect to gain organic content in the mid-single digits. On the housing side of our business, we estimate MH wholesale unit shipments will be up 5% to 10% for 2024, with retail sales absorbing available wholesale production on a real-time basis. In our residential housing end market, we estimate 2024 new housing starts will be flat to up 5% versus 2023. Given the current end market outlook we've outlined, we estimate our 2024 operating margin will improve by 30 to 50 basis points on an adjusted basis versus 2023. We estimate our full-year 2024 operating cash flows will be between $390 million and $410 million, implying free cash flow of $310 million or more based on our CapEx estimates. That completes my remarks. We are now ready for questions.\n\nOperator: Thank you. We will now be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. Our first questions come from the line of Mike Swartz with Truist Securities. Please proceed with your question.\n\nMichael Swartz: Hey guys. Good morning. Just maybe starting out on the outlook. I think one of the biggest changes versus maybe what you talked about a couple of months ago was just on the marine side. So maybe, I guess, just frame up from a wholesale shipment perspective, and maybe how you're thinking about the year now versus prior? Is it deeper cuts in first half, second half is kind of unchanged? Or just maybe any guidelines around how you're thinking about that?\n\nAndy Nemeth: Sure, Mike. This is Andy, Andy Nemeth. As we've looked at marine and really looking across the industry sector in total, and we look at our mix of business kind of geared towards higher end and higher engineered product lines with some really strong presentation and concentration in the ski and wake sector as well as the pontoon sector. We just -- we looked at that model, and we're seeing dealers and OEMs alike remain very, very disciplined. And so we felt that it was prudent to kind of pull back just a little bit, especially given what we've seen so far. I think we noted a greater than 50% decline in ski and wake and greater than 40% decline in pontoon in the first quarter. And we just see that discipline continuing through the second quarter, especially when we look at kind of when the new model year is going to come through with some stabilization expected in the back half. So we just pulled things back just a little bit, especially as it relates to our industry-specific concentration.\n\nMichael Swartz: And the thought would be that the rate of decline you saw in some of those key categories in the first quarter, that kind of continues into the second quarter. Is the thought on a year-over-year basis? Or does it get better on a year-over-year basis? Because I think most of the destocking was -- or restocking was done first quarter last year?\n\nAndy Nemeth: Yes. We still think that kind of Q1 run rates are going to continue through Q2 at this point in time. So that's really kind of driving that model.\n\nMichael Swartz: Okay. That's helpful. And then on the -- just on the operating margin outlook for the year, you've reiterated that. Any thoughts on just how that should kind of trend or play out through the year. I think seasonally, the second quarter has the highest margin, and it kind of drops off over that time period over the rest of the year. But given the comments on marine, which is one of your higher margin businesses, would that be expected to look any different this year than maybe years prior?\n\nAndy Nemeth: So we still think we're going to see a sequential margin improvement, and I'm talking quarter over the prior year quarter in each of our quarters for 2024. And our business is well diversified as we've looked at it. Our marine business has a strong margin component, is highly engineered, highly innovative. And so just with some of the -- as we talked about the mix, pulling back that segment a little bit with some of the strength that we've seen offset with our housing business in particular, we just felt like, again, we want to keep it at that 30 to 50 bps of improvement. I think if we see some uptick in the back half as it relates to the kind of that marine business, we would expect to see some margin lift on that. But overall, we feel again pretty consistent that we will see some improvement each quarter over the prior year's quarter in our financials.\n\nMichael Swartz: Okay. That's super helpful. And then just one last one for me quickly. Just the revenue growth, the components of that in the quarter on a year-over-year basis, how much was that, I guess, organic volume, pricing, M&A, all that good stuff?\n\nAndrew Roeder: Sure, Mike. This is Andy Roeder. Good morning. Yes, for Q1, overall industry was down 3%. Acquisition growth was up 5% and organic was up 2%. And that organic is broken down by pricing was down 3% and shared content was up 4%.\n\nOperator: Thank you. Our next questions come from the line of Scott Stember with ROTH MKM. Please proceed with your question.\n\nScott Stember: I imagine that right now, you guys are having discussions on the RV side with the OEMs on where their pricing is going to be looking. Just got off a call this morning with one of the bigger dealers. It sounds like they're not expecting to see a material change in pricing from '24 to '25. What are you guys hearing on your end? And how should we look at that from a content standpoint throughout the balance of the year?\n\nJeffrey Rodino: Yes, Scott, this is Jeff. As we go into the model year, every year, were we go through and price our product appropriately going into the model year. And we've seen a lot of our commodities flatten out. As we've talked in the past, we do pass along pricing on a real-time basis with commodities and where our inventories stand. And we've seen kind of a lot of those flatten out over the fourth quarter and into the first quarter of this year. So there's some up, there's some down. It's kind of, I would say, almost flat. In particular to what you're saying about the dealer earlier thinking they're going to be flat. We're seeing the same from our commodities and the pricing that we're putting out there.\n\nScott Stember: Got it. And then looking into the Powersports side of it, if we could just take a little bit of a deeper dive. I know you've talked about how you guys are pretty much aligned heavily with the side-by-side utility piece. But can you maybe just overall, just trying to get a sense of how much of the Powersports business would be considered mission-critical types of things versus more importantly, maybe just utility, utility or mission-critical. Just trying to get a sense of how this -- we should expect this business to perform in the event that the industry really tapers off a lot this year?\n\nAndy Nemeth: Scott, as we look at Powersports, in particular, in our spread across the Powersports market, which we talked about is going to include the side-by-side utility primarily, golf carts and motorcycles. When you're thinking about utility, we again expect to see -- we're seeing our content rise in that sector on the units that we're going into a market right now that when you look at the recreational side is a little bit down. But as we look at the model overall and the opportunities to continue to drive organic content amongst our product categories and bring solutions to those customers, we expect to continue to be very aggressive on taking market share there and gaining content. So overall, while the market is in a little bit of a volatile place today, if you just look at kind of the recreational versus utility, we're well aligned with utility.\n\nScott Stember: Got it. And then just last question. There was a comment about expectations for operating margin growth this year. Did I hear 50 basis points. I just want to make sure I heard correctly?\n\nOperator: Thank you. Our next questions come from the line of Noah Zatzkin with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please proceed with your questions.\n\nNoah Zatzkin: Hi, thanks for taking my questions. I guess just quick on the RV industry. I noticed you guys kind of ticked down your expectations slightly on the wholesale side. So just wondering relative to a few months ago, what may have led to that? Thanks.\n\nJeffrey Rodino: Yes. Noah, this is Jeff. As we've gotten into 2024, we've seen production rates from the OEMs pretty stable through the first quarter and into the second quarter. We believe that on our model, we were looking at 330 to 350 prior. Interest rate is not going down or at least the Fed saying that they're probably not going to go down as soon as we thought. I think it's going to continue to constrain dealers from wanting to bring inventory in at those higher levels, especially in the second half of the year, where we saw -- thought that maybe with some interest rate relief, we might see a little bit of that. So we just moved to a tick, not too much. We also note that going into the model change, the OEMs are being very, very disciplined with their production levels. So -- and as we get into June, they'll start to ramp down the 2024 production and start to get into the 2025 starting in July. So we see a little bit of falloff there over those -- over that time period. So overall, not much of a change, but we're just being a little bit cautious on it.\n\nNoah Zatzkin: Great. And maybe just kind of two-parter. Maybe if you could just kind of talk about how Sportech's performing relative to your expectations early on as well as kind of appetite for other M&A in the nearer term? Thanks.\n\nAndy Nemeth: Sure, Noah. This is Andy. Sportech is performing better than expectations so far. We're really pleased with not only the team's performance, but the cultural fit, the alignment, the collaboration we're seeing today. As we noted, we're really striving to execute on synergies very, very quickly and see a ton of runway there. So very pleased with Sportech, and it is performing better than expectations. I think as we look at our appetite for acquisitions, as we noted as well, we are in a position of strength from our perspective. We've got a ton of liquidity. We're managing our cash flows extremely well. Our team is extremely disciplined and doing a fabulous job of working with our customers to manage our inventories and be very thoughtful about that. So I would say our appetite, again, is a position of strength and to be on offense, and we are actively looking at the acquisition pipeline, continuing to cultivate acquisitions organically. And again, really prioritizing what could make sense at what point in time, but we are actively looking at acquisitions right now.\n\nNoah Zatzkin: Great. Thank you.\n\nOperator: Thank you. Our next questions come from the line of Tristan Thomas-Martin with BMO Capital Markets. Please proceed with your questions.\n\nTristan Thomas-Martin: Good morning. Can you just talk how RV content specifically trended in the quarter, maybe not on a trailing 12-month basis, both year-over-year and then quarter-over-quarter. Just trying to square the 9% shipment growth to your revenue being up 15%?\n\nJeffrey Rodino: Yes, Tristan, this is Jeff. Sequentially, RV was up about 1% from the fourth quarter of 2023 to the first quarter. So we are seeing that, and we believe that will -- that trend will continue through the year.\n\nTristan Thomas-Martin: Okay. I guess just kind of the delta of how you outperformed the industry so much on a shipment standpoint, given there seems to be kind of the ongoing ASP pressure?\n\nAndy Nemeth: Yes. We've -- I would tell you, Tristan, over the last 15 months, our team has been really active in the marketplace and picking up business. Again, working with our customers, really making sure that we're in the best position to be able to take care of them, both on the quality and service side, but as well on the pricing side. And as we've -- again, managed our inventories, but also worked to push our vendors to bring commodity costs down as well. We are -- as Jeff mentioned, we're really active in pushing those prices through to our customers. So we maintain a great balance of pricing and quality and service with the customer base. And as a result, our RV teams have done a spectacular job of picking up more organic content in the RV space.\n\nTristan Thomas-Martin: Okay. And then just one more, 1Q RV retail to get to year, I believe it was down 14%. That implies a pretty big deceleration in March. Am I thinking about that the right way?\n\nAndy Nemeth: Say it again. I really didn't understand your question.\n\nTristan Thomas-Martin: Yes. So RV retail, I think you called out down 14%. But to get there, that would imply March was down more than both January and February year-over-year. Am I missing anything there?\n\nAndy Nemeth: At this point with the estimates, we would tell you, it's down a little bit more than January and February, correct.\n\nTristan Thomas-Martin: Okay. Thank you.\n\nOperator: Thank you. Our next questions come from the line of Craig Kennison with Baird. Please proceed with your questions.\n\nCraig Kennison: Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. You've addressed many of them, but maybe a follow-on. That last question on the month of March. Any color on April trends in terms of RV demand as we continue to see high interest rates impact the consumer?\n\nJeffrey Rodino: Yes, Craig, this is Jeff. From our perspective and what we look at are the production levels, I would tell you that through April, they've stayed pretty consistent with what we've seen so far this year. Like I mentioned earlier, looking ahead to May a little bit. We do see a little bit of time being taken off over the Memorial Day holiday. So we'll lose a little bit of production level there. But overall, the levels -- weekly levels of our customers have stayed pretty consistent.\n\nCraig Kennison: Okay. Thanks. Then on the margin front, 30 to 50 basis points. I'm wondering if you can just share any color on the puts and takes to getting there. I know your marine business tends to be higher margin. You've got Sportech rolling through. I'm just wondering if you can help us understand how you get to 30 to 50 basis points with all the ups and downs in your individual businesses?\n\nAndy Nemeth: Craig, this is Andy. There are definitely a lot of puts and takes in the model. When you look at the diversified business model and what we're doing there, I think when you look at the housing business, which is a highly leverageable business, given the low fixed cost structure that's there. That team has done a fantastic job as well really across our organization when we think about the team's performance. They've done a great job of managing that business, but we've also picked up business there on the housing side and the MH of the business. So leveraging that model is certainly supporting the margin profile and really kind of helping offset what we're seeing as it relates to a little bit worse performance on the Marine side of the business, just given what we're seeing in our mix with the products that we're selling through. It is a higher engineered product, a higher-priced product. And so yes, that does have some impact on it. But when I think about just the puts and takes. There's a lot that goes into our model. But when you look at the industries and the industry performance, it's allowing us to be very, very resilient. And then when you look at the acquisitions that we've done, and I'm going to say over the course of the last 24 to 36 months, we're buying margin-accretive businesses that are supporting the model as well. So we look at that margin resilience that we're able to produce it's a combination of a lot of things with the diversification, the acquisition strategy, the team's performance, the automation initiatives that we've put in place, the increase throughput, and increased quality. And then again, just the team's execution in the marketplace and ability to really drive customer value as we strive to be that component solutions provider as a go-to for our customers have all played into the margin profile.\n\nOperator: Thank you. Our next questions come from the line of Daniel Moore with CJS Securities. Please proceed with your questions.\n\nDaniel Moore: Thank you. Good morning. And Andy, good morning. Welcome to you. Covered a lot of ground -- excuse me. But just on the content side, content per RV ticked slightly higher in Q1 and marine. I think you said flat sequentially. You think we found the bottom from which we can grow on either or both sides or consumers likely to continue to opt for more entry level units that might keep some pressure on that metric?\n\nAndy Nemeth: Hey, Dan. Andy Nemeth. I think as we look at content today, we feel like we have bottomed in general. There may be a few small puts and takes here. But overall, we feel like we bottomed and we would expect content to continue to go up. kind of sequentially as we look at the model going forward, especially with the business that we've brought on. I think one of the other things that we're really excited about is when you think about market conditions like this, and the consumers -- or I'm sorry, the customers at the OEM level, there's a higher concentration on new innovations and product development, and we're actively and aggressively pursuing a lot of different innovations out there in the product space today. So when we look at content and where we sit today, kind of bouncing along the bottom with some uptick with business that we brought on, we get pretty excited about where we think we can go once the market doesn't flag, especially with a lot of the new product solutions that we're bringing to market and working with our customers on, not only current model year out but two, three year models out, as we've mentioned. So our expectation is the -- long answer to your question, but we expect content to sequentially continue to go up. We do believe it's bottomed.\n\nDaniel Moore: Very helpful. And on Sportech and Powersports, more generally. You've had Sportech under the umbrella for a couple of months now. Just how would you characterize the opportunities to drive content over the next few years relative to your initial expectations. You described some of those cross-selling or internal sales and initiatives that or meetings that you've already had taken place, but just talk about the -- where you see that opportunity going?\n\nAndy Nemeth: Yes. We definitely are excited about the opportunity that exists there. With that team's innovation, again, we talk about advanced products. They've been doing that for a while as well. And so you look at some of the combinations of products that we can bring to market in alignment with what they're delivering today as a product solution and a very sticky product solution, we think that there's a lot of opportunity to bring additional value with our product lines and incorporating those into, again, a higher value-added product for the customer base, for that enthusiast space that we think can be really compelling for the end consumer. So I would say our expectations are at or better than kind of what we anticipated.\n\nDaniel Moore: Great. And lastly, it does sound like M&A could be on the table given the strong cash flow outlook that you just reiterated, talk about your capital allocation priorities for the next 12 months, debt paydown versus M&A versus maybe potential buybacks, opportunistically? Thanks again.\n\nAndy Nemeth: Yes, sure. So I think as we look at capital allocation, we're going to stay focused on making sure that we're reinvesting in the business. We're going to continue to pursue automation initiatives that increase throughput and quality. That's been very successful from our perspective. So we're going to continue to deploy capital there. We're going to remain opportunistic on the buyback side of the business. And we've always got a grid in place as it relates to marker that we will execute upon based on the return model that we've put forth. So we're always actively looking at that, whether or not we execute in a given quarter, we do -- we are very actively monitoring the buyback. And then on the acquisition front, for sure, we're excited about the pipeline that exists out there today. We've got the liquidity. We've got the capital structure to be able to support a continued acquisition profile, especially as we look at our leverage profile as well, which we've been able to deliver upon in bringing that down immediately following Sportech and expect to continue to do so. So I think we remain opportunistic and as we've mentioned on offense as it relates to acquisitions and want to continue to actively pursue them.\n\nOperator: Thank you. Our next questions come from the line of Brandon Rolle with D.A. Davidson. Please proceed with your questions.\n\nBrandon Rolle: Thank you. Thanks for taking my questions. First, just on Sportech, I think you had mentioned expectations for wholesale shipments this year to be flat. What gives you confidence shipments can be flat year-over-year given the state of dealer inventories and also the industry lapping a very strong channel fill year in 2023.\n\nAndy Nemeth: Sure, Brandon. This is Andy Nemeth. As we look at Sportech, again, the utility sector is where Sportech is primarily focused. And when we look at the combination of demand, that exists there today. Inventory levels in the channel that we see in the utility side of the business and then the backlog that exists at Sportech. That's what gives us kind of our confidence as it relates to the stability of that business. So again, we see that. That was one of the things that we looked at as we kind of pursued Sportech as well, and gain confidence on, but that's really driving that. That utility sector has a solid demand profile to it. And then that coupled with the backlog gives us confidence in Sportech's performance.\n\nBrandon Rolle: Okay. Great. And then just one other question. I think currently, over the past couple of months, the model year '25 bidding process within the RV industry has been going on. Could you comment on the state of competition, any increased competition or any potential -- it seems like OEMs are looking to get prices lower, given affordability issues within the industry and elevated interest rates. Any commentary on the model year '25 bidding process? Thank you.\n\nJeffrey Rodino: Yes, Brandon, this is Jeff. Every year, we kind of go through the same bidding process. We have competition in every one of the product categories. And there is always competition out there. We're obviously working to be kind of best-in-class in all of our product categories, making sure that we're hitting on our automation, our efficiencies as well as pushing our vendors to pass along the pricing, so we can get that to our customers. So we're being aggressive out there where we can be and pushing that. But certainly, we're always dealing with competition. We've got competition in every one of the product lines.\n\nBrandon Rolle: Great. Thank you.\n\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. Our next questions come from the line of Alex Perry with Bank of America (NYSE:BAC). Please proceed with your questions.\n\nAlex Perry: Hi, thanks for taking my questions here. I guess just first, any more color you can give on the sort of expectations for whether it's Sportech or the Powersport segment should contribute for the year. I guess, specifically, any color you can give on sort of the phasing in any seasonality we should be thinking about with the business as we build our models up? Thanks.\n\nAndy Nemeth: Yes. This is Andy. I think as we look at kind of seasonality, we expect kind of existing run rates or current run rates that we're seeing today. As we look at kind of overall Powersports for Patrick as a whole for the year, we're estimating around $400 million of Powersports revenue in that space today. So again, we feel like where we're geared, where we're focused, kind of flat market growth or organic -- let's call it, flat market growth with up organic content as we continue to pick up business, but also gain content on products, especially as it relates to additional solutions that were bringing to the table.\n\nAlex Perry: That's really helpful. And then just my follow-up is on Marine. I think you said 2Q decline similar to 1Q. I guess as we move into the back half, what gives you the confidence that you should start to see an improvement in the Marine business? Thanks.\n\nAndy Nemeth: Sure. I think as we're looking at Marine, there is resilience at the retail level, and we do see solid traffic out there. There's a lot of interest. The marine OEMs do a fabulous job of innovating product and continuing to push the envelope as it relates to innovations in the space. So we don't believe that there is a lack of attractiveness of product out there and nor do we believe that there's a lack of demand. Right now, as we just kind of look at where the market's at, the anticipation of the '25 model year and the new innovations that do come out in marine kind of hitting in the back half we feel -- and we also feel like inventories in the channel are in balance. We think the OEs have been extremely aggressive in managing production in alignment with the dealers. And so there's a lot of discipline. There's still tremendous demand out there, especially for the new innovations, and we just kind of look at that model today and think that we're kind of bouncing along here on the bottom. It's been soft in the higher concentrated components, to date, through Q1, and we just expect that to continue, especially with what we're seeing from a macroeconomic perspective through Q2. So as we look at things, again, we wanted to -- we thought it was prudent to kind of make sure that we're looking at the market according to our mix. But overall, again, the demand is still out there, and we're seeing that resilience with certain product categories in the space. And again, that's what gives us confidence towards the back half that we'll see some stabilization.\n\nOperator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, I will turn it back over to Andy Nemeth for closing remarks.\n\nAndy Nemeth: Thank you. I want to end the call, once again, by thanking our amazing team members who have made these past 65 years as a company possible. Their leadership, tenacity and passion for what we do is evident in the company that we are today. Patrick's ability to adapt, grow and evolve over this time period from a manufactured housing supplier into a more diversified partner to the RV, marine, Powersports and housing industries supports our goal of being the supplier of choice to the outdoor enthusiast space. We will continue to be stewards of good business, accelerating the transformation of our company, while optimizing our financial and operational health. Thank you very much for your continued support.\n\nOperator: Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This concludes today's teleconference. Thank you for your participation.

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, George Karamanos, Chief Legal Officer. Thank you, sir. You may begin.\n\nGeorge Karamanos: Welcome to our Q1 conference call. Riley McCormack, our CEO; and Charles Beck, our CFO, are with me on the call. On the call today, we will provide a business update and discuss Q1 2024 financial results. This will be followed by a question and answer forum. We have posted our prepared remarks in the investor relations section of our website and will archive this webcast there. Before we begin, let me remind everyone that today's discussion contains forward-looking statements that have risks and uncertainties. Please refer to our press release for more information on the specific risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially. Riley will now provide a business update.\n\nRiley McCormack: Thank you, George, and welcome aboard. Hello, everyone. Thank you for joining today's call. As our world becomes increasingly digital and company progressed their digital transformation journeys, Digimarc maximizes the ways in which products and multimedia can digitally interact with the various systems that surround them. We excel at the identification and authentication of physical goods and digital assets often at massive scale and often where other means of identification or authentication don't work well or don't work at all. Our focus is on converting this large total addressable market into substantial free cash flow by positioning ourselves to deliver high and long lasting top line growth at world-class operating margins. This starts with our being easy to begin doing business with and excellently guiding customers along their digital transformation journey and is aided by 4 tailwinds we've been very intentional to create. One, an incredibly deep and wide modes provide us the ability to offer differentiated products. In turn, our differentiated products allow us the ability to create new markets as well as to disrupt existing ones, all while delivering best-in-class gross margins that will continue to expand as we scale. Two, the need to identify or authenticate physical goods and digital assets is universal, and thus almost every entity in the world is a potential Digimarc customer. At the same time, our technology allows us to identify and authenticate things where other solutions don't work well or don't work at all, which means our ecosystem is comprised of companies incentivized to partner with us as opposed to companies that pose competitive risk. These two truths provide us the exciting opportunity to leverage our partners' customer list, pipelines and go-to-market resources and specific domain expertise to deliver quickly scalable and high gross profit margin revenue in a way that is also extremely efficient from the operating expenditure perspective. Three, there are many use cases that require companies to identify or authenticate their physical items and digital assets, and many ways we can configure our technology to achieve these goals, and therefore our ability to productize new functionality is open-ended. This means our already prodigious TAM will continue to grow as we either launch new products or add opportunity-unlocking functionality to existing products. Four, we engineer our products to be accretive, which means the more Digimarc products a customer buys, the more value each product delivers. This positions us to harvest the low hanging and highly profitable fruit of cross sells and upsells for years to come. The combination of these four tailwinds is why we are confident in our ability to deliver high and long-lasting growth at world-class operating margins, and in so doing achieve our goal of converting our enormous TAM into massive free cash flow generation. Our first quarter results provide multiple tangible examples I'd like to now share. We signed a multi-year deal with a customer in the collectibles industry that delivered 6-figure ARR growth in Q1. Moreover, this deal should see ARR grow to $2 million in year two and into the mid-to-very-high 7 figures in year-3 and beyond. Collectibles is a new industry for us, and one we believe is ripe for digital transformation in both how items are identified as well as how they are authenticated. To that end, this customer chose to start their journey with two Digimarc products, Digimarc Automate and Digimarc Validate. And we believe that as we work to ensure our valued customer's success, there is even more we could do - we could help them accomplish beyond what is scoped in this initial agreement. Moreover, and unrelated to this deal, we are in discussions with multiple partners, both new and old, regarding opportunities to jointly provide value to other companies in this multi-hundred billion dollar per year industry. Collectibles is a perfect example of an industry that has been held back by other means of identification and authentication not working well or not working at all. And we are excited to guide this industry along its product digitization journey, and in so doing, accelerate its growth. We signed a high 5-figure ARR Digimarc Automate deal with a division of our largest commercial customer that will grow to 6-figures in the very near term. We believe this new deal is yet another proof-point that we are still just scratching the surface of all the transformational value we can provide this Uber-valued and tech-forward customer. We remain laser-focused on doing just that. We upsold a long-standing Digimarc Validate customer that had historically only been focused on B2B anti-counterfeit applications, but is now keenly interested in expanding the authentication capability of Digimarc Validate to end consumers. This upsell allows our customer to unlock new functionality that we just recently productized, and we believe the opportunity with this customer for B2C validation is enormous. We are excited to prove our value and earn the right to capture the entirety of the opportunity this new functionality allows, with this specific customer as well as the many, many other companies that will benefit from this newly-productized functionality. We signed a deal with another customer interested in beginning their journey with two Digimarc products, in this case an iconic European brand interested in the power of Digimarc Engage and Digimarc Validate. While this initial deal was mid-5 figures, this relationship has the potential to grow to be much larger even if the customer doesn't expand beyond these two Digimarc products. It is also important to note that this customer understands the accretive nature of our products and has already expressed interest in another Digimarc product beyond Digimarc Engage and Digimarc Validate. We signed a Digimarc Validate deal with an existing Digimarc Automate customer and have additional pipeline opportunities for both products with this extremely large CPG. Our focus is on not only proving the value of Digimarc Validate and Digimarc Automate, but also of Digimarc as a digital transformation partner as the upside presented by this single customer is enormous as it is not only a large company, but a very viable candidate for our full product suite. We upsold Digimarc Engage to a long-standing Digimarc Validate customer and believe the upside from their planned rollout of Digimarc Engage will see this high-5-figure initial deal grow well into the 6 figures in the not-too-distant future. Our go-to-market strategies are not just increasing our win rates, however, but also our momentum as evidenced by other Q1 deals, including a 6-figure upsell of Digimarc Engage to an existing customer just over a year after the initial agreement was signed. Additionally, we secured a Digimarc Validate agreement with a new customer within 38 days of our initial discussion as well as revived a previously inactive relationship by signing a Digimarc Validate deal with another new customer only 45 days after reengagement. These achievements highlight the effectiveness of our refined approach and the strong demand for our solutions. The final first quarter wins that I want to highlight today involve the closing of two separate Digimarc Validate deals with divisions of an existing Digimarc customer, one with a division new to our offering, and one with a division who churned in 2023. This 2023 churn was the result of our holding firm on key terms during the renewal process, and the rebound signing is a testament to the incredible value Digimarc Validate provides. Important to note, even during the period during which this division was not a customer, they continued to act as a Digimarc champion in our conversation with other divisions and were key to our closing the new division we signed this quarter as well as progressing other divisions currently in our pipeline. We are thrilled to have this division back as a customer. While not normally a topic discussed voluntarily in prepared remarks, I do want to spend a few minutes discussing customer churn as this is yet another area in which we differentiate. First, as this example shows, while we are not immune to churn, I expect our churn will always remain much lower than other SaaS companies as the solutions we provide tend to be mission critical and Digimarc is unique in being able to provide them. Our premium offerings also mean we do more business with established companies and the overall trends from which we benefit are unlikely to be de-funded by companies undergoing organizational change. Also important to note that not all churn is regrettable, especially for a company that has undergone the transformation that we have executed here. As we have productized functionality previously sold as bespoke offerings and been acting with intentionality to not deviate from our long-term vision, we have been guided by a decision we made at the onset of our transformation and shared with you all on an earnings call in 2021. We will build a focused, profitable, and sustainable business versus pursuing ARR growth at all costs. Not every dollar of revenue is created equal and when forced to choose we will always prioritize the creation of long-term, not short-term, value. While acting as a headwind to our reported net ARR growth since we began our transformation, this headwind of non-regrettable churn is predominantly behind us. And what's more, this discipline will allow us to avoid the distractions that can impede vision realization as well as maximize our overall profitability by maintaining a focus on the profitability of each customer. But this discipline can also lead to short-term benefits as well, and in Q1 we recorded a 6-figure ARR upsell as a result of a legacy customer choosing to accept our right-sized pricing despite this pricing being significantly higher than their legacy deal. Before I turn the call over to Charles, I want to touch on what we refer to as our Ecosystem Driven Opportunities. Digimarc Recycle, Digimarc Validate (Media), and Digimarc Retail Experience. While these opportunities provide game-changing upside that will be extremely fast, profitable, and sticky once they each begin to scale, the ultimate timing of when exactly that happens is tough to predict as it is ultimately outside of our direct control. These opportunities require the collaboration of multiple parties and in some cases may be accelerated by regulatory action. Yet once the spark is lit, they should be extremely sticky and grow exponentially due to well-understood network effects and natural incentives for rapid adoption. Do not read any signaling into what I just said, it is something we've said before. And also let me be very clear in saying that we remain just as excited about these 3 giant opportunities and just as optimistic about the impact they each will have when they do indeed begin to scale. Instead, I wanted to focus today's prepared remarks on the other pieces of our business which don't receive the attention from investors that we believe they should. While Digimarc Recycle, Digimarc Validate Media, and Digimarc Retail Experience tend to make up the vast majority of investor questions, they don't yet contribute in a meaningful way to the incredibly high and accelerating growth we've been delivering in both ARR and commercial subscription revenue. There are many unique aspects to Digimarc, and this is yet another example. We're delivering strong results in the parts of the business where we directly assert control while progressing and growing the untapped opportunities which will provide stair-step increases in growth and profitability when they do indeed occur. An investment in Digimarc is both an investment in a quickly growing and accelerating software business with best-in-class-and-expanding gross margins, and an investment in a company that is progressing towards becoming the de facto market standard in some really exciting and massive opportunities, with a third leg of value provided by our work with the world's Central Banks that delivers steadily growing revenue and high inflation-protected operating margins while acting as a profitable source of commercial intellectual property generation. We are the sum of these 3 pillars of shareholder value and before I give an update on the Ecosystem Driven Opportunities that I fully agree are incredibly exciting components of our future, I wanted to spend the majority of this call on the incredibly exciting components of our business generating ARR today. Digimarc Recycle. As discussed in the last call, we recently launched a new Go-To-Market avenue for this revolutionary product and I am happy to share we are in conversations with multiple parties regarding this new avenue, including 2 parties in the same country. We are also in conversations on 2 continents about leveraging our Center of Expertise Program as a way to bring our partners considerable heft to bear in opening Digimarc Recycle markets. Success on either of these fronts would speed the time to opening of Digimarc Recycle markets while in parallel reducing the associated costs. Success on the latter front would add the additional benefit of bringing these partners into our CoE Program and thus allow for the building of pipeline for our other products as well. Turning to other important developments for Digimarc Recycle, the European Packaging (NYSE:PKG) and Packaging Waste Regulation has been finalized and we are all awaiting the final full text. Recall that all previous drafts of this regulation mandated digital marking on all packaging as a means to improve waste sortation which would provide an incredibly strong tailwind for opening Digimarc Recycle markets in every country in the EU. Moreover, it has already been made public that the PPWR will mandate Deposit Return Schemes in countries where collections are below a very high bar. This will provide equally strong tailwinds for our ability, in conjunction with partners, to apply the power of Digimarc Illuminate to power these schemes across the European Union. Recall that Digimarc Illuminate provides a differentiated and lower cost means to provide the product authentication required by a performant DRS, and this use case was a key component in the $32 million deal we signed a few quarters ago. Also in Europe, the Holy Grail trial is in its final phase, and while the step-change improvement that digital watermarks will bring to plastic recycling is already widely-acknowledged, we are excited to support this wonderful group through the end of this trial so Digimarc Recycle can claim the powerful validation that will come from receiving an industry-driven Tech Readiness Level 9 designation. We are also supporting this group as they optimize their planning for an initial market launch, and while we are unable to speak to any updates on this front, we do want to flag to our investors to be on the lookout for an exciting update on all Holy Grail activities that we are being told will come soon. On Digimarc Validate Media, as regulators worldwide endeavor to strike the right balance between protecting against the harm of Generative AI without stifling the incredible advancements it will bring, there is an increasing awareness that tools that can do both, like digital watermarks, must be seized. We are actively involved in these conversations, providing our 30 years of expertise in applying digital watermarks to build massive systems of trust and authenticity. In Q1, Digimarc was appointed as a founding member of the National Institute of Standards and Technology's U.S. Artificial Intelligence Safety Institute Consortium and we also announced that along with Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE) we are co-chairing the new digital watermark workgroup of the Coalition for Content Provenance and Authenticity or C2PA. On the product front, we released the world's first browser extension to turn Chrome into a C2PA validator and along with our valued partner DataTrails put the finishing touches on the industry's first fully integrated content protection solution to fortify digital content using advanced digital watermarks in tandem with cryptographic proofs, a solution we announced in early April. We are big believers that of all the many benefits GenAI will bring, perhaps the greatest will be to act as the catalyst to deliver the safer, fairer, and more authentic internet we all deserve. To help deliver this much-needed future, we announced in January that we have made our SAFE digital watermarking embedding and detection tools for digital assets free to large ecosystem partners so that our Digimarc Validate customers will have easy access when they are ready to adopt at scale. There is a lot more going on that is not yet ready for broader discussion, but before I close on Digimarc Validate Media, I do want to point everyone to the state of California and Assembly Bill 3211, which is focused on authenticity and watermarking standards and might end up being the catalyst for the catalyst and in so doing, build upon California's proud history of leading the world on important issues. Realizing that real damage is being done every day that action is delayed, the California Assembly has a wonderfully fast timeframe in mind and I was honored to be asked to testify last week on the feasibility of the key provisions in this bill. We are excited to provide our support as this bill continues its fast progress through the California State Assembly and hopefully soon into law. Multiple global regulators are closely watching this bill, and its impact will be felt not just domestically, but around the world. On Digimarc Retail Experience, while there is little we can say about this opportunity due to the immense pride we take in being a trusted supplier, I did mention earlier in the call that we signed an Automate deal with our largest commercial customer who is also key to the broad adoption of Retail Experience by the global CPGs. The opportunities presented for digital transformation between the world's leading product digitization company and a company that touches a mindboggling number of products across multiple touch points, both physical and digital, is truly exciting. And the two most impactful ways to bring those opportunities to fruition are a win their business everyday through a maniacal focus on delivering them excellence and b not speaking about their business on their behalf. I will now turn the call over to Charles to discuss our financial results.\n\nCharles Beck: Thank you, Riley, and good afternoon, everyone. Continuing on the positive trends we delivered in the third and fourth quarters last year, we again delivered improved year-over-year financial performance in the first quarter this year. Ending ARR grew to $23.9 million, representing an 85% increase. Commercial subscription revenue increased 52%. Subscription gross profit margin was 87%, a 7.5 percentage point improvement. Operating expenses decreased 10% and non-GAAP net loss decreased $3.5 million or 39%. I highlight these areas again as they are all critical drivers toward reaching positive free cash flow. Before I begin a deeper review of the quarter, I want to highlight that we've posted a Quarterly Earnings Snapshot presentation to the Investor Relations section of our website, along with our normal quarterly materials. The Quarterly Earnings Snapshot is broken into two parts. The first part provides an overview of our business and contains, among other things, a deeper dive into our three different commercial Go-To-Market motions as well as key details of the three pillars of shareholder value, which Riley highlighted earlier. The second part provides an overview of the quarter and presents our financial KPI's with relevant comparative and trended data. As you will see, we have delivered accelerating growth in both the year - in year 1 and 3-year periods for ARR and commercial subscription revenue, as well as a material improvement in our subscription gross profit margins. We will continue to refine the material in the Quarterly Earnings Snapshot in the quarters ahead, and we welcome your feedback as we strive to provide our investors continued clarity and transparency. ARR increased 85% from $13 million at the end of March last year to $23.9 million at the end of March this year. The increase in ARR largely reflects the impact of new customer contracts and several important customer upsells. As a reminder, we believe ARR is the best leading indicator for future commercial subscription revenue growth. Revenue growth will lag ARR growth as commercial subscription revenue is generally recognized ratably over a contract term versus ARR is calculated upfront upon entering into a contract. You can see this in looking at our Q1 results as ARR increased 85% year-over-year while commercial subscription revenue increased 52%. Total revenue for the quarter was $9.9 million, an increase of $2.1 million or 27% from $7.8 million in Q1 last year, reflecting strong growth in subscription revenue. Subscription revenue, which accounted for 58% of total revenue for the quarter, grew 48% from $3.9 million to $5.8 million. The increase reflects subscription revenue recognized on new customer contracts as well as upsells on existing customer contracts. Commercial subscription revenue grew at an even higher rate at 52%. Service revenue increased 6% from $4 million to $4.2 million. The increase primarily reflects the timing of program work with the Central Banks. Subscription gross profit margin improved from 79.5% in Q1 last year to 87% in Q1 this year, representing a 7.5 percentage point improvement. The large increase year-over-year reflects both the strong growth in subscription revenue combined with a favorable mix in subscription revenue to our newer products, which have higher gross profit margins than our legacy products. Service gross profit margin was down slightly from 56.7% in Q1 last year to 56% in Q1 this year. It is not unusual to see some fluctuation in service margins depending on labor mix for services work. We expect to generate mid-50% service gross profit margins on a normalized basis. Operating expenses for the quarter were $17.1 million compared to $19 million in Q1 last year, a decrease of 10%. Operating expenses in Q1 last year included $2.1 million of one-time severance costs for organizational changes we made in February 2023. Excluding these severance costs, operating expenses were up only $200 thousand year-over-year or 1%, reflecting the impact of annual compensation adjustments for our employees, offset by lower headcount. Company-wide, we continue to focus on ways to maximize our productivity and efficiency as an organization in order to minimize the impact of rising labor and other costs. Non-GAAP operating expenses, which excludes non-cash and non-recurring items, were $13.8 million for the quarter, down 11%, compared to $15.5 million in Q1 last year. Net loss per share for the quarter was $0.50 versus $0.70 in Q1 last year. And non-GAAP net loss per share was also considerably lower for the quarter at $0.27 versus $0.45 in Q1 last year. We ended the quarter with $48.9 million in cash and short-term investments, after raising $32.5 million of gross proceeds through a registered direct offering that closed in February. Free cash flow usage was $8.6 million for the quarter, compared to $8.9 million in Q1 last year. As we foreshadowed on the last earnings call, free cash flow usage in Q1 included annual cash incentive payments to our employees. The company paid annual cash incentives of $2.9 million in Q1 to our employees for exceeding our 2023 financial targets and strategic goals. Excluding these cash incentive payments, free cash flow usage would have been $5.7 million. Given cash flows can fluctuate quarter to quarter depending on the timing of cash inflows and outflows, we continue to believe that a good proxy for a normalized level of free cash flow is using non-GAAP loss and adding the small amount of capital expenditures we invest. Our non-GAAP loss was $5.5 million during Q1 this year versus $9 million in Q1 last year, a decrease of 39%. We also used an additional $1.8 million of cash in Q1 for share repurchases. For further discussion of our financial results, and risks and prospects for our business, please see our Form 10-Q that will be filed with the SEC later this week. I will now turn the call back over to Riley for final remarks.\n\nRiley McCormack: Thanks, Charles. Q1 was another strong quarter for Digimarc. Compared to the quarter a year ago, we grew quarter-ending ARR 85%, grew commercial subscription revenue 52%, and expanded subscription gross profit margin 7.5 percentage points to 87%. While investors remain understandably and rightfully excited about what our massive Ecosystem Driven Opportunities will contribute to our future, I am so proud of what the team is delivering in the massive opportunities in front of us today. Our top line growth has been accelerating from already high levels, our best-in-class gross profit margin continues to expand, and we are positioned to convert an incredibly high percentage of the resultant gross profit dollars to the bottom line by leveraging our partners to further boost our top line in an incredibly OpEx-efficient way. There are many things that make Digimarc a unique and generational investment opportunity. The fact we have three very real, tangible, and quantifiable pillars to our shareholder value story is one of the most powerful and, at the same time, perhaps the least understood. I encourage you all to review the Quarterly Earnings Snapshot deck Charles referenced for more on this front. As always, we remain focused on positioning ourselves to convert our large total addressable market into substantial free cash flow by delivering high and long-lasting growth at world class operating margins. Q1 provided multiple tangible examples of our progress against this focus and we remain excited for what's ahead. Operator, we will now open up the call for questions.\n\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Joshua Reilly with Needham. Please proceed with your question.\n\nJoshua Reilly: Yes. Thanks for taking my question and nice job and congrats on the 85% ARR growth there. I'm curious what's the initial response you're hearing from customers on the next-gen digital watermark upgrade here? And how much of a factor was that in some of the deals that you kind of highlighted here in the quarter? Or is that more something that's going to be on the common as the growth driver in the second half of the year?\n\nRiley McCormack: Thanks, Josh. Thanks for dialing in. Yes, great question. So off the top of my head, I don't think any of the deals that closed in Q1 took advantage of our next-gen digital watermark, but our pipeline is full of them. As we talked about in the last call, one of the - there's a lot of key unlocks from the next-gen digital watermark. One of them is the apply-now activate-later functionality that we can roll out. We talked about how important that was going to be to our CoE program. And I guess stay tuned for our Q2 call. We'll give you more details on the initial up-ramp and success in our CoE program. But that's key there. But even with the brands that we're currently doing business with, having the understanding that, hey, they understand they're taking some of the Digimarc products - some of their products today, maybe regionally with the idea that now they can, during package refresh, apply this apply-now activate-later next-gen digital watermark to all of their packaging, huge, huge, huge unlocking. So, really excited by the initial reception. It is specifically on the CoE program, something that is really driving conversations like many people that are higher CoE tier because that's the only place it's available to our partners. But even with our existing brands and understanding now that they can future-proof all of their packaging even if we're not ready to adopt immediately a Digimarc product, huge unlock and an ARR increase.\n\nJoshua Reilly: Got it. That's helpful. And then on the Digimarc Engage product, with the upgrade now, are you going to be making any changes to your Go-To-Market there? And how should we just kind of be thinking about the potential growth for that product in general with the upgrade?\n\nRiley McCormack: You mean the upgrade by adding the digital functionality?\n\nJoshua Reilly: Yes.\n\nRiley McCormack: Yes. It's just another differentiator, right? So there's a lot of things that, as you know, Digimarc Engage is the one product where potentially the most competitive in terms of having competitors can offer some of the functionality. This is just another differentiation. There's a lot of differentiation we have on the physical side with our thought leadership in digital link, our best-in-class redirection engine, the fact that we are a platform, right? And so a lot of consumer engagement offerings are one-stop shops. So the fact that there's so much more with Illuminate people can do besides Engage, the fact that because of Digital Link and Sunrise 2027, this is becoming more of an IT purchase as opposed to a marketing purchase. So, all of those things play in there. We just opened up another front where we differentiate from everybody else, which is we can provide all that amazing functionality in the digital domain. And while that itself is exciting, both with conversations with end customers, but also partners who are really wrapping their head around what we can do, just by itself that would be exciting, the fact that we could provide a unified view and inform campaigns that are cross domain. This is rarefied air. This is sort of the holy grail of everything that every tech company is trying to do is, yes, it's interesting to track somebody or to provide people content into digital domain, and it's interesting to do that in the analog world. But, man, tying those two together, incredible unlock. And it's a differentiator has resonating.\n\nJoshua Reilly: Got it. That's helpful. And then last question from me. I don't think you've guided this specifically, but how are you thinking about the cash burn for the balance of the year relative to the recent capital raise and the cash that you have on your balance sheet, and kind of just thinking out in terms of capital allocation for the balance of the year? Thanks, ugys.\n\nCharles Beck: Yes. So cash can fluctuate quarter-to-quarter as we kind of - as I highlighted in my prepared remarks. Obviously, Q1 is a lot higher than what we think a normalized level is because of the tax payments. And that's why I highlight back to the non-GAAP loss really being a more normalized level. And so our focus is continuing to grow the top line, expand our margins, reduce costs to continue to decrease our loan GAAP loss which you can see has been trending down significantly year-over-year, down 39%. So that's the primary focus. We don't give guidance itself on cash flow. Part of that is because it's difficult to predict because of the inflows or outflows. But our mission as a company is really focused on driving down that non-GAAP loss, which will directly translate into improved free cash flow.\n\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Jeff Van Rhee with Craig-Hallum Capital Group. Please proceed with your question.\n\nJeff Van Rhee: Hey, guys. Congrats. A couple for me tonight. So just if I could start on the ARR, $24 million up from $13 million a year ago; you've added $11 million to the incremental ARR. Specifically as you're willing to, where has the incremental $11 million in ARR come from with respect to use cases?\n\nCharles Beck: I'd say the majority of it's come from our platform itself. But it's a combination of new contracts, the majority of it over the last year, but then also significant upsells with our customers. And Riley highlighted on several of those in Q1. We've highlighted some of those in prior periods. So it's a combination of really our platform itself and then Validate and Engage are the two other primary drivers.\n\nJeff Van Rhee: Okay. Maybe shift gears to the sales front. As I think about how the sales team operates, I mean - and I'm just looking at like Slide 9 in your deck today, which I appreciate - you've got a ton of end market opportunities. And in thinking through how that sales force is structured, I know you've got greatly enhanced leadership, you're really doing some good things there. Take a minute just talk about your sales org and in particular how the Go-To-Market, how the reps are tasked? How it's broken down right now would be helpful.\n\nRiley McCormack: Yes. So we have direct sales. People that are calling our accounts have industry-focus, geographic focus. And we have our market development team that are focused on some of the bigger opportunities. We are very specific to call it market development and not business development because business development is like 2 to 3 years, market developments 6 to 12 months maybe. Let's actually develop a market so we can unlock it and then throw a bunch more of AEs after that market. And so in the market development are some of our bigger opportunities like the ecosystem-driven opportunities would fall into there, some of the bigger one-off deals, but also lighting up our CoE partners, right? And that's the key unlock here. As to your point, there are so many verticals, so many areas that we could be going after where we don't need to go in there and become an expert in every single vertical. And even if we wanted to be an expert, we don't have the 15 years of showing up to the trade shows that people expect. Vendors, especially vendors in the Validate, the anti-counterfeit space, right, our partners do. And so we have a team focused on opening up the CoE partners. The CoE partners then act as legitimizers. It's a speed to time to market, right, because they have existing customers, they have a pipeline, they have massive sales forces themselves. But it's also the domain expertise. It's coming in and saying, hey, we have this incredible anti-counterfeit partner that should you meet called Digimarc and making those introductions. And so then when those introductions come in, the direct reps pick it up. So, that's really the focus, direct as it's been with market development and the CoE openings comes under market development and then any leads that come out of the CoE program go back to the direct reps unless they are our highest level CoE where they can actually - the partners can actually sign deals on their own paper.\n\nJeff Van Rhee: That's helpful. And then one other for me, if I go back to the Slide 9, I know you are saying here that the individual color codes are not breaking down the pipe necessarily per se by percentages for each of these opportunities. And I am not clear if the general scope of the increase of the annual pipeline that's expressed here is accurate either. So, maybe the question would just be, can you give us a sense - some quantification of the expansion of late-stage pipeline now versus 6 months, 12 months, 18 months ago? Anything along those lines would help.\n\nCharles Beck: I would say the expansion of the pipelines really passed all those key product areas. And I elected that part - I shouldn't say elected, but did mention automate earlier that's a product too that's contributed to ARR. So, I mean it really goes across the gamut here as opportunities you look at on our pipeline. Obviously, CoE is a big area of focus, and we are continuing to improve Validate and Engage opportunities now with both up-selling with new customers as well as the platform. And then we highlight on here two security solutions and deposit return systems. Those are big opportunities in our pipeline as we look forward as well.\n\nRiley McCormack: Yes. And Jeff, we don't talk about our pipeline, we don't quantify our pipeline, but to answer your question, I think your holistic question, it's a lot bigger, obviously, right. I mean we need to have the pipeline ahead of the ARR. And so look at what our AAR (NYSE:AIR) has done in the pipeline. Looking forward, it has to be there to support it. One of the reasons we don't quantify pipeline, right, is - and we have had this conversation, we have massive opportunities in our pipeline. And no matter what percentage we assign, we are going to be wrong. It's either going to close or it's not going to close, right. So, it gets really tough when you are the size that we are, right. This is a reality we are always going to have. I hope we have these massive boulders in our pipeline, but when they become less massive relevant related to the size of existing, it becomes more noise. For us, it gets really hard to quantify externally pipeline because there is some really - there is wonderfully singles and doubles type business, right. Some examples like the deals that we talked - I talked about in prepared remarks today, but there is also these giant boulders. And it's hard to put it - not hard, it's impossible to put a percentage on them because whatever percentage probability we assign, that's not right. It's either going to close or it's not going to close. It's either zero or 100%.\n\nOperator: Our next question comes from Jeff Bernstein with TD Cowen. Please proceed with your question.\n\nJeff Bernstein: Hey guys. Just wanted to ask a little bit more about the deposit return scheme opportunity. There is a lot written in the last couple of weeks about - in order for these European countries to even sort of get into a positioning where they could be on track for the plastic reuse and recycling goals that they have. They almost have to get on deposit return schemes. Can you just flush that out a little bit and talk a little bit about what kind of timeframes you think that stuff has to happen? And can you tell us if the one that your partner had ongoing has launched yet or kind of any learnings from that?\n\nRiley McCormack: Yes. So, the reason, Jeff, I am guessing you have seen a lot on the DRS stuff is because of the - I don't want to call it a leak because it came from the EU, but they haven't released the final text for the PPWR. So, a lot of the questions you are asking will be in the final text. But they made it very clear that one of the things they have talked about, because they released a few of the bigger policy things, that if for any country where collection is not above an incredibly high bar and I don't remember exactly, I think it's like 90%, incredibly high bar. Yes, we are going to have to roll out DRS, right. And so one of the key parts of a DRS - I mean DRS is a pretty simple concept. You put a deposit on a bottle or a can and then when you return it, you get your deposit back. So, it's not - the systems themselves are pretty easy. The problem is the fraud. And there is a million examples. Lately there was a family in Arizona that's - I don't know what happened, I haven't been following the case, but it was a headline where they made $6 million taking products from Arizona and bring it into California. It's rough, right. And so what they need is a way to authenticate that the products that are being returned actually were part of the deposit return scheme, that there was a $0.05 or $0.10 deposit placed against that product. There is a lot of ways to do product authentication, right. A lot of them are really expensive. Our value that we have to offer through Digimarc Validate is the same value property offered DRS. And in general, lowering the cost of a DRS system, because they are expensive, is wonderful. We can also democratize it in so far, as in a lot of places, it's not just the cost, it's also - they don't have 60,000 square foot supermarkets that could have one of these really expensive RVMs, reverse vending machines. People want to use their cell phone wherever they go on the country side, right. So, that's where we come. And just like we offer a differentiated offering with Digimarc Validate for any product authentication, we can do the same thing, which is a key component of the DRS. And there is not an area that we want to get into directly ourselves. This is an area we will go through our partners, but a really exciting opportunity. We can't wait to see the final text of the PPWR and move forward from there based on all the marching orders. And again, the key thing about the PPWR, right, is the R stands for regulation, which means it's not negotiable. The member states are going to have to adopt whatever is in this final text.\n\nJeff Bernstein: Got it. Okay. And then anything on your partners initial win and how that's progressing and kind of any learnings from that?\n\nRiley McCormack: Yes, progressing well. I don't really know if there is any learnings yet today, but we will - just like with our biggest commercial customer, the best way to earn the trust every day is to not talk about our customers' business on their behalf. But obviously, because this is a national scheme, I would assume it would become very public whenever the country is ready to talk about it, just rolling out I am sure. Once we are allowed to amplify it, trust me, Jeff, we will.\n\nJeff Bernstein: Yes, understand. Okay. And then just I wanted to make sure I understood on automate. Does automate imply that there is some factory automation element to how something's being used, or is that not the right way to automatically think about it?\n\nRiley McCormack: No, that's right. It's in fulfillment centers, distribution centers. It's a way to apply digital watermarks in the Illuminate platform in the process of some sort of automation, right. So, multiple use cases - sorry, multiple locations, right, distribution centers, performance centers, where this could be applied, where there is currently automation today. And either, one, there actually is an automation that's still being done by humans because of the other means identification don't work at all or there is some automation that doesn't work well or it's really expensive because others means of identifications don't work well. And that's the opportunity. If you see in our deck, we will officially launch automate in the not-too-distant future. Incredible, we haven't even launched this product yet, and we have multiple customers not just historic, but if you paid attention to the prepared remarks, there was multiple deals in Q1 just from automate. That is an example of having wonderful partners in this space as well as just a real demand for a high ROI return, which is either we are actually allowing the initial steps of automation that were not existing before. We are also taking an automation though it's kind of kluge here, didn't work well, and bringing it in the 21st century.\n\nJeff Bernstein: Terrific. And then last question. In terms of that newest ability, because I think you only started talking about it pretty recently, of tracking consumer interactions, both in the e-commerce world and then in the physical world, it sounds like you already are signing some deals relating to that?\n\nRiley McCormack: On the digital side?\n\nJeff Bernstein: Yes. Or on a hybrid of - we are going to follow both the e-commerce and physical world, yes?\n\nRiley McCormack: No. So, nothing yet signed. We announced this not too long ago. It takes a while for pipeline. But it's an area of interest, not just directly with some existing customers, but really from our partners because this is something that they wrestle with, our partners, right, is they are getting asked to do some really difficult things. There is a very big partner of ours that's talking about how they are trying to help customers in the multimedia world, right. And they can offer stuff like content repositories or creating artwork, not just for physical packages, but for e-commerce, right. That's all really, really important, really, really interesting. The more opportunities we can offer in this hybrid world through our partners, it just makes their conversations easier. It gives them a reason to ping their existing customers. They had no way to talk in a while. We have this great new partnership that's coming called Digimarc, I will tell you more. So, I would assume here it's going to be partner-led only because our partners get this. And you have a conversation. This is back to the operating leverage our CoEs will give us. You have a conversation with a partner and that partner has got 1,000 salespeople, you can have 1,000 customers or 1,000 conversations with customers through that entity as opposed to us going back during QBR is with our existing customers say, hey, let's say there is a new functionality. So, I would assume this one in particular. And as we have been talking about a lot of our business, customer led. But just like I think Jeff is asking about the apply-now activate-later the next-gen digital watermark, the CoEs get it. And they get it immediately and there is a lot of excitement.\n\nJeff Bernstein: Okay. And just to understand from kind of a real-world example. So, you could have a packaging bar who has been discussing Digimarc watermarked packaging and the interaction that that allows with people who then is going back to say, oh, and by the way, the Digimarc's ability to track all of this in a cloud-based database means that we can now also intercept when somebody has interacted online relative to some offer that you made or relative to something on social media, etcetera, etcetera. And we can wrap that into a complete view of how the person interacted, not just with the package, but with your other advertising or promotional messages.\n\nRiley McCormack: Kind of, but really, so two things, right. The two partners that most get this are the pre-media/printing partners, right. And this is where customers are coming to them and saying, hey, how do we apply with Sunrise 2027, you are the packaging expert or hey, we want to put a QR code on our packaging for consumer engagement, right. Up until now, they are like, right, we can put a QR code on and do this stuff. They didn't have the technical back-end or the expertise or the technology to say, I am so glad you asked us about that. Let's talk about how we are going to apply this, not just to your physical packaging, but also for all your owned multimedia. Let's have a broader conversation where we are not just talking about packaging, which tends to be a competitive industry, right, on fair purpose. Let us talk about this whole thing we can offer even in the digital domain. And that makes their end customers a lot stickier because now they are not just coming to procure articles in a packing, they are coming to them to solve a bigger - to get what they wanted to do with QR codes, whether it is a direct consumer channel, but across both the packaging but also the internet. The other big area of partners are the advertising agencies, right. So, these advertising agencies are in charge of coming up with campaigns and one of the things we can offer is not just stickier customers or a chance to reach out, they also can monetize and build a campaign. We don't want to be in the content creation business of putting together this - I mean some of these campaigns are seven figures because they are incredibly complex and beautiful and detailed, and you have seen the quality of ads, like its super pulse, right. That's not an area that we want to get into. But now they, as an advertising agency, can say, hey, I know we have been talking about a certain campaign. Can you imagine if we not - if we brought your physical products and not just the internet into this or vice versa, if we actually could bring in the internet to your physical - what you plan to do in the physical world, maybe it's bus stops, maybe it's on a store - point of sales in the store. And not only can you follow the consumer and tell them, as you - as we are rolling out this campaign, you can hit them in both the physical and digital domain. You can also get the data back. And that is the most powerful point is that, the old adage in advertising is that half your advertising dollars are wasted, you just don't know which half. What people advertise because they want to get consumers to buy things, that is the reason advertising exists. And now you can actually run campaigns, whether they are email campaigns or internet campaigns and say, yes, it wasn't just engagement or open rakes. I know which one of these campaigns led to somebody interacting with the physical product within, pick-your-favorite time, 48 hours. It's a holy grail. And it can - the same way that advertising became so much more effective with the advent of online, the next wave is, okay, now that you have online, how do you tie online activity to physical behavior, that's the holy grail. Advertising spends about to get an impression...\n\nOperator: There are no further questions at this time.

(NASDAQ:AXTI), a leading developer of compound semiconductor substrates, reported a strong start to 2024 with increased revenues and optimistic projections for the second quarter. The company's first-quarter revenue rose to $22.7 million, up from the previous quarter's $20.4 million and the prior year's $19.4 million.\n\nGrowth was particularly noted in indium phosphide and gallium phosphide applications, while germanium substrate demand showed signs of recovery. AXT expects second-quarter revenues to be between $25.5 million and $27.5 million, despite anticipating a non-GAAP net loss per share of $0.03 to $0.05.\n\nAXT's first-quarter performance and forward-looking statements reflect a company navigating the semiconductor market's challenges while capitalizing on emerging opportunities in AI and data center markets. With plans to attend the Northland Security Growth Conference, AXT is actively seeking to engage with investors and industry partners to discuss its strategy and growth potential.\n\nAXT, Inc. (ticker: AXTI) has shown a remarkable performance in the stock market, with InvestingPro data revealing a 20.79% return over the last week and an impressive 59.13% price total return over the last six months. The company's stock has been buoyed by strong returns, gaining 48.18% over the last three months and 52.5% year-to-date as of 2024.\n\nInvestingPro Tips suggest that AXTI has been experiencing high price volatility, which could be an important consideration for investors looking for both growth opportunities and those wary of market fluctuations. Analysts also anticipate sales growth in the current year, aligning with the company's optimistic revenue projections for the second quarter.\n\nStill, it is important to note that analysts do not anticipate the company to be profitable this year, and AXTI has not been profitable over the last twelve months. This is reflected in the adjusted P/E ratio of -9.39, indicating that the market has priced the stock with expectations of future earnings growth to offset current losses. The company's gross profit margin stands at 18.09% for the last twelve months as of Q1 2024, underscoring the challenges it faces in maintaining profitability.\n\nFor those interested in deeper analysis, there are 11 additional InvestingPro Tips available for AXTI, which can be found at: https://www.investing.com/pro/AXTI.

This conference call will be available on our website at axt.com through May 2, 2025. Also before we begin, I want to note that shortly following the close of market today, we issued a press release reporting financial results for the first quarter of 2024. This information is available on the Investor Relations portion of our website at axt.com. I would now like to turn the call over to Gary Fischer for a review of our first quarter 2024 results. Gary?\n\nGary Fischer: Thank you, Leslie, and good afternoon to everyone. Revenue for the first quarter of 2024 was $22.7 million. That's up from $20.4 million in the fourth quarter of 2023 and up from $19.4 million in the first quarter of 2023. To break down our Q1 204 revenue for you by product category, Indium phosphide increased sequentially to $8.1 million. That's reflecting strong growth from data center applications, including AI and continued improvement in passive optical networks, Gallium our side also grew to $7.5 million with broad-based improvement across a number of applications. Germanium substrates were $1.4 million, up from the prior quarter with renewed strength in demand for satellite solar cells. Finally, as expected, revenue from our consolidated raw material joint venture companies in Q1 was $5.8 million, down from Q4 as we consumed a greater portion of their output for our growing substrate demand. In the first quarter of 2024, revenue from Asia Pacific was 79%, Europe was 16%, and North America was 5%. The top 5 customers generated approximately 33% of total revenue and 1 customer was over the 10% level. Non-GAAP gross margin in the first quarter was 27.3% compared with 23.2% in Q4 and 26.9% in Q1 of 2023. For those who prefer to track results on a GAAP basis, gross margin in the first quarter was 26.9% compared with 22.6% in Q4 and 26.3% in Q1. Beyond the near-term, we remain confident that we can get back to the mid-30% range as the environment strengthens through higher overall volume, favorable product mix and the benefits of our recycling programs, along with continued efficiency improvements throughout our business. Moving to operating expense. Total non-GAAP operating expense in Q1 was $8.7 million compared with $7.5 million in Q4 of 2023 and $8.7 million in Q1 of 2023. On a GAAP basis, total operating expense in Q1 was $9.4 million compared with $8.2 million in Q4 and down from $9.5 million in Q1 of 2023. As you've seen from our quarterly run rate in 2023, we had put in a number of constraints in place for OpEx to align with market conditions as things are beginning to trend up, we're loosening up some of these constraints, which has brought OpEx up from the previous run rates. We do expect to hold it at approximately this level throughout the rest of this year. Our non-GAAP operating loss for the first quarter of 2024 was $2.5 million compared with a non-GAAP operating loss in Q4 2023 of $2.7 million and a non-GAAP operating loss of $3.5 million in Q1 of 2023. For reference, our GAAP operating line for the first quarter of 2024 was a loss of $3.3 million compared with an operating loss of $3.6 million in Q4 and an operating loss of $4.4 million in Q1. Nonoperating other income and expense and other items below the operating line for the first quarter in 2024 was a net gain of $1.3 million. The details can be seen in the P&L included in our press release today. For Q1 2024, we had a non-GAAP net loss of $1.3 million or $0.03 per share compared with non-GAAP net loss of $2.8 million or $0.07 per share in the fourth quarter and non-GAAP net loss in Q1 of 2022 was $2.4 million or $0.06 per share. On a GAAP basis, net loss in Q1 was $2.1 million or $0.05 per share. By comparison, net loss was $3.6 million or $0.09 per share in the fourth quarter and GAAP net loss in Q1 of 2023 was $3.3 million or $0.08 per share. The weighted average basic shares outstanding in Q1 of 2024 was 43.0 million shares. Cash and cash equivalents and investments were $41.3 million as of March 31. By comparison at December 31, it was 52.3%. Cash is down for 2 main reasons. First, our revenue billings tended to be back-end loaded in the first quarter as most of China shuts down for Chinese New Year. As a result, Q1 and Q1 accounts receivable increased by $6.1 million. This is simply a timing issue as most of that cash can be collected in Q2. The second reason for the decline in cash in Q1 was CapEx spending of $5.7 million. This is not new commitments to facilities. This was work done in 2023 and for which payment was due in Q1. As we look to the balance of the year, we expect CapEx to be in the $2 million to $3 million range quarter per quarter, most of which goes towards facilities work, which was done in 2023. One more note on cash. From time-to-time, we have had outside parties approach us with an interest to invest in our supply chain companies. Currently, interest in China is growing, perhaps related to the change in the economic circumstances in China. We believe that there is real value in these assets to be unlocked and may consider monetizing a portion of them this year. As a reminder, we now have over 10 companies in our supply chain where we have partial ownership shared with industry partners. Depreciation and amortization in the first quarter was $2.2 million. Total stock comp was $800,000. Net inventory was down $600,000 in the first quarter. This includes inventory added through our recycling program. 33% of the inventory is raw materials and WIP was 63%, finished goods makes up approximately 4%. The increase in WIP is primarily the result of increased crystal growth in anticipation of higher demand in Q2. With improving demand, we hope to bring our total inventory down by approximately $10 million over the year. Okay. This concludes our discussion of our quarterly financial results. Turning to our plan to list our subsidiary, Tong May in China on the Star market in Shanghai. We now believe that we have had some significant developments on the issue that the CSRC previously raised, and we believe the likely next step is that the CSRC can resume consideration of our application. As we've said, this is a lengthy process, but we continue to believe that Tongmei is an excellent candidate for listing. With that, I'll now turn the call over to Dr. Morris Young for a review of our business and markets.\n\nMorris Young: Thank you, Gary. We believe our business is on a firm path to recovery, as evidenced by the continued growth in our business and solid execution, which allowed us to exceed our Q1 revenue and profitability pace. In the first quarter, we achieved 11% sequential growth in our revenues and 29% sequential improvement in our non-GAAP net income. While certain parts of the demand environment remains somewhat soft, all three of our substrate product line showed improvement, including a 48% growth in time phosphide revenue from Q4. Looking individually at these product lines. Indium phosphide once again became our biggest selling material in Q1. Sales was driven by continued recovery in the power market and a meaningful increase in demand related to AI. We review AI as an exciting catalyst for Indium phosphide in the years to come. As AI requires high-speed lasers and detectors for rapid data transfer with increased bandwidth, low attenuation and low distortion. Today, AI applications are primarily oxide pixels, which require a relatively small amount of substrate material. But as the industry moves to 800 gig and then 1.6 terabyte speed, we expect that there will be a necessary transition to indium phosphide. We are already seeing development work happening today with next-generation silicon photonics devices and electro-absorption modulated laser or EML for high-speed data center transceivers. Revenue from these applications contributed to our strong indium phosphide growth in Q1 and will help drive our expected growth in 2024. Our gallium phosphide revenue grew 24% sequentially in Q1, reflecting increased demand across a broad base of applications, including power amplifiers, HPT applications for wireless our switches, high-power lasers and LEDs. We believe much of the excess inventory in the supply chain has been decided, and we are benefiting from a desire among our customers to diversify their supply base as the market recovers. For example, today, our share of the HPT market is relatively small, but we believe we have a great opportunity to increase our market share over time and are pleased with early customer traction. In addition, our 8-inch gallium site development efforts have led to a groundbreaking advancements in both of our defect densities and yields. We believe this innovation can be applied to our 6-inch gallium state products, allowing us to further enhance our competitiveness across all of our market research. In germanium substrate, demand for satellite solar cells were down substantially throughout 2023, is now beginning to recover. Sales increased 25% in Q1 over the prior quarter with renewed strength in Europe and Asia. And finally, coming off three quarters of strong sales in our raw material business as well as contribution from our recycling efforts sales from our raw material business declined as we expected in Q1. This decline was primarily the result of our consuming a greater portion of the output from our consolidated joint venture as our substrate business has strengthened. In total, our portfolio joint venture companies continues to be a strategic value to our business, providing money of the critical material we use to make our products and allowing us to benefit from the cost and efficiency advantages. Now in closing, we are optimistic about the coming year and the growth and expansion of our business. We are seeing tangible signs of recovery across all of our product lines with new catalysts such as AI, providing strong incremental opportunity. We've worked hard over the last two years to pave the way for an exciting future by providing world-class products for a highly dynamic technology landscape, elevating our own business practices to meet the requirements of Tier 1 customers, delivering breakthrough innovations in the development of large diameter gallium arsenide and indium phosphide substrates and executing on a recycling program that both advances our ESG commitments and improves our cost structure. We remain status focused on business efficiency and accelerating our return to profitability. With that, I will turn the call back to Gary for our second quarter guidance. Gary?\n\nGary Fischer: Thank you, Morris. In keeping with our comments today, we expect Q2 revenue to be between $25.5 million and $27.5 million. We expect our non-GAAP net loss will be in the range of $0.03 to $0.05, and GAAP net loss will be in the range of $0.05 to $0.07. Share count will be approximately 43.0 million shares. Okay. Well, this concludes our prepared comments. Morris and I will be glad to answer your questions now. John, can you take it back?\n\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from the line of Charles Shi from Needham. Please go ahead.\n\nCharles Shi: Hi, Morris. Gary, congrats on the good Q1 results and very happy about Q2 guidance. I want to start with the AI really related question. The indium phosphide, I think that last time when we speak -- when we spoke about this, you were talking about semi-insulating indium phosphide wafers potentially being used for some of the high-speed detectors application. But in your prepared remarks, it sounds like you are getting a little bit more upbeat about the high-speed laser type of applications for 800 gig, 1.6 tera those kind of applications for the next-generation EML et cetera. So can you provide us a little bit of update your engagement on these AI applications so far? Do you -- when do you see the laser application will start to contribute some meaningful revenues for the indium phosphide business?\n\nMorris Young: Charles, first of all, the order we received one customer specifically told us is for us for AI, and that was from selling germanium phosphide. And the fact that we're guessing if it was for detectors, it was a guess, okay? Because usually, indium phosphide good semi-insulating either for electronic applications or for high-speed detectors. However, recently in the industry, we also heard some of the EMLs require semi-insulating substrates. So this -- whether it's for lasers or for detectors, we all know from what we are making, the customer demand for our product is sort of a slight change from silicon do -- I mean sulfate semiconducting substrates, usually good for lasers. And now it's for semi-insulating in of the indium phosphide, but whether it's detectors or lasers, it's a an insulate estimate. We don't really know. I'm sorry. But we do hear from our customer, it's for a pretty large AI customer.\n\nCharles Shi: Got it. Thanks. Well, Morris, thanks for the color you provide. I guess it's something we will continue to chat. And obviously, we don't want to dig more if there's something about your customer you don't want to share. So maybe a second question, maybe for Gary, I think in your prepared remarks, you talked a little bit more about the SAR listing. It sounds like you're making some progress on that front. Can you kind of provide a little bit more color in terms of what kind of progress exactly? And give us a little bit better sense about why you think it's moving forward a little bit more at this time.\n\nGary Fischer: So the process of communication with Shanghai Stock Exchange a CSRC is such that once we send in our applications, they will continue to ask questions. They want us to clarify a few things. And there are things which that they express, they have concerns with and we provide them with answers. And we think we made some good progress on the questions they have. And so now we think we are ready to go through the next step, which is go through their review process again, and they will then look at our whole application and either continue to ask questions or improve -- approve...\n\nCharles Shi: All right, thanks for the update. Okay, that's all from me for now. Thanks so much and congrats again on the results and guide.\n\nOperator: Yes. The next question comes from the line of Richard Shannon from Craig-Hallum. Please go ahead.\n\nRichard Shannon: Well, hi, guys. Thanks for taking my question as well. And congratulations on a really nice guide here. Great to see you. To that point here on the guidance here, I wonder if you could elaborate on a couple of items here, first of all, just trying to understand the relative growth dynamics of each of your four revenue buckets here, I would assume you deposits probably your best growth driver, but wondering if you can kind of rank those and whether you expect them all to be growing sequentially. And then second of all, trying to get a sense of what's implied here for gross margins, given that you said that OpEx could generally be the same in the second quarter as the first. I'm kind of getting a number that's slightly higher than the first quarter, maybe as high as $30 or 30%, but just wondering if I'm doing the right math on that one.\n\nMorris Young: Yes. So let me first try on the business conditions. Actually, the strongest growth we think next quarter is going to come from Gallium phosphide and also germanium. Germanium seems to be very strong and raw material is very strong as well. Indium phosphide actually at this point of the timing that we are projecting flat. And one other thing which is interesting about this business environment right now is that wherever the customer wants something, it's the short -- the lead time is extremely short. I mean, we usually ask the customer to give us at least four weeks lead time because we need to process the wafers and sometimes we even have to grow crystal. So the lead time issue is long. We don't have a standard product for offering. But nowadays, I mean, customers just want two weeks lead time, which is great. However, it's all of prevented from having better visibility. But we can see that gallium phosphide is extremely busy. And indium phosphide right now, as we see now is a flat quarter, but things can change because we still got almost two months to go, given two weeks lead time. We have six weeks to take orders and deliver. And on the margin, Gary?\n\nGary Fischer: Maybe we can do this on a follow-up call, Richard, because it gets kind of complicated and I didn't understand exactly what your model is telling you, but we can work on it with you, so.\n\nRichard Shannon: Okay. Fair enough. Morris, I did want to follow-up on your comment regarding gallium phosphide being your highest growth driver here. To what degree is this maybe some inventory fill in some product areas that were driven down so hard in the last 1.5 years? And then I think you also mentioned some pickup in the wireless/HPT market. So I'm wondering to what degree that's contributing in this quarter.\n\nMorris Young: Well, first of all, I would say gallium phosphide was the first product coming down in terms of revenue, right? I mean, I remember it was the second quarter of 2022, gallium phosphide start to come down. So it takes usually six weeks before all the inventory got depleted. So now it's coming back. So because indium phosphide takes, I think, three longer weeks before it start to come down. Three, yes, three quarters, too. So I expect indium phosphide perhaps not to recover as quickly as gallium phosphide. Although the pickup of indium phosphide last quarter, I attribute that to the new business on AI and because I see PAM business is doing okay but not really robust. The telecom business is not great. And data center, from what I see, they are still inventory out there. So I think the AI part of the data center, I think, is pulling the demand for us and increase our revenue by, what, 40-some-odd percent 48% from Q4 to Q1. So the -- yes.\n\nRichard Shannon: I didn't mean to interrupt Morris, so please continue.\n\nMorris Young: No, I actually have forgotten what my. So what was another part of your question? Yes.\n\nRichard Shannon: Yes, I think so. But there is an interesting follow-up to those comments here, which is like how much of your Indium phosphide businesses is AI today? It seems like given these kind of growth rates, it's got to be a pretty substantial part now. Can you quantify that in any way?\n\nMorris Young: Well, I think last quarter was significant. I would say, could be as much as 20%, although it's a little bit difficult for us to really nail it because some customers would tell us and some customers don't, okay? But as I said, indium phosphide business is very interesting. I want to encourage analysts to help us to do that analysis. There are two parts of indium phosphide one is semi-insulating and the other semi-conducting. The semi-insulating is usually made for detectors and electronic applications. And the software do semiconducting are usually low EPD and good for lasers, and they are the dominant demand for indium phosphide for many, many years. It's almost like eight-one in favor of semiconducting wafers, okay? But the last two or three quarters, the trend is reversed. There's so much more demand on semi-insulating iron doled wafers. So it's as if the laser just didn't grow or maybe they still got too much inventory. And this new demand of iron doled making either some kind of laser or more likely high-speed detector is growing very strong. So what I'm hoping for is that the sulfide material will recover as the inventory get consumed and will come back again. But this iron actually is a new application will continue its own trajectory of growth.\n\nRichard Shannon: Okay. Very interesting dynamics there. I'm going to ponder that while I ask a couple of other questions here. I guess just a quick one here. You had a 10% customer in the quarter. Can you identify that or at least the sector and whether that they've been a 10% customer in the past.\n\nGary Fischer: Okay. Yes. It's a historically long-term customer for us that does EPPE. And we don't know for sure where that was going. But actually, we do know, but we can't say I'm not going to lie to you.\n\nRichard Shannon: Okay. Fair enough, Gary. Maybe just a couple of last questions here, and I'll ask both of you to put on your long-term lenses here, or I guess we'll call it a medium-term lens here. But just kind of wanted to conjecture on the opportunity for getting back to breakeven level by the end of this year or early next year? And maybe just as a reminder what that model looks like in terms of revenues and gross margins.\n\nGary Fischer: Well, we certainly think that it's a reasonable target and goal to do that maybe this year. So we're not giving up on it.\n\nMorris Young: I would say it's this year. Yes. So...\n\nGary Fischer: Yes. It's probably somewhere between $28 million and $30 million a quarter, and we would need to get the gross margins to go up maybe close to 28% and keep the OpEx somewhere around 9.3%, 9.4%. That's GAAP and OpEx, by the way. So...\n\nMorris Young: And I think we do need some help from indium phosphide. I mean right now indium phosphide is only 50% of what we used to do at a peak.\n\nGary Fischer: Yes. I mean that's probably the wildcard. And it's -- I would say that the indium phosphide surge, especially since it's centered in the artificial intelligence area, it's happening sooner than we expected. We thought it would -- we believe early on it was going to happen, but it's happening sooner. So the question is what's going to happen in the next two or three quarters. But it's a tremendous opportunity, and there's billions and billions of dollars that are being invested in the hardware side of AI and the software side. So -- and of course, we play in the hardware side. So it's pretty amazing what's on the horizon. So...\n\nRichard Shannon: Okay. One last question, I'll jump on the line here, guys. The short report that came out on your stock early last month, I think, is -- I think we've established pretty well, there's a bunch of Malarky for the most part. But it does bring up an interesting topic that I think it would be very interesting for you to address. And I think it's risk that a lot of investors bring up with me. And that is related to the STAR listing and the investment by private equity investors. And if there's any rejection of the application for whatever reason here, what's the risk? And how do you get around the risk of having to repay that money and then find other ways to finance the company.\n\nGary Fischer: Well, as long as we're in the process they have no right for redemption. And equally important, they don't want to be redeemed. I mean the last thing they want is their money back. And so they're very willing to be patient and that work with us. And it's everyone was disappointed that it's taken longer than we all expected. But...\n\nMorris Young: So let me try to help out a little bit here, Gary. Look, I think -- I mean, hard assets and doing manufacturing semiconductor or materials job industry is hot in demand in China. And that is showing up in the fact that we have other investors interested in acquiring a minority share of our other joint ventures, okay. So although the IPO takes longer than we thought it is. But I think our assets in China are highly valuable. I think the psychology or the thinking from a Chinese investor point of view, the money no longer can go into real estate to invest and doing materials and doing manufacturing and the real fundamental business manufacturing is highly desirable. So if we don't, for whatever reason, we don't go IPO, I would say one possibility is inviting other customers -- I mean, investors investing into our joint ventures. And we have several of them, which are highly valuable. I mean, of course, the most valuable is Toma manufacturing substrates, and we have the world ranking leadership in those fields, although they are smaller, but nevertheless, it's highly desirable. But because we're going public in China, so we cannot separate them and then invite investor into the main body of the investment to me. But for our joint ventures, we can certainly get other investors investing in those joint ventures.\n\nGary Fischer: Yes, let me give you -- we have talked about this internally. So, we're not worried about it. But as I said, the PE companies want us to go public. They don't want to pull out. So these equity -- private equity investors are all large and premier institutions, each with an investment of just under $5 million, which represents a relatively small part of their respective portfolios. And so far, since they have to be patient no matter what, they're being patient. So and another thing that's probably interesting to note is that they don't have any recourse or their investment is not collateralized. So that's why they needed to succeed. So -- and we made some significant progress and some developments that we really can't give any details, but some very good steps were taken in the recent quarter, which continues to sustain our hope regarding the IPO.\n\nRichard Shannon: Well, great I appreciate all that detail I think a lot of investors wanted to hear that, and I think that's a great response. So appreciate the time, guys. That's all for me.\n\nOperator: The next question comes from the line of Tim Savageaux from Northland Securities. Please go ahead.\n\nTim Savageaux: Hi. Good afternoon, and congrats on both the results and the outlook and especially the growth in indium phosphide. And I think there was a mention of kind of peak levels that you had achieved in indium phosphide. I think that's getting up towards $20 million a quarter, maybe $1 million -- but at that point, you also had some additional consumer business. And I guess my question is as you look at it now, the market opportunity you're seeing, do you think this AI kind of optical data center opportunity can move you back toward peak indium phosphide levels by itself? And I have a follow-up.\n\nMorris Young: That's a good question. I -- the customer who use our product for consumer products at the time -- I mean, they still have one product using it for consumer product, by the way. They didn't go all completely, and we are believe a big dominant supplier for that product. And we are also in negotiation and in qualification for yet other product although I don't know what's the launch time and whatnot. And the other thing is that talking to their engineers, at one time, they told us they have 11 projects centered around using indium phosphide in their consumer product devices. So I don't think I'm giving that up, but indium phosphide just has so many different characteristics such as fire infrared and using as a detector, et cetera, et cetera. So it's unique in its place to be used as a technology device. Whereas AI application, I think it's an extension of what people use it for data center. If you want high bandwidth, high-speed data transfer, low attenuation, I mean that's the perfect choice. And if you have AI, that means you've got to access data much in 100, 1,000 times, even 10,000 times, and you have so many more data center, you want to exchange information. What's the best way to transfer that information, it's no banner. It has to be some kind of an optical device to transfer that data. So I think it's difficult for me to say when it's going to be so strong and so how big but whether it's going to rival to the consumer product. But I think both of them do need indium phosphide...\n\nGary Fischer: Yes, when Morris said optical, that means it's got to have the indium phosphide because the wavelengths can be read by indium phosphide -- so -- but yes, we believe we will get back to those levels, Tim. As Morris says, we're not sure on the timing. And it very well could get back to that level sooner than we thought because of AI. Six months ago, we didn't have this kind of expectation. I don't know for the people listening to it. I think last week, there was really an amazing article in the New York Times about the amount of money invested in AI in Q1 of this year, and it was, I think, $32 billion. And that's not just software, that's hardware, too. So it's data center stuff. So I mean, we've all been around a long time and so we've seen stuff, but I was very amazed by that. And I sent it to Morris and Leslie, I said it to our Board of Directors because that's going to -- we know we're at the bottom of the food chain or the end of the train, but that's going to benefit any phosphide substrates. And so the dream or the hope is that the consumer comes back and it competes against AI for who's going to be the biggest contributor to indium phosphide revenue. And we don't need a miracle for that to happen. I think it's a very reasonable goal.\n\nTim Savageaux: Got it. And I want to ask a little bit more about the improvement or the pretty dramatic growth that you saw in Q1 in indium phosphide. And you've already talked about -- you have a unique perspective kind of in the ecosystem. And maybe I'm going to ask you to guess a little bit more here. But I guess my question is around the breadth and how you could characterize that strength. Obviously, you can sell to a lot of different folks in this arena, whether it's Epiwafer suppliers or vertically integrated laser manufacturers or module manufacturers. And I think you've done business with all of those types of guys. And so whether it's looking at the type of customers or looking at wafer sizes, what does that tell you about the breadth of demand that you see as the -- historically, you've had a couple of major customers on the data center side? Or can you see to the extent new customers are showing up? Or are there a couple of customers really moving the needle for you when you see this extraordinary growth in Q1?\n\nMorris Young: The Q1 customer actually is new. I mean they are a customer on other products. But for that application for AI was new. And they're telling us their customer, but I can't repeat it. It's a big, big customer.\n\nGary Fischer: Well, there's a -- we know the players, right? There's Meta (NASDAQ:META), there's Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL), there's Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), all of those data centers are going to -- where indium phosphide is going to have a play is rack to rack, rack to the aggregation point within the data center and then the aggregation point to a different data center. All of that needs high speed. If you think of the data that's computed in AI then you've got to transfer it and move it around in order to get an end result. And so within the rack, we don't think they'll go to AI to indium phosphide. But rack to rack and beyond, that's where indium-phosphide has a definite application. So...\n\nMorris Young: Of course, Gary, you're not saying anything different. Why is it AI, data set are already doing this. But it's just that data center has to get so busy talking to each other and exchange information a thousand times or 10,000 times that requires higher speed highway. That is where the indium phosphate come in.\n\nGary Fischer: The other thing that one of our marketing guys taught me is that some of the large data centers are now having a shortage of power of electricity to run the thing. So they're downsizing in the future architecture to smaller -- more data centers that are smaller but are spread around, and that's going to benefit us. So...\n\nTim Savageaux: Got it. Well, okay, it sounds like there was sort of a big customer helping to drive that growth in Q1. And sort of the rest of the color I was looking for. I know there's only so much you can say. But clearly, you're at the substrate level, you've got an Epiwafer supplier who maybe selling into a module manufacturer. I mean I imagine that you're maybe not all the way up to the cloud provider level, but you have customer touch points all along that ecosystem. And I was just looking for as you see the pieces move around what you're seeing in terms of opportunity at any of those levels, right, whether it's going directly to a chip supplier, obviously, you used to do a lot of business with Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) and their module assets are over at Jabil now. Are you seeing sort of different customers kind of show up at different parts of the food chain, I guess, in driving this AI growth.\n\nMorris Young: Not yet. In fact, I think if I mean we have some China customer, which is showing up -- taking a lot of wafer as well, but they're not telling us anything. I mean I think the customer base seems to be shifting somewhat before these things all happen to consumer product that sort of win way. And then there was a data center that you were talking about, which was taking a lot of wafer, they are not prime customers at the table right now. There is a new Chinese customer coming in, but we don't know where that is coming from. And this new customer is taking this as leading in the phosphide and we know they're telling us it's going to AI. But I wish I can see that's the second one, the third one coming in, that would be great.\n\nGary Fischer: We think we understand the architectural needs well enough that there's little doubt in our mind, there's no doubt, frankly, that we're going to end up benefiting and getting into multiple data centers along the big names that I just ran off. So...\n\nOperator: The next question comes from the line of Danny Cheng from B. Riley Securities. Please go ahead.\n\nDanny Cheng: Good afternoon. My first question is actually on gallium arsenide. So you're expecting that to be the main driver from first quarter to second quarter. Just wondering if there any applications or customers kind of driving this strong growth?\n\nMorris Young: LED is strong for automobile. Lasers is strong, but not as high as at the peak. I would say it's about 50% of the peak level. Automobile is probably 70%, 80% of the peak and HPT is a new, I believe, opportunity for us, and we're trying very hard to get ourselves back into it. And if we are successful, we can expect more revenue growth for HPT as well. And the China market seems to be fairly strong in gallium arsenide.\n\nDanny Cheng: Got it. And just wondering how sustainable your expectation is on gallium arsenide, I mean are we talking just a few quarters or kind of a multiyear cycle.\n\nMorris Young: I can guarantee multiyear. I would say we have probably good visibility, at least to Q3. I mean demand is strong. But as you know that I do worry about the world economy. I mean, I think -- but then people are saying there's a recession, but it never come, right? It's -- I mean...\n\nGary Fischer: Yes, most of our cycles are more than one quarter. So Gallium arsenide is more robust than we expected it to be, but we're not thinking like, oh, then it's going to drop back down in July. So...\n\nDanny Cheng: Got it. And then just on indium phosphide for AI applications. Is there any data on market share? How big that is and the market share between you versus competitors?\n\nGary Fischer: No, we don't know. There is some public projections on markets that coherent shared publicly in one of their presentations. If you haven't seen that, you might want to take a look because there's some stuff in there that might give you some information. So...\n\nDanny Cheng: But just on the market share. I mean, you think -- should we expect maybe one-third each for you and your competitors or somebody has a dominant market share -- just for -- on the AI. Any color on that?\n\nMorris Young: The customer we have, I think, they are giving us all the order, but I don't know whether our competitor is taking order from a different customer okay? In other words, the order we got, we know we got 100% of that order from that customer. And they told us it's for AI. But I don't know whether our competitors are serving yet down the channel.\n\nOperator: The next question comes from the line of Matt Bryson from Wedbush Securities. Please go ahead.\n\nMatt Bryson: Hey thanks for taking my questions. On the HPT side of things, if you're successful in getting traction, any idea of what the size of that opportunity might be?\n\nMorris Young: Say it again, I didn't hear. The expected value...\n\nMatt Bryson: How big is the HBT market -- what could that look like on a quarterly or annual revenue run rate, assuming you're successful in getting traction in that market?\n\nGary Fischer: Okay. I would say close to $20 million a year.\n\nMatt Bryson: Got it. So that's a nice big round number. Similarly, or slightly different question. I think a lot of the focus on indium phosphide has been around the AI opportunity. But do you have any sense of how close to the point where inventory is normalized, we are? Like is that two, three quarters out? Is it a year out? And then any idea in terms of how much revenue you think you're losing because there's inventory out there right now? Or what might your revenue look like if that inventory didn't exist, any thoughts?\n\nMorris Young: Yes. I think right now, it's very difficult for me to estimate because I don't even know whether they are in full production or not, although the amount of substrate are buying doesn't look like it's pilot. I think they're making something. But we haven't seen -- I mean, the first thing I'd like to see is, I mean, the last order was at three months. If they give us other six months order, if they're increasing, then I can estimate and better yet is if there's a second customer sort of coming and wants the same thing, and that's even better. At this point...\n\nMatt Bryson: And sorry to interrupt Morris. So I'm actually -- I'm asking on kind of that traditional indium phosphide business, like where you know you have inventory kicking around in the supply chain. If you have any idea, so not so much the AI side, but the traditional business, if you have any idea like how -- what the impact on your revenue is today, how much it's holding it off? And then any thoughts on when that inventory might get worked out, and you might resume normal revenue run rate on that older business.\n\nMorris Young: I think that's -- because the business is right now just beginning, it's hard for me to tell. But I mean, I think we have the capacity. We can definitely make 3 times to 5 times what they are ordering now or even 10 times if giving us a little bit of time to increase our facility. So I think the volume is no problem. And I think our product quality really fits well with what they wanted. So at this point, it's I think -- I don't know whether I'm answering a question or not. I think I'm excited about it, and we're trying to get as much information as we can. And we know the customer and customer which is large, I don't think they're pulling around. So hopefully be coming back with increased order or somebody else is going to come in following their lead, please. So I think that's diversion.\n\nGary Fischer: Yes. I've had some of these conversations with our marketing guys. And I think they expect that we're going to continue to work through the inventory into the second-half of this year.\n\nGary Fischer: Data center Inventory. Yes. So that's what I was referring to. So -- there's still some out there. But...\n\nMatt Bryson: You're getting cleared out and then restoring normal levels, that's probably a -- an early 2025 type phenomenon as you're thinking right now?\n\nGary Fischer: Yes, maybe Q4 of this year, but definitely in 2025. So it's going to happen. So we can't wait. We're so excited about it.\n\nMatt Bryson: Yes. I guess last one for me, Gary. I completely understand that customers don't want to hold inventory. And so they're putting in rush orders, which makes it hard on your end to clear out your inventory because you don't want to turn down business. But I guess given that environment, how confident are you can take down inventory by $10 million? Or what are the dynamics involved in that where you're not effectively having a turn down business because you can't meet those rush orders?\n\nGary Fischer: Well, I wanted to take it down $10 million last year in -- it came down last year, but not as much as our target. However, I have a couple of reasons that I think it's a realistic target. One is, if you look back at our historical inventory levels compared to our revenue run rate levels, it was the inventory was in the $60 million level range, $65 million level range. So the difference is we have more inventory in the consolidated joint ventures now because they have different added product lines and things like that. And our recycling program, which is good, it helps us on gross margin and it helps us with ESG, but you're converting what I would call scraps of materials or slurry, which has a little or no book value, and then you bring it in at standard cost. So your inventory goes up. So it's counterintuitive. But even so, I'm absolutely convinced we can take money out of the inventory. Is it going to be $10 million? That's my target. And if revenue grows for us, then it makes it a little easier to take the inventory down. So yes, I don't need a miracle to have that happen. I just need some good business decisions, and if it was easier, frankly, when I could go to China because I would hold inventory review meetings and I haven't been there for a while because of the COVID thing, but I'm going to go this year. So we're getting back in that cycle. But it's a good question. So thanks.\n\nMatt Bryson: Awesome. Thanks for taking the question.\n\nOperator: As there are no further questions at the queue this time, this concludes our Q&A session. I would like to turn the call over back to Dr. Morris Young for closing remarks.\n\nMorris Young: Thank you for participating in our conference call. This quarter we will participate in the Northland Security Growth Conference until June 25, and I hope to see you there. As always, please feel free to contact me, Gary Fischer or Leslie Green, if you would like to set up a call with us. We look forward to speaking with you in the near future.\n\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call.

We undertake no obligation to update these statements to reflect circumstances or events that occur after the date the forward-looking statements are made. I would now like to turn the call over to Andy Nemeth.\n\nAndy Nemeth: Thank you, Steve. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us on the call today. As we finished the first quarter of the 2024 fiscal year Patrick remains in a position of strength, as a result of the work our team has put in day in and day out and the strong performance and results that we have generated, while diligently managing our business and balance sheet. Our success would not be possible without the dedication of our incredible team members, and I thank them for their tremendous efforts and focus. Our family of trusted, independent brands building better component solutions is guiding our model as we strive to be the supplier of choice in the outdoor enthusiast and housing markets. Our accretive growth strategy has evolved over the years through our team's relentless pursuit of great customer service and building innovative high-quality product solutions. We have become a key supplier to RV, marine, manufactured housing, and now Powersports OEMs alike, and we believe our ability to scale and adapt to our customers' needs is unmatched. As we have further refined our business objectives, we identified and executed on the appeal of a more diversified end market ecosystem, which is proving resilient, especially in these uncertain market conditions. Our first quarter acquisition of Sportech further solidifies the foundation in the Powersports industry and serves as another platform for future strategic and organic growth. We are excited by the promising potential in this space, particularly in the utility side-by-side segment on which Sportech focuses. The Sportech acquisition brings in a team aligned with our purpose as passionate outdoor enthusiasts dedicated to creating highly engineered, innovative products in close partnership with our valued OEM customers. We are thrilled with the initiatives that Patrick and Sportech teams have already set in motion and the future growth potential we see ahead of us. Examples of our drive to immediately deliver synergies post-closing involves our team at Rockford Fosgate hosting Sportech to showcase the benefits of being connected to the Patrick ecosystem. And how our businesses are able to collaboratively leverage their processes and expertise, bringing additional value to their respective customers. We also invited our key plastics, metals, and harness and dash businesses to Sportech for a brainstorming session, including a production line walk-through to identify avenues of opportunity between business units, their best practices, and potential areas for collaboration, including logistics, sourcing and material synergies. While collaboration remains a crucial tenet of our success through our business model, we strive to maintain each business' individuality and passion as they drive forward, keeping the entrepreneurial spirit alive. We believe this strategy is key to our future success and empowers our businesses and the collective Patrick family to achieve new heights. We continue to seek out entrepreneurial businesses with strong, culturally-aligned leadership teams, solid organic growth prospects and accretive margins. Our ability to execute at the operational level at our brands exemplifies our balance sheet and working capital management, for which we also drive accountability. Our team has done a great job of working with our customer partners to manage our inventories and ensure we also remain focused on delivering strong cash flows, while maintaining a disciplined leverage position. Our inventories are balanced and well maintained, and our leverage position has already improved from just two months ago, following the Sportech acquisition, the largest acquisition in the company's history. Now moving on to our financial results. Our first quarter revenues increased 4% to $933 million. And on a trailing 12-month basis, our consolidated revenues were approximately $3.5 billion. Our net income in the first quarter improved 16% to $35 million, and net income per diluted share was $1.59. Excluding acquisition transaction costs, purchase accounting adjustments, our first quarter adjusted net income was $39 million and adjusted diluted earnings per share grew 31% to $1.79. Our team continues to anticipate and adjust to market and macroeconomic forces through the management of our highly variable cost structure, and our model performed well during a seasonally slow period also as a result of acquisitions completed over the past year, operational efficiencies gained through automation and better throughput and our diversification among other items, as shown by our continued solid margin performance. Excluding acquisition transaction costs, purchase accounting adjustments in both periods, operating margin improved 70 basis points to 7.0% and adjusted EBITDA margin increased to 110 basis points to 11.9% in the quarter. On an administrative level, I'd like to welcome Andy Roeder, our new CFO, who joined us in March. Andy has tremendous experience in the outdoor enthusiast space and brings his impressive skills and expertise into the Patrick family. We're pleased to have Andy on our team supporting our businesses growth objectives, while ensuring our balance sheet and financial foundation remains strong. I'd also like to thank Matt Filer, who filled the interim CFO role with confidence in execution and helped us successfully deliver on our operational and strategic plans. Matt has resumed his role as Senior Vice President of Finance, and we look forward to his continued contributions. I'll now turn the call over to Jeff, who will highlight the quarter and provide more detail on our end markets.\n\nJeffrey Rodino: Thanks, Andy. Good morning, everyone. We continue to experience dynamic conditions across all of our primary end markets. RV and MH trends have improved modestly after reaching what we believe was the bottom of the cycle in 2023. While shipments have improved in the market, interest rates continue to negatively impact demand of our end consumers and dealers across our markets as ownership and online costs remain relatively high. As a reminder, in the outdoor enthusiast space, RV has historically been first market to enter and exit economic cycles and the RV market typically precedes the recovery in marine and Powersports. In the first quarter, RV wholesale shipments have seen some sequential and year-over-year improvement. We except these positive trends to continue in the near-term, give the need for additional inventory and preparation for spring selling season and the coming 2025 model year change. However, the durability of positive trends will depend on retail sell-through. Our first quarter RV revenues increased 15% to $421 million when compared to the same period in 2023 and represented 45% of consolidated revenue. RV content per unit on a TTM basis was $4,859, off by about 9% from the record level we achieved for the first quarter of 2023. On a positive note, RV content per unit on a TTM basis increased sequentially in Q1 of 2024 from Q4 of 2023. According to the RVIA, RV wholesale unit shipments increased 9% to approximately 85,900 units from the first quarter of 2023. We currently estimate first quarter retail registrations were down approximately 14% to an estimated 73,100 units in the quarter. Our estimates further indicate that TTM dealer inventory weeks on hand at the end of Q1 of 2024 have increased by two to three weeks to approximately 20 to 22 weeks as dealers plan for the upcoming selling season. This is well below the historical averages of approximately 26 to 30 weeks. On the marine side of our business, OEMs have remained very disciplined in their production, which will help lessen the response time between inventory sell-through and replenishment in the eventual recovery. We expect to see our marine business bottom out in Q2 and then begin to stabilize in Q3 and into Q4, especially as consumers and dealers await the new model year product. We believe in the long-term durability of the marine industry as outdoor enthusiasts continue to see the appeal of boating and spending time on the water with family and friends. Our first quarter marine revenues were up 35% to $155 million, representing 17% of consolidated sales. This change in sales is in line with our expectations in the quarter, especially when considering our mix towards ski and wake and pontoon. We estimate wholesale powerboat unit shipments declined 34% to approximately 38,400 units from Q1 of 2023 with estimated ski and wake and pontoon unit shipments down approximately 52% and 41%, respectively. We currently estimate first quarter retail powerboat shipments were down approximately 10% to an estimated 31,200 units. Our estimated marine content for wholesale unit on a TTM basis was $4,049 compared to 4,433 in the same period last year. On a sequential basis, our first quarter content was roughly flat compared to the fourth quarter of 2023. It is important to note that in the prior periods, we reported both marine and Powersports revenue in our marine market, impacting both our marine revenue and content per unit. The current and prior-year figures have been recalculated for revenue and content per unit to reflect these adjustments. Our estimates indicate that the TTM dealer inventory weeks on hand at the end of Q1 of 2024 have increased approximately two to three weeks to an estimated 30 to 32 weeks. This is well below the historical average, which we estimate at 36 to 40 weeks on hand. Our housing businesses, both MH and residential site built demonstrated the resilience of our diversified platform and remained steady and performed well despite the headwinds in interest rates as consumers demand for affordable housing remains strong. Multifamily housing continues to experience softness, while single-family housing starts have improved. In Q1, our housing revenue was up 5% to $275 million, representing 29% of consolidated sales, and manufacturing which represents approximately 57% of our housing revenue in the quarter, we increased the content per unit on a TTM basis by 1% to $6,422. We estimate MH wholesale unit shipments increased 13% in the quarter, total residential housing starts for Q1 improved 1%. As we begin reporting on Powersports business, our focus will primarily be on the side-by-side golf cart and motorcycle sectors of the industry, and our market commentary will reflect this focus. Powersports is a broad space. And unlike our other end markets, there is no third-party source for industry-wide data on wholesale shipments. Although, our focus has shifted to side-by-side space, which includes golf carts, following the Sportech acquisition, we have had a presence in side-by-side and motorcycles, primarily through Rockford Fosgate's premium audio offerings. Of course, as we expand our presence in this space, the metrics we track will evolve along with our commentary to more accurately reflect our business within the industry. Ultimately, our intention is to provide business-relevant insight into the markets we serve is then providing an outlook on the broader Powersports industry as a whole. Anecdotally, Powersports dealer inventory levels appear elevated, particularly in the recreation segment. However, on the utility side of the industry, demand appears to be more resilient. This, coupled with Sportech's promising backlog supports our optimism as we move into this year and beyond. The demand for creature comforts like HVAC requires the doors and closure enclosures for tech manufacturers. With the potential to add audio and other high-value product solutions we produce down the road, both to the OEMs and in the aftermarket. Our Powersport revenues were $83 million in the quarter, which represents 9% of our first quarter 2024 consolidated sales, including approximately two months of Sportech revenue, which outperformed expectations. On the innovation front, our dedicated advanced product group, which we highlighted in the fourth quarter is off and running and remains intensely focused on collaborating with OEM customers, evaluating best-in-class solutions two and three model years out, in the RV, marine and Powersports market. We believe we are well timed with this strategic initiative as OEMs generally focus inward on product design and evolution during periods of softer retail demand. Two examples of our leading innovations as a testament to our progress Patrick's brands won two innovation awards this year at the Discover Boating Miami International Boat Show in February. TACO Marine won an innovation award for their open water internal and collapsible carbon fiber outrigger poles. Their sleek design and increased functionality results in more natural movement of bait in the water. We continue to believe both RV and boating experience can be enhanced through the use of carbon fiber products, which we have launched along with the potential of our outdoor enthusiast market. SeaDek also won an award for their patented lighted SeaDek, which can embed RGB lighting into their products providing additional opportunity for customization in marine flooring and padding. The sliding takes the superior traction of EVA foam decking, coaming pads and step pads, SeaDek is known for to a whole new level of comfort and visual appeal. I'll now turn the call over to Andy Roeder, who will provide additional comments on our financial performance.\n\nAndrew Roeder: Thanks, Jeff, and good morning, everybody. First, I'd like to thank Andy, Jeff, Matt and the rest of the team here for such a warm welcome. I'm thrilled to become part of the Patrick family at such an exciting time, and I'm ready to work with the stellar team here, maintaining our solid financial foundation and supporting Patrick's continued drive toward profitable organic and strategic growth. Now on to our financial results. Our consolidated first quarter net sales increased 4% and to $933 million, driven by 9% growth in RV wholesale shipments, an estimated 13% increase in manufactured housing wholesale shipments and our acquisition of Sportech, which together more than offset the impact of an estimated 34% decrease in marine wholesale powerboat unit shipments. Gross margin increased 30 basis points to 21.9%, which was the result of our strategic diversification, acquisitions, larger mix of higher engineered products and cost reduction initiatives, coupled with our investments in automation and continuous improvement initiatives. The first quarter gross margin includes 10 basis points of non-cash purchase accounting charges from the inventory step-up related to the Sportech acquisition. SG&A expenses increased $3 million or 3% to $85 million in the first quarter of 2024, but decreased 10 basis points as a percent of sales. The year-over-year increase in expense reflects transaction costs related to the Sportech acquisition. Excluding the nonrecurring acquisition transaction costs associated with the Sportech acquisition, SG&A expenses as a percent of sales decreased 60 basis points versus the quarter of 2023. Operating expenses were $146 million in the quarter compared to $138 million last year, primarily due to higher amortization costs and the impact of acquisition-related expenses on SG&A. Operating income grew $3 million to $59 million, while operating margin improved 20 basis points to 6.4%. Excluding acquisition transaction costs and purchase accounting adjustments related to acquisitions, adjusted operating margin improved 70 basis points to 7% in the first quarter. The improvement in operating margin was driven by higher revenue from our RV and housing businesses, coupled with the acquisition of Sportech among other factors previously discussed. These positive factors, while partially offset by the impact of lower marine revenue and higher amortization expense again reflected benefits of our strategic diversification. Net income increased 16% to $35 million, which equates to $1.59 per diluted share. Adjusting for the acquisition transaction costs and purchase accounting adjustments in both periods, adjusted net income improved 29% to $39 million or $1.79 per share. Our reported and adjusted EPS for the first quarter of 2024 include approximately $0.01 per share in additional accounting related dilution from our 2028 convertible notes. We have hedges in place which are expected to reduce or eliminate any potential dilution of the company's common stock upon any conversion of the convertible notes and/or offset any cash payments, that company is required to make in excess of the principal amount of any converted notes. For reporting purposes, these hedges are always anti-dilutive and therefore, cannot be included when reporting earnings per share. Adjusted EBITDA grew 14% to $111 million versus $98 million last year. Adjusted EBITDA margin expanded 110 basis points to 11.9% for the first quarter of 2024. Our overall effective tax rate was 10.6% for the first quarter compared to 20.1% in the prior year. The decrease in the tax rate in the first quarter was due to the tax benefit related to the vesting of share-based awards and the increase in Patrick's stock price. We expect our effective tax rate to be approximately 22% to 23% for the full-year, implying 25% to 26% for the next three quarters. Looking at cash flows. Cash provided by operations for the first three months of 2024 was approximately $35 million compared to an outflow of approximately $1 million in the prior year period, primarily due to working capital management and stronger net income. This quarter, purchases of property, plant and equipment were $15 million, reflecting maintenance CapEx, automation projects and select facility improvements. We remain committed to allocating capital to our automation initiatives as we reinforce innovation, efficiencies and long-term value for our customers and stakeholders. We estimate our 2024 capital expenditures will total $70 million to $80 million. Our goal is a disciplined capital allocation strategy, and we continue to evaluate possible organic growth initiatives, while maintaining a robust acquisition pipeline. We plan to continue to assess these growth initiatives, while maintaining a strong balance sheet with ample liquidity. Our net leverage at the end of the quarter was 2.8x, down from 2.9x on a pro forma basis at the closing of Sportech in January. During the quarter, we generated $20 million of free cash flow. For the trailing 12-month period, we generated $391 million of free cash flow compared to $352 million for the same period last year. At the end of the first quarter, our total net liquidity was $413 million, comprised of $18 million of cash on hand and unused capacity on our revolving credit facility of $395 million. With no major debt maturities until 2027, we continue to have the balance sheet strength, flexibility and liquidity to remain on offense and assess the potential to seize profitable strategic growth opportunities as they arise. We returned $13 million in the form of dividends during the quarter. We will remain opportunistic on share repurchases and have $78 million left authorized under our current plan at the end of the first quarter. Moving on to our end market outlook. We continue to expect the current interest rate environment to negatively impact consumer demand and dealers' willingness to hold inventory during the year. Based on recent trends, we estimate full-year RV wholesale unit shipments will approximate 320,000 to 340,000 units as dealers remain cautious about the carrying cost of inventory in this rate environment. We currently expect full-year RV retail shipments to be down approximately 5% to 10%, implying approximately 350,000 units at the midpoint. In our marine market, we estimate 2024 total industry retail will be down 5% to 10% and wholesale units for our overall product mix will be down 10% to 15%. In our Powersports end market on a pro forma basis, including Sportech, our full-year 2023 revenue was $385 million, and we estimate Powersports unit shipments in our product categories will be flat in 2024. For modeling purposes, we expect to gain organic content in the mid-single digits. On the housing side of our business, we estimate MH wholesale unit shipments will be up 5% to 10% for 2024, with retail sales absorbing available wholesale production on a real-time basis. In our residential housing end market, we estimate 2024 new housing starts will be flat to up 5% versus 2023. Given the current end market outlook we've outlined, we estimate our 2024 operating margin will improve by 30 to 50 basis points on an adjusted basis versus 2023. We estimate our full-year 2024 operating cash flows will be between $390 million and $410 million, implying free cash flow of $310 million or more based on our CapEx estimates. That completes my remarks. We are now ready for questions.\n\nOperator: Thank you. We will now be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. Our first questions come from the line of Mike Swartz with Truist Securities. Please proceed with your question.\n\nMichael Swartz: Hey guys. Good morning. Just maybe starting out on the outlook. I think one of the biggest changes versus maybe what you talked about a couple of months ago was just on the marine side. So maybe, I guess, just frame up from a wholesale shipment perspective, and maybe how you're thinking about the year now versus prior? Is it deeper cuts in first half, second half is kind of unchanged? Or just maybe any guidelines around how you're thinking about that?\n\nAndy Nemeth: Sure, Mike. This is Andy, Andy Nemeth. As we've looked at marine and really looking across the industry sector in total, and we look at our mix of business kind of geared towards higher end and higher engineered product lines with some really strong presentation and concentration in the ski and wake sector as well as the pontoon sector. We just -- we looked at that model, and we're seeing dealers and OEMs alike remain very, very disciplined. And so we felt that it was prudent to kind of pull back just a little bit, especially given what we've seen so far. I think we noted a greater than 50% decline in ski and wake and greater than 40% decline in pontoon in the first quarter. And we just see that discipline continuing through the second quarter, especially when we look at kind of when the new model year is going to come through with some stabilization expected in the back half. So we just pulled things back just a little bit, especially as it relates to our industry-specific concentration.\n\nMichael Swartz: And the thought would be that the rate of decline you saw in some of those key categories in the first quarter, that kind of continues into the second quarter. Is the thought on a year-over-year basis? Or does it get better on a year-over-year basis? Because I think most of the destocking was -- or restocking was done first quarter last year?\n\nAndy Nemeth: Yes. We still think that kind of Q1 run rates are going to continue through Q2 at this point in time. So that's really kind of driving that model.\n\nMichael Swartz: Okay. That's helpful. And then on the -- just on the operating margin outlook for the year, you've reiterated that. Any thoughts on just how that should kind of trend or play out through the year. I think seasonally, the second quarter has the highest margin, and it kind of drops off over that time period over the rest of the year. But given the comments on marine, which is one of your higher margin businesses, would that be expected to look any different this year than maybe years prior?\n\nAndy Nemeth: So we still think we're going to see a sequential margin improvement, and I'm talking quarter over the prior year quarter in each of our quarters for 2024. And our business is well diversified as we've looked at it. Our marine business has a strong margin component, is highly engineered, highly innovative. And so just with some of the -- as we talked about the mix, pulling back that segment a little bit with some of the strength that we've seen offset with our housing business in particular, we just felt like, again, we want to keep it at that 30 to 50 bps of improvement. I think if we see some uptick in the back half as it relates to the kind of that marine business, we would expect to see some margin lift on that. But overall, we feel again pretty consistent that we will see some improvement each quarter over the prior year's quarter in our financials.\n\nMichael Swartz: Okay. That's super helpful. And then just one last one for me quickly. Just the revenue growth, the components of that in the quarter on a year-over-year basis, how much was that, I guess, organic volume, pricing, M&A, all that good stuff?\n\nAndrew Roeder: Sure, Mike. This is Andy Roeder. Good morning. Yes, for Q1, overall industry was down 3%. Acquisition growth was up 5% and organic was up 2%. And that organic is broken down by pricing was down 3% and shared content was up 4%.\n\nOperator: Thank you. Our next questions come from the line of Scott Stember with ROTH MKM. Please proceed with your question.\n\nScott Stember: I imagine that right now, you guys are having discussions on the RV side with the OEMs on where their pricing is going to be looking. Just got off a call this morning with one of the bigger dealers. It sounds like they're not expecting to see a material change in pricing from '24 to '25. What are you guys hearing on your end? And how should we look at that from a content standpoint throughout the balance of the year?\n\nJeffrey Rodino: Yes, Scott, this is Jeff. As we go into the model year, every year, were we go through and price our product appropriately going into the model year. And we've seen a lot of our commodities flatten out. As we've talked in the past, we do pass along pricing on a real-time basis with commodities and where our inventories stand. And we've seen kind of a lot of those flatten out over the fourth quarter and into the first quarter of this year. So there's some up, there's some down. It's kind of, I would say, almost flat. In particular to what you're saying about the dealer earlier thinking they're going to be flat. We're seeing the same from our commodities and the pricing that we're putting out there.\n\nScott Stember: Got it. And then looking into the Powersports side of it, if we could just take a little bit of a deeper dive. I know you've talked about how you guys are pretty much aligned heavily with the side-by-side utility piece. But can you maybe just overall, just trying to get a sense of how much of the Powersports business would be considered mission-critical types of things versus more importantly, maybe just utility, utility or mission-critical. Just trying to get a sense of how this -- we should expect this business to perform in the event that the industry really tapers off a lot this year?\n\nAndy Nemeth: Scott, as we look at Powersports, in particular, in our spread across the Powersports market, which we talked about is going to include the side-by-side utility primarily, golf carts and motorcycles. When you're thinking about utility, we again expect to see -- we're seeing our content rise in that sector on the units that we're going into a market right now that when you look at the recreational side is a little bit down. But as we look at the model overall and the opportunities to continue to drive organic content amongst our product categories and bring solutions to those customers, we expect to continue to be very aggressive on taking market share there and gaining content. So overall, while the market is in a little bit of a volatile place today, if you just look at kind of the recreational versus utility, we're well aligned with utility.\n\nScott Stember: Got it. And then just last question. There was a comment about expectations for operating margin growth this year. Did I hear 50 basis points. I just want to make sure I heard correctly?\n\nOperator: Thank you. Our next questions come from the line of Noah Zatzkin with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please proceed with your questions.\n\nNoah Zatzkin: Hi, thanks for taking my questions. I guess just quick on the RV industry. I noticed you guys kind of ticked down your expectations slightly on the wholesale side. So just wondering relative to a few months ago, what may have led to that? Thanks.\n\nJeffrey Rodino: Yes. Noah, this is Jeff. As we've gotten into 2024, we've seen production rates from the OEMs pretty stable through the first quarter and into the second quarter. We believe that on our model, we were looking at 330 to 350 prior. Interest rate is not going down or at least the Fed saying that they're probably not going to go down as soon as we thought. I think it's going to continue to constrain dealers from wanting to bring inventory in at those higher levels, especially in the second half of the year, where we saw -- thought that maybe with some interest rate relief, we might see a little bit of that. So we just moved to a tick, not too much. We also note that going into the model change, the OEMs are being very, very disciplined with their production levels. So -- and as we get into June, they'll start to ramp down the 2024 production and start to get into the 2025 starting in July. So we see a little bit of falloff there over those -- over that time period. So overall, not much of a change, but we're just being a little bit cautious on it.\n\nNoah Zatzkin: Great. And maybe just kind of two-parter. Maybe if you could just kind of talk about how Sportech's performing relative to your expectations early on as well as kind of appetite for other M&A in the nearer term? Thanks.\n\nAndy Nemeth: Sure, Noah. This is Andy. Sportech is performing better than expectations so far. We're really pleased with not only the team's performance, but the cultural fit, the alignment, the collaboration we're seeing today. As we noted, we're really striving to execute on synergies very, very quickly and see a ton of runway there. So very pleased with Sportech, and it is performing better than expectations. I think as we look at our appetite for acquisitions, as we noted as well, we are in a position of strength from our perspective. We've got a ton of liquidity. We're managing our cash flows extremely well. Our team is extremely disciplined and doing a fabulous job of working with our customers to manage our inventories and be very thoughtful about that. So I would say our appetite, again, is a position of strength and to be on offense, and we are actively looking at the acquisition pipeline, continuing to cultivate acquisitions organically. And again, really prioritizing what could make sense at what point in time, but we are actively looking at acquisitions right now.\n\nNoah Zatzkin: Great. Thank you.\n\nOperator: Thank you. Our next questions come from the line of Tristan Thomas-Martin with BMO Capital Markets. Please proceed with your questions.\n\nTristan Thomas-Martin: Good morning. Can you just talk how RV content specifically trended in the quarter, maybe not on a trailing 12-month basis, both year-over-year and then quarter-over-quarter. Just trying to square the 9% shipment growth to your revenue being up 15%?\n\nJeffrey Rodino: Yes, Tristan, this is Jeff. Sequentially, RV was up about 1% from the fourth quarter of 2023 to the first quarter. So we are seeing that, and we believe that will -- that trend will continue through the year.\n\nTristan Thomas-Martin: Okay. I guess just kind of the delta of how you outperformed the industry so much on a shipment standpoint, given there seems to be kind of the ongoing ASP pressure?\n\nAndy Nemeth: Yes. We've -- I would tell you, Tristan, over the last 15 months, our team has been really active in the marketplace and picking up business. Again, working with our customers, really making sure that we're in the best position to be able to take care of them, both on the quality and service side, but as well on the pricing side. And as we've -- again, managed our inventories, but also worked to push our vendors to bring commodity costs down as well. We are -- as Jeff mentioned, we're really active in pushing those prices through to our customers. So we maintain a great balance of pricing and quality and service with the customer base. And as a result, our RV teams have done a spectacular job of picking up more organic content in the RV space.\n\nTristan Thomas-Martin: Okay. And then just one more, 1Q RV retail to get to year, I believe it was down 14%. That implies a pretty big deceleration in March. Am I thinking about that the right way?\n\nAndy Nemeth: Say it again. I really didn't understand your question.\n\nTristan Thomas-Martin: Yes. So RV retail, I think you called out down 14%. But to get there, that would imply March was down more than both January and February year-over-year. Am I missing anything there?\n\nAndy Nemeth: At this point with the estimates, we would tell you, it's down a little bit more than January and February, correct.\n\nTristan Thomas-Martin: Okay. Thank you.\n\nOperator: Thank you. Our next questions come from the line of Craig Kennison with Baird. Please proceed with your questions.\n\nCraig Kennison: Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. You've addressed many of them, but maybe a follow-on. That last question on the month of March. Any color on April trends in terms of RV demand as we continue to see high interest rates impact the consumer?\n\nJeffrey Rodino: Yes, Craig, this is Jeff. From our perspective and what we look at are the production levels, I would tell you that through April, they've stayed pretty consistent with what we've seen so far this year. Like I mentioned earlier, looking ahead to May a little bit. We do see a little bit of time being taken off over the Memorial Day holiday. So we'll lose a little bit of production level there. But overall, the levels -- weekly levels of our customers have stayed pretty consistent.\n\nCraig Kennison: Okay. Thanks. Then on the margin front, 30 to 50 basis points. I'm wondering if you can just share any color on the puts and takes to getting there. I know your marine business tends to be higher margin. You've got Sportech rolling through. I'm just wondering if you can help us understand how you get to 30 to 50 basis points with all the ups and downs in your individual businesses?\n\nAndy Nemeth: Craig, this is Andy. There are definitely a lot of puts and takes in the model. When you look at the diversified business model and what we're doing there, I think when you look at the housing business, which is a highly leverageable business, given the low fixed cost structure that's there. That team has done a fantastic job as well really across our organization when we think about the team's performance. They've done a great job of managing that business, but we've also picked up business there on the housing side and the MH of the business. So leveraging that model is certainly supporting the margin profile and really kind of helping offset what we're seeing as it relates to a little bit worse performance on the Marine side of the business, just given what we're seeing in our mix with the products that we're selling through. It is a higher engineered product, a higher-priced product. And so yes, that does have some impact on it. But when I think about just the puts and takes. There's a lot that goes into our model. But when you look at the industries and the industry performance, it's allowing us to be very, very resilient. And then when you look at the acquisitions that we've done, and I'm going to say over the course of the last 24 to 36 months, we're buying margin-accretive businesses that are supporting the model as well. So we look at that margin resilience that we're able to produce it's a combination of a lot of things with the diversification, the acquisition strategy, the team's performance, the automation initiatives that we've put in place, the increase throughput, and increased quality. And then again, just the team's execution in the marketplace and ability to really drive customer value as we strive to be that component solutions provider as a go-to for our customers have all played into the margin profile.\n\nOperator: Thank you. Our next questions come from the line of Daniel Moore with CJS Securities. Please proceed with your questions.\n\nDaniel Moore: Thank you. Good morning. And Andy, good morning. Welcome to you. Covered a lot of ground -- excuse me. But just on the content side, content per RV ticked slightly higher in Q1 and marine. I think you said flat sequentially. You think we found the bottom from which we can grow on either or both sides or consumers likely to continue to opt for more entry level units that might keep some pressure on that metric?\n\nAndy Nemeth: Hey, Dan. Andy Nemeth. I think as we look at content today, we feel like we have bottomed in general. There may be a few small puts and takes here. But overall, we feel like we bottomed and we would expect content to continue to go up. kind of sequentially as we look at the model going forward, especially with the business that we've brought on. I think one of the other things that we're really excited about is when you think about market conditions like this, and the consumers -- or I'm sorry, the customers at the OEM level, there's a higher concentration on new innovations and product development, and we're actively and aggressively pursuing a lot of different innovations out there in the product space today. So when we look at content and where we sit today, kind of bouncing along the bottom with some uptick with business that we brought on, we get pretty excited about where we think we can go once the market doesn't flag, especially with a lot of the new product solutions that we're bringing to market and working with our customers on, not only current model year out but two, three year models out, as we've mentioned. So our expectation is the -- long answer to your question, but we expect content to sequentially continue to go up. We do believe it's bottomed.\n\nDaniel Moore: Very helpful. And on Sportech and Powersports, more generally. You've had Sportech under the umbrella for a couple of months now. Just how would you characterize the opportunities to drive content over the next few years relative to your initial expectations. You described some of those cross-selling or internal sales and initiatives that or meetings that you've already had taken place, but just talk about the -- where you see that opportunity going?\n\nAndy Nemeth: Yes. We definitely are excited about the opportunity that exists there. With that team's innovation, again, we talk about advanced products. They've been doing that for a while as well. And so you look at some of the combinations of products that we can bring to market in alignment with what they're delivering today as a product solution and a very sticky product solution, we think that there's a lot of opportunity to bring additional value with our product lines and incorporating those into, again, a higher value-added product for the customer base, for that enthusiast space that we think can be really compelling for the end consumer. So I would say our expectations are at or better than kind of what we anticipated.\n\nDaniel Moore: Great. And lastly, it does sound like M&A could be on the table given the strong cash flow outlook that you just reiterated, talk about your capital allocation priorities for the next 12 months, debt paydown versus M&A versus maybe potential buybacks, opportunistically? Thanks again.\n\nAndy Nemeth: Yes, sure. So I think as we look at capital allocation, we're going to stay focused on making sure that we're reinvesting in the business. We're going to continue to pursue automation initiatives that increase throughput and quality. That's been very successful from our perspective. So we're going to continue to deploy capital there. We're going to remain opportunistic on the buyback side of the business. And we've always got a grid in place as it relates to marker that we will execute upon based on the return model that we've put forth. So we're always actively looking at that, whether or not we execute in a given quarter, we do -- we are very actively monitoring the buyback. And then on the acquisition front, for sure, we're excited about the pipeline that exists out there today. We've got the liquidity. We've got the capital structure to be able to support a continued acquisition profile, especially as we look at our leverage profile as well, which we've been able to deliver upon in bringing that down immediately following Sportech and expect to continue to do so. So I think we remain opportunistic and as we've mentioned on offense as it relates to acquisitions and want to continue to actively pursue them.\n\nOperator: Thank you. Our next questions come from the line of Brandon Rolle with D.A. Davidson. Please proceed with your questions.\n\nBrandon Rolle: Thank you. Thanks for taking my questions. First, just on Sportech, I think you had mentioned expectations for wholesale shipments this year to be flat. What gives you confidence shipments can be flat year-over-year given the state of dealer inventories and also the industry lapping a very strong channel fill year in 2023.\n\nAndy Nemeth: Sure, Brandon. This is Andy Nemeth. As we look at Sportech, again, the utility sector is where Sportech is primarily focused. And when we look at the combination of demand, that exists there today. Inventory levels in the channel that we see in the utility side of the business and then the backlog that exists at Sportech. That's what gives us kind of our confidence as it relates to the stability of that business. So again, we see that. That was one of the things that we looked at as we kind of pursued Sportech as well, and gain confidence on, but that's really driving that. That utility sector has a solid demand profile to it. And then that coupled with the backlog gives us confidence in Sportech's performance.\n\nBrandon Rolle: Okay. Great. And then just one other question. I think currently, over the past couple of months, the model year '25 bidding process within the RV industry has been going on. Could you comment on the state of competition, any increased competition or any potential -- it seems like OEMs are looking to get prices lower, given affordability issues within the industry and elevated interest rates. Any commentary on the model year '25 bidding process? Thank you.\n\nJeffrey Rodino: Yes, Brandon, this is Jeff. Every year, we kind of go through the same bidding process. We have competition in every one of the product categories. And there is always competition out there. We're obviously working to be kind of best-in-class in all of our product categories, making sure that we're hitting on our automation, our efficiencies as well as pushing our vendors to pass along the pricing, so we can get that to our customers. So we're being aggressive out there where we can be and pushing that. But certainly, we're always dealing with competition. We've got competition in every one of the product lines.\n\nBrandon Rolle: Great. Thank you.\n\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. Our next questions come from the line of Alex Perry with Bank of America (NYSE: BAC ). Please proceed with your questions.\n\nAlex Perry: Hi, thanks for taking my questions here. I guess just first, any more color you can give on the sort of expectations for whether it's Sportech or the Powersport segment should contribute for the year. I guess, specifically, any color you can give on sort of the phasing in any seasonality we should be thinking about with the business as we build our models up? Thanks.\n\nAndy Nemeth: Yes. This is Andy. I think as we look at kind of seasonality, we expect kind of existing run rates or current run rates that we're seeing today. As we look at kind of overall Powersports for Patrick as a whole for the year, we're estimating around $400 million of Powersports revenue in that space today. So again, we feel like where we're geared, where we're focused, kind of flat market growth or organic -- let's call it, flat market growth with up organic content as we continue to pick up business, but also gain content on products, especially as it relates to additional solutions that were bringing to the table.\n\nAlex Perry: That's really helpful. And then just my follow-up is on Marine. I think you said 2Q decline similar to 1Q. I guess as we move into the back half, what gives you the confidence that you should start to see an improvement in the Marine business? Thanks.\n\nAndy Nemeth: Sure. I think as we're looking at Marine, there is resilience at the retail level, and we do see solid traffic out there. There's a lot of interest. The marine OEMs do a fabulous job of innovating product and continuing to push the envelope as it relates to innovations in the space. So we don't believe that there is a lack of attractiveness of product out there and nor do we believe that there's a lack of demand. Right now, as we just kind of look at where the market's at, the anticipation of the '25 model year and the new innovations that do come out in marine kind of hitting in the back half we feel -- and we also feel like inventories in the channel are in balance. We think the OEs have been extremely aggressive in managing production in alignment with the dealers. And so there's a lot of discipline. There's still tremendous demand out there, especially for the new innovations, and we just kind of look at that model today and think that we're kind of bouncing along here on the bottom. It's been soft in the higher concentrated components, to date, through Q1, and we just expect that to continue, especially with what we're seeing from a macroeconomic perspective through Q2. So as we look at things, again, we wanted to -- we thought it was prudent to kind of make sure that we're looking at the market according to our mix. But overall, again, the demand is still out there, and we're seeing that resilience with certain product categories in the space. And again, that's what gives us confidence towards the back half that we'll see some stabilization.\n\nOperator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, I will turn it back over to Andy Nemeth for closing remarks.\n\nAndy Nemeth: Thank you. I want to end the call, once again, by thanking our amazing team members who have made these past 65 years as a company possible. Their leadership, tenacity and passion for what we do is evident in the company that we are today. Patrick's ability to adapt, grow and evolve over this time period from a manufactured housing supplier into a more diversified partner to the RV, marine, Powersports and housing industries supports our goal of being the supplier of choice to the outdoor enthusiast space. We will continue to be stewards of good business, accelerating the transformation of our company, while optimizing our financial and operational health. Thank you very much for your continued support.\n\nOperator: Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This concludes today's teleconference. Thank you for your participation.

I will now turn the call over to Paul.\n\nPaul Badawi: Thanks, Trip. We continue to advance our mission of developing transformative, interventional technologies that allow eye care providers to procedurally elevate the standards of care, empowering people to keep seeing. In the first quarter, we saw an increase in the utilization of our Surgical Glaucoma technologies as compared to the previous quarter and the first quarter of 2023 and continue to demonstrate operational excellence with our strong gross margins and disciplined expense management. We are executing on our strategic initiatives to facilitate appropriate and equitable market access and expand our clinical evidence portfolio in both segments. Our first quarter performance only increases our excitement about 2024 and the long-term opportunities in front of us. We believe that our compelling commercial strategies into multibillion-dollar market opportunities, robust clinical efficacy supporting our differentiated interventional portfolio and experienced management team have created a tremendous opportunity to drive durable and profitable growth over the coming years. We generated total revenue of $19.3 million in the first quarter, representing a record for our first quarter period. Growth was 3% sequentially from the fourth quarter of 2023 and 2% compared to the first quarter of 2023. At the same time, we significantly decreased our cash usage to $10.8 million in the first quarter of 2024, compared to $17.7 million in the first quarter of 2023, while still investing in our commercial and R&D value drivers and after taking into account our debt restructuring payments and typical first quarter bonus payments. I will now turn to a more detailed discussion of our business segments, starting with our Surgical Glaucoma segment. We are pleased with our quarterly performance with Surgical Glaucoma revenue of $18.3 million, representing sequential growth of 6% compared to the fourth quarter of 2023 and growth of 5% compared to the same period in the prior year. OMNI is positioned as an important MIGS technology that surgeons rely on to treat their glaucoma patients and our recovery trajectory attracting to our expectations. We remain confident in our ability to continue expanding our position in the Surgical Glaucoma market for both combination cataract uses and stand-alone uses. We have strategically focused on a few critical drivers to build long-term success within our Surgical Glaucoma segment. Our main priorities are to increase surgeon utilization across all accounts and reengage accounts who ceased or decreased their orders during the LCD uncertainty period. We also continue to focus our efforts on increasing the pipeline of new surgeons to be trained on OMNI and SION. Growth in the first quarter of 2024 was driven primarily by increased utilization from existing accounts of OMNI and SION, which had both sequential growth and growth when compared to the same period in the prior year. This is a testament in large part to the leading clinical profile of OMNI, which demonstrates the efficacy of OMNI at lowering both IOP and IOP-reducing medications, for a broad set of primary open-angle glaucoma patients. In parallel, we are actively reengaging with accounts that have ceased or decreased their orders during the LCD uncertainty period, during the second half of 2023, before the LCDs were withdrawn in late December 2023. As a reminder, we experienced net account attrition of approximately 6% during that period, which we believe was primarily due to the uncertainty caused by the LCDs in the same period. We expect returning accounts to contribute toward further regaining momentum in the second quarter to help drive low double-digit sequential growth from the first quarter of 2024 and toward double-digit growth in the second half of the year versus the comparable period in the prior year. Another core aspect of our strategy is building our funnel of surgeons to be trained on procedures enabled by our OMNI technology. We are pleased to see that our funnel has increased over the past few months and we expect this funnel to continue to strengthen throughout the remainder of 2024. Producing robust clinical data also remains a critical piece of our strategy to drive increased adoption and utilization of OMNI. The compelling results from the prospective multicenter GEMINI 2 study demonstrated sustained and clinically significant IOP reduction of 29% at three years and clinically significant reduction of IOP-lowering medication use, as 74% of study patients were medication-free at three years. Most recently, we announced the publication of a large-scale real-world clinical outcome study of patients treated by the three most common MIGS technologies in AJO International. The results further demonstrated OMNI's strong efficacy profile. Using the American Academy of Ophthalmology's IRIS Registry, the largest specialty society clinical data registry in all of medicine, and the first comprehensive eye disease clinical registry in the United States, this large-scale MIGS study evaluated long-term two-year, postsurgical outcomes among patients with primary open-angle glaucoma treated with the three most commonly used FDA approved or cleared ab interno MIGS devices in the U.S., OMNI, Hydrus Microstent and iStent inject combined with cataract surgery, as well as for cataract surgery alone. The results from this study reported that the comprehensive outflow procedure performed with the OMNI Surgical System technology was effective at lowering both IOP and IOP-reducing medication use at two years. The results were further evidence of the OMNI procedure durable efficacy at two years and were consistent with our many prior published studies. We are excited to see that large-scale real-world studies of MIGS standards of care provide further evidence of the robust IOP reduction and medication reduction, associated with the comprehensive outflow procedure enabled by OMNI. The body of evidence supporting OMNI's clinical efficacy continues to expand, continuing to strengthen our belief that the comprehensive outflow procedure enabled by OMNI is a critical procedure in the field of glaucoma that is elevating the standard of care. We will continue prioritizing the production of powerful long-term clinical data, and we anticipate delivering additional compelling results in the future. We are very proud of our published high-quality, long-term data, including the GEMINI 2 and IRIS studies. Should new proposed LCDs emerge, we believe these data along with our existing body of clinical evidence will continue to support coverage of the procedure enabled by OMNI for the appropriate patient population. I want to emphasize our belief that the reimbursement profile for OMNI today is sufficient to drive high growth. At the same time, when we look at the clinical profile of the procedure enabled by our technology, we believe there are opportunities to better align OMNI''s coding coverage and payment profiles with the clinical value OMNI actually delivers. We look forward to continued engagement with the MACs, CMS, commercial payers and other stakeholders, as part of our ongoing efforts to maintain and improve appropriate and equitable market access for glaucoma patients and their surgeons to the procedures enabled by our OMNI technology. To close our Surgical Glaucoma discussion, I want to comment on the recent results from the patent trial that concluded last week in Delaware. As we noted in our press release earlier this week, the Jury found that Sight Sciences' three asserted patents were willfully infringed and awarded monetary damages for past infringement. The monetary damages included $5.5 million in lost profits and $28.5 million in royalty damages for sales of the Hydrus Microstent from its commercial launch through trial. As far as next steps, the District Court will entertain post-trial briefings by both parties, including with respect to potential enhancements to the damages and other remedies. And the court's final judgment will be subject to appeal. We have invested considerable capital in research and development to create new and innovative technologies, striving to pioneer novel treatments for chronic eye disease. Our commitment to these investments underscores our mission to expand patient access to transformative and interventional technologies that enhance patient outcomes. Given the substantial investments we have made in our surgical innovations, on behalf of our surgeon customers in glaucoma patients, we have a duty to our stakeholders to safeguard our intellectual property portfolio, and we are pleased with the Jury's verdict. Our attention remains steadfast on equipping eye care providers with efficacious technologies and executing on our long-term growth strategy in Surgical Glaucoma and Dry Eye disease. Now I will turn to our Dry Eye business. We believe the TearCare System represents a transformative technology that will elevate the standard of care for evaporative Dry Eye disease treatment. Our long-term strategy has been to pioneer the field of interventional Dry Eye. The interventional dry eye procedure performed with TearCare is designed to address the root cause of evaporative Dry Eye disease, and the growing body of TearCare clinical results strongly support our belief in its safety and efficacy. Clinical trial data has evidenced that TearCare provided patients with a comprehensive, consistent, fast-acting and durable treatment and the SAHARA RCT showed superiority on our primary objective endpoint, tear breakup time, versus the market-leading prescription eye drop RESTASIS. There are over 11 million diagnosed patients, who we think could benefit from the procedure, which we believe creates an approximate $2.5 billion core addressable U.S. market opportunity. Over the last five years, we have sold over 55,000 TearCare SmartLids, developed meaningful relationships with important Dry Eye key opinion leaders and achieved the successful six and 12-month results of our landmark SAHARA RCT. These developments were critical to build a foundation prior to seeking equitable market access. As part of our original long-term strategy, we are now focused on driving equitable market access for patients that can benefit from the procedures enabled by the TearCare technology. We shifted our resources away from cash pay commercialization efforts toward market access, while reducing our overall commercial spend and infrastructure in the Dry Eye segment, until we have some coverage wins. This year, we have begun discussions with payers with the goal of receiving coverage decisions starting in 2025. Our strategy for these payer discussions is based on articulating the value of TearCare from both clinical and health economic perspectives. We believe the combination of the strong clinical data from our SAHARA RCT and the findings of our budget impact analysis to be discussed in more detail shortly, create a compelling case for payers to cover treatments performed with TearCare at an appropriate reimbursement level. We recently presented at the ASCRS Conference in April, the 12-month results of the SAHARA RCT, demonstrating improved signs and symptoms of dry eye disease for TearCare patients crossed over from RESTASIS. The Phase 2 crossover of the SAHARA RCT showed subjects who were previously treated with RESTASIS for six months and then subsequently taken off of RESTASIS and received a single TearCare treatment, experienced further statistically significant improvements in the signs and symptoms of dry eye disease. The first two phases of the SAHARA RCT month six and month 12 endpoints suggest that the effectiveness of TearCare appeared to be the same, whether or not a study patient had prior treatment with RESTASIS, and that similar results could be expected when TearCare is used as a primary or secondary treatment for dry eye disease. We are extremely pleased that Phase 2 of the RCT, again demonstrates the strong clinical efficacy of the TearCare procedure. In the final phase of the SAHARA RCT, patients from the TearCare cohort will be followed for a total period of 24 months from baseline with repeat TearCare treatments as needed according to protocol-specified treatment with the goal of understanding treatment frequency. We expect results from this final phase of the SAHARA RCT to be published in 2025. In addition, we believe there are benefits associated with the dry eye treatment technology like TearCare that is not reliant on patient adherence. The ability to avoid the risk of patient noncompliance with a drop regimen further supports the case for prioritizing an interventional in-office treatment over a prescription-based approach. In addition to clinical data, our conversations with payers include our budget impact analysis, which will be presented this month at ISPOR, the International Society for Pharmacoeconomics and Outcomes Research, a leading health economics conference. We anticipate that the compelling model showcasing the health economic impact and savings for TearCare versus prescription drops, will be a powerful tool as we work to establish broad coverage for TearCare. Another part of our strategy to achieve positive coverage decisions is for our customers to properly submit claims for TearCare treatments to payers in a manner that appropriately reflects the value of the procedure. We are happy to report that we are seeing early positive traction with our customers' efforts, and we expect this momentum to continue. Again, our goal is to begin receiving positive coverage decisions from payers starting in 2025. And until then, we will continue working diligently to articulate the clinical and economic benefits of TearCare technology. Looking ahead to the rest of 2024, we believe we are in a position to continue to execute on our strategic priorities and capitalize on our upcoming catalysts as we scale our business with the intent to return to double-digit growth in the second half of 2024 and into 2025. In our Surgical Glaucoma segment, we expect OMNI to capture market share in combo cataract procedures and lead the development of the stand-alone MIGS market. We also remain committed to producing long-term clinical evidence for OMNI. In our Dry Eye segment, we will continue to lay the foundation for market access to interventional eyelid procedures with TearCare. We believe we have an incredible opportunity ahead of us, along with the right strategy and the right team to execute and deliver value for our patients and stakeholders. I will now turn the call over to Ali to discuss our financials.\n\nAlison Bauerlein: Thanks, Paul. Before I turn to the first quarter financial results, I want to reiterate that we feel we are well positioned to support our financial and strategic goals for the future and are pleased with both our commercial and operational execution throughout the quarter. We plan on achieving cash flow breakeven without the need to raise additional equity capital and are excited about our long-term growth opportunity. Moving back to the first quarter. Total revenue for the first quarter was $19.3 million. This reflects an increase of 2% compared to the first quarter of 2023, primarily driven by increased utilization of OMNI and SION, and partially offset by the expected decline in Dry Eye revenue. Surgical Glaucoma revenue for the first quarter was $18.3 million, up 5% versus the comparable period in the prior year and 6% compared to the fourth quarter of 2023. 1,073 customers ordered Surgical Glaucoma products in the first quarter, up 1% from the fourth quarter of 2023 and up 5% from the first quarter of 2023. Utilization of ordering accounts was up about 10% from the fourth quarter of 2023 and up about 5% from the first quarter of 2023. We believe this improved utilization is a testament to the unique benefits of OMNI and SION and their importance to surgeons and patients. Our Dry Eye revenue for the first quarter was $1 million, down 32% compared to the first quarter of 2023. This expected decline was primarily due to fewer new accounts and related SmartHub sales, as a result of the reduced sales infrastructure after our restructuring in October of 2023, and the focus on the next phase of our commercial strategy for our Dry Eye segment towards achieving market access. For the first quarter of 2024, we had 288 active Dry Eye customers, a 9% increase versus the first quarter of 2023. We also sold about 4,000 Dry Eye treatment lids in the first quarter, a 7% decrease versus the comparable period in the prior year. Gross margins for the first quarter was 86% compared to 84% in the same period in the prior year. The increase in gross margin was primarily driven by higher Surgical Glaucoma gross margin, which was partially offset by lower Dry Eye gross margin. Surgical Glaucoma gross margin in the first quarter of 2024 increased to 88% compared to 86% in the same period in the prior year, primarily driven by a onetime prior year inventory scrap expense. Dry Eye gross margin in the first quarter of 2024 declined to 42% compared to 54% in the same period in the prior year, primarily due to higher overhead costs per unit in the current period primarily due to lower production volumes. Total operating expenses for the first quarter were $31.2 million, a decrease of 7% compared to $33.3 million in the first quarter of 2023, which reflects reduced selling, general and administrative operating expenses and improved operating expense leverage in the first quarter of 2024, as compared to the same period in the prior year. The decrease was primarily due to lower personnel-related expenses, partially offset by the expected increased legal expenses and stock-based compensation expenses. Adjusted operating expenses were $26.6 million for the first quarter, a decrease of 11% compared to $29.7 million in the same period in the prior year. Our loss from operations for the first quarter was $14.7 million compared to a loss of $17.6 million in the first quarter of 2023. Our net loss was $16.2 million or $0.33 per share in the first quarter compared to a net loss of $17.1 million or $0.35 per share for the first quarter of 2023. We ended the quarter with $127.3 million of cash and cash equivalents and $35 million of debt, excluding debt discounts and amortized debt issuance costs. We had $10.8 million of cash used in the first quarter, reflecting continued operating discipline, which included a payment of $3.2 million associated with our debt refinancing, annual bonus payments and higher legal expenses. This was a substantial improvement from $17.7 million cash used in the first quarter of 2023. Moving to our outlook for the full-year 2024. We are reiterating our revenue guidance of $81 million to $85 million, representing growth of approximately 0% to 5% compared to 2023. We expect second quarter 2024 revenue to be lower than the comparable period in the prior year, following the impact of the LCDs in the second half of 2023. However, we do expect low double-digit sequential revenue growth in the second quarter of 2024 versus the first quarter of 2024, primarily driven by increased OMNI utilization. We expect this will be followed by double-digit growth in the second half of the year versus the comparative period in the prior year as we regained commercial momentum and expand utilization and our customer base. We expect typical seasonality in 2024 where the second and fourth quarters tend to have stronger utilization than the first and third quarters. We still expect Dry Eye revenue to decline significantly in full-year 2024 compared to full-year 2023 due to the evolution of our commercial strategy towards market access activities and the restructuring of our Dry Eye team. We expect Dry Eye revenue to have accelerated growth in 2025, with reimbursement coverage and an expanded commercial presence. In terms of gross margin, we continue to expect overall gross margin to be in the mid-80s. However, we anticipate incurring increased overhead cost per unit due to lower production builds planned in 2024 for both segments, the larger impact in the Dry Eye segment. We are reiterating our full-year 2024 adjusted operating expense guidance of $107 million to $110 million, representing a decrease of approximately 0% to 3% compared to 2023. We believe we will return to double-digit revenue growth in the second half of 2024 and into 2025. We remain focused on further penetrating and expanding the Surgical Glaucoma and Dry Eye markets, as we execute and deliver on our long-term goals and build for our future. Operator, please open the line for questions.\n\nOperator: Thank you. At this time, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of David Saxon with Needham & Company. Your line is now open.\n\nDavid Saxon: Great, thanks for taking my questions. And good afternoon, Paul and Ali. So I just want to start on guidance. I get all the comments, sequential double-digit growth in the second quarter and then the second half should see double-digit year-on-year growth. I mean, pretty easily bumping up against the top end of the guidance. So my question is just given what you're seeing year-to-date? Why not raise the guide? Is there anything you're seeing that you view as a material risk to the guidance?\n\nAlison Bauerlein: Yes, I'm happy to take that question. And our general approach to guidance is to make sure that we set achievable targets based on what we're seeing in the business. We're only one quarter into 2024. And while we've seen great success through this point, we want to see consistent traction with that regaining momentum seeing utilization, continuing to improve as well as new accounts. But at this point in time, we are very happy with what we've seen, particularly in our Surgical Glaucoma segment. So as we get farther into the year, we'll obviously continue to look at what appropriate guidance is, but we are very pleased with the results we saw in Q1 and that we've seen starting into Q2. And we think it's important to put out achievable guidance.\n\nDavid Saxon: Okay, that makes sense. Maybe for my second question, I'll switch gears to Dry Eye. So I'd love to hear what you're seeing in terms of TearCare claims so far? Is the level of reimbursement in line with expectations and at a level you think could get doctors excited about the procedure? And then kind of secondarily to that, I mean we all know the Dry Eye drop market is very promotional and requires a lot of marketing. Your -- the kind of Dry Eye device, I guess, would have reimbursement to help the doctors economics. But to build patient awareness, do you think you need to spend heavily on marketing and promotional activities like we see in the Dry Eye drop category? Thanks so much.\n\nMatthew Link: Hi, this is Matt. I'll take that one, in two parts. First, on the claims. Obviously, we're very excited about the data from SAHARA. And as Paul referenced in his comments, we are preparing for the publication of our economic impact model, but still very, very early days as it relates to claims. It would be premature to really say anything, at this time. What we can say is based on the economic impact model we have, there's reasons to be optimistic around the level of reimbursement, and we believe that level of reimbursement to be both favorable from a provider's perspective and making the economics work within their practice and also favorable from a payer perspective relative to the current standard of care, which we compared the TearCare procedure too. So again, early in these conversations, early in the claims process, but certainly encouraged by what we're seeing and hearing at this stage, and we look forward to provide more feedback on that at a later date. As it relates to the marketing, we fully understand and appreciate that we're in a market-creating opportunity here. This is a pharmaceutical medication space as it relates to the treatment of dry eye. That is a generic disease state that isn't highly differentiated. I believe a lot of the promotional activity is to differentiate from other drops that are available on the market. And we've got this very unique opportunity to create an entire new category for procedural intervention in ocular surface disease, specifically due to meibomian gland disease. And so we absolutely know that there is a marketing opportunity. I think equally, if not more important, there's an education and outreach opportunity to providers. These patients are being seen in clinics across the United States. We know that they are underdiagnosed and undertreated. And so certainly, at the very beginning of this, we believe there is an opportunity for outreach and education to providers to identify the patients that are already in their clinic, when supported with reimbursement, we think that will be a very favorable opportunity for them and for us. And then moving forward, we'll continue to evaluate what the broader promotional opportunities are to expand that patient population in conjunction with market access, in sustainable reimbursement.\n\nDavid Saxon: Great, thanks so much guys.\n\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for our next question please. Our second question comes from the line of James Beers with William Blair. Your line is now open.\n\nJames Beers: Awesome, thanks for taking the questions. Maybe just to start on utilization, obviously, great to see things improving in Q1. Could you maybe speak to the exit rate in terms of utilization? I know you're saying low double-digit growth sequentially into Q2. Are you near historical levels yet? Or is that sort of the gating factor to giving you more confidence into, say, raising the guide? Thank you.\n\nAlison Bauerlein: Yes. So at a high level, when we think about utilization trends, typically, you would see the Q2 period seeing higher utilization versus the first quarter period. So that's a typical trend in the industry and that's something that we also see in our business and expect this year, as we said in our prepared remarks, we expect traditional seasonality this year with higher sales in the second quarter and the fourth quarter versus the first quarter and the third quarter. So that trend happens in our business, and that is consistent with what we're seeing from a utilization perspective. I do think that having another quarter under our belts will certainly give us more confidence about what we expect to see in the back half of the year, both in terms of number of accounts as well as increasing utilization across those accounts. So those are the critical metrics that we look at as a business in order to predict where we see the business going in the future. So of course, we will continue to reevaluate that as we get further into the year. Did you have a follow-up question? Are you...\n\nJames Beers: Sorry, I thought market might have been popping on. In terms of the account adds in the first quarter, I guess maybe a little bit lighter than we expected where most of those accounts -- the accounts may be you lost in the second half of 2023, and I know you're possibly saying -- or maybe saying less account adds factored into the guidance for the back half of the year, but it sounds like maybe you're a little bit more upbeat on that. So maybe could you just speak to the account adds in the first quarter and then how you expect that to transition into the second quarter and then throughout the rest of the year? Thank you.\n\nAlison Bauerlein: Yes. As we said in our last earnings call, we expected to see increased utilization to be the first improvement in the core metrics versus the account addition. So we do expect our active accounts to increase throughout 2024. That's a key focus of us. But in these early stages of rebuilding post the LTV uncertainty period, we were focusing our reps on the highest value activities. And that includes focusing on accounts that we're already ordering and getting those ordering patterns back up. So our long-term strategy is still the same. It's a mix of increasing utilization of existing customers, reengagement with the lost customers and training new customers. So it's kind of a mix. And when we look at going further into 2024, all three of those are contributors to our growth and getting back to double-digit growth. But in the first quarter, we were primarily focused on utilization and that was planned. That was what we intended to do.\n\nJames Beers: Great, thank you.\n\nOperator: Thank you so much. One moment for our next question please. Our next question comes from the line of Joanne Wuensch with Citi. Your line is now open.\n\nUnidentified Analyst: Hi, this is Felipe [ph] on for Joanne. Just quickly for accounts that you're looking to reengage with from the LCD withdrawal period. I was just wondering, how are those conversations going? And I guess, what are your expectations for conversions? And maybe like what is your biggest hurdle for converting those accounts back to using OMNI again?\n\nMatthew Link: Hi, this is Matt. I'll take that one. Look, our engagements overall have been very positive. I think the market overall has seen recovery in MIGS procedures and volumes on the heels of the withdrawal, the LCD. There's no real material limitation in terms of engaging those accounts and those engagements and conversations are ongoing. As Ali said, from the very beginning of the year, we anticipated the recovery coming in the form of increased utilization. Our sales force has done a phenomenal job, as I think was indicated and demonstrated in Q4 in the face of the LCDs to remain a high level of engagement with our core accounts. But there's also a capacity consideration here. As we talked about in -- the second half of last year, we didn't materially reduce headcount. We saw some modest headcount attrition that we did immediately moved to backfill. And in Q1, we spoke about how we would continue to build back into reinvestment within the sales organization. So we really think about that in terms of capacity more so than infrastructure. And so a lot of this is about building capacity. Sight Sciences is a growth company. We have been a growth company. And to some extent, that was interrupted, obviously, in the second half of last year with the uncertainty of the LCDs. And as we see the rate of recovery that's been demonstrated in Q1, as well as we see in early Q2, that certainly gives us some measure of confidence to continue our investment. And that's a key factor as we think about increasing not just utilization within active accounts, but new accounts and then new surgeon engagement through new surgeon training.\n\nUnidentified Analyst: Thank you.\n\nOperator: All right. Thank you. One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from the line of Thomas Stephan with Stifel. Your line is now open.\n\nThomas Stephan: Great, hey guys. Thanks for the questions. Congrats on the nice quarter. I'll start with competition. Maybe can you elaborate a bit on how, I guess mix competition is qualitatively factored into guidance and your long-term outlook as well. There's obviously a lot of innovation happening in glaucoma. So I guess, wondering if you can just talk about how this is contemplated in both the near-term and the long-term view? And then I have a follow-up.\n\nAlison Bauerlein: Yes, sure. I'll take that and let others jump in to add their thoughts as well. Our overall approach to guidance was to be prudent here and put out a capable targets as we were coming out of the LCD uncertainty period. So we think we have set the right bar for the company, given those dynamics as well as the dynamics on the Dry Eye side of the business this year. In terms of what we see from competitive dynamics, we think the MIGS market is a healthy market right now. It is a growing market. There's great innovation happening, and that brings more and more attention to doing stand-alone procedures, expanding the interventional mindset. All of that is great for us when we look at our products and the clinical efficacy profile that we provide, we think that, that will continue to help us and others in this industry continue to grow and shape the future of glaucoma patients. So those are longer-term dynamics in terms of our guidance for 2024. It's really focused on getting back the foundational work, the momentum back with our core accounts and reengaging with accounts. But we see the competitive dynamics to be favorable for OMNI's success in the short term and the medium term and the long-term. So we are happy to see that. Anything you guys want to add? Okay.\n\nThomas Stephan: Great. That's helpful. Thanks, Ali. And then maybe my follow-up would just be on utilization. Really encouraging to see the trends year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter. Ali, you talked about this a bit, but can you expand a little on sort of how those utilization trends look, I guess, across your surgeon base, how widespread or narrow are these recovery trends? Maybe has the sales force been able to move further into driving utilization in sort of those lower volume accounts? Any color there would be helpful.\n\nMatthew Link: Yes, Tom, this is Matt. I'll take that. Look, the good news is the trends in utilization we see are broadly across the organization. And I think the other thing really important to characterize is we talk about utilization. We sell through to a facility as the endpoint customer. But the RESTASIS, as you all are aware, there's in many instances, multiple surgeons within those facilities. And so the increased utilization is coming as best we can tell also is a mix between higher utilization on a per surgeon basis, but also surgeons within the facility. And so for our comments earlier, we really think this is a healthy underlying dynamic within the business and gives us an opportunity to really drive volume and density within key markets and really start to leverage some efficiency across our sales force through the increased volumes. Importantly, we recognized that there's still a large number of opportunities for competitive conversions. I think we have historically talked about having trained about 50% of the available MIGS surgeons on OMNI. Not all of those have fully adopted OMNI to the extent we believe they could. And so you really see a really large opportunity to continue to grow on this space that we're talking about, and this goes back to the comment I made a few minutes ago, we are excited to get back to investment into the sales force and driving incremental resources as the business justifies and warrants to continue this growth trajectory. It's not just going to happen on the sales force we have today, but what we will invest in the future. And so again, we talked a lot about at the end of last year and the beginning of this year in Q1, how prudently we managed our dollars and resources in the face of the uncertainty of the LCDs. I know that I speak for everyone, when we say we're a lot more excited to talk about getting back to investment in the organization to scale and sustain the double-digit growth that we're looking towards the back half of this year and into early next year.\n\nOperator: Thank you so much. One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from the line of Matthew O'Brien with Piper Sandler. Your line is now open.\n\nUnidentified Analyst: Hey, this is Phil on for Matt. Thanks for taking our questions. And congrats on the great quarter. I guess my first one on the trial and patent infringements on those three patents relating to the canicular scaffold. I was curious as far as future infringement goes with regard to Hydrus and their ability to continue to sell that product. And I understand you might not be able to say much there, but is that perhaps low-hanging share that you could capture in MIGS given similarities?\n\nAlison Bauerlein: Yes, we really can't comment on ongoing patent litigation matters about our patent litigation strategy at this point, or what that could potentially mean. Obviously, we were happy to see the results of the Jury verdict associated with tax damages and royalties. But the go-forward remedies and those things are all pending future hearing. So those will have to let play out in the court process over time.\n\nUnidentified Analyst: That's fair. I figured I'd ask. And then shifting gears, maybe you could just touch on the pipeline you have within the Surgical Glaucoma specifically. Any milestones or launches that investors should be made aware of over the next, call it, 12 to 18 months?\n\nPaul Badawi: Yes. Hi, this is Paul. Obviously, very excited about our pipeline. Products we have commercialized today, OMNI, SION and TearCare were all developed internally. We've proven our ability to innovate effectively and then commercialize effectively as well. So on the pipeline front, we can't share too much at this time, but we have shared in the past and we're continuing to work on intracanalicular scaffold, the Helix stent. That's in animals as we speak. We're excited about that. We'll share more in due course. We are in earlier stages of sustained release as well. Hopefully later this year, we'll hit some milestones that we'll be ready to share with everybody. But excited about what we're working on. I think we've proven our ability to innovate in a differentiated manner in a way that can elevate the standard of care and eye care and love what we're doing and looking forward to sharing more later this year.\n\nUnidentified Analyst: Great, thanks so much.\n\nOperator: Thank you. This concludes the question-and-answer session part. I would now like to turn it back to Paul Badawi for closing remarks.\n\nPaul Badawi: Thank you for attending today's call. We appreciate your interest in Sight Sciences, and we look forward to updating you on our progress in the future. Thank you all.\n\nOperator: Thank you for your participation in today's conference.

(NYSE: VIA), a player in the renewable energy sector, reported a decline in adjusted EBITDA for the first quarter of 2024 during its earnings call today. CEO Keith Maxwell and CFO Mike Barajas presented the company's financial results, which showed a decrease in adjusted EBITDA to $15.1 million from $18.8 million in the prior year.\n\nThe dip was attributed to lower unit margins and mild weather affecting gas volumes. Despite the downturn, the company grew its customer base and announced an upcoming acquisition expected to bolster the bottom line from the second quarter.\n\nVia Renewables' first quarter results reflect a challenging period with mixed financial outcomes. While the company faced headwinds in unit margins and weather-related volume decreases, strategic customer base growth and a forthcoming acquisition offer a potential boost to future earnings.\n\nThe company's focus on increasing its customer base in POR markets and its proactive hedging strategies have helped to mitigate risks and position it for potential growth. As Via Renewables continues to navigate the renewable energy market, stakeholders will be closely monitoring the impact of its acquisition strategy and market expansion efforts on its financial performance in the coming quarters.\n\nVia Renewables, Inc. is trading at attractive valuation multiples, with a current P/E Ratio of 8.23 and an adjusted P/E Ratio for the last twelve months as of Q1 2024 at 6.11. This indicates that the company's earnings are priced lower relative to the market, which may interest value investors. Moreover, the PEG Ratio for the same period stands at 0.02, suggesting that the company's earnings growth is potentially undervalued when considering its low price-to-earnings growth ratio.\n\nThe company's stock has experienced a large price uptick over the last six months, as reflected by the 66.87% price total return, signaling a strong market performance in the recent period. This contrasts with the reported decline in adjusted EBITDA and could be indicative of investor confidence in the company's long-term strategy and upcoming acquisition.\n\nInvestingPro Tips highlight that Via Renewables is also trading at a low revenue valuation multiple, with a Revenue of 417.4M USD and a Revenue Growth of -10.27% over the last twelve months as of Q1 2024. Despite the decline in revenue, the company remains profitable with a Gross Profit Margin of 38.41%, which could be a reassuring factor for investors looking at the company's ability to generate earnings.\n\nInvestors interested in further analysis and additional InvestingPro Tips can explore https://www.investing.com/pro/VIA, where they can find 7 more tips to gain a comprehensive understanding of Via Renewables' financial health and stock performance.

This call is also being broadcast via webcast, which can be located in the Investor Relations section of our website at viarenewables.com. With us today from management is our CEO, Keith Maxwell; and our CFO, Mike Barajas. Please note that today's discussion may contain forward-looking statements, which are based on assumptions that we believe to be reasonable as of this date. Actual results may differ materially. We urge everyone to review the safe harbor statement in yesterday's earnings release as well as the risk factors in our SEC filings. We undertake no obligation to update these statements as a result of future events, except as required by law. In addition, we will refer to both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. For information regarding our non-GAAP financial measures and reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP measures, please refer to yesterday's earnings release. With that, I'll turn the call over to Keith Maxwell, our CEO.\n\nKeith Maxwell: Thank you, Stephen. I want to welcome everyone to today's call. I'll begin by providing a summary of results for the first quarter. And then our CFO, Mike Barajas will provide more details on the financials. In the first quarter, we reported adjusted EBITDA of $15.1 million which is a $3.7 million decrease from the prior year of $18.8 million, due to lower unit margins compounded by mild weather, which resulted in lower gas volumes. On a positive note, we grew our customer book to 338,000 RCEs compared to 335,000 RCEs at the start of the year. We also increased the percentage of our customer-based POR markets, which compared to the first quarter of 2023, which lowers our credit risk and bad debt exposure. Looking forward to our second quarter, we're happy to announce that we entered into an agreement to acquire approximately 12,500 RCEs in our existing markets. This acquisition will be accretive to our bottom line beginning in the second quarter of this year. This marks our first customer [indiscernible] acquisition since the end of 2022, and we will continue to be open to any potential future tuck-in acquisitions, and we are committed to growing our customer base in line with long-term growth strategies. That concludes my prepared remarks. And now I'll turn the call over to Mike for his financial review. Mike?\n\nMike Barajas: Thanks, Keith. Good morning. In the first quarter, we achieved $15.1 million in adjusted EBITDA compared to last year's first quarter of $18.8 million. Retail gross margin for the quarter was $35.7 million compared with $40.3 million last year. In our retail electricity segment, gross margin was $18.9 million compared to $20.5 million in the first quarter last year. The decrease due to lower unit margins, partially offset by higher volumes due to a higher RCE count. In our retail natural gas segment, gross margin was $16.2 million compared to $19.9 million in the first quarter last year. This was due to both lower unit margins and volumes year-over-year. G&A expenses were $17.3 million compared to $17.2 million in the first quarter last year, primarily due to increased sales and marketing expenses and legal fees. This was partially offset by a reduction in bad debt. We ended the quarter at 338,000 RCEs compared to 339,000 RCEs to end the first quarter of 2023 and up from 335,000 RCEs on December 31, 2023. Our attrition was 3.9%, which remained flat compared to the first quarter of 2023 due to lower attrition in our mass market book, offset by an uptick in commercial attrition. Our net income for the quarter was $19.1 million or income of $1.81 per fully diluted share compared to a net loss of $6.8 million or a loss of $1.26 per fully diluted share for the first quarter of 2023. The increase is mainly due to an increase in the mark-to-market on our hedges that we put in place to lock in margins on our retail contracts. We had a mark-to-market gain this quarter of $11.2 million compared to a mark-to-market loss of $22.6 million a year ago. We also had reductions in net asset optimization, depreciation and interest expenses of $1.4 million, $1.3 million and $800,000, respectively. The increase in net income was partially offset by a decrease in retail gross margin and increases in income tax and G&A expenses. Income tax expense increased to $4.8 million in the first quarter of 2024 compared to a benefit of $2 million in 2023. On April 15, we paid the quarterly cash dividend on our Series A preferred stock. On April 17, we declared a dividend in the amount of $0.76051 per share on our preferred stock to be paid on July 15. That's all I have. Back to Keith.\n\nKeith Maxwell: Thanks, Mike. I want to thank our employees and the care and the dedication to growing and supporting Via and to our suppliers and their continued support. I want to thank our customers for choosing us as their energy provider. We are excited about the future and look forward to connecting with you soon on our next call.\n\nOperator:", "source": {"uri": "uk.investing.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Investing.com UK"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earnings_before_interest,_taxes,_depreciation,_and_amortization", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_financial_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Chief financial officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renewable_energy", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Renewable energy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Price\u2013earnings_ratio", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Price\u2013earnings ratio"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valuation_(finance)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Valuation (finance)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revenue", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Revenue"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accounting_standard", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Accounting standard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_investing", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Value investing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earnings_call", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Earnings call"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stakeholder_(corporate)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stakeholder (corporate)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hedge_(finance)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hedge (finance)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_growth", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Economic growth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Stock_Exchange", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York Stock Exchange"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_factor_(finance)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Risk factor (finance)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gross_income", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gross income"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bad_debt", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bad debt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gross_margin", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gross margin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SEC_filing", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "SEC filing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_dollar", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States dollar"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks_and_Bonds", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks and Bonds", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance/Investing", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance/Investing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Guides", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Guides", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://i-invdn-com.investing.com/news/LYNXNPEB6R0AQ_L.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9542931", "eventUri": "eng-9542931", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-04-15", "textStart": 7458, "textEnd": 7466}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-04-17", "textStart": 7540, "textEnd": 7548}, {"amb": false, "date": "-07-15", "textStart": 7646, "textEnd": 7653}], "sentiment": 0.2, "wgt": 139, "relevance": 1}

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, George Karamanos, Chief Legal Officer. Thank you, sir. You may begin.\n\nGeorge Karamanos: Welcome to our Q1 conference call. Riley McCormack, our CEO; and Charles Beck, our CFO, are with me on the call. On the call today, we will provide a business update and discuss Q1 2024 financial results. This will be followed by a question and answer forum. We have posted our prepared remarks in the investor relations section of our website and will archive this webcast there. Before we begin, let me remind everyone that today's discussion contains forward-looking statements that have risks and uncertainties. Please refer to our press release for more information on the specific risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially. Riley will now provide a business update.\n\nRiley McCormack: Thank you, George, and welcome aboard. Hello, everyone. Thank you for joining today's call. As our world becomes increasingly digital and company progressed their digital transformation journeys, Digimarc maximizes the ways in which products and multimedia can digitally interact with the various systems that surround them. We excel at the identification and authentication of physical goods and digital assets often at massive scale and often where other means of identification or authentication don't work well or don't work at all. Our focus is on converting this large total addressable market into substantial free cash flow by positioning ourselves to deliver high and long lasting top line growth at world-class operating margins. This starts with our being easy to begin doing business with and excellently guiding customers along their digital transformation journey and is aided by 4 tailwinds we've been very intentional to create. One, an incredibly deep and wide modes provide us the ability to offer differentiated products. In turn, our differentiated products allow us the ability to create new markets as well as to disrupt existing ones, all while delivering best-in-class gross margins that will continue to expand as we scale. Two, the need to identify or authenticate physical goods and digital assets is universal, and thus almost every entity in the world is a potential Digimarc customer. At the same time, our technology allows us to identify and authenticate things where other solutions don't work well or don't work at all, which means our ecosystem is comprised of companies incentivized to partner with us as opposed to companies that pose competitive risk. These two truths provide us the exciting opportunity to leverage our partners' customer list, pipelines and go-to-market resources and specific domain expertise to deliver quickly scalable and high gross profit margin revenue in a way that is also extremely efficient from the operating expenditure perspective. Three, there are many use cases that require companies to identify or authenticate their physical items and digital assets, and many ways we can configure our technology to achieve these goals, and therefore our ability to productize new functionality is open-ended. This means our already prodigious TAM will continue to grow as we either launch new products or add opportunity-unlocking functionality to existing products. Four, we engineer our products to be accretive, which means the more Digimarc products a customer buys, the more value each product delivers. This positions us to harvest the low hanging and highly profitable fruit of cross sells and upsells for years to come. The combination of these four tailwinds is why we are confident in our ability to deliver high and long-lasting growth at world-class operating margins, and in so doing achieve our goal of converting our enormous TAM into massive free cash flow generation. Our first quarter results provide multiple tangible examples I'd like to now share. We signed a multi-year deal with a customer in the collectibles industry that delivered 6-figure ARR growth in Q1. Moreover, this deal should see ARR grow to $2 million in year two and into the mid-to-very-high 7 figures in year-3 and beyond. Collectibles is a new industry for us, and one we believe is ripe for digital transformation in both how items are identified as well as how they are authenticated. To that end, this customer chose to start their journey with two Digimarc products, Digimarc Automate and Digimarc Validate. And we believe that as we work to ensure our valued customer's success, there is even more we could do - we could help them accomplish beyond what is scoped in this initial agreement. Moreover, and unrelated to this deal, we are in discussions with multiple partners, both new and old, regarding opportunities to jointly provide value to other companies in this multi-hundred billion dollar per year industry. Collectibles is a perfect example of an industry that has been held back by other means of identification and authentication not working well or not working at all. And we are excited to guide this industry along its product digitization journey, and in so doing, accelerate its growth. We signed a high 5-figure ARR Digimarc Automate deal with a division of our largest commercial customer that will grow to 6-figures in the very near term. We believe this new deal is yet another proof-point that we are still just scratching the surface of all the transformational value we can provide this Uber-valued and tech-forward customer. We remain laser-focused on doing just that. We upsold a long-standing Digimarc Validate customer that had historically only been focused on B2B anti-counterfeit applications, but is now keenly interested in expanding the authentication capability of Digimarc Validate to end consumers. This upsell allows our customer to unlock new functionality that we just recently productized, and we believe the opportunity with this customer for B2C validation is enormous. We are excited to prove our value and earn the right to capture the entirety of the opportunity this new functionality allows, with this specific customer as well as the many, many other companies that will benefit from this newly-productized functionality. We signed a deal with another customer interested in beginning their journey with two Digimarc products, in this case an iconic European brand interested in the power of Digimarc Engage and Digimarc Validate. While this initial deal was mid-5 figures, this relationship has the potential to grow to be much larger even if the customer doesn't expand beyond these two Digimarc products. It is also important to note that this customer understands the accretive nature of our products and has already expressed interest in another Digimarc product beyond Digimarc Engage and Digimarc Validate. We signed a Digimarc Validate deal with an existing Digimarc Automate customer and have additional pipeline opportunities for both products with this extremely large CPG. Our focus is on not only proving the value of Digimarc Validate and Digimarc Automate, but also of Digimarc as a digital transformation partner as the upside presented by this single customer is enormous as it is not only a large company, but a very viable candidate for our full product suite. We upsold Digimarc Engage to a long-standing Digimarc Validate customer and believe the upside from their planned rollout of Digimarc Engage will see this high-5-figure initial deal grow well into the 6 figures in the not-too-distant future. Our go-to-market strategies are not just increasing our win rates, however, but also our momentum as evidenced by other Q1 deals, including a 6-figure upsell of Digimarc Engage to an existing customer just over a year after the initial agreement was signed. Additionally, we secured a Digimarc Validate agreement with a new customer within 38 days of our initial discussion as well as revived a previously inactive relationship by signing a Digimarc Validate deal with another new customer only 45 days after reengagement. These achievements highlight the effectiveness of our refined approach and the strong demand for our solutions. The final first quarter wins that I want to highlight today involve the closing of two separate Digimarc Validate deals with divisions of an existing Digimarc customer, one with a division new to our offering, and one with a division who churned in 2023. This 2023 churn was the result of our holding firm on key terms during the renewal process, and the rebound signing is a testament to the incredible value Digimarc Validate provides. Important to note, even during the period during which this division was not a customer, they continued to act as a Digimarc champion in our conversation with other divisions and were key to our closing the new division we signed this quarter as well as progressing other divisions currently in our pipeline. We are thrilled to have this division back as a customer. While not normally a topic discussed voluntarily in prepared remarks, I do want to spend a few minutes discussing customer churn as this is yet another area in which we differentiate. First, as this example shows, while we are not immune to churn, I expect our churn will always remain much lower than other SaaS companies as the solutions we provide tend to be mission critical and Digimarc is unique in being able to provide them. Our premium offerings also mean we do more business with established companies and the overall trends from which we benefit are unlikely to be de-funded by companies undergoing organizational change. Also important to note that not all churn is regrettable, especially for a company that has undergone the transformation that we have executed here. As we have productized functionality previously sold as bespoke offerings and been acting with intentionality to not deviate from our long-term vision, we have been guided by a decision we made at the onset of our transformation and shared with you all on an earnings call in 2021. We will build a focused, profitable, and sustainable business versus pursuing ARR growth at all costs. Not every dollar of revenue is created equal and when forced to choose we will always prioritize the creation of long-term, not short-term, value. While acting as a headwind to our reported net ARR growth since we began our transformation, this headwind of non-regrettable churn is predominantly behind us. And what's more, this discipline will allow us to avoid the distractions that can impede vision realization as well as maximize our overall profitability by maintaining a focus on the profitability of each customer. But this discipline can also lead to short-term benefits as well, and in Q1 we recorded a 6-figure ARR upsell as a result of a legacy customer choosing to accept our right-sized pricing despite this pricing being significantly higher than their legacy deal. Before I turn the call over to Charles, I want to touch on what we refer to as our Ecosystem Driven Opportunities. Digimarc Recycle, Digimarc Validate (Media), and Digimarc Retail Experience. While these opportunities provide game-changing upside that will be extremely fast, profitable, and sticky once they each begin to scale, the ultimate timing of when exactly that happens is tough to predict as it is ultimately outside of our direct control. These opportunities require the collaboration of multiple parties and in some cases may be accelerated by regulatory action. Yet once the spark is lit, they should be extremely sticky and grow exponentially due to well-understood network effects and natural incentives for rapid adoption. Do not read any signaling into what I just said, it is something we've said before. And also let me be very clear in saying that we remain just as excited about these 3 giant opportunities and just as optimistic about the impact they each will have when they do indeed begin to scale. Instead, I wanted to focus today's prepared remarks on the other pieces of our business which don't receive the attention from investors that we believe they should. While Digimarc Recycle, Digimarc Validate Media, and Digimarc Retail Experience tend to make up the vast majority of investor questions, they don't yet contribute in a meaningful way to the incredibly high and accelerating growth we've been delivering in both ARR and commercial subscription revenue. There are many unique aspects to Digimarc, and this is yet another example. We're delivering strong results in the parts of the business where we directly assert control while progressing and growing the untapped opportunities which will provide stair-step increases in growth and profitability when they do indeed occur. An investment in Digimarc is both an investment in a quickly growing and accelerating software business with best-in-class-and-expanding gross margins, and an investment in a company that is progressing towards becoming the de facto market standard in some really exciting and massive opportunities, with a third leg of value provided by our work with the world's Central Banks that delivers steadily growing revenue and high inflation-protected operating margins while acting as a profitable source of commercial intellectual property generation. We are the sum of these 3 pillars of shareholder value and before I give an update on the Ecosystem Driven Opportunities that I fully agree are incredibly exciting components of our future, I wanted to spend the majority of this call on the incredibly exciting components of our business generating ARR today. Digimarc Recycle. As discussed in the last call, we recently launched a new Go-To-Market avenue for this revolutionary product and I am happy to share we are in conversations with multiple parties regarding this new avenue, including 2 parties in the same country. We are also in conversations on 2 continents about leveraging our Center of Expertise Program as a way to bring our partners considerable heft to bear in opening Digimarc Recycle markets. Success on either of these fronts would speed the time to opening of Digimarc Recycle markets while in parallel reducing the associated costs. Success on the latter front would add the additional benefit of bringing these partners into our CoE Program and thus allow for the building of pipeline for our other products as well. Turning to other important developments for Digimarc Recycle, the European Packaging (NYSE: PKG ) and Packaging Waste Regulation has been finalized and we are all awaiting the final full text. Recall that all previous drafts of this regulation mandated digital marking on all packaging as a means to improve waste sortation which would provide an incredibly strong tailwind for opening Digimarc Recycle markets in every country in the EU. Moreover, it has already been made public that the PPWR will mandate Deposit Return Schemes in countries where collections are below a very high bar. This will provide equally strong tailwinds for our ability, in conjunction with partners, to apply the power of Digimarc Illuminate to power these schemes across the European Union. Recall that Digimarc Illuminate provides a differentiated and lower cost means to provide the product authentication required by a performant DRS, and this use case was a key component in the $32 million deal we signed a few quarters ago. Also in Europe, the Holy Grail trial is in its final phase, and while the step-change improvement that digital watermarks will bring to plastic recycling is already widely-acknowledged, we are excited to support this wonderful group through the end of this trial so Digimarc Recycle can claim the powerful validation that will come from receiving an industry-driven Tech Readiness Level 9 designation. We are also supporting this group as they optimize their planning for an initial market launch, and while we are unable to speak to any updates on this front, we do want to flag to our investors to be on the lookout for an exciting update on all Holy Grail activities that we are being told will come soon. On Digimarc Validate Media, as regulators worldwide endeavor to strike the right balance between protecting against the harm of Generative AI without stifling the incredible advancements it will bring, there is an increasing awareness that tools that can do both, like digital watermarks, must be seized. We are actively involved in these conversations, providing our 30 years of expertise in applying digital watermarks to build massive systems of trust and authenticity. In Q1, Digimarc was appointed as a founding member of the National Institute of Standards and Technology's U.S. Artificial Intelligence Safety Institute Consortium and we also announced that along with Adobe (NASDAQ: ADBE ) we are co-chairing the new digital watermark workgroup of the Coalition for Content Provenance and Authenticity or C2PA. On the product front, we released the world's first browser extension to turn Chrome into a C2PA validator and along with our valued partner DataTrails put the finishing touches on the industry's first fully integrated content protection solution to fortify digital content using advanced digital watermarks in tandem with cryptographic proofs, a solution we announced in early April. We are big believers that of all the many benefits GenAI will bring, perhaps the greatest will be to act as the catalyst to deliver the safer, fairer, and more authentic internet we all deserve. To help deliver this much-needed future, we announced in January that we have made our SAFE digital watermarking embedding and detection tools for digital assets free to large ecosystem partners so that our Digimarc Validate customers will have easy access when they are ready to adopt at scale. There is a lot more going on that is not yet ready for broader discussion, but before I close on Digimarc Validate Media, I do want to point everyone to the state of California and Assembly Bill 3211, which is focused on authenticity and watermarking standards and might end up being the catalyst for the catalyst and in so doing, build upon California's proud history of leading the world on important issues. Realizing that real damage is being done every day that action is delayed, the California Assembly has a wonderfully fast timeframe in mind and I was honored to be asked to testify last week on the feasibility of the key provisions in this bill. We are excited to provide our support as this bill continues its fast progress through the California State Assembly and hopefully soon into law. Multiple global regulators are closely watching this bill, and its impact will be felt not just domestically, but around the world. On Digimarc Retail Experience, while there is little we can say about this opportunity due to the immense pride we take in being a trusted supplier, I did mention earlier in the call that we signed an Automate deal with our largest commercial customer who is also key to the broad adoption of Retail Experience by the global CPGs. The opportunities presented for digital transformation between the world's leading product digitization company and a company that touches a mindboggling number of products across multiple touch points, both physical and digital, is truly exciting. And the two most impactful ways to bring those opportunities to fruition are a win their business everyday through a maniacal focus on delivering them excellence and b not speaking about their business on their behalf. I will now turn the call over to Charles to discuss our financial results.\n\nCharles Beck: Thank you, Riley, and good afternoon, everyone. Continuing on the positive trends we delivered in the third and fourth quarters last year, we again delivered improved year-over-year financial performance in the first quarter this year. Ending ARR grew to $23.9 million, representing an 85% increase. Commercial subscription revenue increased 52%. Subscription gross profit margin was 87%, a 7.5 percentage point improvement. Operating expenses decreased 10% and non-GAAP net loss decreased $3.5 million or 39%. I highlight these areas again as they are all critical drivers toward reaching positive free cash flow. Before I begin a deeper review of the quarter, I want to highlight that we've posted a Quarterly Earnings Snapshot presentation to the Investor Relations section of our website, along with our normal quarterly materials. The Quarterly Earnings Snapshot is broken into two parts. The first part provides an overview of our business and contains, among other things, a deeper dive into our three different commercial Go-To-Market motions as well as key details of the three pillars of shareholder value, which Riley highlighted earlier. The second part provides an overview of the quarter and presents our financial KPI's with relevant comparative and trended data. As you will see, we have delivered accelerating growth in both the year - in year 1 and 3-year periods for ARR and commercial subscription revenue, as well as a material improvement in our subscription gross profit margins. We will continue to refine the material in the Quarterly Earnings Snapshot in the quarters ahead, and we welcome your feedback as we strive to provide our investors continued clarity and transparency. ARR increased 85% from $13 million at the end of March last year to $23.9 million at the end of March this year. The increase in ARR largely reflects the impact of new customer contracts and several important customer upsells. As a reminder, we believe ARR is the best leading indicator for future commercial subscription revenue growth. Revenue growth will lag ARR growth as commercial subscription revenue is generally recognized ratably over a contract term versus ARR is calculated upfront upon entering into a contract. You can see this in looking at our Q1 results as ARR increased 85% year-over-year while commercial subscription revenue increased 52%. Total revenue for the quarter was $9.9 million, an increase of $2.1 million or 27% from $7.8 million in Q1 last year, reflecting strong growth in subscription revenue. Subscription revenue, which accounted for 58% of total revenue for the quarter, grew 48% from $3.9 million to $5.8 million. The increase reflects subscription revenue recognized on new customer contracts as well as upsells on existing customer contracts. Commercial subscription revenue grew at an even higher rate at 52%. Service revenue increased 6% from $4 million to $4.2 million. The increase primarily reflects the timing of program work with the Central Banks. Subscription gross profit margin improved from 79.5% in Q1 last year to 87% in Q1 this year, representing a 7.5 percentage point improvement. The large increase year-over-year reflects both the strong growth in subscription revenue combined with a favorable mix in subscription revenue to our newer products, which have higher gross profit margins than our legacy products. Service gross profit margin was down slightly from 56.7% in Q1 last year to 56% in Q1 this year. It is not unusual to see some fluctuation in service margins depending on labor mix for services work. We expect to generate mid-50% service gross profit margins on a normalized basis. Operating expenses for the quarter were $17.1 million compared to $19 million in Q1 last year, a decrease of 10%. Operating expenses in Q1 last year included $2.1 million of one-time severance costs for organizational changes we made in February 2023. Excluding these severance costs, operating expenses were up only $200 thousand year-over-year or 1%, reflecting the impact of annual compensation adjustments for our employees, offset by lower headcount. Company-wide, we continue to focus on ways to maximize our productivity and efficiency as an organization in order to minimize the impact of rising labor and other costs. Non-GAAP operating expenses, which excludes non-cash and non-recurring items, were $13.8 million for the quarter, down 11%, compared to $15.5 million in Q1 last year. Net loss per share for the quarter was $0.50 versus $0.70 in Q1 last year. And non-GAAP net loss per share was also considerably lower for the quarter at $0.27 versus $0.45 in Q1 last year. We ended the quarter with $48.9 million in cash and short-term investments, after raising $32.5 million of gross proceeds through a registered direct offering that closed in February. Free cash flow usage was $8.6 million for the quarter, compared to $8.9 million in Q1 last year. As we foreshadowed on the last earnings call, free cash flow usage in Q1 included annual cash incentive payments to our employees. The company paid annual cash incentives of $2.9 million in Q1 to our employees for exceeding our 2023 financial targets and strategic goals. Excluding these cash incentive payments, free cash flow usage would have been $5.7 million. Given cash flows can fluctuate quarter to quarter depending on the timing of cash inflows and outflows, we continue to believe that a good proxy for a normalized level of free cash flow is using non-GAAP loss and adding the small amount of capital expenditures we invest. Our non-GAAP loss was $5.5 million during Q1 this year versus $9 million in Q1 last year, a decrease of 39%. We also used an additional $1.8 million of cash in Q1 for share repurchases. For further discussion of our financial results, and risks and prospects for our business, please see our Form 10-Q that will be filed with the SEC later this week. I will now turn the call back over to Riley for final remarks.\n\nRiley McCormack: Thanks, Charles. Q1 was another strong quarter for Digimarc. Compared to the quarter a year ago, we grew quarter-ending ARR 85%, grew commercial subscription revenue 52%, and expanded subscription gross profit margin 7.5 percentage points to 87%. While investors remain understandably and rightfully excited about what our massive Ecosystem Driven Opportunities will contribute to our future, I am so proud of what the team is delivering in the massive opportunities in front of us today. Our top line growth has been accelerating from already high levels, our best-in-class gross profit margin continues to expand, and we are positioned to convert an incredibly high percentage of the resultant gross profit dollars to the bottom line by leveraging our partners to further boost our top line in an incredibly OpEx-efficient way. There are many things that make Digimarc a unique and generational investment opportunity. The fact we have three very real, tangible, and quantifiable pillars to our shareholder value story is one of the most powerful and, at the same time, perhaps the least understood. I encourage you all to review the Quarterly Earnings Snapshot deck Charles referenced for more on this front. As always, we remain focused on positioning ourselves to convert our large total addressable market into substantial free cash flow by delivering high and long-lasting growth at world class operating margins. Q1 provided multiple tangible examples of our progress against this focus and we remain excited for what's ahead. Operator, we will now open up the call for questions.\n\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Joshua Reilly with Needham. Please proceed with your question.\n\nJoshua Reilly: Yes. Thanks for taking my question and nice job and congrats on the 85% ARR growth there. I'm curious what's the initial response you're hearing from customers on the next-gen digital watermark upgrade here? And how much of a factor was that in some of the deals that you kind of highlighted here in the quarter? Or is that more something that's going to be on the common as the growth driver in the second half of the year?\n\nRiley McCormack: Thanks, Josh. Thanks for dialing in. Yes, great question. So off the top of my head, I don't think any of the deals that closed in Q1 took advantage of our next-gen digital watermark, but our pipeline is full of them. As we talked about in the last call, one of the - there's a lot of key unlocks from the next-gen digital watermark. One of them is the apply-now activate-later functionality that we can roll out. We talked about how important that was going to be to our CoE program. And I guess stay tuned for our Q2 call. We'll give you more details on the initial up-ramp and success in our CoE program. But that's key there. But even with the brands that we're currently doing business with, having the understanding that, hey, they understand they're taking some of the Digimarc products - some of their products today, maybe regionally with the idea that now they can, during package refresh, apply this apply-now activate-later next-gen digital watermark to all of their packaging, huge, huge, huge unlocking. So, really excited by the initial reception. It is specifically on the CoE program, something that is really driving conversations like many people that are higher CoE tier because that's the only place it's available to our partners. But even with our existing brands and understanding now that they can future-proof all of their packaging even if we're not ready to adopt immediately a Digimarc product, huge unlock and an ARR increase.\n\nJoshua Reilly: Got it. That's helpful. And then on the Digimarc Engage product, with the upgrade now, are you going to be making any changes to your Go-To-Market there? And how should we just kind of be thinking about the potential growth for that product in general with the upgrade?\n\nRiley McCormack: You mean the upgrade by adding the digital functionality?\n\nJoshua Reilly: Yes.\n\nRiley McCormack: Yes. It's just another differentiator, right? So there's a lot of things that, as you know, Digimarc Engage is the one product where potentially the most competitive in terms of having competitors can offer some of the functionality. This is just another differentiation. There's a lot of differentiation we have on the physical side with our thought leadership in digital link, our best-in-class redirection engine, the fact that we are a platform, right? And so a lot of consumer engagement offerings are one-stop shops. So the fact that there's so much more with Illuminate people can do besides Engage, the fact that because of Digital Link and Sunrise 2027, this is becoming more of an IT purchase as opposed to a marketing purchase. So, all of those things play in there. We just opened up another front where we differentiate from everybody else, which is we can provide all that amazing functionality in the digital domain. And while that itself is exciting, both with conversations with end customers, but also partners who are really wrapping their head around what we can do, just by itself that would be exciting, the fact that we could provide a unified view and inform campaigns that are cross domain. This is rarefied air. This is sort of the holy grail of everything that every tech company is trying to do is, yes, it's interesting to track somebody or to provide people content into digital domain, and it's interesting to do that in the analog world. But, man, tying those two together, incredible unlock. And it's a differentiator has resonating.\n\nJoshua Reilly: Got it. That's helpful. And then last question from me. I don't think you've guided this specifically, but how are you thinking about the cash burn for the balance of the year relative to the recent capital raise and the cash that you have on your balance sheet, and kind of just thinking out in terms of capital allocation for the balance of the year? Thanks, ugys.\n\nCharles Beck: Yes. So cash can fluctuate quarter-to-quarter as we kind of - as I highlighted in my prepared remarks. Obviously, Q1 is a lot higher than what we think a normalized level is because of the tax payments. And that's why I highlight back to the non-GAAP loss really being a more normalized level. And so our focus is continuing to grow the top line, expand our margins, reduce costs to continue to decrease our loan GAAP loss which you can see has been trending down significantly year-over-year, down 39%. So that's the primary focus. We don't give guidance itself on cash flow. Part of that is because it's difficult to predict because of the inflows or outflows. But our mission as a company is really focused on driving down that non-GAAP loss, which will directly translate into improved free cash flow.\n\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Jeff Van Rhee with Craig-Hallum Capital Group. Please proceed with your question.\n\nJeff Van Rhee: Hey, guys. Congrats. A couple for me tonight. So just if I could start on the ARR, $24 million up from $13 million a year ago; you've added $11 million to the incremental ARR. Specifically as you're willing to, where has the incremental $11 million in ARR come from with respect to use cases?\n\nCharles Beck: I'd say the majority of it's come from our platform itself. But it's a combination of new contracts, the majority of it over the last year, but then also significant upsells with our customers. And Riley highlighted on several of those in Q1. We've highlighted some of those in prior periods. So it's a combination of really our platform itself and then Validate and Engage are the two other primary drivers.\n\nJeff Van Rhee: Okay. Maybe shift gears to the sales front. As I think about how the sales team operates, I mean - and I'm just looking at like Slide 9 in your deck today, which I appreciate - you've got a ton of end market opportunities. And in thinking through how that sales force is structured, I know you've got greatly enhanced leadership, you're really doing some good things there. Take a minute just talk about your sales org and in particular how the Go-To-Market, how the reps are tasked? How it's broken down right now would be helpful.\n\nRiley McCormack: Yes. So we have direct sales. People that are calling our accounts have industry-focus, geographic focus. And we have our market development team that are focused on some of the bigger opportunities. We are very specific to call it market development and not business development because business development is like 2 to 3 years, market developments 6 to 12 months maybe. Let's actually develop a market so we can unlock it and then throw a bunch more of AEs after that market. And so in the market development are some of our bigger opportunities like the ecosystem-driven opportunities would fall into there, some of the bigger one-off deals, but also lighting up our CoE partners, right? And that's the key unlock here. As to your point, there are so many verticals, so many areas that we could be going after where we don't need to go in there and become an expert in every single vertical. And even if we wanted to be an expert, we don't have the 15 years of showing up to the trade shows that people expect. Vendors, especially vendors in the Validate, the anti-counterfeit space, right, our partners do. And so we have a team focused on opening up the CoE partners. The CoE partners then act as legitimizers. It's a speed to time to market, right, because they have existing customers, they have a pipeline, they have massive sales forces themselves. But it's also the domain expertise. It's coming in and saying, hey, we have this incredible anti-counterfeit partner that should you meet called Digimarc and making those introductions. And so then when those introductions come in, the direct reps pick it up. So, that's really the focus, direct as it's been with market development and the CoE openings comes under market development and then any leads that come out of the CoE program go back to the direct reps unless they are our highest level CoE where they can actually - the partners can actually sign deals on their own paper.\n\nJeff Van Rhee: That's helpful. And then one other for me, if I go back to the Slide 9, I know you are saying here that the individual color codes are not breaking down the pipe necessarily per se by percentages for each of these opportunities. And I am not clear if the general scope of the increase of the annual pipeline that's expressed here is accurate either. So, maybe the question would just be, can you give us a sense - some quantification of the expansion of late-stage pipeline now versus 6 months, 12 months, 18 months ago? Anything along those lines would help.\n\nCharles Beck: I would say the expansion of the pipelines really passed all those key product areas. And I elected that part - I shouldn't say elected, but did mention automate earlier that's a product too that's contributed to ARR. So, I mean it really goes across the gamut here as opportunities you look at on our pipeline. Obviously, CoE is a big area of focus, and we are continuing to improve Validate and Engage opportunities now with both up-selling with new customers as well as the platform. And then we highlight on here two security solutions and deposit return systems. Those are big opportunities in our pipeline as we look forward as well.\n\nRiley McCormack: Yes. And Jeff, we don't talk about our pipeline, we don't quantify our pipeline, but to answer your question, I think your holistic question, it's a lot bigger, obviously, right. I mean we need to have the pipeline ahead of the ARR. And so look at what our AAR (NYSE: AIR ) has done in the pipeline. Looking forward, it has to be there to support it. One of the reasons we don't quantify pipeline, right, is - and we have had this conversation, we have massive opportunities in our pipeline. And no matter what percentage we assign, we are going to be wrong. It's either going to close or it's not going to close, right. So, it gets really tough when you are the size that we are, right. This is a reality we are always going to have. I hope we have these massive boulders in our pipeline, but when they become less massive relevant related to the size of existing, it becomes more noise. For us, it gets really hard to quantify externally pipeline because there is some really - there is wonderfully singles and doubles type business, right. Some examples like the deals that we talked - I talked about in prepared remarks today, but there is also these giant boulders. And it's hard to put it - not hard, it's impossible to put a percentage on them because whatever percentage probability we assign, that's not right. It's either going to close or it's not going to close. It's either zero or 100%.\n\nOperator: Our next question comes from Jeff Bernstein with TD Cowen. Please proceed with your question.\n\nJeff Bernstein: Hey guys. Just wanted to ask a little bit more about the deposit return scheme opportunity. There is a lot written in the last couple of weeks about - in order for these European countries to even sort of get into a positioning where they could be on track for the plastic reuse and recycling goals that they have. They almost have to get on deposit return schemes. Can you just flush that out a little bit and talk a little bit about what kind of timeframes you think that stuff has to happen? And can you tell us if the one that your partner had ongoing has launched yet or kind of any learnings from that?\n\nRiley McCormack: Yes. So, the reason, Jeff, I am guessing you have seen a lot on the DRS stuff is because of the - I don't want to call it a leak because it came from the EU, but they haven't released the final text for the PPWR. So, a lot of the questions you are asking will be in the final text. But they made it very clear that one of the things they have talked about, because they released a few of the bigger policy things, that if for any country where collection is not above an incredibly high bar and I don't remember exactly, I think it's like 90%, incredibly high bar. Yes, we are going to have to roll out DRS, right. And so one of the key parts of a DRS - I mean DRS is a pretty simple concept. You put a deposit on a bottle or a can and then when you return it, you get your deposit back. So, it's not - the systems themselves are pretty easy. The problem is the fraud. And there is a million examples. Lately there was a family in Arizona that's - I don't know what happened, I haven't been following the case, but it was a headline where they made $6 million taking products from Arizona and bring it into California. It's rough, right. And so what they need is a way to authenticate that the products that are being returned actually were part of the deposit return scheme, that there was a $0.05 or $0.10 deposit placed against that product. There is a lot of ways to do product authentication, right. A lot of them are really expensive. Our value that we have to offer through Digimarc Validate is the same value property offered DRS. And in general, lowering the cost of a DRS system, because they are expensive, is wonderful. We can also democratize it in so far, as in a lot of places, it's not just the cost, it's also - they don't have 60,000 square foot supermarkets that could have one of these really expensive RVMs, reverse vending machines. People want to use their cell phone wherever they go on the country side, right. So, that's where we come. And just like we offer a differentiated offering with Digimarc Validate for any product authentication, we can do the same thing, which is a key component of the DRS. And there is not an area that we want to get into directly ourselves. This is an area we will go through our partners, but a really exciting opportunity. We can't wait to see the final text of the PPWR and move forward from there based on all the marching orders. And again, the key thing about the PPWR, right, is the R stands for regulation, which means it's not negotiable. The member states are going to have to adopt whatever is in this final text.\n\nJeff Bernstein: Got it. Okay. And then anything on your partners initial win and how that's progressing and kind of any learnings from that?\n\nRiley McCormack: Yes, progressing well. I don't really know if there is any learnings yet today, but we will - just like with our biggest commercial customer, the best way to earn the trust every day is to not talk about our customers' business on their behalf. But obviously, because this is a national scheme, I would assume it would become very public whenever the country is ready to talk about it, just rolling out I am sure. Once we are allowed to amplify it, trust me, Jeff, we will.\n\nJeff Bernstein: Yes, understand. Okay. And then just I wanted to make sure I understood on automate. Does automate imply that there is some factory automation element to how something's being used, or is that not the right way to automatically think about it?\n\nRiley McCormack: No, that's right. It's in fulfillment centers, distribution centers. It's a way to apply digital watermarks in the Illuminate platform in the process of some sort of automation, right. So, multiple use cases - sorry, multiple locations, right, distribution centers, performance centers, where this could be applied, where there is currently automation today. And either, one, there actually is an automation that's still being done by humans because of the other means identification don't work at all or there is some automation that doesn't work well or it's really expensive because others means of identifications don't work well. And that's the opportunity. If you see in our deck, we will officially launch automate in the not-too-distant future. Incredible, we haven't even launched this product yet, and we have multiple customers not just historic, but if you paid attention to the prepared remarks, there was multiple deals in Q1 just from automate. That is an example of having wonderful partners in this space as well as just a real demand for a high ROI return, which is either we are actually allowing the initial steps of automation that were not existing before. We are also taking an automation though it's kind of kluge here, didn't work well, and bringing it in the 21st century.\n\nJeff Bernstein: Terrific. And then last question. In terms of that newest ability, because I think you only started talking about it pretty recently, of tracking consumer interactions, both in the e-commerce world and then in the physical world, it sounds like you already are signing some deals relating to that?\n\nRiley McCormack: On the digital side?\n\nJeff Bernstein: Yes. Or on a hybrid of - we are going to follow both the e-commerce and physical world, yes?\n\nRiley McCormack: No. So, nothing yet signed. We announced this not too long ago. It takes a while for pipeline. But it's an area of interest, not just directly with some existing customers, but really from our partners because this is something that they wrestle with, our partners, right, is they are getting asked to do some really difficult things. There is a very big partner of ours that's talking about how they are trying to help customers in the multimedia world, right. And they can offer stuff like content repositories or creating artwork, not just for physical packages, but for e-commerce, right. That's all really, really important, really, really interesting. The more opportunities we can offer in this hybrid world through our partners, it just makes their conversations easier. It gives them a reason to ping their existing customers. They had no way to talk in a while. We have this great new partnership that's coming called Digimarc, I will tell you more. So, I would assume here it's going to be partner-led only because our partners get this. And you have a conversation. This is back to the operating leverage our CoEs will give us. You have a conversation with a partner and that partner has got 1,000 salespeople, you can have 1,000 customers or 1,000 conversations with customers through that entity as opposed to us going back during QBR is with our existing customers say, hey, let's say there is a new functionality. So, I would assume this one in particular. And as we have been talking about a lot of our business, customer led. But just like I think Jeff is asking about the apply-now activate-later the next-gen digital watermark, the CoEs get it. And they get it immediately and there is a lot of excitement.\n\nJeff Bernstein: Okay. And just to understand from kind of a real-world example. So, you could have a packaging bar who has been discussing Digimarc watermarked packaging and the interaction that that allows with people who then is going back to say, oh, and by the way, the Digimarc's ability to track all of this in a cloud-based database means that we can now also intercept when somebody has interacted online relative to some offer that you made or relative to something on social media, etcetera, etcetera. And we can wrap that into a complete view of how the person interacted, not just with the package, but with your other advertising or promotional messages.\n\nRiley McCormack: Kind of, but really, so two things, right. The two partners that most get this are the pre-media/printing partners, right. And this is where customers are coming to them and saying, hey, how do we apply with Sunrise 2027, you are the packaging expert or hey, we want to put a QR code on our packaging for consumer engagement, right. Up until now, they are like, right, we can put a QR code on and do this stuff. They didn't have the technical back-end or the expertise or the technology to say, I am so glad you asked us about that. Let's talk about how we are going to apply this, not just to your physical packaging, but also for all your owned multimedia. Let's have a broader conversation where we are not just talking about packaging, which tends to be a competitive industry, right, on fair purpose. Let us talk about this whole thing we can offer even in the digital domain. And that makes their end customers a lot stickier because now they are not just coming to procure articles in a packing, they are coming to them to solve a bigger - to get what they wanted to do with QR codes, whether it is a direct consumer channel, but across both the packaging but also the internet. The other big area of partners are the advertising agencies, right. So, these advertising agencies are in charge of coming up with campaigns and one of the things we can offer is not just stickier customers or a chance to reach out, they also can monetize and build a campaign. We don't want to be in the content creation business of putting together this - I mean some of these campaigns are seven figures because they are incredibly complex and beautiful and detailed, and you have seen the quality of ads, like its super pulse, right. That's not an area that we want to get into. But now they, as an advertising agency, can say, hey, I know we have been talking about a certain campaign. Can you imagine if we not - if we brought your physical products and not just the internet into this or vice versa, if we actually could bring in the internet to your physical - what you plan to do in the physical world, maybe it's bus stops, maybe it's on a store - point of sales in the store. And not only can you follow the consumer and tell them, as you - as we are rolling out this campaign, you can hit them in both the physical and digital domain. You can also get the data back. And that is the most powerful point is that, the old adage in advertising is that half your advertising dollars are wasted, you just don't know which half. What people advertise because they want to get consumers to buy things, that is the reason advertising exists. And now you can actually run campaigns, whether they are email campaigns or internet campaigns and say, yes, it wasn't just engagement or open rakes. I know which one of these campaigns led to somebody interacting with the physical product within, pick-your-favorite time, 48 hours. It's a holy grail. And it can - the same way that advertising became so much more effective with the advent of online, the next wave is, okay, now that you have online, how do you tie online activity to physical behavior, that's the holy grail. Advertising spends about to get an impression...\n\nOperator: There are no further questions at this time. I would now like to turn the floor back over to Riley McCormack for closing comments.\n\nRiley McCormack: Well, thank you everybody for joining us today. That's all we have.

[Operator Instructions] Please note this conference is being recorded. I will now turn the conference over to your host, Steven Hooser, with Three Part Advisors. Sir, you may begin.\n\nSteven Hooser: Good morning, everyone, and welcome to the Distribution Solutions Group First Quarter 2024 Earnings Call. Joining me on today's call are DSG's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Bryan King; and Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Ron Knutson. In conjunction with today's call, we have provided a financial results slide deck that is posted on the company's website at investor.distributionsolutionsgroup.com. Please note that statements made on this call and in today's press release contain forward-looking statements concerning goals, beliefs, expectations, strategies, plans, future operating results and underlying assumptions that are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those described. In addition, statements made during this call are based on the company's views as of today. The company anticipates that future developments may cause those views to change, and we may elect to update the forward-looking statements, but disclaim no obligation to do so. Management will also refer to non-GAAP measures, and reconciliations to the nearest GAAP measures can be found at the end of our earnings release. The earnings release issued earlier today was posted on the Investor Relations section of our website. A copy of the release has also been included in a current report on 8-K filed with the SEC. Lastly, this call is being webcast on the Internet via the Distribution Solutions Group Investor Relations page on our website. A replay of the teleconference will be made available through May 16, 2024. With that, I'd now like to turn the call over to Bryan King. Bryan?\n\nBryan King: Thanks, Steven, and thank you all for joining us to review first quarter 2024. I'll be starting on Slide 4 to review overall financial results. Our 2024 first quarter sales totaled $416 million, up 19.5% on strategic inorganic growth compared to the first quarter a year ago. As we signaled on our Q4 2023 call, DSG was up against double-digit comps in the first quarter of 2023 of nearly 14% and faced continued softness in certain end markets, which we will highlight later in the call. Despite those continued pockets of softness, we maintained a positive organic trajectory on a 2-year organic basis of 4.7%, which we acknowledge is below our expectation for organic growth that we require from our investment initiatives into the business when we use a longer time horizon lens. Consolidated EBITDA margins enjoyed a sequential improvement from 8.4% in the fourth quarter of 2023 to an adjusted EBITDA margin of 8.7% in the first quarter of 2024, but we are below where we expect them to be, partially because of the pockets of end market softness, but also significantly influenced by the internal initiatives that we are executing, where there are near-term costs, but where real expense optimization and profitability and efficiency is getting unlocked. We continue to enjoy strong visibility into how those initiatives are reworking significant elements of our cost structure while visibly improving our value-added offering for our customers and customer-facing colleagues and refining the profitability discipline on that revenue across each of our three DSG verticals. Today, I will reemphasize DSG's overarching goals and longer-term performance milestone objectives, reinforcing our confidence in the huge opportunity in front of us and the material progress we're making, even in the face of some marketplace softness and the accountability and engagement our collective team embraces. During our 2023 Investor Day last September, we shared that DSG's long-term value creation plans and programs were based on specific commercial growth initiatives and process and structural optimization work streams. These initiatives were and continue to be a bridge for us to grow into structurally higher margins while enjoying stronger organic growth and accelerating returns on invested capital over the next several years. As stated, our 5-year goal is to increase total sales to over $3.3 billion, which our plan indicates will be driven about equally from organic and inorganic growth initiatives. And we expect that level of revenue will generate adjusted EBITDA in excess of $450 million and will significantly drive the returns on invested capital profile and earnings per share and free cash flow per share profile of this highly value-added specialty distribution business. All three of our verticals have a clear path with the assets we own today to deliver EBITDA margins consistent with our corporate objective. Although we acknowledge that each of the three verticals currently enjoy a very different fully optimized structural EBITDA margin opportunity, we believe that the two acquisitions we have closed this year to consolidate with Lawson improves EBITDA margins and our return on invested capital. As we shared our detailed initiatives with investors last fall, I think it is important to hold ourselves accountable with our shareholder partners on our progression, acknowledging the pockets of end-market headwinds we have faced, while offering discrete data points on the numerous initiatives that are confirming the foundation today for the exciting progression we expect will continue to unfold as we move DSG towards our defined future state. In January, we acquired Emergent Safety Supply, or ESS, under the Lawson Products banner. ESS is an example consistent with our inorganic investment objective of adding a commercial growth initiative, in this case, bolstering our safety offering to our MRO and OEM customers and expanding our existing VMI capabilities inside their facilities to offer a logical product category expansion requested by our customers and sales force. We believe it is one that is ubiquitous across our customer base, allowing for an increase in wallet share of existing customers, and more earning opportunity and productivity for our sales force, allowing us to add some upgrades and talent depth in key areas of growth, while augmenting and driving more opportunities for cross-selling, not only across our MRO offering, but for our OEM relationships, where we recognized it would enhance our proposed MRO solution when introducing our MRO capabilities in categories to our OEM customer relationships. Safety is a key category where our leadership team strongly believes that investing in an improved offering was an important organic growth accelerating opportunity through our existing relationships and service delivery models. We also announced S&S Automotive acquisition yesterday, which I will discuss in a moment. These two highly deliberate inorganic growth acquisitions highlight how we have identified opportunities within our DSG and specialty distribution relationships to engage businesses with product and service capabilities and deep customer relationships and marketplace presence. When combined with our existing network of offerings, this creates an enhanced DSG specialty offering, improving and deepening our value proposition to our customers and allowing for improved sales optimization and cross-sell expansions focusing on our committed lens to driving higher structural returns across DSG, the vertical the acquisition is being acquired into and higher structural returns on the acquisition itself. Reflecting on our capital allocation around acquisitions over the last 24 months, we are excited about how they significantly enhance each of our verticals' ability to accomplish our profitability objectives and customer engagement vision, as well as drawing together the three verticals into a solutions focused DSG value proposition. Looking across each of our specialty distribution verticals, we continue to progress dialogues with targeted acquisitions that add product or value added capabilities, driving more scale to transform certain categories or lines of business to accelerate our efforts towards improved marketplace leadership and to generate meaningfully higher levels of free cash flow and returns on invested capital. ESS and S&S Automotive are great examples of strategic acquisitions that benefits our customers, sales teams and shareholders. The downstream impact of both acquisitions creates more customer engagement, more expertise in targeted product categories and more solutions and services catered to our combined customers throughout expanded cross-selling opportunities and better sales density. The outcome is positive with higher productivity and compensation opportunity across each sales force, while driving structurally higher EBITDA margins and returns on our invested capital. These downstream effects can be large and wide, and we believe they work toward creating durable and repeatable results and accelerate the organic growth rate of DSG. Turning to Slide 5, let's walk through key initiatives and end-market trends in each of our business verticals. Our MRO focused business, Lawson Products, launched an important sales force transformation in 2023 with a foundation built on a structure of approximately 900 high producing and highly motivated field sales reps. We also expanded our inside sales team last fall to approximately 40 individuals from only a few and added 14 technical product specialists. We are in the early innings of this sales optimization program, which includes fine tuning our investments in working capital and technology tools to help our sales force's effectiveness and productivity, as well as deliberate lens around designing and optimizing new sales territories as we refocus our attention around driving opportunity for existing field sales reps and recruiting additional reps into a role with enhanced tools and opportunity. We are very pleased with early results as our productivity measured as sales reps per day increased 8% in quarter one over a year ago on top of 18% and 15% improvements in the last two quarters of 2023. We continue to analyze and leverage data to optimize our overall sales force network, including going live with our CRM tool in the first quarter as well as an enhanced order entry tablet for our field sales reps to drive ease and productivity around placing customer orders and offering more insights to our salesperson about additional revenue opportunities to grow that customer. This full implementation of Lawson CRM connects our entire sales force into the order management system, greatly improving our visibility into the sales organization and accelerating the ROI of our sales force transformation, addressing our stated goal to improve both the initial and structural earnings available to our sales force and enhance our service levels with our engaged customers, while additionally driving a productivity lift that should improve our selling expense across our total revenue base and elevate our EBITDA margin structurally higher. As I mentioned, we are in the early stages of our progression with defined milestones that should unfold this year and the next two, and we will continue to hold ourselves accountable, reporting consistently on this key initiative. In addition, Lawson continues to concentrate on product expansion and resources that customers truly value as part of our MRO service delivery intensive VMI offering. We believe this is critical as we refine our product mix and increase our customer density, expertise, value-added tools and capabilities to engage with new and existing customers. Our process and structure optimization efforts are improving how we go to market at Lawson and effectively utilize people, processes and products. Lawson had a good first quarter, especially considering we were up against organic comp growth of over 19% reported in prior year quarter. The 2-year stack organic growth in the first quarter for Lawson Products was nearly 12%, plus we added a few million dollars of acquired sales from ESS for most of the first quarter. The biggest headwind to sustaining organic revenue growth this quarter was overwhelmingly government, where we have seen a delay in purchase orders, although we remain confident the dollars are there to be spent later this year. Yesterday, we announced another acquisition under the Lawson banner, S&S Automotive Group. S&S and our existing Kent Automotive business, which has enjoyed sustained leadership in our organic growth in the last few years, operate in large and growing markets in North America, such as auto collision repair and dealership aftermarket businesses. According to the National Automobile Dealers Association, there are 16,835 light vehicle dealerships in the United States. Those dealers wrote 264 million repair orders in 2023, with total part sales of $142 billion. Additionally, only 34% of dealers have auto body shop capabilities. By adding S&S to the Kent offering, we can improve our customer value proposition with more SKUs and services tailored to this large market. Kent focuses primarily on collision repair centers in the U.S. and Canada, where S&S focuses more on auto dealerships in the Midwest, where they have strong density and market share. These business go-to-market models are similar, with both organizations offering value added high-touch customer engagement. They each have complementary product leadership that allows each company to credibly expand their product offering with their existing customers, significantly enhancing the organic growth opportunity. We believe increasing our market density, especially in the Midwest geographies, and leveraging facilities and exceptional localized human capital will immediately increase our sales force productivity and improve our margin for our total automotive division. We are confident that combining Kent with S&S will allow us to drive our EBITDA margins for this business above our target margins for DSG and to drive our Kent and S&S returns on invested capital to specialty distribution market leadership levels. Our deliberate structural lift in the return profile and market leadership presence with this acquisition of our automotive repair line of business inside of Lawson is an exceptional example of what we have and expect to continue to accomplish with targeted strategic acquisitions at DSG. As expected, the first quarter returned to double-digit EBITDA margins for Gexpro Services. Although the core business was down slightly compared to the prior year on tough comps, sales grew sequentially by 4.2% compared to the fourth quarter on comparable days. We also experienced strong double-digit sequential and quarter-over-quarter improvements in the sales in the aerospace and defense vertical. Also in the A&D end markets, we are excited about the lift in the number of new projects and services, including new kitting awards and VMI plant production services. We are winning and implementing new program awards faster-than-expected, which builds our backlog and positions us well for the remainder of 2024 and onto the future. It also offers us confidence about the enhanced value Gexpro Services brings to its customers as part of DSG and with the value added capabilities we invested in with our last couple of years of tuck-in acquisitions. And no one is more excited about the Hisco acquisition and its expanded capabilities, product lines and strong geographic presence in Mexico than the Gexpro Services team, except perhaps Cesar and the Lawson team. Our technology end markets, which were such a drag during 2023 to profitability in the Gexpro Services division especially in the last half of last year, in the first quarter of 2024, continued to be down compared to a year ago, dragging on EBITDA and EBITDA margin for the division, partly due to the tougher comps in the first part of 2023. However, we are encouraged to see that first quarter sales to our technology customers improve sequentially compared to the third and fourth quarters of 2023, citing an increase in new orders and hopefully, messaging, we are past the trough of the semiconductor cycle. Regarding the semiconductor industry as it was an important element of the profitability that we missed out on for most of last year and some of this first quarter, we hear that most companies are signaling trough level sales in the first quarter with auto chip sales reporting better-than-expected results and core industrial sales improving. It's also worth noting that our renewables business has slowly ramped upward with recent sequential improvements between the fourth quarter of '23 and the first quarter of '24, and our customers are reflecting confidence in the progression. Our overall confidence in the OEM business is supported by an increase in gross margins for year-over-year results and sequential margin improvements. On a sales comparison basis, we are past our toughest quarter comparisons of the year and are excited that our project services backlog is growing. We are also excited to see a ramp in our new VMI program wins, market share growth and wallet share expansion with many long-standing customers. On a sequential basis, all of our end markets are either stabilized or growing, which gives us more confidence year-over-year, and we expect sequential improvement as 2024 develops. Also starting last year, our project-based businesses from the Frontier, Resolux and SIS 2022 acquisitions started positioning us as strategic suppliers instead of competitors with those three now business units of Gexpro Services, which with our expanded capabilities and touch points brought by coming together, especially in a market like renewables, that is seeing activity from customers precedent to a real revenue recovery from a tough year last year is allowing us to expand our market share. Those complementary tuck-in acquisitions enhance the expanded capabilities we now enjoy and will continue to benefit us in 2024 and on. As a refresher, adding those key channel partners offers us a more comprehensive and differentiated solution to a broader customer base, which supports our stated objective around Gexpro Services margin expansion plan by doing more of the value added work around the source product versus leaning more on being the leading OEM partner for specking, sourcing and managing Class C parts already in the form of a finished good product. The Gexpro Services business unit also benefits from an expanded investment in e-commerce capabilities, adding several million dollars of incremental revenue from e-commerce orders from established aerospace and defense accounts. As we mentioned last year, Gexpro Services started the year with a healthy book-to-bill pipeline, growing it as it progressed into 2024. Turning to TestEquity Group. The electronic and specialty production supplies categories remained soft in the first quarter and were impacted by difficult sales comparisons from this time last year, weighing on the OEM as well as the MRO parts of the TestEquity Group. Weakness in sales into wireless communications and semiconductor production also weighed on the OEM and MRO parts of the group. The biggest drag on revenue and profitability, though, for the TestEquity Group continues to be the test and measurement in markets, which became more challenged in late September by what appeared to be an anxiousness around continued spending on capital equipment as the extended interest rate tightening cycle started weighing on business confidence and on capital spending on R&D towards the end of last year. The revenue pressure and marketplace impacts were exacerbated by the product surplus in the channel by some of our suppliers and competitors. After a period of supply chain disruption coming out of COVID, the delayed delivery on customers' orders and perhaps over message to manufacturers and suppliers about where demand was playing out. A shift in customer behavior caught the channel with too much product on hand. As some try to push excess product, profitability for most was doubly impacted by weakness in sales and a natural discounting and temporary pricing activity, which only further stimulates unnatural demand and customer behavior and prolongs the disruptive period in the channel. We thought much of the dynamic was done by the end of the year, but then saw some of this behavior lingering in the first quarter. We certainly believe there was a better backdrop around inventory, pricing and demand by the end of the quarter than existed throughout the fourth quarter. We believe trends will continue to normalize as the year progresses against weaker comparisons and less rebalancing of inventory in the channel, but it's taken longer than expected. While we don't have enough conviction to call an inflection around a reacceleration, there appears to be some stability returning in the customer demand, which with cleaner inventories, we expect will help profitability. Since the fourth quarter of 2023, we've identified more synergy opportunities bringing Hisco into the TestEquity Group as we now believe approximately $15 million of cost synergies will be realized during 2024 as we work through integrating Hisco and TestEquity, up from the $10 million that we indicated was our estimate at the end of 2023. Real progress is being made, although expenses associated with integration efforts are still flowing through, masking some of the underlying progress to structural margins. Hisco Mexico TestEquity Mexico, for instance, have been integrated and four facilities have been closed as well as some duplicative warehouse headcount has been relieved. In the U.S. and Canada, another five consolidations have been completed and two more are in process. This footprint rationalization saves over $1.2 million annually. One of the facilities allows us to exit a less optimized own building that we believe will also release $4.95 million of cash back to the balance sheet as we sell it. Additionally, given the softness of sales in the T&M business, we are actively identifying and accelerating further opportunities for cost rationalization. Adjusted EBITDA for the TestEquity Group improved, but is down versus a year ago. However, gross margins have stabilized despite sales headwinds over the last two quarters, and gross margin initiatives identified during our underwriting across our recent acquisitions are starting to yield a meaningful impact at levels ahead of where we underwrote at this point, masked some by the noisiness of the soft end markets and the continued inventory channel messiness and softness in the test and measurement marketplace. We realize it will take several quarters to see the real run rate benefits of our structural changes to improve overall margins. But as an example, by building the first layer of strategic pricing discipline in the pricing model at Hisco for their small customers, differentiating pricing from their largest customers, we saw gross margins increase by almost 150 basis points across all of Hisco just in the first quarter. TestEquity Group is a big ship to turn, and we are very pleased with the Hisco acquisition, both in how this complementary and strategic acquisition improves the mix shift towards a more reoccurring OEM and MRO offering as well as enhances the profitability and scale of this industrial technologies business unit with more consumables and lower price points that serve the electronics assembly and lab equipment customers. With Hisco's addition, the steep engagement this business unit now has with Gexpro Services and Lawson is remarkably different as they work together with real added benefits on working to expand their collective engagements with their longstanding customers and new ones that have requested us to bid on contracts with a lens towards a broader DSG set of capabilities. With the Hisco addition, there is now a combined revenue growth initiative populated with a very capable team of sales leadership from each of the three verticals and some of the specialty business unit leaders. There's also significant enthusiasm at Lawson an Gexpro Services leadership teams around the added footprint that Hisco brings with significant scale throughout North America, most specifically offering a platform for our customers requesting Gexpro Services in Lawson to expand their engagements into Mexico. Distribution Solutions Group serves a broad diverse set of end markets with over 180,000 customers. We deliver and ship from strategically located distribution and service centers to customers throughout North America and Europe, Asia, South America and the Middle East. Our decentralized operations that maintain brand identity and integrity, coupled with an integrated growth platform, offer DSG's customers access to unique, differentiated, high touch products and solutions, sourcing advantage and expertise through businesses that leverage best practices to deliver world-class service to our customers every day. With that, I'd like to turn the call to Ron to walk through the financials.\n\nRon Knutson: Thank you, Bryan, and good morning, everyone. Turning to Slide 5, I will first summarize our business, which includes our acquisitions for the trailing 12 months. Lawson represents 31% of total DSG revenue, Gexpro Services 23%, and the TestEquity Group represents 46% of revenues. Our run rate adjusted revenue is now approximately $1.73 billion. And as Bryan mentioned, we serve over 180,000 customers across more than 500,000 SKUs. Now turning to Slide 6, I will summarize the reported results for the first quarter, and then I will break out each reporting segment. Consolidated revenue for the quarter was $416.1 million. This represents an increase of $67.8 million or 19.5%, primarily driven by the 2023 and 2024 acquisitions. Excluding the acquisitions, organic sales declined by 8.6% on a comparable day basis, however, grew 4.7% on a 2-year stacked basis. The organic decline versus a year ago was driven primarily within the Test & Measurement business and very strong comps from a year ago in all verticals. On a sequential basis versus the fourth quarter of 2023, organic sales grew by 2.1% as we saw several end markets such as technology, strengthen sequentially and also realize continued strong sales in aerospace and defense. Q1 of 2024 reflected growth in net margin dollars of $2.2 million versus the fourth quarter of 2023. As indicated on the Q4 2023 earnings call, we expected margin pressure in the first half of 2024. While the quarter ended with softer sales, our margin profile came in line with our near-term expectations. For the quarter, we generated adjusted EBITDA of $36.1 million or 8.7% of sales, a sequential improvement over 8.4% in Q4, and I'll expand further at the segment level here in a minute. We reported operating income of $2.8 million for the quarter, net of $10.7 million of acquisition-related intangible amortization and $16.2 million of aggregate costs from stock-based compensation, acquisition, severance and retention related expenses, merger and acquisition costs and other nonrecurring items. Adjusted operating income was $29.8 million as compared to $32.8 million a year ago quarter and $28 million in the fourth quarter of 2023. We reported GAAP diluted loss per share of $0.11 for the quarter, inclusive of higher depreciation and amortization and a valuation allowance on certain deferred tax assets, compared to earnings per share of $0.14 in the year ago. Adjusted diluted EPS was $0.25 for the quarter on 4.2 million more shares outstanding than a year ago. Turning to Slide 7, let me now comment briefly on each of the segments. Starting with Lawson Products. Sales were $118.2 million, down 4.2% on comparable days, primarily from very strong comps a year ago of nearly 20%. As compared to the fourth quarter, sales increased 7.6% or 4.2% on a same-day basis. This growth was driven by the acquisition of Emergent Safety Supply in January, which contributed approximately $2.3 million in sales in the first quarter, plus organic daily growth of 2.2%. Growth continues both over a year ago and sequentially within our strategic and Kent Automotive customers, offset by softening sales to the Lawson core customers. As Bryan highlighted, Lawson is coming off of a really strong 2023, all while continuing to invest in its business to strategic position itself for long-term success. We are still in the early innings of implementing initiatives to help our sales team become more productive while fine-tuning our sales investments to grow sales. We are very pleased with the initial improvement in our sales rep productivity, resulting in an 8% lift this quarter on top of 18% and 15% realized in the last two quarters of 2023. We have open field sales rep positions that we are actively recruiting for in the right territories that should help drive sequential sales growth in future quarters. For the quarter, Lawson realized adjusted EBITDA of $13.4 million or 11.4% of sales. While this is down versus a year ago quarter on lower sales in our 2023 investments, sequentially, adjusted EBITDA grew by $1 million with a slight margin expansion. Turning to Gexpro Services on Slide 8. Total sales for the quarter decreased 2.3% to $98.7 million, however, increased 4.2% on comparable days from the fourth quarter of 2023. As discussed in the past, comps against the prior year are tough given the flattening of sales in the technology end market in 2023. That vertical was down nearly 26% from a year ago quarter. However, we are seeing signs of improvement as Q1 2024 sales within that end market exceeded sales in both Q3 and Q4 2023 on a standalone basis. 2023 saw global semiconductor spending decline roughly 10% as consumer electronics and automobile production drove softness in supply chains adjusted, which certainly is impacting our year-over-year comparisons. Two acquired businesses, which sell into the renewables space also put pressure on year-over-year comps. Excluding the technology and renewables end markets, sales grew 3% over a year ago quarter and 4.2% over Q4, giving us additional confidence for the remainder of 2024. Gexpro Services has continued to see strong demand in the aerospace and defense vertical being up 24% over a year ago and 15% over Q4. We continue to invest in the business, attracting new customers and new opportunities within existing customers. However, we are cautious about certain weaker markets and those more sensitive to current macroeconomic issues. As expected, through some modest recovery in sales, along with a focus on gross margin improvements and cost controls, we returned to double-digit margins for this quarter. Gexpro Services EBITDA was $10.8 million or 11% of sales despite margin pressure of approximately $1.7 million from the technology vertical and the acquired businesses supporting renewables. Lastly, I will turn to TestEquity Group on Slide 9. Q1 sales grew 74.3% to $187.1 million, an increase of $79.8 million driven by the 2023 acquisition of Hisco. Excluding Hisco, TestEquity sales were down 14.6% in Q1 and 6.5% on a comparable day basis versus Q4, primarily driven by continued weakness in the Test & Measurement business. As we've discussed on previous calls, the decline in this piece of our business is primarily related to delays in customers' capital project spending associated with continued higher interest rates and an imbalance of demand against the improved supply chain disruptions from a year ago. Excluding the Test & Measurement market, sales grew nearly 1% over Q4 on three additional selling days. TestEquity's adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was $11.6 million or 6.2% of sales. With the expected pressure on sales, the business has stabilized from a margin perspective. We are actively taking actions to protect our margins within the TestEquity Group and also realizing savings from the integration of Hisco. As we think about the remainder of 2024 for TestEquity, we will continue to focus on the integration of Hisco in TestEquity. We remain committed to sequentially improving our margin profile as 2024 develops through higher sales, synergies to be realized on the combined company and proactively rebalancing our cost structure. Between the merger savings and other cost normalization, we are focused on delivering approximately $15 million of cost savings in 2024. We anticipate a stronger second half of 2024 for the TestEquity Group as we continue to integrate Hisco and some additional pickup of capital project type spending. Moving on to Slide 10. We ended the quarter with approximately $284 million of liquidity, including $85.6 million of cash and $198.3 million under our existing credit facility. A portion of that availability has now been utilized to fund the purchase of S&S Automotive. We continued to focus on strengthening our balance sheet and ended the first quarter at a leverage rate of 3.0x. The acquisition of S&S Automotive subsequent to the quarter does not significantly change our leverage profile given the strong double-digit acquired EBITDA of that business. Although we continue to support a robust working capital investment, we are carefully managing inventories, accounts receivables and accounts payable. Our cash conversion ratio defined as adjusted EBITDA, less the change in working capital and less CapEx divided by adjusted EBITDA was nearly 110% on a trailing 12-month basis and approximately 75% for the first quarter. Net capital expenditures, including rental equipment, were $2.9 million for the first quarter. We expect full year CapEx to be in the range of $16 million to $20 million or approximately 1% of revenue in 2024. Before I turn it back to Bryan, I'd like to make some comments on how we see the remainder of 2024 developing. As we've discussed over the past two quarters, we were up against very tough organic sales comps with Q1 of 2023 having been up nearly 14%. Q2 2023 organic sales were up nearly 5%. Given some of the sales pressures that we continue to see, in particular in the Test & Measurement business, offset by some strengthening in other end markets, we expect Q2 organic sales to be flat to down low single digits as compared to a year ago, however, up sequentially from Q1 of this year. As we make traction on many of our initiatives in 2024 and as comps against the prior year soften, we would expect organic sales growth to turn positive starting in the second half. To achieve our internal sales plans, we will need some normalization of various end markets and some recovery of customer capital related project spending. While we realized Q1 margin expansion over Q4, our focus continues to be on improving margin profiles within all of our segments on a sequential quarterly basis. I'll now turn the call back over to Bryan.\n\nBryan King: Thank you, Ron. The first quarter met our near-term targets, especially given the continued softness in the several end markets highlighted, and we are pleased to see positive trends in many verticals that have been under pressure for several quarters. Turning to Slide 11, DSG's capital allocation framework remains disciplined and flexible, encouraging healthy competition for capital across our businesses. At the core, we believe in the compounding effect of cash flow reinvestment in the business on a per share basis. With a focus on bridging to higher structural margins, we believe that inorganic growth provides strategic opportunities for bolt-on acquisitions that provide us scale, geographic density, new customer channels, cross-sell opportunities and product or service level category expansion, all with an objective to enjoy sustained and structurally higher returns on invested capital, more driven by organic growth than inorganic growth as the platform matures. Finally, the capital allocation equation will not be complete without focusing on prudent debt paydowns and opportunistic share repurchases. These allow us to rebalance the company's weighted average cost of capital and return capital to the shareholders, especially as the platform matures. Combining our asset light model and increasing working capital efficiencies improves our overall liquidity position, allowing us to reduce our net borrowings. Let me wrap up my comments on Slide 12. The first quarter showed sequential top line and bottom line progress against challenging prior year sales comparisons and some very real pockets of soft demand. Lawson had solid margins as we continue to dial in a number of the key initiatives and acquisitions for our longer term opportunity to take this unique VMI offering to structurally higher margins. Gexpro Services returned to double-digit margins as expected and enjoyed seeing its collection of end market verticals firm up confidence in their OEM schedules for the back half of the year based on communication with us, building backlog, and excitedly, we saw new programs indicate that organic revenue growth based on market share wins is happening enhanced by our DSG platform capabilities and the acquisitions that we have added to the platform to improve our value propositions. And the TestEquity Group's margin stabilized despite continued end market challenges, while the heavy lifting integration is progressing as scheduled, while yielding more synergy cost wins and the commercial confidence in what Hisco brings to DSG continues to build across all the verticals. All three leadership teams on these verticals have been challenged with the environment we are in and the number of value unlocking initiatives we are working with them on. I want to personally thank them and their colleagues for their consistent effort and value-creating accomplishments they are delivering for us, the shareholders and how accountable the collective team is holding each other too. We are very pleased with the hard work and progress coming out of our corporate development team on acquisitions that provide DSG with product and solution expansion and extensions in our business units and with their collaboration with the business unit leadership teams as they work to facilitate an acquisition all the way through its integration. Our M&A playbook is active, and we are excited about our current pipeline to continue to deliver largely directly sourced, extremely commercially enhancing high return invested capital, accretive acquisitions that fit our objective to build a best-in-class, high value, high touch specialty distribution business for our shareholder partners, our customers and importantly, our DSG colleagues. Additionally, as I highlighted, because of the continued evidence we see and customers acknowledge for expanded opportunities for cross-selling, spanning our premier specialty distribution company, with great enthusiasm, we've expanded and dedicated more resources to a cross business unit commercial initiative to grow cross-selling revenue and also to leverage value added capabilities to improve the success of each vertical in their own marketplaces. As DSG's Chairman, CEO and largest affiliate shareholder, we fully align with our public investor partners to drive long-term value creation for our shareholders. Investor outreach continues to be our focus. We will attend the Barrington and KeyBanc conferences in May and the East Coast IDEAS Conference in New York in June. With that, operator, we'd like to open the call for questions.\n\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Our first question is coming from Tommy Moll with Stephens Inc. Your line is live.\n\nTommy Moll: I wanted to start on S&S. I presume that was a directly sourced deal. So any context you could give us on a relationship there, how the deal came to you and then also just the go-forward on integration. And while on that, Bryan, you said some complementary things about your development team. You want to put a bogey on how many more deals you'll get over the finish line this year. It sounds like the pipeline is full.\n\nBryan King: Oh gosh. Thanks, Tommy. Let's start with S&S, and I'll let Ron add some additional color here. But -- so the Kent Automotive division, which was something that was bought, Ron, maybe 20 years ago or so?\n\nRon Knutson: Yes, 20 plus.\n\nBryan King: Over 20 years ago, is the kind of a line of business inside of the Lawson Products business model, very similar, but just largely discrete set of SKUs for collision and maintenance repair work on automotive. And S&S was the best competitor that was competing with us in the Midwest. And they had built a really strong, dense market share. They were started in the 60s, I think, early 60s, two families owned them. And the operating family that had kind of taken over from the original founding family had done an extremely good job running the business. And so we started a dialogue with them maybe a couple of years ago. And this has taken quite a long time and a lot of time on both sides to try and work through getting a transaction done. But it was so important to building value in the Kent Automotive division that our leadership team and our corporate development team and the sellers stayed committed to the process. So we are -- we couldn't be more excited about an acquisition that we've done over the last several years. This one took a lot of effort from a lot of people, not to take anything away from others that we've done. But yes, it was direct source, it was direct dialogue. There were lots of nuances to work through, but it provides a tremendous amount of EBITDA margin uplift and strategically an opportunity for complementary product leadership to drive structurally higher organic revenue opportunity for both sides over the coming years. As we've started to do more work on Lawson Products and I'll digress just for a second, I know I'm going to get trouble for this. But there's lines of businesses inside of Lawson that are not -- don't have structurally today as high of EBITDA margin as we are enjoying in our U.S. domestic Lawson business. And so as we see opportunities to punch to higher margin, EBITDA margin and returns on the Lawson core, we are looking at these pockets. And so Kent has had tremendous -- has had kind of a leadership in the clubhouse around organic growth the last couple of years, had strong organic growth even in this first quarter. But we needed more density there in order to pull it over double-digit EBITDA margins from where it was sitting, and this does it in spades. And so that was -- so not only did it bring it immediately to double-digit EBITDA margins, but it gives us strong visibility to be able to take it to margins that are consistent with what we would expect we can do over time with Lawson. So we are doing some of the same analysis with other lines of business inside of Lawson as we are across our other verticals. That's where the corporate development team is spending a lot of their time. We've identified across each of our leadership teams, areas that we can fill in to try and bring the whole to a higher value added proposition with trying to drive performance out of different verticals that we've got even inside of each of the three business units, if you will, more broadly. And they do have a lot on their plate. There are other opportunities that we're pushing forward on that we think are key to our objectives to meeting our longer term defined goal. So there's -- I don't want to get too deep into the pipeline. There was a funnel that we have. And I don't know, Ron, if you want to offer more discreteness on it, but most of it, Tommy, is direct source, and that takes a lot of effort. And so you start conversations like we did with S&S and -- on some of the others that we've done and some of the others that we are working on. And you -- it's hard to anticipate how long it's going to take to get them to closing line. Hisco was another one that was really direct source. We spent years talking to them and then you kind of try and progress that. And we didn't have a lot of conviction or confidence on what the time line was going to look like to get to a closing table. We just had a lot of confidence that there was a tremendous amount of value if we could land it. And the other side, the counterparty was committed in that case -- both of these cases to being partners with DSG. Anything to add, Ron?\n\nRon Knutson: Yes. The only thing I would add to that, Bryan, is a lot of the Kent Automotive growth over the many -- over the past few years has been certainly building relationships with auto dealerships, but also heavier in the collision repair shops. And S&S Automotive heavily focused on auto dealerships. And so typically, there -- the auto dealership spend is typically greater than a collision repair shop. So to Bryan's point, I think it puts us in a great position, there's -- to expand SKU availability within all of the end customers, very really little to no end customer overlap and very little SKU overlap as well. So great opportunity on both ends to be able to leverage both product availability and then also really having now a foothold into servicing the auto dealership market.\n\nTommy Moll: Thank you, both. I wanted to follow-up on the outlook you provided. Ron, I appreciate the context on the second quarter from a revenue standpoint. I wanted to ask on margin, just to make sure I heard you correctly. Did I hear you say for each segment and then obviously for the consolidated results, you're looking for margins to be up sequentially in 2Q? And if I did hear that correctly, any noteworthy callouts on that trajectory would be appreciated.\n\nRon Knutson: Sure. Yes, Tommy. So yes, you did hear that correctly. From an organic sales perspective, we've got certainly visibility into the first month of the quarter here. Again, we'll be up against some sales pressure against the, call it, 5% organic growth that we realized in the second quarter of '23. And then just, I would say, probably some continued pressure that sits out on Test & Measurement that seems to be kind of prolonging longer than what we initially anticipated from probably as we were looking at this late last year. From a margin perspective, yes, you heard that correctly as well. Our expectation going into the second quarter is that we would realize margin -- incremental margin improvement sequentially within all three of the verticals. Individually, there's initiatives taking place within Lawson, Gexpro Services and TestEquity Group to be able to -- for us to be able to make that comment. And we feel like we are on a nice path as 2024 develops to be able to sequentially see some improvement there. We -- as you know, we don't provide formal guidance. So I can't really give you a number around that, but we do expect sequential improvement from where we ended the first quarter.\n\nTommy Moll: Thank you. I appreciate it, and I will turn it back.\n\nBryan King: Just on -- on the -- Ron, on the -- just to add that, one of the things that we did get with the close of April was -- and again, 2 months is not a trend is that we are seeing -- we've seen now 2 months of a very slight tick up relative to what we saw in the fourth quarter and the first couple of months of the first quarter on the Test & Measurement side. So we are hoping that what that is indicating is more clean channel in terms of inventory overhang. And we are feeling like that there's money out there to spend on test and measurement equipment. It's just a matter of the confidence that the customer has in letting that spending on more of a capital asset loose.\n\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is coming from Kevin Steinke with Barrington Research. Your line is live.\n\nKevin Steinke: Hi. Thanks for taking my question. So I just wanted to ask about the Lawson sales representative headcount, about 860. It seems to be down a bit from where it was historically, but you also mentioned that you had open positions that you're recruiting for and you want to build that out in certain territories. So maybe just talk about the trend in the Lawson sales rep headcount, both kind of from an attrition standpoint and where you'd like to grow it, how do you like to grow it going forward?\n\nRon Knutson: Sure. Kevin, I'll take that. So yes, as we commented in our prepared remarks, we are down slightly from an overall headcount perspective. And I would say that it's not overly unexpected through some of the changes that we put in place through 2023 to help our sales reps become more productive, along with some of the shifts that we've talked about in terms of building out our inside sales team and so forth. We did expect that we would take incrementally a few steps down just in terms of the total count. We are actively, in the marketplace, recruiting for additional sales reps, and I would say probably better defining the territories that we believe that can drive our sales on a go-forward basis. We are now looking at more of a combination of really very specific market data in terms of those end markets that we believe can really provide an opportunity for us, not only for where some of our existing sales reps are at, but also new territories that we can enter into. So we -- we've -- so again, I wouldn't say that it's overly surprising that we are down from a rep count perspective. We'll say that for us, feet on the ground and a number of inside sales reps can put some pressure on our average daily sales just in terms of the number of sales reps on a combined basis that are out actively selling. But we believe that, that's part of the growth as we move throughout the rest of 2024.\n\nBryan King: I'm just going to touch on that. Kevin, the part of Cesar and the analysis that we did, we brought in -- we intuitively -- Ron and I've known this now probably for the last couple of years. It was refreshing for Cesar in bringing in an outside consulting firm to really look at what we needed to do in order to make sure that our reps were making structurally more money, while at the same time as our cost to serve was also heading in the right direction. And so we had, at one point, Ron, 1,050, almost 1,100 reps, and we had [indiscernible] territories at that time. And today, the way we look at the business is more like at this stage, 900 -- they're 900 defined territories. And so that means that we kind of went back and reworked and looked at what a territory needed to look like in order to make sure that we were allowing a sales rep an opportunity, both someone who is a starting rep to get to have a higher likelihood of success and to get to profitability for us faster. We are adding a lot of tools for them, which are also going to help them. But a lot of the insight is taking territories that we had that were maybe too thin or that were -- that needed to be reworked. And it's hard to do that when you've got somebody in those territories. And so part of the process was making sure that we -- as we've had some turnover that we were slow to backfill some of those chairs so that Cesar and his team could really look at how to consolidate and rework and to get some better organization out of how we had our territories and how -- what our route structures look like for our salespeople. And so that all is going to allow both higher level of productivity and compensation for our reps, and it's also going to drive our cost to serve down over time. And so, Ron, several years ago, when we were shareholders and I wasn't in the chair I'm in, was giving metrics around cost to serve. And at one point, it was up in the 30s, I think if I remember, and we were trying to get 1% of selling costs a year out of the business. And we -- we are back in a mode where we can see line of sight to how what used to be 25% might be 15% as it relates to where we want to go in terms of total productivity out of our reps and total volume out of them. And that means that the reps going to make 30% or 40% more than what they did maybe on an average comp basis. I think it's -- where we want to be is probably -- I think it's 30% or 35% more than where they were or 40% more than where they were on an average basis a couple of years ago.\n\nKevin Steinke: Okay, great. That's helpful color. I will turn it back over ...\n\nBryan King: There's 70 -- there's 35 new territories and there's 35 backfills that are open efforts right now. Is that too much detail, Ron?\n\nKevin Steinke: That's great. I appreciate the -- all the detail as usual. I will turn it back over. I have to jump on to another call, but appreciate all the comments as usual.\n\nBryan King: Thanks, Kevin.\n\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next question is coming from Katie Fleischer with KeyBanc Capital. Your line is live.\n\nKatie Fleischer: Good morning. I was wondering if you could give a little bit more color on the commentary from the government orders that drove some of the weakness in Lawson and maybe when you would expect an inflection in that.\n\nBryan King: Yes, I hit that in my early comments and Ron can probably give more discreteness to it. There was a change in the way that the government -- every 5 or 7 years, I guess, they change their order entry program, and that's something that could be disruptive for all of us that sell in -- small piece goods into the Class C parts into the government. And then there's also was just kind of a lot of spending that was -- that we knew -- that we know is out there and that we can see that's coming towards us, but it was a pretty significant delay in some spending that took place in the first quarter. There was about equal parts between a broad set of customers across our up and down the street core business at Lawson and then government. And the two of the -- decrease from prior year first quarter for Lawson was about equally weighted to those two areas or strategic accounts were up in the first quarter versus a year ago, and that's just continuing to grow engagement with the relationships that we've got there. But that was a big detractor to Lawson's organic growth in the first quarter. Ron, do you want to ...\n\nRon Knutson: Yes. Bryan, I would just add to that. You're spot on in terms of the ordering system that we are now and others as well are required to go through. And it's just a longer process, Katie. So it's -- we saw some of that decrease versus a year ago within that end segment for us. The other piece I would say is, I mean, the government, the military business is its great business for Lawson. I mean there is a high demand of the consumable Class C parts that we sell. We've not lost any locations, any large locations that we've historically seen some pretty large volumes in the past. So it's not that we are concerned about any customer attrition around that. It's just -- it's more timing. Our sense is that, that will come back to us for the most part throughout the rest of 2024. Certainly, it's not an all catch up, let's call it, in one quarter. I think it will come back gradually to us as 2024 develops.\n\nKatie Fleischer: Okay. That's helpful. And then just one more on test & measurement. So I know you mentioned that it's difficult to have a really strong sense of when these markets are going to inflect just based on the limited visibility. But what are some signs that you would look for from your end markets or from your customers that would give you confidence that this demand is starting to come back?\n\nRon Knutson: Yes. So -- and Katie, Bryan had commented on this a little bit as well. When we look at that test & measurement business, even on a monthly basis as to how the first quarter developed, we -- March was stronger than both January and February on a standalone basis and really was back to levels that we saw kind of in the November and December time frame. So we feel like we've -- that business has kind of leveled off at the bottom right now. What I would say is that in the test & measurement piece for us is really kind of two separate -- I divide it into two separate areas. One, TEquipment, which is one of the acquisitions that was made a year or so ago, they sell what I would say, more handheld units, lower average purchase price. That business was up sequentially Q4 into Q1 of this year. So that's a good sign that we continue to see down a little bit versus a year ago quarter, but sequentially up Q4 versus Q3. So I think that's a good sign that there's some additional demand coming back in the lower price point items. On the larger items, we continue to see some pressure there. But to my point earlier, March was the strongest month of the quarter. So for us, we are staying very connected into our customer base. Again, really no customer attrition there. It's more that -- what we are hearing from our customers is that the capital spend continues to be delayed. And the other piece, and I think we commented on this in the Q4 call, and I described it as almost the perfect storm was that perfect storm going in the wrong direction. But the demand dried up primarily from delay of capital projects on higher interest rates, not shortly thereafter all the supply chain issues surrounding that end market were resolved. So there was a pent-up demand that came through or pent-up supply that came through and kind of mid-2023 -- early to mid 2023, that release of the supply chain kind of hit squarely with the slowdown in the demand. So hopefully, that helps. But Bryan, certainly, any additional thoughts you may have on that.\n\nBryan King: So look, that is -- I think Ron laid out a nice framework there. Katie, there -- when we are looking at TestEquity and we are looking at Hisco and we are looking across that division, there was a -- we hit the nadir as it turned out from what we've seen so far in January and February. We kind of hit the bottom of the lowest average or kind of lowest volume that we were seeing through Test & Measurement specifically. And that's really, for us, looking at the desktop larger versions as opposed to what we are selling through TEquip or the [indiscernible] type handhelds. And Keysight and Tektronix would be our largest vendors there by far. And there was a nice kind of inflection point, it appears, but 2 months isn't a trend because we still got lots of kind of concern about what's going on, on the true demand side. But some of the messiness in the channel and some of the activity in terms of quoting picked back up, and we saw by March, the revenue levels and then April stepped up again back to kind of where they were at the highest level during the 3 months of the fourth quarter, not yet by any means back to where they were in the first half of last year or even the third quarter. And so that -- the nice thing is that we've kind of -- we saw a sell-off or kind of a decline in activity. One of the things that we are also looking at is when we look at the OEM side of our engagements with Hisco, which are largely with similar type of customers and similar sort of industry verticals, we are seeing -- we are seeing percentage declines in OEM programs that are still active in some of those segment markets. So if you think about wireless and communications or industrial electronics, the Hisco is seeing some -- had some volume in the activity in the programs that were coming through the OEM programs of declines there. And those were reflecting kind of more amplified impact that we were seeing over TestEquity on buying test and measurement equipment. So there's confirmation that it's -- some of what's going on seems to be in those industry verticals and that they're just -- they aren't making as much through their OEM facilities or if they're having some struggles in their own end markets, they're probably not spending as much money on their R&D equipment in their labs. And so at some point in time, we are -- just because the way that we think it's trending, we think that those dollars are going to be coming back. But we don't feel like we've lost customers. We do think we lost orders at times during the fourth quarter and maybe even a little bit in the first quarter where there was a natural pricing activity that we weren't willing to match.\n\nKatie Fleischer: Okay, great. Thanks for all the color.\n\nOperator: Thank you. As we have no further questions on the lines at this time, I will turn the call back over to Mr. Bryan King for any closing remarks.\n\nBryan King: Well, that's -- I think, we really appreciate everybody's time. Obviously, we've got still a lot of moving parts in the business. We are very encouraged with the work and accountability that our teams have been putting in across each of the three verticals. And we've got a lot of confidence in the business that we are continuing to build and how we can drive returns on invested capital and structural margins over the coming years. Thank you for your time today. We look forward to speaking with you again when we report our second quarter results in early August. And have a great day.\n\nOperator: Thank you. This concludes today's conference, and you may disconnect your lines at this time, and we thank you for your participation.", "source": {"uri": "investing.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

[Operator Instructions] Please note this conference is being recorded. I will now turn the conference over to your host, Steven Hooser, with Three Part Advisors. Sir, you may begin.\n\nSteven Hooser: Good morning, everyone, and welcome to the Distribution Solutions Group First Quarter 2024 Earnings Call. Joining me on today's call are DSG's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Bryan King; and Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Ron Knutson. In conjunction with today's call, we have provided a financial results slide deck that is posted on the company's website at investor.distributionsolutionsgroup.com. Please note that statements made on this call and in today's press release contain forward-looking statements concerning goals, beliefs, expectations, strategies, plans, future operating results and underlying assumptions that are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those described. In addition, statements made during this call are based on the company's views as of today. The company anticipates that future developments may cause those views to change, and we may elect to update the forward-looking statements, but disclaim no obligation to do so. Management will also refer to non-GAAP measures, and reconciliations to the nearest GAAP measures can be found at the end of our earnings release. The earnings release issued earlier today was posted on the Investor Relations section of our website. A copy of the release has also been included in a current report on 8-K filed with the SEC. Lastly, this call is being webcast on the Internet via the Distribution Solutions Group Investor Relations page on our website. A replay of the teleconference will be made available through May 16, 2024. With that, I'd now like to turn the call over to Bryan King. Bryan?\n\nBryan King: Thanks, Steven, and thank you all for joining us to review first quarter 2024. I'll be starting on Slide 4 to review overall financial results. Our 2024 first quarter sales totaled $416 million, up 19.5% on strategic inorganic growth compared to the first quarter a year ago. As we signaled on our Q4 2023 call, DSG was up against double-digit comps in the first quarter of 2023 of nearly 14% and faced continued softness in certain end markets, which we will highlight later in the call. Despite those continued pockets of softness, we maintained a positive organic trajectory on a 2-year organic basis of 4.7%, which we acknowledge is below our expectation for organic growth that we require from our investment initiatives into the business when we use a longer time horizon lens. Consolidated EBITDA margins enjoyed a sequential improvement from 8.4% in the fourth quarter of 2023 to an adjusted EBITDA margin of 8.7% in the first quarter of 2024, but we are below where we expect them to be, partially because of the pockets of end market softness, but also significantly influenced by the internal initiatives that we are executing, where there are near-term costs, but where real expense optimization and profitability and efficiency is getting unlocked. We continue to enjoy strong visibility into how those initiatives are reworking significant elements of our cost structure while visibly improving our value-added offering for our customers and customer-facing colleagues and refining the profitability discipline on that revenue across each of our three DSG verticals. Today, I will reemphasize DSG's overarching goals and longer-term performance milestone objectives, reinforcing our confidence in the huge opportunity in front of us and the material progress we're making, even in the face of some marketplace softness and the accountability and engagement our collective team embraces. During our 2023 Investor Day last September, we shared that DSG's long-term value creation plans and programs were based on specific commercial growth initiatives and process and structural optimization work streams. These initiatives were and continue to be a bridge for us to grow into structurally higher margins while enjoying stronger organic growth and accelerating returns on invested capital over the next several years. As stated, our 5-year goal is to increase total sales to over $3.3 billion, which our plan indicates will be driven about equally from organic and inorganic growth initiatives. And we expect that level of revenue will generate adjusted EBITDA in excess of $450 million and will significantly drive the returns on invested capital profile and earnings per share and free cash flow per share profile of this highly value-added specialty distribution business. All three of our verticals have a clear path with the assets we own today to deliver EBITDA margins consistent with our corporate objective. Although we acknowledge that each of the three verticals currently enjoy a very different fully optimized structural EBITDA margin opportunity, we believe that the two acquisitions we have closed this year to consolidate with Lawson improves EBITDA margins and our return on invested capital. As we shared our detailed initiatives with investors last fall, I think it is important to hold ourselves accountable with our shareholder partners on our progression, acknowledging the pockets of end-market headwinds we have faced, while offering discrete data points on the numerous initiatives that are confirming the foundation today for the exciting progression we expect will continue to unfold as we move DSG towards our defined future state. In January, we acquired Emergent Safety Supply, or ESS, under the Lawson Products banner. ESS is an example consistent with our inorganic investment objective of adding a commercial growth initiative, in this case, bolstering our safety offering to our MRO and OEM customers and expanding our existing VMI capabilities inside their facilities to offer a logical product category expansion requested by our customers and sales force. We believe it is one that is ubiquitous across our customer base, allowing for an increase in wallet share of existing customers, and more earning opportunity and productivity for our sales force, allowing us to add some upgrades and talent depth in key areas of growth, while augmenting and driving more opportunities for cross-selling, not only across our MRO offering, but for our OEM relationships, where we recognized it would enhance our proposed MRO solution when introducing our MRO capabilities in categories to our OEM customer relationships. Safety is a key category where our leadership team strongly believes that investing in an improved offering was an important organic growth accelerating opportunity through our existing relationships and service delivery models. We also announced S&S Automotive acquisition yesterday, which I will discuss in a moment. These two highly deliberate inorganic growth acquisitions highlight how we have identified opportunities within our DSG and specialty distribution relationships to engage businesses with product and service capabilities and deep customer relationships and marketplace presence. When combined with our existing network of offerings, this creates an enhanced DSG specialty offering, improving and deepening our value proposition to our customers and allowing for improved sales optimization and cross-sell expansions focusing on our committed lens to driving higher structural returns across DSG, the vertical the acquisition is being acquired into and higher structural returns on the acquisition itself. Reflecting on our capital allocation around acquisitions over the last 24 months, we are excited about how they significantly enhance each of our verticals' ability to accomplish our profitability objectives and customer engagement vision, as well as drawing together the three verticals into a solutions focused DSG value proposition. Looking across each of our specialty distribution verticals, we continue to progress dialogues with targeted acquisitions that add product or value added capabilities, driving more scale to transform certain categories or lines of business to accelerate our efforts towards improved marketplace leadership and to generate meaningfully higher levels of free cash flow and returns on invested capital. ESS and S&S Automotive are great examples of strategic acquisitions that benefits our customers, sales teams and shareholders. The downstream impact of both acquisitions creates more customer engagement, more expertise in targeted product categories and more solutions and services catered to our combined customers throughout expanded cross-selling opportunities and better sales density. The outcome is positive with higher productivity and compensation opportunity across each sales force, while driving structurally higher EBITDA margins and returns on our invested capital. These downstream effects can be large and wide, and we believe they work toward creating durable and repeatable results and accelerate the organic growth rate of DSG. Turning to Slide 5, let's walk through key initiatives and end-market trends in each of our business verticals. Our MRO focused business, Lawson Products, launched an important sales force transformation in 2023 with a foundation built on a structure of approximately 900 high producing and highly motivated field sales reps. We also expanded our inside sales team last fall to approximately 40 individuals from only a few and added 14 technical product specialists. We are in the early innings of this sales optimization program, which includes fine tuning our investments in working capital and technology tools to help our sales force's effectiveness and productivity, as well as deliberate lens around designing and optimizing new sales territories as we refocus our attention around driving opportunity for existing field sales reps and recruiting additional reps into a role with enhanced tools and opportunity. We are very pleased with early results as our productivity measured as sales reps per day increased 8% in quarter one over a year ago on top of 18% and 15% improvements in the last two quarters of 2023. We continue to analyze and leverage data to optimize our overall sales force network, including going live with our CRM tool in the first quarter as well as an enhanced order entry tablet for our field sales reps to drive ease and productivity around placing customer orders and offering more insights to our salesperson about additional revenue opportunities to grow that customer. This full implementation of Lawson CRM connects our entire sales force into the order management system, greatly improving our visibility into the sales organization and accelerating the ROI of our sales force transformation, addressing our stated goal to improve both the initial and structural earnings available to our sales force and enhance our service levels with our engaged customers, while additionally driving a productivity lift that should improve our selling expense across our total revenue base and elevate our EBITDA margin structurally higher. As I mentioned, we are in the early stages of our progression with defined milestones that should unfold this year and the next two, and we will continue to hold ourselves accountable, reporting consistently on this key initiative. In addition, Lawson continues to concentrate on product expansion and resources that customers truly value as part of our MRO service delivery intensive VMI offering. We believe this is critical as we refine our product mix and increase our customer density, expertise, value-added tools and capabilities to engage with new and existing customers. Our process and structure optimization efforts are improving how we go to market at Lawson and effectively utilize people, processes and products. Lawson had a good first quarter, especially considering we were up against organic comp growth of over 19% reported in prior year quarter. The 2-year stack organic growth in the first quarter for Lawson Products was nearly 12%, plus we added a few million dollars of acquired sales from ESS for most of the first quarter. The biggest headwind to sustaining organic revenue growth this quarter was overwhelmingly government, where we have seen a delay in purchase orders, although we remain confident the dollars are there to be spent later this year. Yesterday, we announced another acquisition under the Lawson banner, S&S Automotive Group. S&S and our existing Kent Automotive business, which has enjoyed sustained leadership in our organic growth in the last few years, operate in large and growing markets in North America, such as auto collision repair and dealership aftermarket businesses. According to the National Automobile Dealers Association, there are 16,835 light vehicle dealerships in the United States. Those dealers wrote 264 million repair orders in 2023, with total part sales of $142 billion. Additionally, only 34% of dealers have auto body shop capabilities. By adding S&S to the Kent offering, we can improve our customer value proposition with more SKUs and services tailored to this large market. Kent focuses primarily on collision repair centers in the U.S. and Canada, where S&S focuses more on auto dealerships in the Midwest, where they have strong density and market share. These business go-to-market models are similar, with both organizations offering value added high-touch customer engagement. They each have complementary product leadership that allows each company to credibly expand their product offering with their existing customers, significantly enhancing the organic growth opportunity. We believe increasing our market density, especially in the Midwest geographies, and leveraging facilities and exceptional localized human capital will immediately increase our sales force productivity and improve our margin for our total automotive division. We are confident that combining Kent with S&S will allow us to drive our EBITDA margins for this business above our target margins for DSG and to drive our Kent and S&S returns on invested capital to specialty distribution market leadership levels. Our deliberate structural lift in the return profile and market leadership presence with this acquisition of our automotive repair line of business inside of Lawson is an exceptional example of what we have and expect to continue to accomplish with targeted strategic acquisitions at DSG. As expected, the first quarter returned to double-digit EBITDA margins for Gexpro Services. Although the core business was down slightly compared to the prior year on tough comps, sales grew sequentially by 4.2% compared to the fourth quarter on comparable days. We also experienced strong double-digit sequential and quarter-over-quarter improvements in the sales in the aerospace and defense vertical. Also in the A&D end markets, we are excited about the lift in the number of new projects and services, including new kitting awards and VMI plant production services. We are winning and implementing new program awards faster-than-expected, which builds our backlog and positions us well for the remainder of 2024 and onto the future. It also offers us confidence about the enhanced value Gexpro Services brings to its customers as part of DSG and with the value added capabilities we invested in with our last couple of years of tuck-in acquisitions. And no one is more excited about the Hisco acquisition and its expanded capabilities, product lines and strong geographic presence in Mexico than the Gexpro Services team, except perhaps Cesar and the Lawson team. Our technology end markets, which were such a drag during 2023 to profitability in the Gexpro Services division especially in the last half of last year, in the first quarter of 2024, continued to be down compared to a year ago, dragging on EBITDA and EBITDA margin for the division, partly due to the tougher comps in the first part of 2023. However, we are encouraged to see that first quarter sales to our technology customers improve sequentially compared to the third and fourth quarters of 2023, citing an increase in new orders and hopefully, messaging, we are past the trough of the semiconductor cycle. Regarding the semiconductor industry as it was an important element of the profitability that we missed out on for most of last year and some of this first quarter, we hear that most companies are signaling trough level sales in the first quarter with auto chip sales reporting better-than-expected results and core industrial sales improving. It's also worth noting that our renewables business has slowly ramped upward with recent sequential improvements between the fourth quarter of '23 and the first quarter of '24, and our customers are reflecting confidence in the progression. Our overall confidence in the OEM business is supported by an increase in gross margins for year-over-year results and sequential margin improvements. On a sales comparison basis, we are past our toughest quarter comparisons of the year and are excited that our project services backlog is growing. We are also excited to see a ramp in our new VMI program wins, market share growth and wallet share expansion with many long-standing customers. On a sequential basis, all of our end markets are either stabilized or growing, which gives us more confidence year-over-year, and we expect sequential improvement as 2024 develops. Also starting last year, our project-based businesses from the Frontier, Resolux and SIS 2022 acquisitions started positioning us as strategic suppliers instead of competitors with those three now business units of Gexpro Services, which with our expanded capabilities and touch points brought by coming together, especially in a market like renewables, that is seeing activity from customers precedent to a real revenue recovery from a tough year last year is allowing us to expand our market share. Those complementary tuck-in acquisitions enhance the expanded capabilities we now enjoy and will continue to benefit us in 2024 and on. As a refresher, adding those key channel partners offers us a more comprehensive and differentiated solution to a broader customer base, which supports our stated objective around Gexpro Services margin expansion plan by doing more of the value added work around the source product versus leaning more on being the leading OEM partner for specking, sourcing and managing Class C parts already in the form of a finished good product. The Gexpro Services business unit also benefits from an expanded investment in e-commerce capabilities, adding several million dollars of incremental revenue from e-commerce orders from established aerospace and defense accounts. As we mentioned last year, Gexpro Services started the year with a healthy book-to-bill pipeline, growing it as it progressed into 2024. Turning to TestEquity Group. The electronic and specialty production supplies categories remained soft in the first quarter and were impacted by difficult sales comparisons from this time last year, weighing on the OEM as well as the MRO parts of the TestEquity Group. Weakness in sales into wireless communications and semiconductor production also weighed on the OEM and MRO parts of the group. The biggest drag on revenue and profitability, though, for the TestEquity Group continues to be the test and measurement in markets, which became more challenged in late September by what appeared to be an anxiousness around continued spending on capital equipment as the extended interest rate tightening cycle started weighing on business confidence and on capital spending on R&D towards the end of last year. The revenue pressure and marketplace impacts were exacerbated by the product surplus in the channel by some of our suppliers and competitors. After a period of supply chain disruption coming out of COVID, the delayed delivery on customers' orders and perhaps over message to manufacturers and suppliers about where demand was playing out. A shift in customer behavior caught the channel with too much product on hand. As some try to push excess product, profitability for most was doubly impacted by weakness in sales and a natural discounting and temporary pricing activity, which only further stimulates unnatural demand and customer behavior and prolongs the disruptive period in the channel. We thought much of the dynamic was done by the end of the year, but then saw some of this behavior lingering in the first quarter. We certainly believe there was a better backdrop around inventory, pricing and demand by the end of the quarter than existed throughout the fourth quarter. We believe trends will continue to normalize as the year progresses against weaker comparisons and less rebalancing of inventory in the channel, but it's taken longer than expected. While we don't have enough conviction to call an inflection around a reacceleration, there appears to be some stability returning in the customer demand, which with cleaner inventories, we expect will help profitability. Since the fourth quarter of 2023, we've identified more synergy opportunities bringing Hisco into the TestEquity Group as we now believe approximately $15 million of cost synergies will be realized during 2024 as we work through integrating Hisco and TestEquity, up from the $10 million that we indicated was our estimate at the end of 2023. Real progress is being made, although expenses associated with integration efforts are still flowing through, masking some of the underlying progress to structural margins. Hisco Mexico TestEquity Mexico, for instance, have been integrated and four facilities have been closed as well as some duplicative warehouse headcount has been relieved. In the U.S. and Canada, another five consolidations have been completed and two more are in process. This footprint rationalization saves over $1.2 million annually. One of the facilities allows us to exit a less optimized own building that we believe will also release $4.95 million of cash back to the balance sheet as we sell it. Additionally, given the softness of sales in the T&M business, we are actively identifying and accelerating further opportunities for cost rationalization. Adjusted EBITDA for the TestEquity Group improved, but is down versus a year ago. However, gross margins have stabilized despite sales headwinds over the last two quarters, and gross margin initiatives identified during our underwriting across our recent acquisitions are starting to yield a meaningful impact at levels ahead of where we underwrote at this point, masked some by the noisiness of the soft end markets and the continued inventory channel messiness and softness in the test and measurement marketplace. We realize it will take several quarters to see the real run rate benefits of our structural changes to improve overall margins. But as an example, by building the first layer of strategic pricing discipline in the pricing model at Hisco for their small customers, differentiating pricing from their largest customers, we saw gross margins increase by almost 150 basis points across all of Hisco just in the first quarter. TestEquity Group is a big ship to turn, and we are very pleased with the Hisco acquisition, both in how this complementary and strategic acquisition improves the mix shift towards a more reoccurring OEM and MRO offering as well as enhances the profitability and scale of this industrial technologies business unit with more consumables and lower price points that serve the electronics assembly and lab equipment customers. With Hisco's addition, the steep engagement this business unit now has with Gexpro Services and Lawson is remarkably different as they work together with real added benefits on working to expand their collective engagements with their longstanding customers and new ones that have requested us to bid on contracts with a lens towards a broader DSG set of capabilities. With the Hisco addition, there is now a combined revenue growth initiative populated with a very capable team of sales leadership from each of the three verticals and some of the specialty business unit leaders. There's also significant enthusiasm at Lawson an Gexpro Services leadership teams around the added footprint that Hisco brings with significant scale throughout North America, most specifically offering a platform for our customers requesting Gexpro Services in Lawson to expand their engagements into Mexico. Distribution Solutions Group serves a broad diverse set of end markets with over 180,000 customers. We deliver and ship from strategically located distribution and service centers to customers throughout North America and Europe, Asia, South America and the Middle East. Our decentralized operations that maintain brand identity and integrity, coupled with an integrated growth platform, offer DSG's customers access to unique, differentiated, high touch products and solutions, sourcing advantage and expertise through businesses that leverage best practices to deliver world-class service to our customers every day. With that, I'd like to turn the call to Ron to walk through the financials.\n\nRon Knutson: Thank you, Bryan, and good morning, everyone. Turning to Slide 5, I will first summarize our business, which includes our acquisitions for the trailing 12 months. Lawson represents 31% of total DSG revenue, Gexpro Services 23%, and the TestEquity Group represents 46% of revenues. Our run rate adjusted revenue is now approximately $1.73 billion. And as Bryan mentioned, we serve over 180,000 customers across more than 500,000 SKUs. Now turning to Slide 6, I will summarize the reported results for the first quarter, and then I will break out each reporting segment. Consolidated revenue for the quarter was $416.1 million. This represents an increase of $67.8 million or 19.5%, primarily driven by the 2023 and 2024 acquisitions. Excluding the acquisitions, organic sales declined by 8.6% on a comparable day basis, however, grew 4.7% on a 2-year stacked basis. The organic decline versus a year ago was driven primarily within the Test & Measurement business and very strong comps from a year ago in all verticals. On a sequential basis versus the fourth quarter of 2023, organic sales grew by 2.1% as we saw several end markets such as technology, strengthen sequentially and also realize continued strong sales in aerospace and defense. Q1 of 2024 reflected growth in net margin dollars of $2.2 million versus the fourth quarter of 2023. As indicated on the Q4 2023 earnings call, we expected margin pressure in the first half of 2024. While the quarter ended with softer sales, our margin profile came in line with our near-term expectations. For the quarter, we generated adjusted EBITDA of $36.1 million or 8.7% of sales, a sequential improvement over 8.4% in Q4, and I'll expand further at the segment level here in a minute. We reported operating income of $2.8 million for the quarter, net of $10.7 million of acquisition-related intangible amortization and $16.2 million of aggregate costs from stock-based compensation, acquisition, severance and retention related expenses, merger and acquisition costs and other nonrecurring items. Adjusted operating income was $29.8 million as compared to $32.8 million a year ago quarter and $28 million in the fourth quarter of 2023. We reported GAAP diluted loss per share of $0.11 for the quarter, inclusive of higher depreciation and amortization and a valuation allowance on certain deferred tax assets, compared to earnings per share of $0.14 in the year ago. Adjusted diluted EPS was $0.25 for the quarter on 4.2 million more shares outstanding than a year ago. Turning to Slide 7, let me now comment briefly on each of the segments. Starting with Lawson Products. Sales were $118.2 million, down 4.2% on comparable days, primarily from very strong comps a year ago of nearly 20%. As compared to the fourth quarter, sales increased 7.6% or 4.2% on a same-day basis. This growth was driven by the acquisition of Emergent Safety Supply in January, which contributed approximately $2.3 million in sales in the first quarter, plus organic daily growth of 2.2%. Growth continues both over a year ago and sequentially within our strategic and Kent Automotive customers, offset by softening sales to the Lawson core customers. As Bryan highlighted, Lawson is coming off of a really strong 2023, all while continuing to invest in its business to strategic position itself for long-term success. We are still in the early innings of implementing initiatives to help our sales team become more productive while fine-tuning our sales investments to grow sales. We are very pleased with the initial improvement in our sales rep productivity, resulting in an 8% lift this quarter on top of 18% and 15% realized in the last two quarters of 2023. We have open field sales rep positions that we are actively recruiting for in the right territories that should help drive sequential sales growth in future quarters. For the quarter, Lawson realized adjusted EBITDA of $13.4 million or 11.4% of sales. While this is down versus a year ago quarter on lower sales in our 2023 investments, sequentially, adjusted EBITDA grew by $1 million with a slight margin expansion. Turning to Gexpro Services on Slide 8. Total sales for the quarter decreased 2.3% to $98.7 million, however, increased 4.2% on comparable days from the fourth quarter of 2023. As discussed in the past, comps against the prior year are tough given the flattening of sales in the technology end market in 2023. That vertical was down nearly 26% from a year ago quarter. However, we are seeing signs of improvement as Q1 2024 sales within that end market exceeded sales in both Q3 and Q4 2023 on a standalone basis. 2023 saw global semiconductor spending decline roughly 10% as consumer electronics and automobile production drove softness in supply chains adjusted, which certainly is impacting our year-over-year comparisons. Two acquired businesses, which sell into the renewables space also put pressure on year-over-year comps. Excluding the technology and renewables end markets, sales grew 3% over a year ago quarter and 4.2% over Q4, giving us additional confidence for the remainder of 2024. Gexpro Services has continued to see strong demand in the aerospace and defense vertical being up 24% over a year ago and 15% over Q4. We continue to invest in the business, attracting new customers and new opportunities within existing customers. However, we are cautious about certain weaker markets and those more sensitive to current macroeconomic issues. As expected, through some modest recovery in sales, along with a focus on gross margin improvements and cost controls, we returned to double-digit margins for this quarter. Gexpro Services EBITDA was $10.8 million or 11% of sales despite margin pressure of approximately $1.7 million from the technology vertical and the acquired businesses supporting renewables. Lastly, I will turn to TestEquity Group on Slide 9. Q1 sales grew 74.3% to $187.1 million, an increase of $79.8 million driven by the 2023 acquisition of Hisco. Excluding Hisco, TestEquity sales were down 14.6% in Q1 and 6.5% on a comparable day basis versus Q4, primarily driven by continued weakness in the Test & Measurement business. As we've discussed on previous calls, the decline in this piece of our business is primarily related to delays in customers' capital project spending associated with continued higher interest rates and an imbalance of demand against the improved supply chain disruptions from a year ago. Excluding the Test & Measurement market, sales grew nearly 1% over Q4 on three additional selling days. TestEquity's adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was $11.6 million or 6.2% of sales. With the expected pressure on sales, the business has stabilized from a margin perspective. We are actively taking actions to protect our margins within the TestEquity Group and also realizing savings from the integration of Hisco. As we think about the remainder of 2024 for TestEquity, we will continue to focus on the integration of Hisco in TestEquity. We remain committed to sequentially improving our margin profile as 2024 develops through higher sales, synergies to be realized on the combined company and proactively rebalancing our cost structure. Between the merger savings and other cost normalization, we are focused on delivering approximately $15 million of cost savings in 2024. We anticipate a stronger second half of 2024 for the TestEquity Group as we continue to integrate Hisco and some additional pickup of capital project type spending. Moving on to Slide 10. We ended the quarter with approximately $284 million of liquidity, including $85.6 million of cash and $198.3 million under our existing credit facility. A portion of that availability has now been utilized to fund the purchase of S&S Automotive. We continued to focus on strengthening our balance sheet and ended the first quarter at a leverage rate of 3.0x. The acquisition of S&S Automotive subsequent to the quarter does not significantly change our leverage profile given the strong double-digit acquired EBITDA of that business. Although we continue to support a robust working capital investment, we are carefully managing inventories, accounts receivables and accounts payable. Our cash conversion ratio defined as adjusted EBITDA, less the change in working capital and less CapEx divided by adjusted EBITDA was nearly 110% on a trailing 12-month basis and approximately 75% for the first quarter. Net capital expenditures, including rental equipment, were $2.9 million for the first quarter. We expect full year CapEx to be in the range of $16 million to $20 million or approximately 1% of revenue in 2024. Before I turn it back to Bryan, I'd like to make some comments on how we see the remainder of 2024 developing. As we've discussed over the past two quarters, we were up against very tough organic sales comps with Q1 of 2023 having been up nearly 14%. Q2 2023 organic sales were up nearly 5%. Given some of the sales pressures that we continue to see, in particular in the Test & Measurement business, offset by some strengthening in other end markets, we expect Q2 organic sales to be flat to down low single digits as compared to a year ago, however, up sequentially from Q1 of this year. As we make traction on many of our initiatives in 2024 and as comps against the prior year soften, we would expect organic sales growth to turn positive starting in the second half. To achieve our internal sales plans, we will need some normalization of various end markets and some recovery of customer capital related project spending. While we realized Q1 margin expansion over Q4, our focus continues to be on improving margin profiles within all of our segments on a sequential quarterly basis. I'll now turn the call back over to Bryan.\n\nBryan King: Thank you, Ron. The first quarter met our near-term targets, especially given the continued softness in the several end markets highlighted, and we are pleased to see positive trends in many verticals that have been under pressure for several quarters. Turning to Slide 11, DSG's capital allocation framework remains disciplined and flexible, encouraging healthy competition for capital across our businesses. At the core, we believe in the compounding effect of cash flow reinvestment in the business on a per share basis. With a focus on bridging to higher structural margins, we believe that inorganic growth provides strategic opportunities for bolt-on acquisitions that provide us scale, geographic density, new customer channels, cross-sell opportunities and product or service level category expansion, all with an objective to enjoy sustained and structurally higher returns on invested capital, more driven by organic growth than inorganic growth as the platform matures. Finally, the capital allocation equation will not be complete without focusing on prudent debt paydowns and opportunistic share repurchases. These allow us to rebalance the company's weighted average cost of capital and return capital to the shareholders, especially as the platform matures. Combining our asset light model and increasing working capital efficiencies improves our overall liquidity position, allowing us to reduce our net borrowings. Let me wrap up my comments on Slide 12. The first quarter showed sequential top line and bottom line progress against challenging prior year sales comparisons and some very real pockets of soft demand. Lawson had solid margins as we continue to dial in a number of the key initiatives and acquisitions for our longer term opportunity to take this unique VMI offering to structurally higher margins. Gexpro Services returned to double-digit margins as expected and enjoyed seeing its collection of end market verticals firm up confidence in their OEM schedules for the back half of the year based on communication with us, building backlog, and excitedly, we saw new programs indicate that organic revenue growth based on market share wins is happening enhanced by our DSG platform capabilities and the acquisitions that we have added to the platform to improve our value propositions. And the TestEquity Group's margin stabilized despite continued end market challenges, while the heavy lifting integration is progressing as scheduled, while yielding more synergy cost wins and the commercial confidence in what Hisco brings to DSG continues to build across all the verticals. All three leadership teams on these verticals have been challenged with the environment we are in and the number of value unlocking initiatives we are working with them on. I want to personally thank them and their colleagues for their consistent effort and value-creating accomplishments they are delivering for us, the shareholders and how accountable the collective team is holding each other too. We are very pleased with the hard work and progress coming out of our corporate development team on acquisitions that provide DSG with product and solution expansion and extensions in our business units and with their collaboration with the business unit leadership teams as they work to facilitate an acquisition all the way through its integration. Our M&A playbook is active, and we are excited about our current pipeline to continue to deliver largely directly sourced, extremely commercially enhancing high return invested capital, accretive acquisitions that fit our objective to build a best-in-class, high value, high touch specialty distribution business for our shareholder partners, our customers and importantly, our DSG colleagues. Additionally, as I highlighted, because of the continued evidence we see and customers acknowledge for expanded opportunities for cross-selling, spanning our premier specialty distribution company, with great enthusiasm, we've expanded and dedicated more resources to a cross business unit commercial initiative to grow cross-selling revenue and also to leverage value added capabilities to improve the success of each vertical in their own marketplaces. As DSG's Chairman, CEO and largest affiliate shareholder, we fully align with our public investor partners to drive long-term value creation for our shareholders. Investor outreach continues to be our focus. We will attend the Barrington and KeyBanc conferences in May and the East Coast IDEAS Conference in New York in June. With that, operator, we'd like to open the call for questions.\n\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Our first question is coming from Tommy Moll with Stephens Inc. Your line is live.\n\nTommy Moll: I wanted to start on S&S. I presume that was a directly sourced deal. So any context you could give us on a relationship there, how the deal came to you and then also just the go-forward on integration. And while on that, Bryan, you said some complementary things about your development team. You want to put a bogey on how many more deals you'll get over the finish line this year. It sounds like the pipeline is full.\n\nBryan King: Oh gosh. Thanks, Tommy. Let's start with S&S, and I'll let Ron add some additional color here. But -- so the Kent Automotive division, which was something that was bought, Ron, maybe 20 years ago or so?\n\nRon Knutson: Yes, 20 plus.\n\nBryan King: Over 20 years ago, is the kind of a line of business inside of the Lawson Products business model, very similar, but just largely discrete set of SKUs for collision and maintenance repair work on automotive. And S&S was the best competitor that was competing with us in the Midwest. And they had built a really strong, dense market share. They were started in the 60s, I think, early 60s, two families owned them. And the operating family that had kind of taken over from the original founding family had done an extremely good job running the business. And so we started a dialogue with them maybe a couple of years ago. And this has taken quite a long time and a lot of time on both sides to try and work through getting a transaction done. But it was so important to building value in the Kent Automotive division that our leadership team and our corporate development team and the sellers stayed committed to the process. So we are -- we couldn't be more excited about an acquisition that we've done over the last several years. This one took a lot of effort from a lot of people, not to take anything away from others that we've done. But yes, it was direct source, it was direct dialogue. There were lots of nuances to work through, but it provides a tremendous amount of EBITDA margin uplift and strategically an opportunity for complementary product leadership to drive structurally higher organic revenue opportunity for both sides over the coming years. As we've started to do more work on Lawson Products and I'll digress just for a second, I know I'm going to get trouble for this. But there's lines of businesses inside of Lawson that are not -- don't have structurally today as high of EBITDA margin as we are enjoying in our U.S. domestic Lawson business. And so as we see opportunities to punch to higher margin, EBITDA margin and returns on the Lawson core, we are looking at these pockets. And so Kent has had tremendous -- has had kind of a leadership in the clubhouse around organic growth the last couple of years, had strong organic growth even in this first quarter. But we needed more density there in order to pull it over double-digit EBITDA margins from where it was sitting, and this does it in spades. And so that was -- so not only did it bring it immediately to double-digit EBITDA margins, but it gives us strong visibility to be able to take it to margins that are consistent with what we would expect we can do over time with Lawson. So we are doing some of the same analysis with other lines of business inside of Lawson as we are across our other verticals. That's where the corporate development team is spending a lot of their time. We've identified across each of our leadership teams, areas that we can fill in to try and bring the whole to a higher value added proposition with trying to drive performance out of different verticals that we've got even inside of each of the three business units, if you will, more broadly. And they do have a lot on their plate. There are other opportunities that we're pushing forward on that we think are key to our objectives to meeting our longer term defined goal. So there's -- I don't want to get too deep into the pipeline. There was a funnel that we have. And I don't know, Ron, if you want to offer more discreteness on it, but most of it, Tommy, is direct source, and that takes a lot of effort. And so you start conversations like we did with S&S and -- on some of the others that we've done and some of the others that we are working on. And you -- it's hard to anticipate how long it's going to take to get them to closing line. Hisco was another one that was really direct source. We spent years talking to them and then you kind of try and progress that. And we didn't have a lot of conviction or confidence on what the time line was going to look like to get to a closing table. We just had a lot of confidence that there was a tremendous amount of value if we could land it. And the other side, the counterparty was committed in that case -- both of these cases to being partners with DSG. Anything to add, Ron?\n\nRon Knutson: Yes. The only thing I would add to that, Bryan, is a lot of the Kent Automotive growth over the many -- over the past few years has been certainly building relationships with auto dealerships, but also heavier in the collision repair shops. And S&S Automotive heavily focused on auto dealerships. And so typically, there -- the auto dealership spend is typically greater than a collision repair shop. So to Bryan's point, I think it puts us in a great position, there's -- to expand SKU availability within all of the end customers, very really little to no end customer overlap and very little SKU overlap as well. So great opportunity on both ends to be able to leverage both product availability and then also really having now a foothold into servicing the auto dealership market.\n\nTommy Moll: Thank you, both. I wanted to follow-up on the outlook you provided. Ron, I appreciate the context on the second quarter from a revenue standpoint. I wanted to ask on margin, just to make sure I heard you correctly. Did I hear you say for each segment and then obviously for the consolidated results, you're looking for margins to be up sequentially in 2Q? And if I did hear that correctly, any noteworthy callouts on that trajectory would be appreciated.\n\nRon Knutson: Sure. Yes, Tommy. So yes, you did hear that correctly. From an organic sales perspective, we've got certainly visibility into the first month of the quarter here. Again, we'll be up against some sales pressure against the, call it, 5% organic growth that we realized in the second quarter of '23. And then just, I would say, probably some continued pressure that sits out on Test & Measurement that seems to be kind of prolonging longer than what we initially anticipated from probably as we were looking at this late last year. From a margin perspective, yes, you heard that correctly as well. Our expectation going into the second quarter is that we would realize margin -- incremental margin improvement sequentially within all three of the verticals. Individually, there's initiatives taking place within Lawson, Gexpro Services and TestEquity Group to be able to -- for us to be able to make that comment. And we feel like we are on a nice path as 2024 develops to be able to sequentially see some improvement there. We -- as you know, we don't provide formal guidance. So I can't really give you a number around that, but we do expect sequential improvement from where we ended the first quarter.\n\nTommy Moll: Thank you. I appreciate it, and I will turn it back.\n\nBryan King: Just on -- on the -- Ron, on the -- just to add that, one of the things that we did get with the close of April was -- and again, 2 months is not a trend is that we are seeing -- we've seen now 2 months of a very slight tick up relative to what we saw in the fourth quarter and the first couple of months of the first quarter on the Test & Measurement side. So we are hoping that what that is indicating is more clean channel in terms of inventory overhang. And we are feeling like that there's money out there to spend on test and measurement equipment. It's just a matter of the confidence that the customer has in letting that spending on more of a capital asset loose.\n\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is coming from Kevin Steinke with Barrington Research. Your line is live.\n\nKevin Steinke: Hi. Thanks for taking my question. So I just wanted to ask about the Lawson sales representative headcount, about 860. It seems to be down a bit from where it was historically, but you also mentioned that you had open positions that you're recruiting for and you want to build that out in certain territories. So maybe just talk about the trend in the Lawson sales rep headcount, both kind of from an attrition standpoint and where you'd like to grow it, how do you like to grow it going forward?\n\nRon Knutson: Sure. Kevin, I'll take that. So yes, as we commented in our prepared remarks, we are down slightly from an overall headcount perspective. And I would say that it's not overly unexpected through some of the changes that we put in place through 2023 to help our sales reps become more productive, along with some of the shifts that we've talked about in terms of building out our inside sales team and so forth. We did expect that we would take incrementally a few steps down just in terms of the total count. We are actively, in the marketplace, recruiting for additional sales reps, and I would say probably better defining the territories that we believe that can drive our sales on a go-forward basis. We are now looking at more of a combination of really very specific market data in terms of those end markets that we believe can really provide an opportunity for us, not only for where some of our existing sales reps are at, but also new territories that we can enter into. So we -- we've -- so again, I wouldn't say that it's overly surprising that we are down from a rep count perspective. We'll say that for us, feet on the ground and a number of inside sales reps can put some pressure on our average daily sales just in terms of the number of sales reps on a combined basis that are out actively selling. But we believe that, that's part of the growth as we move throughout the rest of 2024.\n\nBryan King: I'm just going to touch on that. Kevin, the part of Cesar and the analysis that we did, we brought in -- we intuitively -- Ron and I've known this now probably for the last couple of years. It was refreshing for Cesar in bringing in an outside consulting firm to really look at what we needed to do in order to make sure that our reps were making structurally more money, while at the same time as our cost to serve was also heading in the right direction. And so we had, at one point, Ron, 1,050, almost 1,100 reps, and we had [indiscernible] territories at that time. And today, the way we look at the business is more like at this stage, 900 -- they're 900 defined territories. And so that means that we kind of went back and reworked and looked at what a territory needed to look like in order to make sure that we were allowing a sales rep an opportunity, both someone who is a starting rep to get to have a higher likelihood of success and to get to profitability for us faster. We are adding a lot of tools for them, which are also going to help them. But a lot of the insight is taking territories that we had that were maybe too thin or that were -- that needed to be reworked. And it's hard to do that when you've got somebody in those territories. And so part of the process was making sure that we -- as we've had some turnover that we were slow to backfill some of those chairs so that Cesar and his team could really look at how to consolidate and rework and to get some better organization out of how we had our territories and how -- what our route structures look like for our salespeople. And so that all is going to allow both higher level of productivity and compensation for our reps, and it's also going to drive our cost to serve down over time. And so, Ron, several years ago, when we were shareholders and I wasn't in the chair I'm in, was giving metrics around cost to serve. And at one point, it was up in the 30s, I think if I remember, and we were trying to get 1% of selling costs a year out of the business. And we -- we are back in a mode where we can see line of sight to how what used to be 25% might be 15% as it relates to where we want to go in terms of total productivity out of our reps and total volume out of them. And that means that the reps going to make 30% or 40% more than what they did maybe on an average comp basis. I think it's -- where we want to be is probably -- I think it's 30% or 35% more than where they were or 40% more than where they were on an average basis a couple of years ago.\n\nKevin Steinke: Okay, great. That's helpful color. I will turn it back over ...\n\nBryan King: There's 70 -- there's 35 new territories and there's 35 backfills that are open efforts right now. Is that too much detail, Ron?\n\nKevin Steinke: That's great. I appreciate the -- all the detail as usual. I will turn it back over. I have to jump on to another call, but appreciate all the comments as usual.\n\nBryan King: Thanks, Kevin.\n\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next question is coming from Katie Fleischer with KeyBanc Capital. Your line is live.\n\nKatie Fleischer: Good morning. I was wondering if you could give a little bit more color on the commentary from the government orders that drove some of the weakness in Lawson and maybe when you would expect an inflection in that.\n\nBryan King: Yes, I hit that in my early comments and Ron can probably give more discreteness to it. There was a change in the way that the government -- every 5 or 7 years, I guess, they change their order entry program, and that's something that could be disruptive for all of us that sell in -- small piece goods into the Class C parts into the government. And then there's also was just kind of a lot of spending that was -- that we knew -- that we know is out there and that we can see that's coming towards us, but it was a pretty significant delay in some spending that took place in the first quarter. There was about equal parts between a broad set of customers across our up and down the street core business at Lawson and then government. And the two of the -- decrease from prior year first quarter for Lawson was about equally weighted to those two areas or strategic accounts were up in the first quarter versus a year ago, and that's just continuing to grow engagement with the relationships that we've got there. But that was a big detractor to Lawson's organic growth in the first quarter. Ron, do you want to ...\n\nRon Knutson: Yes. Bryan, I would just add to that. You're spot on in terms of the ordering system that we are now and others as well are required to go through. And it's just a longer process, Katie. So it's -- we saw some of that decrease versus a year ago within that end segment for us. The other piece I would say is, I mean, the government, the military business is its great business for Lawson. I mean there is a high demand of the consumable Class C parts that we sell. We've not lost any locations, any large locations that we've historically seen some pretty large volumes in the past. So it's not that we are concerned about any customer attrition around that. It's just -- it's more timing. Our sense is that, that will come back to us for the most part throughout the rest of 2024. Certainly, it's not an all catch up, let's call it, in one quarter. I think it will come back gradually to us as 2024 develops.\n\nKatie Fleischer: Okay. That's helpful. And then just one more on test & measurement. So I know you mentioned that it's difficult to have a really strong sense of when these markets are going to inflect just based on the limited visibility. But what are some signs that you would look for from your end markets or from your customers that would give you confidence that this demand is starting to come back?\n\nRon Knutson: Yes. So -- and Katie, Bryan had commented on this a little bit as well. When we look at that test & measurement business, even on a monthly basis as to how the first quarter developed, we -- March was stronger than both January and February on a standalone basis and really was back to levels that we saw kind of in the November and December time frame. So we feel like we've -- that business has kind of leveled off at the bottom right now. What I would say is that in the test & measurement piece for us is really kind of two separate -- I divide it into two separate areas. One, TEquipment, which is one of the acquisitions that was made a year or so ago, they sell what I would say, more handheld units, lower average purchase price. That business was up sequentially Q4 into Q1 of this year. So that's a good sign that we continue to see down a little bit versus a year ago quarter, but sequentially up Q4 versus Q3. So I think that's a good sign that there's some additional demand coming back in the lower price point items. On the larger items, we continue to see some pressure there. But to my point earlier, March was the strongest month of the quarter. So for us, we are staying very connected into our customer base. Again, really no customer attrition there. It's more that -- what we are hearing from our customers is that the capital spend continues to be delayed. And the other piece, and I think we commented on this in the Q4 call, and I described it as almost the perfect storm was that perfect storm going in the wrong direction. But the demand dried up primarily from delay of capital projects on higher interest rates, not shortly thereafter all the supply chain issues surrounding that end market were resolved. So there was a pent-up demand that came through or pent-up supply that came through and kind of mid-2023 -- early to mid 2023, that release of the supply chain kind of hit squarely with the slowdown in the demand. So hopefully, that helps. But Bryan, certainly, any additional thoughts you may have on that.\n\nBryan King: So look, that is -- I think Ron laid out a nice framework there. Katie, there -- when we are looking at TestEquity and we are looking at Hisco and we are looking across that division, there was a -- we hit the nadir as it turned out from what we've seen so far in January and February. We kind of hit the bottom of the lowest average or kind of lowest volume that we were seeing through Test & Measurement specifically. And that's really, for us, looking at the desktop larger versions as opposed to what we are selling through TEquip or the [indiscernible] type handhelds. And Keysight and Tektronix would be our largest vendors there by far. And there was a nice kind of inflection point, it appears, but 2 months isn't a trend because we still got lots of kind of concern about what's going on, on the true demand side. But some of the messiness in the channel and some of the activity in terms of quoting picked back up, and we saw by March, the revenue levels and then April stepped up again back to kind of where they were at the highest level during the 3 months of the fourth quarter, not yet by any means back to where they were in the first half of last year or even the third quarter. And so that -- the nice thing is that we've kind of -- we saw a sell-off or kind of a decline in activity. One of the things that we are also looking at is when we look at the OEM side of our engagements with Hisco, which are largely with similar type of customers and similar sort of industry verticals, we are seeing -- we are seeing percentage declines in OEM programs that are still active in some of those segment markets. So if you think about wireless and communications or industrial electronics, the Hisco is seeing some -- had some volume in the activity in the programs that were coming through the OEM programs of declines there. And those were reflecting kind of more amplified impact that we were seeing over TestEquity on buying test and measurement equipment. So there's confirmation that it's -- some of what's going on seems to be in those industry verticals and that they're just -- they aren't making as much through their OEM facilities or if they're having some struggles in their own end markets, they're probably not spending as much money on their R&D equipment in their labs. And so at some point in time, we are -- just because the way that we think it's trending, we think that those dollars are going to be coming back. But we don't feel like we've lost customers. We do think we lost orders at times during the fourth quarter and maybe even a little bit in the first quarter where there was a natural pricing activity that we weren't willing to match.\n\nKatie Fleischer: Okay, great. Thanks for all the color.\n\nOperator: Thank you. As we have no further questions on the lines at this time, I will turn the call back over to Mr. Bryan King for any closing remarks.\n\nBryan King: Well, that's -- I think, we really appreciate everybody's time. Obviously, we've got still a lot of moving parts in the business. We are very encouraged with the work and accountability that our teams have been putting in across each of the three verticals. And we've got a lot of confidence in the business that we are continuing to build and how we can drive returns on invested capital and structural margins over the coming years. Thank you for your time today. We look forward to speaking with you again when we report our second quarter results in early August. And have a great day.\n\nOperator: Thank you. This concludes today's conference, and you may disconnect your lines at this time, and we thank you for your participation.", "source": {"uri": "za.investing.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

Welcome to the Universal Electronics First Quarter 2024 Financial Results Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speaker's presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. I would now like to hand the conference over to our first speaker for today, Kirsten Chapman with LHA Investor Relations, a division of Alliance Advisors. Please go ahead.\n\nKirsten Chapman: Thank you, Krystal, and thank you all for joining us for the Universal Electronics 2024 first quarter financial results conference call. By now, you should have received a copy of the press release. If you have not, please contact LHA at 415-433-3777 or visit the Investor Relations section of the website. This call is being broadcast live over the Internet. A webcast replay of the call, including any additional updated material non-public information that might be discussed during this call will be available on the company's website at www.uei.com for 1-year. During this call, management may make forward-looking statements regarding future events and future financial performance of the company and cautions you that these statements are just projections and actual results or events may differ materially from those projected.\n\nThese statements include the company's ability to penetrate the connected home space and, particularly, the climate control and home automation markets through the development and delivery of unique and innovative solutions as anticipated by management. The acceptance of UEI TIDE family products in the global HVAC market, management's ability to continue to manage its business, inventories and cash flows to achieve its net sales margins and earnings through financial discipline and cost savings initiatives, operational efficiency, liquidity requirements, factory optimization strategy, R&D spend, product line and business management and other investment spending expectations, including our ability to execute our stock repurchase program.\n\nThe company's successful life-sustaining [ph] of the company's QuickSet technologies, the company's ability to maintain its leading market share in the traditional subscription broadcasting business and the direct and indirect impact the company may experience with respect to its business and financial results stemming from the continued economic uncertainty affecting consumers' confidence and spending natural disaster, public health crises, governmental actions or political unrest, including war, terrorist activities, or other hostilities.

Management provides adjusted non-GAAP metrics, because it uses them for budget planning purposes and for making operational financial decisions, and believes that providing these non-GAAP financial measures to investors as a supplement to GAAP financial measures, help investors evaluate UEI's core operating and financial performance and business trends consistent with how management evaluates such performance and trends. In addition, management believes these measures facilitate comparisons with the core operating and financial results and business trends of competitors and other companies. A full description and reconciliation of these adjusted non-GAAP measures versus GAAP are included in the Company's press release issued today.\n\nOn the call today are Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Paul Arling, who will deliver an overview; and Chief Financial Officer, Bryan Hackworth, who will summarize the financials. Paul will then return to provide the closing remarks. It's now my pleasure to introduce Paul Arling. Please go ahead, sir.\n\nPaul Arling: Thank you for joining us today. We are building for a better future, shifting sales and product development resources to the connected home space, expanding our end market reach and implementing cost initiatives. These actions delivered Q1 2024 results as expected with strong year-over-year gross margin improvements. More importantly, our customer wins, our global footprint optimization and our expense reductions position us for a profitable year as well as position us for consistent sales and earnings growth into 2025, 2026 and beyond. The strengths we have built over the past decades, delivering true seamless interoperability, discovering, connecting and controlling all devices and all brands translate beautifully into the climate control and home automation channels.\n\nOur expertise in connectivity protocols from infrared to radiofrequency to IP, and our ability to make those devices work better together gives us a competitive advantage that continues to create unique and differentiated solutions. Our capability to design, engineer and build solutions for the leading brands in the world that are interoperable and self-configuring can help the next generation of products in the home automation and climate control markets become ever more integral to the smart home experience. We are confident in our success as our capabilities align well with the connected home market needs, as evidenced by our new customer activity in this space. As always, the best testament to our success is the partners that choose to work with us on their product solutions.\n\nWe have won new product designs with 6 of the top 10 HVAC OEM. companies on the planet and are working on to more. Further, the market is growing and undergoing constructive change as climate control devices are getting smarter. For example, there is a transition underway, bringing more efficient product forms such as heat pumps into popularity. Our ability to quickly address these opportunities is reminiscent to the early innings of our success in the home entertainment market. I'd like to highlight a few of our activities that support our outlook. In climate control, at the Consumer Electronics Show in January, we unveiled new UEI TIDE family offerings, including products that bridge to indoor air quality sensors, built-in air purifier control and additional accessories that broaden our control utility.\n\nWe also took the show on the road and demonstrated our full suite of innovative climate control solutions to our growing list of HVAC OEM customers in Japan, including Daikin, Toshiba Carrier, Fujitsu, LG and Panasonic. In March, we exhibited at one of the premier events for the HVAC industry in Europe. Our TIDE family was once again extremely well received generating strong interest from the leading brands in Europe. In fact, in a few short years, we have engaged 13 of the top 14 HVAC OEM brands in Europe that collectively represent over 80% of that market. Already, we have secured three active design wins with two of the top-3 European HVAC OEMs. With a long lead times in this segment, which we have previously discussed. These products are expected to start shipping in 2025.\n\nIn home automation, during Q1, we received our first standard TIDE Dial and TIDE Touch thermostat orders from a leading multi-dwelling unit integrator in North America. We expect to begin product deliveries later this year. Additionally, TIDE Dial is currently in consumer trials with European utility provider. We expect to complete a successful trial and to begin shipping product to them in Q4. In home entertainment and consumer electronics, although the market has changed greatly over the last couple of years, we continued to capture market share with new product introductions at small and large operators. In Q1, we began shipping our sustainable remote control to Liberty Global. We continue to add customers on our Android remote control line, including two telecom companies in India.\n\nBoth have products in development that are expected to ship in Q3 of this year. We continue to see traction on the Xumo platform across the Charter footprint and the Xumo TV branded platforms, as this program continues to scale in the market. Regarding licensing our proprietary technology, we recently added Hisense as a licensee of our Qterics digital rights management provisioning services. These software services are currently used by Vizio, TCL and numerous other TV OEMs to ensure secure delivery of digital rights management keys for streaming content services on their smart TV platforms. Our QuickSet licensees in consumer electronics such as Samsung, LG and Sony all announced their 2024 smart TV product lines and will continue to ship versions of our QuickSet cloud-enabled software.\n\nOur latest version brings added value to our customers, giving them access to a better user experience, increased user engagement and reduced onboarding and troubleshooting challenges. These long-term relationships built upon years of working together with these world leading home entertainment companies continued to be strengthened with these feature enhancements and give us further confidence in our success going forward. Now to the financials. Bryan, please go ahead.\n\nBryan Hackworth: Thank you, Paul. First, I'll review the results for the first quarter of 2024 compared to the first quarter of 2023. Net sales were $91.9 million within guidance. This compares to $108.4 million for the first quarter of 2023, reflecting cord cutting in the video service channel and in an environment where households for a variety of reasons are spending less on discretionary goods. Gross profit for the first quarter of 2024 was $27.2 million or 29.6% of sales, compared to 25.4% in the first quarter of 2023. For the past 2 years, our operations team has been focused on restructuring our manufacturing footprint and have executed well exceeding expectations. These efforts have resulted in significant reduction of manufacturing overhead, the main driver of the improvement in our gross margin.\n\nOur factory optimization plan is nearing completion. We closed 2023 strong, completing the first two phases, commencing operations in our new Vietnam facility and closing our factory in southwestern China ahead of schedule. Our Vietnam factory continues to scale and meet or exceed our expectations. We are currently streamlining our operations in Monterrey, Mexico, including moving into a smaller, more efficient facility that will supply product for certain North American customers. We remain on target for its completion in the second quarter of 2024. As we evolve as a company, we will continue to assess our global footprint and identify ways to operate more efficiently. For the first quarter of 2024, operating expenses were $29.4 million compared to $31.2 million in the first quarter of 2023, reflecting the execution of our cost savings initiatives.\n\nSG&A expenses decreased to $21.8 million compared to $23.1 million in the prior year quarter.

For the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024, we delivered net revenue of 682 million, an increase of 7% compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023. This is on top of delivering outstanding revenue growth of 44% in the fourth quarter last year. Also on top of 66% growth in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022. All financial metrics discussed today are inclusive of the 53rd week in fiscal 2024, except for comparable sales. Comparable sales declined 3% for the quarter as we cycled a remarkable 32% increase in Q4 last year. In the U.S., our net revenue increased 9% for the quarter, while sales grew 4% in Canada in our retail channel, net revenue increased in the fourth quarter by 15%. This was driven by the progress we've made on our real estate expansion strategy. During the quarter, we opened three new boutiques, Indianapolis, Indiana, Corte Madera, California, and Roseville, California. We also opened a newly repositioned location in Skokie, Illinois thus far in Q1, we've completed the repositioning of our Oak Grove, Illinois boutique. We also opened a Reigning Champ pop-up at Yorkdale in Toronto. Finally, we plan to open a new boutique in Boca return later this month. Our fourth boutique in the state of Florida. This is significant because boutique openings have been our most consistent, predictable driver of top line growth the performance of our new boutiques remains strong beyond our expectation, a cohort of six new boutique openings in fiscal 2024 is tracking to payback in under 12 months. This beats our own projection of 12 to 18 months, but it's not just the new boutiques that are performing very well and driving our top line growth. Our boutique repositions are delivering as well, reposition elevate the customer experience and drive increased revenue and profitability from fiscal 2022 to 2024, we completed six three positions in the US. Collectively, we more than doubled the square footage of these boutiques and drove an even higher increase in sales. This resulted in a mid single digit lift and sales per square foot. Turning to e-commerce net revenue decreased by 3% in the fourth quarter. This was driven by a lower volume of markdown sales compared to the fourth quarter last year. The tremendous opportunity we see in e-commerce is far greater than our recent performance, but we also recognize we're coming off three years of unprecedented growth, delivering a four year e-commerce net revenue behavior of 34%. We're confident that as we continue to optimize the composition of our product spreads will reaccelerate, in addition to optimizing our product for focusing on three areas to further support growth in e-commerce. One, we're investing in digital performance marketing. This will help amplify our product franchises, grow brand awareness in the U.S. and drive customer engagement. Two, we're making good progress on upgrading the technology that underpins our e-commerce platform. We have bold creative plans for delivering an outstanding customer experience on a riskier.com. This latest technology will allow us to reach these goals. And three, we're optimizing our omni capabilities. As a reminder, in Q three, in Canada, we completed the rollout of buy online ship from store and continued piloting Buy Online Pickup in Store in Q4, we launched omnichannel capabilities in the US. Early results are encouraging, and we look forward to ramping up Buy Online Pickup in Store to more than 100 boutiques this quarter. Omnichannel services optimize their inventory and lower our distribution costs. In addition, we believe omnichannel will ultimately drive incremental low to mid-single digit e-commerce sales growth. Turning now to product. One of our primary goals continues to be improving the composition of our product, both online and in our boutiques. And that's exactly what we're doing. We have achieved a much better balance of newness and client favorites, and our competition has continued to improve in Q1. Furthermore, our new styles have been well received, which is a positive indicator for future seasons. We're pleased with the progress we made on our inventory position. We successfully cleared through our fall winter inventory ending Q4 with inventory down 27% compared to last year. In March, we launched gold and gold and have an expansion of the athletic assortment we offered under our TENA brand and allows us to address even more of our clients active wear needs. Golden is designed for the athletes who can who loved all things refined. It features like seriously crafted Essentials made with high-performing fabrics and next level detail. This represents billions for something we call the aesthetics of athletic in marketing, our springs wet food campaign featured international supermodel and ongoing brand fan arena, Shake establishing cultural relevance and fashion credibility alongside the campaign, more than 100 aspirational influencers highlighted the styling versatility of sweat, please, by showing their audience how they were hashtags spotted and swiftly. We also continued growing our community of celebrity fans, including blade widely in bad times at the Super Bowl and Maeghan Markel (NYSE: MKL ) in the Super Puff. In addition to propelling brand awareness and driving client engagement, we also see a tremendous opportunity in marketing to amplify our product franchises over the last 40 years for Raytheon (NYSE: RTN ) has become the creator and purveyor of everyday luxury. Our clients know and love the Aritzia brand, which has inspired us to offer more versatile than direct DNA. This enabled us to focus and augment the brand, and we continue to increase awareness, particularly in the US. Of course, our multi-brand strategy is one of our key competitive advantages. So we will continue to create design and evolve our collection of exclusive brands that cater to the lifestyles of our clients. During the quarter, we continued to optimize our distribution network and the ramp-up of our new Ontario distribution center has gone extremely well. Productivity KPIs continue to beat our expectations. Pick-and-pack metrics have increased by more than 70% compared to the prior third party facility. Ecommerce specifically has increased by more than 90% per unit. Labor costs are down meaningfully, and we have now exited all of our temporary off-site facilities, resulting in a significant reduction in our inventory management costs. Now I'll turn the call over to Todd.\n\nTodd Ingledew: Thanks, Jennifer. And good afternoon, everyone. Before I begin note that all financial metrics discussed today are inclusive of the 53rd week except for comparable sales. I'll now take you through the results net revenue for the fourth quarter was in line with our outlook. And as expected, we delivered further margin improvement and continued to optimize our inventory and completed and progressed multiple infrastructure projects to support our future growth. In the fourth quarter, we generated net revenue of $682 million, representing an increase of 7% from last year. This increases on top of two years of extraordinary growth in the fourth quarter, 44% in fiscal 2023 and 66% in fiscal 2022, resulting in a three year CAGR of 37%. As expected, we saw an approximate $32 million benefit from the 53rd week following a remarkable increase of 32% last year. Our comparable sales for the quarter declined 3% due to our improved inventory position. Our composite comparable sales performance was impacted by a lower volume of markdown sales in the fourth quarter compared to last year. Net revenue in the United States increased 9% to $369 million on top of an increase in the fourth quarter last year of 56% and 109% in fiscal 2022. In Canada, net revenue increased 4% to $313 million on top of an increase of 32% in fiscal 2023 and 39% in fiscal 2022. Comparable sales results were similar across geographies as we saw consistent shopping behavior on both sides of the border. Net revenue in our retail channel was 416 million, an increase of 15% from the fourth quarter last year. And this was driven by the performance of our new and repositioned boutiques, which continue to generate better than expected payback periods. Comparable sales growth in our boutiques was positive in e-commerce. Net revenue for the quarter was 266 million, a decrease of 3% from last year. E-commerce was impacted more heavily by the lower volume of markdown sales. We delivered gross profit of $261 million, an increase of 8% compared to the fourth quarter last year. As expected, gross profit margin inflected positively increasing 30 basis points to 38.3% from 38% last year. The increase was primarily driven by select pricing adjustments and lower warehousing and distribution costs, partially offset by inflation in product costs and pre-opening lease amortization for flagship boutiques. SG&A expenses for the quarter were $197 million, up 15% from last year. SG&A as a percent of net revenue was slightly better than our expectations, up 200 basis points to 28.9% compared to 26.9% last year. This was driven by investments in talent made through the end of fiscal 2023, as well as digital marketing initiatives, protect and propel our brand and technology to enhance our e-commerce platform. Adjusted EBITDA in the fourth quarter was $73 million, a decrease of 9% from last year. Adjusted EBITDA was 10.6% of net revenue compared to 12.4% last year, representing further sequential improvement as the end of the fourth quarter. Inventory was 340 million, down 27% from the end of the fourth quarter last year. We are pleased with our improved inventory position and continue to optimize the composition. During the fourth quarter, we generated $23 million in free cash flow and ended the quarter with 163 million in cash and zero drawn on our $300 million revolving credit facility. We remain focused on maintaining a strong balance sheet and expect to see meaningful free cash flow generation starting in the back half of fiscal 2025 as we finish our major capital projects, I will now shift to our outlook for the first quarter and fiscal year 2025. Based on quarter-to-date trends, net revenue in the first quarter of fiscal 2025 is expected to be in the range of 475 to 495 million, representing an increase of 3% to 7% compared to the first quarter last year. We expect gross profit margin in the first quarter to increase by approximately 450 basis points compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2024, driven by IMU improvements, lower warehousing costs, lower markdowns and savings from our smart spending initiatives. We forecast SG&A as a percent of net revenue to increase by approximately 250 basis points in the first quarter, driven by investments in digital marketing and technology initiatives. For the full year, we currently expect net revenue in the range of 2.52 to 2.62 billion. This outlook represents growth for the year of 8% to 12% from fiscal 2024, excluding the 53rd week in fiscal 2024. This represents growth of 10% to 14%. Our fiscal 2025 net revenue outlook reflects the anticipated cadence of our boutique openings and accommodates for a range of macroeconomic scenarios. In fiscal 2025, we plan to open 11 to 13 new boutiques, including our Chicago flagship and to reposition three to four boutiques, including two of our Manhattan flagships other than one new boutique and one repositioned in Canada, all openings and repositions our in the United States, we anticipate total square footage growth of approximately 20% to 25% I can't emphasize enough that our new stores are our most consistent growth driver, delivering predictable revenue growth and attractive payback periods. In addition to building brand awareness, driving significant client acquisition and fueling e-commerce sales. We forecast meaningful gross profit margin expansion for the year, an increase of approximately 400 to 450 basis points compared to last year. This reflects IMU improvements, lower warehousing costs, lower markdowns and savings from our Smart Spending initiative. SG&A as a percentage of net revenue is expected to be approximately flat to down 50 basis points compared to fiscal 2024, driven by savings from our smart spending initiatives and leverage on fixed costs offset by investments in digital marketing. Further, we expect depreciation and amortization of approximately $80 million compared to 65 million in fiscal 2024. We expect our adjusted EBITDA margin to expand by approximately 400 to 500 basis points reflecting the leverage across the range of potential net revenue outcomes. The expansion is primarily driven by improvements in gross margin. We expect capital expenditures for fiscal 2025 of approximately 230 million. This includes approximately 100 and mid 190 million related to investments in new and repositioned boutiques for fiscal 2025 and the start of construction for boutiques opening in early fiscal 2026. We continue to see our most recent new boutiques tracking to payback in approximately one year or less exceeding our projections for 12 to 18 months. Our CapEx spend also includes approximately $40 million, primarily related to the expansion of our distribution center network. This includes a portion of the cost for our new facility in the Vancouver area, which is planned to open in fiscal 2026 and investments in our expanded distribution center in Columbus, Ohio throughout fiscal 2025, we plan to use our NCIB to purchase shares opportunistically to offset the dilution of option exercises. We anticipate that our buying this fiscal year will be concentrated during open trading windows and closing, we expect sales growth to increase this year, driven by an improvement in the composition of our inventory, total square footage growth of 20% to 25% and momentum in e-commerce. In addition, we expect meaningful gross profit margin expansion for the year and modest improvements in SG&A leverage for the fiscal year. The combination of the revenue acceleration and margin expansion will nearly double our earnings. With that, I'll now turn the call back to Jennifer.\n\nJennifer Wong: Thanks, Todd. After two years of exceptional growth in our business, 74% in fiscal 2022 and 47% in fiscal 2023. Fiscal 2024 was a year of building infrastructure and rightsizing our inventory while continuing to service our clients following our unprecedented growth, it was absolutely critical that we rightsize our infrastructure and optimize our operations. We made substantial progress in five key areas. We expanded our distribution center network to accommodate record volume, including the addition of our new 550,000 square foot facility in Ontario. We improved our inventory position, including the composition of our product and enhanced our proven operating model, which has served us well for decades. We executed on our smart spending initiatives around resulting in annualized run rate savings of more than 60 million. We develop a pipeline of boutique openings in premier locations, including four brands, compelling flagship projects. And last but not least, we kicked off the process of integrating our digital channel from driving traffic through to optimizing our omnichannel services. Our focus on investing in the scalability of our business throughout this past year, set the stage for our next phase of expected growth, helping to ensure we can expand at a consistent measured pace moving forward. Q1 is off to a good start, and we're pleased with our clients' response to our product. We expect the composition of our product to continue to improve throughout the quarter and be further optimized for fall. The performance of our new boutiques continues to beat our own expectation. We have an extraordinary pipeline of boutiques opening this year, representing total square footage growth of 20% to 25%. With the vast majority in the US, the increased pace of openings is expected to fuel retail sales growth and drive incremental e-commerce sales as we expand into five new markets in e-commerce, we believe our revenue growth will reaccelerate as we continue to optimize the composition of our product. And additionally, our strategic focus on digital marketing, technology and omnichannel further supports growth in our digital business. In closing, our brand is strong. Our financial position is solid and we have a tremendous multiyear runway for growth in the U.S. All of our people, thank you for your hard work and unwavering commitment to our received future, particularly throughout the last year. During that time, we solidified our platform for the next phase of growth. I'm very optimistic about all of the opportunities on deck for fiscal 2025 and beyond as we continue to plan and bring everyday luxury to more and more clients than ever before. Thank you. And with that, we're ready to open the line for Q&A.\n\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. The first question comes from Mark Petrie with CIBC.\n\nMark Petrie: Yes, good afternoon. Maybe on just first on the on the SG&A guide, can you just help help sort of bridge the pieces there. I recall 150 to 200 basis points cost efficiencies and from the from the smart spend initiatives and the majority of that in SG&A. So could you just talk about what other pieces are going on in SG&A?\n\nJennifer Wong: Yes, absolutely, Mark. And it was approximately 60% of the benefits we were expecting from the smart spending to hit in SG&A. So as a reminder, for the full year, we're expecting to be flat to down 50 basis points, so an improvement of 50 basis points. And that's driven by, as you're suggesting the spend management initiatives, which are offset by investments in the digital marketing. So effectively, that's why you're seeing pressure in the first quarter. And then we're expecting that to improve modestly in the second quarter. And then we're expecting expansion in the third and fourth quarter in SG&A as as the revenue growth begins to accelerate and we're lapping some of the improvements that are in basically in to further focus on the first quarter, have we have digital marketing this year where we didn't in the first quarter last year, and then we have technology initiatives that we made in the back half as well as higher spend in the first quarter this year on projects. So there is really a cadence thing with pressure in the first quarter that dissipates in the second and then turns to a positive for the third and fourth quarter.\n\nMark Petrie: Okay. That's helpful. And if I could just follow up then on that digital marketing spend, it has been ramping up. And I'm just curious if you can speak quantitatively or even just qualitatively about the payoffs and the returns that you're seeing from that? And then related, if you're able to quantify the impact of the lesser availability of clearance goods on either comp sales or the e-com sales?\n\nJennifer Wong: Exactly. And Mark, I think I'll take both of those. The I'll take the last first to quantify the on lower volume of markdown sales in Q4, it's about 15 million, and we are especially pleased, though, because inventory was down 27%. So I think that's the important thing to note here is we're in a better inventory position despite the lower volume of markdown sales on the performance marketing one are grounded on the fact that we have done zero performance marketing to date is just started up, but digital, more digital marketing and we believe we need a baseline level. If we're going to be a player in the digital space, we need a baseline level of digital marketing. The majority of that is to protect and propel our brand and our product franchises and of course, overall to drive traffic and conversion were really only about six weeks into it. We just signed on with the digital agency the beginning of this year or wrapping them up. We're taking a crawl, walk run approach. And the early indicators, if you looked at it apples to apples against the industry is that what we're doing right now, we are focused on the bottom of the funnel, particularly on conversion is we're performing at industry if not better than industry when we are compared to and many in our peer set. So I find that to be quite encouraging and we'll continue to monitor and assess it. And as long as it adding incremental incrementally to our business. We'll continue with it and adjust as necessary.\n\nOperator: The next question comes from Dylan Carden with William Blair.\n\nDylan Carden: Great. Thanks. Just a point of clarification on the gross margin guide. I guess taking a step back, the 500 basis points, the kind of previously spoken to on total EBITDA expansion that's kind of embedded the current guide on the sort of 400 to 450. There's no change there, really exactly. There's no change. We're still targeting the 500 basis points?\n\nTodd Ingledew: Yes, 100%. The range that we provided is simply based on the variance in the fixed cost leverage, right from the top of the range to the bottom.\n\nDylan Carden: Sure. I will. I guess to that point, can you touch you sort of mentioned a range of macro outcomes. Anything you can kind of speak to is where your consumer is that prevalent, you agree, meaning by jurisdiction and kind of what the top and bottom end of the guidance kind of and visions as far as how that trends in one word impacted the same as a lot of others are observing right now.\n\nJennifer Wong: Our customers impacted by macro challenges that are out of our control on. Nothing's really changed quarter over quarter we did see that in our consumer is shopping when she shopping, she is discerning with her spend. So and this is just showing up in terms of in terms of volume overall, but we still have a customer that is shopping with us and basically our basket size and average order value continues to be consistent.\n\nDylan Carden: Great. And then on the digital marketing front, was there certain by reality of the brand that sort of happened organically over the last two or so years on that you're kind of seeing a low and sort of before you really start ramping this digital spend, is that essentially a hole you need to fill? Or is it more the future going from zero and the incremental demand that you can grow through that.\n\nJennifer Wong: Fair to say your question is that we've grown, we've grown with no additional no digital marketing included in our overall digital cyber, and we've experienced phenomenal growth in eCommerce coming out of COVID. We've spoken a lot about that. And I think what's happened coming out of COVID when there everybody was with digital, is that the ad space is noisier. It's noisier. There's everyone is doing some form of digital marketing and more and more of it. And so for us to ensure that we remain top of mind and continue to have share of mine and attention of the customer. We are going to participate and have at least a baseline level of digital marketing. And to be clear, only a component of our overall e-commerce digital playbook at the end of the day, the key driver of our business is our product that we've always said that regardless of both channels, the key driver is our product. So in our minds, a lot of focus on digital marketing because we haven't done it before, and we're just introducing it as of late. And as I said a minute ago, the early indicators are that it is contributing and it is incrementally positive for us, but it's only a component of our overall playbook at the end of the day, we see e-commerce content will reaccelerate and get back to more of the same levels that we saw in our organic growth when our product is optimized.\n\nOperator: The next question comes from Luke Hannan with Canaccord Genuity.\n\nLuke Hannan: Thanks. Good afternoon. Jeff, you mentioned that you were pretty happy with the rollout of buy online pickup in store and ship from store so far in the US. I'm just wondering if we can get a little bit more granularity on that, I guess either quantitatively or qualitatively that you're pleased with, are you able to convert more, call it more casual clientele into into more repeat purchasers of Aritzia product? Or just anything else you can share there?\n\nJennifer Wong: Yes, yes. What is really underlying all is that what it's done is it's opened up the availability of our pretty much our full inventory to the online customer, whereas before when the inventory for the online customer was yes, what was in our distribution centers and we had items that were in the stores, they wouldn't be able to purchase it. So it opens up so when I say it optimizes our inventory, it opens up so much more availability to that online customer. And then on top of it, she has a choice as we are picking up and picking it up in store, which means you can get even sooner. And the customer experience is fantastic and they were achieved in the store and on the Sally advisers assisting her. There's only if there can be a lift there, too. So and we love about it first and foremost that it optimizes our inventory, makes it more efficient and then ultimately for those items that are in the stores and not in the distribution center that might not otherwise be in the stores, it lowers our distribution costs at the end of the day and all to say that it does add incremental sales to the e-commerce channel.\n\nLuke Hannan: That's great. Thanks. And then my follow-up here is just on the cadence of comparable comparable sales growth for the balance of the year, recognizing that there will be positive contributions from this investment in digital. But then I imagine going up against tougher comps when it comes to markdown sales as we get closer to the Q2 and Q3. So I'd love to hear your thoughts there.\n\nTodd Ingledew: Yes. From a revenue cadence perspective, obviously, the growth is more heavily weighted in the back half of the year. And we have we're, as I said, if you exclude the 53rd week, we're expecting 10% to 14% revenue growth for the year. And then within the first quarter, that growth is expected to be 3% to 7%, and that's compared to growth of 13% in Q1 last year. So actually the compares get easier now as we as we move through the fiscal year. And so therefore, with the combination of you, our new stores opening in the back half of the year and easier compares and all of the initiatives underway within e-commerce and the product positioning, we expect that we will still see sort of revenue acceleration quarter on quarter through the year. And as you know, that will be both for non-comp and comp color.\n\nOperator: The next question comes from Martin Landry with Stifel.\n\nMartin Landry: Good afternoon. I'd like to talk about a little bit the cadence of EBITDA margin improvement. Todd, you mentioned that you're going to have some SG&A leverage that's going to kick in a little later this year. You know how it's going to be. Can you give us a bit of color on the cadence of the EBITDA margin improvement throughout the year? And what could the exit rate look like, yes, 100%.\n\nTodd Ingledew: And so I've already laid out the the SG&A cadence with increases again in the back half and pressure in the first half. And so obviously, going along with that is the the gross margin expansion that we're expecting, which obviously is a significant add of 400 to 450 basis points of improvement and the cadence of that that we're expecting is that so roughly near the top of that range in Q1 and Q2 and near the lower end of that range in Q3 and Q4. And that's really driven by our one of the components of benefit we're seeing gross profit is our distribution center costs, and we were already benefiting in the back half of last year from the opening of our new DC. So we don't expect we won't see as much year over year benefit in the back part. That's why there's a cadence there but obviously in the in the back half of the year, if you take the average 400 call it at the bottom end of the range for gross profit plus roughly 100 basis points of leverage in SG&A and which is what we're expecting in the back half. If you model it out, as you'll get that exit point of roughly 500 basis points of improvement in the back half of the year.\n\nMartin Landry: Okay. That's helpful. And can you just talk a little bit about your and your aspirational goal of bringing EBITDA margins towards 19%? And is this still a goal that you can you think you can achieve in the coming years? And what would be the the moving parts get there?\n\nTodd Ingledew: Yes, we're still targeting the high 10s EBITDA margin. Obviously, we're taking taking a meaningful step this year. And then next year, we would expect another another jump in our in our EBITDA margin as we add them one benefit from the revenue from all of the stores that we're adding this year and further leverage from new stores next year, but also from the rent that will be coming off as we as we open our new flagship locations. We've talked about the pressure that we're seeing today that will will drive improvement in FY. 26 as well as what we think is a multiyear IMU improvement opportunity will be part of the building blocks and potentially lower markdowns as well as we work through FY 26 and 27, both from an IMU and markdown perspective. And then also as we as we continue to say that as our mix shift toward the United States that becomes a larger and larger portion of our business, there is an underlying benefit that will help support margin expansion, right the way through FY 27 and beyond, frankly.\n\nOperator: The next question comes from Irene Nattel with RBC Capital Markets.\n\nIrene Nattel: Good afternoon, everyone. And most my questions have been answered, but just a couple of more housekeeping items. As you very helpfully at the Q3 call provided the timing of the new store openings in F 25, I believe in your comments you said that they're largely unchanged, but can you please confirm the quarterly cadence?\n\nJennifer Wong: Yes, of course, Irene. So we're right now we're expecting one new boutique and one reposition, which has already opened in the first quarter as three new boutiques in the second quarter and then nine new boutiques and two repositions, which include the Chicago flagship as well as the SoHo and Fifth Avenue flagships in the back half of the year. And those should be weighted more more towards the end of the the third quarter.\n\nIrene Nattel: Okay. That's that is that is super helpful. Thank you. And then can you give us a little bit on a little bit more color around the basket composition and how you're seeing consumers your customer shopping you noted that there's great response to the newness of it or so if you can give us some examples of that and also how you feel about newness and what we should be seeing in the stores as we move really into the heart of spring summer says, Irene, in the single digits in Montreal SPILL?\n\nJennifer Wong: Listen, I'll take the second question first. We've as I said, we've made great progress in our product composition and we have a much better balance now going into spring. We made tremendous progress, get even better for summer and will largely be where we need to be for fall. So it's the progressive. It's sort of a progressive optimization here. As far as newness, it confirm when you walk into the store and what we see merchandise, I think we're hitting our targets and our goals of having half the store merchandise and in newness and the other 50% of merchandise in our client favorites. We've never ever had a problem with fashion selling all of all of items, all of the styles and the whole entire assortment are absolutely pieces. And it really just what we're working on right now is getting the right composition between the two. As far as what we're seeing trending. As I mentioned, our goal then was extremely well received and I personally love love Golden amazingly had a fantastic campaign around it as well. With this, wet fleece is performing well. And really as always, we've had items pretty much in every department performing, whether it be shirts, sweaters, pants, even accessories. So we're pleased with getting back on track with our product playbooks, and we're seeing the response now early in Q1 and I'm super now optimistic and more than optimistic, I feel very, very confident that this trend will continue as we progress through the year with total revenue. And that's great for me.\n\nIrene Nattel: Thank you. And then just one last question, if I might. Around swim should come because it on the side, it looks like there's a lot of discounting going on. So just kind of wondering how swim has performed relative to expectations and P-8 and sell.\n\nJennifer Wong: And we don't want if we didn't save all of our targets as well, and that doesn't mean that we have continued with there's a bit of background noise there. We have not continued with swimming on the collection going into this spring or summer. So I'm not quite sure what you're talking about as far as far as discounting, because I think we've kind of given your commentary in terms of the markdown sales and how that was quite markedly reduced in Q4 of fiscal 2024. Although I am still given where our inventory levels are, we're feeling again like we're getting, we're getting back on track to our more historical levels of Vamos. And at that, I'll I will add that for Q4 despite the lower than last year and was for Q4, our markdown levels were yes, although slightly higher than last year. They're still below pre-pandemic levels, if that's what you're wondering about our tax team for the AMP (OTC: AMLTF ).\n\nIrene Nattel: That's great.\n\nTodd Ingledew: Thank you for that senior team divestiture, our free cash flow growing at the year over year and the operator standardizing what we have from various lines open to someone else. We're excited about the cloud. Let me child attack against that our next generation.\n\nOperator: The next question comes from Brian Morrison with TD Securities.\n\nBrian Morrison: Your comment with respect to the new products, and you say that they're having great progress and being well received. You gave examples of Goldman your sweat fleece, but I just want to know like are the are you hitting your sales targets with respect to your new products.\n\nJennifer Wong: Yes, absolutely.\n\nBrian Morrison: Perfect. And then, Todd, I got cut off on the call a bit, but just in terms of your margin progression, the 500 basis points, the items within your control, whether it be the transitory costs, the smart spend, the IMUs, are there any that are underperforming or outperforming with respect to good results that you've seen so far to date?\n\nTodd Ingledew: Note that for the we saw a 30 basis point improvement in the fourth quarter, which is what we were anticipating and have already can have obviously good visibility into the IMUP. for the first quarter and for spring, the warehousing costs. But that has already happened. As I said, the benefits we're receiving those benefits and we were in the fourth quarter. So we expect to receive them in the first and the back end. And then obviously the improved markdowns, while there's some benefit in the first quarter because because we're lapping some some runoff sales and markdowns the last few one add, but that will predominantly be seeing those obviously during our sale periods, the benefit of that. So in the second and the fourth quarter. But no, we have great visibility into the gross profit margin expansion for the year and are already seeing those benefits today. So in terms of those four key buckets, it's fair to say they're all between 125 and 150 basis points, and then there'll be a slight offset with respect to the growth in the rent expense and the IMU., if they would go in the order of IMU., then the warehousing and distribution center costs, the lower markdowns and then spend management and they kind of one is slightly bigger than the other.\n\nOperator: The next question comes from Michael Glen with Raymond (NS: RYMD ) James.\n\nMichael Glen: Okay. Thanks for getting me. And maybe just can you speak to how we should think about e-commerce sales trending in Q1 on a year-over-year basis?\n\nTodd Ingledew: Yes, our e-commerce sales in the first quarter are trending within that. That's for the 3% to 7% range and that we laid out. Okay. So no that we shouldn't expect any meaningful variance between retail and e-commerce growth in Q1. I think we would continue to anticipate that the retail growth will be slightly higher than our e-commerce growth driven by the new stores.\n\nMichael Glen: Okay. And then when when I know you've spent a lot of time talking about customer customer activity, when you opened new stores, are you still seeing the same level of customer response when you've opened new stores relative to the fact to the past or has there been a change? Have you seen any slowdown in terms of the traffic experience when you open new stores?\n\nTodd Ingledew: No, we've we have overwhelming response when we open new stores. I think that that's proven in terms of some of the metrics that we shared with you on the call with the opening remarks, when we open new stores, they perform extremely well. And I might add for e-commerce when we open a new store in a new market, we see a 70% Halo eCommerce lift. So the new store openings and as we said in the opening remarks, are proven consistent, most predictable driver of sales.\n\nMichael Glen: Okay. And any changes at all in terms of how you see have you seen any slowing on the paybacks for new stores that you have you referenced in the past?\n\nTodd Ingledew: No, no, we have not. We continue to see, as we said, better than our expectations of 12 to 18 months, we consider to continue to see paybacks of beating that. So we have not seen any slowdown.\n\nOperator: The next question comes from Mauricio Serna with UBS.\n\nMauricio Serna: Great. Good afternoon and thanks for taking my questions. I just wanted to get a better sense on how are you thinking about comp sales for the year? And maybe you could provide I mean, I understand from like the total sales will accelerate because of the boutique openings. But from a comp sales standpoint, how are you thinking about that, you know, starting Q1 in as the quarters progress? And then maybe I guess just wanted to make sure like from a Hello Mark from a digital sorry. From the adjusted EBITDA margin, like the big change relative to like the previous outlook of 500 basis points to now this range is essentially some of the as you're reinvesting some of the gains into digital marketing. Is that is that the right way to think about it? Thanks.\n\nTodd Ingledew: Yes, I mean, I'll take the first one or the second first. And that's that we are still targeting 500 basis points at the top of the range and that the range provided simply reflect, again, the deleverage that we would experience with the declines at the bottom of the range and so that that that's the gap. And yes, we are as I think it will, as we have said last Q1, we reported that we would be investing in digital marketing and that that is offsetting some of the benefits that we had within the spend management within SG&A, but worse, and we're still targeting the 500 at the top of the range. And then from a to answer your first question from a cadence of the comp or maybe composition of the revenue that again, we're forecasting or for 10% to 14% growth. If you exclude the benefit of the 53rd week in FY 24 and that is broken down into two components, non-comp and comp. And the non-comp component, which is obviously the new and repositioned boutiques is approximately 60% of the revenue. And that component, we expect to be relatively consistent through the range. And the range is really the comp component, which is made up of both retail comp and e-commerce. And the obviously the e-commerce being the majority of that comp growth. And so the range that we have outlined there reflect different scenarios for our comp growth, and that's how we're looking at that revenue growth. So if you flex the call using that $100 million range, and that's how we're looking at it. And obviously, the comp growth we're expecting to be lower in the first quarter and then grow in the second, third and fourth.\n\nOperator: The next question comes from Stephen MacLeod with BMO Capital Markets.\n\nStephen MacLeod: Thank you. Good evening. Lots of my questions have already been answered. So I just had a couple of just a couple of clarifying questions. Just on the on the new store timing, it sounded like it was slightly different than what it was before. I just wanted to just wondering, Tom, if you can run through those through the timing of those new stores and repositionings and then when when one the flagships come online as well?\n\nJennifer Wong: Yes. So there hasn't been any material change in the timing. Again, one new boutique and one repositioned in Q1, three new boutiques in Q2. And then the majority of the stores in the back half are planned for close to the end of the third quarter. But I guess I just want to caution against putting them early in the third quarter, we have nine new boutiques are coming online. So those will we'll be coming in effectively majority in that October, November timeframe and some could bleed into December and January. So I that it's just obviously with construction. It's hard to pin exactly when they're going to open and we have major projects going on right now. With our Chicago flagship, Soho And fifth, and we expect the Chicago flagship to open first in the back half, then. So home and followed by fifth. And those again, those projects are large. And so there could be some movement from from our expectations. But we do we do feel confident that by the end of the back half of the year and likely by December, we will have the vast majority of those stores open and in the backup.\n\nStephen MacLeod: Okay. That's great. And then just in terms of the Q, the Q. one guide did you say that comps are like embedded in that total growth of 3% to 5.37% comps? Are we expect it to be positive in Q1?\n\nTodd Ingledew: No, I said what we have to I mean, what I said was that our revenues in the 3% to 7% range and e-commerce would land within that retail growth, total retail growth will likely be slightly over time like slightly higher than e-commerce.\n\nStephen MacLeod: Okay. Okay. Great. Thank you. And then maybe just finally, just some sort of just a modeling question with respect to just the IFRS 16 adjustments related to on the depreciation and interest. Are you able to talk a little bit about how those are going to expected to grow through 2025 and 2026. As I know, that sometimes impacts the margins and EBITDA.\n\nTodd Ingledew: The depreciation and amortization, we're expecting to be roughly $80 million provided by my commentary, John and yes, that's the expectation.\n\nStephen MacLeod: Okay. What about the IFRS. 16? T's depreciation on ROU assets and the interest expense on lease liabilities?\n\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] The next question comes from Mauricio Serna with UBS.\n\nMauricio Serna: Great, thanks. I just had a quick follow-up because when you were answering the question about the comp sales and the growth, I just want to make sure I got her right it. It's the non-comp 50% of the revenue growth is coming from from the non-comp. I just want to make sure I heard that right?\n\nTodd Ingledew: It roughly 60%. So if you take the midpoint of our range and then remove the 53rd week from last year, so you get 2.3 billion, that's the difference there, roughly 60% of that is expected to be coming from the stores, the new stores and would be classified as non-comp. And then the other 40% would be expected to come from comp sales, which are majority e-commerce\n\nOperator: This concludes the question-and-answer session. I would now like now like to turn the call back over to Beth Reed for any closing remarks. Please go ahead.\n\nBeth Reed: And thank you again to everyone for joining us this afternoon. We're available after the call you any further questions and we look forward to providing another update next quarter. Have a great evening.\n\nOperator: This concludes today's conference call.

(CMPR) Q3 2024:\n\nOperator: Welcome to Cimpress' Third Quarter Fiscal Year 2024 Earnings Call. I will introduce Meredith (NYSE: MDP ) Burns, Vice President of Investor Relations and Sustainability.\n\nMeredith Burns: Thank you, Amber, and thank you, everyone, for joining us. With us today on the call are Robert Keane, Founder, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Sean Quinn, EVP and Chief Financial Officer. We appreciate the time that you've dedicated to understand our results, commentary and outlook. This live Q&A session will last about 45 minutes and we'll answer both presubmitted and live questions. You can submit questions live via the questions and answers box at the bottom left of the screen. Before we start, I'll note that in this session, we will make statements about the future. Our actual results may differ materially from these statements due to risk factors that are outlined in detail in our SEC filings and the documents we published yesterday on our website. We also have published non-GAAP reconciliations for our financial results and outlook on our IR website, along with historical financial results. We invite you to read them. And now I'll turn things over to Sean.\n\nSean Quinn: Great. Thanks a lot, Meredith, and thanks to everyone who's joined us today. We're on a recording. Before we take any questions that you have, I'm just going to highlight a few key points from our earnings document that we published yesterday. Cimpress delivered strong results in the third quarter. Consolidated revenue grew 5% on a reported basis and 4% on an organic constant currency basis. The timing of the Easter holiday, which was at the end of Q3 this year versus Q4 last year, had about $6 million of impact or 80 basis points of negative impact on consolidated organic revenue growth for the quarter. So the underlying consolidated revenue growth trends were consistent with what we've seen year-to-date. Adjusted EBITDA grew $25 million year-over-year in Q3 to $94 million, and our adjusted EBITDA margins were up nearly 300 basis points to just over 12% this year, driven by continued gross margin expansion, but also operating expense efficiency. From a segment perspective, we saw an improved trend for our Upload & Print businesses and also for National Pen, both despite a tough Q3 comp for those businesses and growth in our all other businesses remain flat, where there are puts and takes beneath the surface consistent with the last few quarters. We had a pretty submitted question on that, so we'll get into a little bit of detail there. In Vista, if you take the Easter timing out of the mix, revenue growth was a continuation of the trends in the first half of the year. So very strong. Vista continues to grow the value of its customer cohorts through growth in both customer count but also per customer value. And we've also had year-over-year growth in the value of the new customer acquisition cohort again this quarter, which is a pattern that's been in place for six quarters now. Adjusted free cash flow was an outflow of $16.6 million this quarter. We do typically have an outflow in Q3 just due to our seasonal working capital patterns. There was a $3.8 million year-over-year increase in that outflow versus last year despite the improved adjusted EBITDA, and that was a function of the quarterly variability of working capital versus last year. Q2 was very favorable this year, if you recall. And importantly, our year-to-date adjusted free cash flow is up over $155 million versus last year. During the third quarter and also in April, together, we repurchased a total of 1.3 million shares for $120 million at an average price of $93 per share. That's a reduction of about 5% of our shares outstanding. These repurchases were done within the limitation that we disclosed last quarter that we would still exit FY2024 with net leverage at or below approximately 3.0x trailing 12-month EBITDA, and that still remains our expectation. Our liquidity position remains strong. We ended the quarter with cash and marketable securities of $160.8 million, full access to our $250 million revolving credit facility. And during the month of April, we also received net proceeds of $16.8 million for the sale of our building in Jamaica that had previously been classified as held for sale. Our net leverage at the end of Q3 was 3.0x trailing 12-month EBITDA as defined by our credit agreement, and that compares to net leverage of 4.8x one year-ago. With these continued strong results and just one quarter left in the fiscal year, we're confident in our ability to meet or exceed our prior guidance that we shared in last quarter's earnings document. As we also discussed in the earnings document that we published last night, we provided detailed near-term guidance over the past five quarters because we had plans to dramatically improve our profitability and our cash flow, and we felt that it was appropriate it is also necessary for us to be more specific about those expectations that we had. With these improvements now reflected in our actual results going forward, we will replace the near-term guidance with multiyear guidance commentary. So let me just walk through that commentary that we provided for FY2025 and beyond in last night's release. First, we expect to grow organic constant currency revenue at mid-single-digit rates, possibly a little higher. We expect to grow adjusted EBITDA slightly faster than revenue, and we expect the annual conversion rate of adjusted EBITDA to adjusted free cash flow to be in the range of 45% to 50%, with fluctuations from one year to the next. Finally, we disclosed a new leverage policy in our earnings document yesterday evening. We think it's really important to have this information for investors. It's so important for our capital allocation philosophy and decisions and what you can all expect in the coming years. And so we think it's a really useful piece of information, but also a useful input for modeling along with the multiyear outlook commentary that we shared last night and I just went through. So net new leverage policy is to target net leverage at approximately 2.5x or below, with the possibility to take net leverage up to as high as approximately 3.0x from time to time for investments that we think have good returns, but also with a clear path to delever to the target of approximately 2.5x or below. We believe we can reach this 2.5x net leverage target in FY2025. However, if we continue to have attractive opportunities for share repurchases next fiscal year, as we have recently, we expect to exit FY2025 with net leverage at or below approximately 2.75x. We're still in the process of finalizing our plans for next year, but just to set expectations as we look to next year and subject to all the commentary that's already been provided, we do expect our OpEx investments to continue at roughly the current rate. We expect higher CapEx in FY2025 just based on opportunities that we see for both new product introduction, but also efficiency improvements. We continue to not expect material M&A, and we'll consider share and debt repurchases depending on price and subject to the specific net leverage constraint that I outlined. So with that, Meredith, let's open it up for questions.\n\nQ -:\n\nA - Meredith Burns: You bet. Thanks, Sean. As a reminder, you can submit questions during this webcast via the questions and the answers box at the bottom left of the screen. We received a number of presubmitted questions. And so I will ask those questions now, and we'll cover the live questions in as they start to come in. So we're going to kick off with a question on the quarter. So Sean, EBITDA was up $25 million year-over-year. You grew revenue and gross margins, and you had expected Q3 to benefit from about $25 million of year-over-year cost savings. How come EBITDA didn't grow more than $25 million?\n\nSean Quinn: Yes. Just first on the cost savings piece. Our cost savings were exactly as planned. And so that's been great. I think what we disclosed one year-ago, we delivered and maybe a little bit more than that even. And now those are fully in our run rate by the end of - end of March here. So those are in the numbers. We did have a currency headwind on EBITDA, which was, again, consistent with what we had previously disclosed in our commentary. That was a little over $4 million in the quarter. And there's - just as a reminder, in Q4, there's still another about $4 million of headwind in front of us. We do have in OpEx, just naturally in any year, you have things like merit increases or other kind of inflationary increases in your OpEx space. And so you have to factor that in. So we had $25 million of year-over-year cost savings. That's in the math. But then you also have some growth in OpEx just from normal inflationary increases that eats into that. So the way I would think about it for the quarter is that our contribution profit on a consolidated basis grew $24 million and our EBITDA grew $25 million. And so you can see that the contribution profit growth basically dropped through to EBITDA, and that's because of the OpEx efficiency and specifically the cost reductions that we implemented last year, allowing that contribution to profit to flow through. I think the other thing is that just from a - I mentioned this in my earlier remarks that there was a little bit of impact from the Easter holiday timing as well. And so you can expect a little bit of flow-through from that. That was a timing shift as well.\n\nMeredith Burns: Yes. And I'll just say that as I was watching people dialing in, a few people after you made that comment, Sean, and you can see this in the transcript just to reiterate that we did size that at the start of the call, Sean sized that at about $6 million of an impact from the Easter timing in Q3 that would shift into Q4.\n\nSean Quinn: And just to be clear, that $6 million is impact on revenue, and that was about 80 basis points.\n\nMeredith Burns: Exactly. Great. Thank you. All right. Moving on. So Sean, another one for you. We rarely talk about end market exposures, but given performance the past few quarters, it reasons that BuildASign is quite exposed to real estate and DIY home decor. Can you give us a ballpark of what percentage of BuildASign's revenue comes from these two end markets? Is it fair to say that until these end markets recover, we will see more of the same as BuildASign?\n\nSean Quinn: Yes. Yes, it's a good question. And you're right, we rarely talk about end market exposures because there's - we have such little concentration in any one industry or end market. And so - and that's actually a great strength of the business. For BuildASign, there's a few things that impacting revenue growth here. So I'm just going to walk through that and also respond to the question along the way. The first one, there's really - there's two impacts here that we've called out. One is the slowness in the home decor category and then the impact of real estate. So I'll take those in turn. On the home decor side, it changes quarterly, but on an annual basis, home decor is a little less than half of the BuildASign revenue. And now we say home decor. But by far, the largest product category in there is canvas prints. So you can think about this as mostly canvas prints. Most of that is for consumer use cases, so that could be in the home, it could be for gifts, but there are also business use cases for canvas prints as well. I'm not sure going back to the tie-in to real estate as an end market. I'm not sure I connect home decor here or canvas prints more specifically so directly to the real estate market. There may be some impact there, but I wouldn't make that direct connection. For home decor or canvas prints, this has really been more about channel performance for BuildASign. And some of the transactional acquisition channels that were very efficient in past years have been less efficient recently. And so that's going to take a few quarters to work through, and the team is very actively working through that. But we think the end market is still a good one. And again, that's more of a channel performance. Of course, for home decor, we had the spike during the pandemic, which was a pull forward of demand. And then we've since normalized to lower levels and then more recently, some bumpiness because of that channel performance. On the real estate side, for real estate, it is about 10% of BuildASign's revenue. And part of that is their enterprise accounts business, which some of their largest accounts - their largest enterprise accounts are national real estate franchises. And so that's had some impact on growth in the near-term. But the BuildASign team is strong. We say that regularly. They've been working on multiple opportunities. And the foundations of those have been multiyear efforts, but the benefits are still ahead of us. In North America, just to pan out a little bit, the signage category in both BuildASign and in Vista has been really strong. And we should also benefit there in the quarters ahead from the political cycle in the United States. BuildASign is also increasingly an important production partner to Vista with their attractive cost structure for signs for other large-format products but also for supporting new product introductions at Vista as well. And so we expect even more of that as we look forward. So been a little noisy in recent quarters, but it's a great business, a really strong team, and they have a good ability to adapt and improve over time. We've seen that through the time that they've been part of Cimpress. And so they've done a lot over the last two years or three years. That should set them up for success in the next few years, including continued expansion as a fulfiller for other Cimpress businesses, most notably Vista.\n\nMeredith Burns: Great. Thank you, Sean. I'm going to have Robert weigh in on this next question. Robert, we have spoken in the past about PP&E or CapEx cycles at Upload & Print and how we were near the end of one. Is this an accurate characterization? And if so, are the new lower spend levels more reflective of where PP&E should be for these businesses moving forward?\n\nRobert Keane: Okay. Well, thanks for the question, and welcome, everyone. We did talk about this in the release. We do expect CapEx overall at Cimpress to be higher next year because we have opportunities in new product introductions and in some important efficiency improving production equipment. Some of that will be in Upload & Print, but we're looking at these across the Cimpress level. And with our Cimpress volumes, even if the CapEx will end up in one part of Cimpress is one of our segments or another, we do look at it as a return on the overall Cimpress level. So if we talk about CapEx cycles in Upload & Print, specifically, I'd break that into two parts. In our PrintBrothers segment, CapEx has been about 1% of revenues for the last five years. That includes this year FY2024, because there we use a lot more third-party fulfillment. We do expect CapEx in PrintBrothers to remain relatively low, but it is likely to increase a bit as we vertically integrate where it makes sense to do so. And that comes along with lower cost of goods sold and better margins when we do that. In that segment, there's - there will continue to be much more third-party fulfillment, but we're starting to shift it a little bit. It's traditionally been a very different model than other parts of Cimpress. Sticking within Upload & Print, Print Group does produce the vast majority of our revenues there internally. So you're correct that over time, that's where we've seen these ways of CapEx intensity tied to both replacement CapEx, but also growth CapEx or even replacing equipment, which is not yet end of life with new equipment, which is just much more economical or higher quality output. Now as a percentage of revenue, CapEx intensity is down a bit. We do expect it to continue to fluctuate year-to-year over the next year or two. They're not just in Upload & Print, there are multiple product efficiency opportunities. I wouldn't set the expectation that, that reduction now is a new norm. It's going to continue to fluctuate. And that fluctuation of CapEx is a pretty material factor, although not the only factor behind our statement last night that we expect our conversion from EBITDA to free cash flow at the Cimpress level to fluctuate year-to-year within that 45% to 50% range. Now Print Group's gross profits have been really strong. And on top of that - their gross profit in their direct-to-customer business, on top of that, they are growing fulfillment for other businesses, for example, Vistaprint, which then has a COGS reduction impact at the Cimpress wide level. And we've been - in other words, we've been able to export some of the great innovation we see in Print Group and to a lesser extent, but a growing extent PrintBrothers into other parts of Cimpress. And that CapEx required for that has prevented CapEx in other parts of Cimpress. So we're very happy with the returns we've seen so far. And then finally, we're confident that all of this CapEx we're talking about, if you look at it as an overall portfolio is high return, it's also behind our growth and it's improving our competitive advantage. So we're pretty comfortable with what we're doing there.\n\nMeredith Burns: Great. Thank you, Robert. All right. We're going to switch from CapEx to cap software. This one is going to be for Sean. The amount of capitalized software in National Pen and all other businesses seems very high relative to their contribution to Cimpress overall. Why are they so elevated? And how are these investments expected to evolve moving forward? And I'll just say the reason why the person who asked this question knows this is because they're reading our financial and operating metrics spreadsheet, which we post on our website every quarter. So a way to go to the person who asked this question looking at all of the documents that we provide.\n\nSean Quinn: I'm sure whoever asked this appreciates that, Meredith. Yes, so National Pen's capitalized software has been pretty consistently 1% of revenue for the last, I think, four or five years. BuildASign for that same time period has been about 2%, and that's been consistent as well. We don't talk about it as much as we did the Vista tech transformation. But each of these businesses has done a lot in terms of rearchitecting their e-commerce front-end, but also building additional services on top of that, that also leverage MCP. And so that's very much been in play for - yes, for the last four or five years. And we're through a lot of the heavy lifting on that. So we should see leverage out of that as we look to the future. But that's why these capitalized software levels are where they are. And I think if you look at National Pen, for example, is 1% of revenue, but where their growth is coming from is in the e-commerce segment, Pens.com, and that's been very strong growth that is becoming more and more of the mix. And so I think that the - if you look at the capitalized software relative to the absolute growth there and just the size of that channel now, which is going beyond $100 million and growing high teens, low 20s percentage. If you look at it from that perspective, I would say that capitalized software investment has been productive.\n\nMeredith Burns: That's great. Thanks, Sean. All right. I think I'm going to switch gears now. We're going to talk about cap structure, capital allocation, fun stuff like that. So Sean, I'll stick with you for this next question. What is the timeline for refinancing your high-yield notes? Is there still a place for them in your future cap structure given your new leverage policy with a lower target?\n\nSean Quinn: We haven't made decisions on either when or how we'll refinance the bonds. And we have time before we need to make those decisions. We do like having both secured and unsecured debt in our capital structure. And so yes, we do think that remains a place for unsecured debt in the future. And the reasons for that are - there are a few, but diversification of the capital base is a good thing. Keeping secured capacity is a good thing. And also, over time, gives us some optionality because we do expect that our base of profitability is going to grow and therefore, we'll need to access some of these markets in the future. As I said, we don't have a specific timeline. We still have a little more than two years before our high-yield notes mature. And starting in just a few months here, we can call the bonds at par. And so we'll keep a close eye on where the market is at. I think for us, we're going to just continue to focus on consistent execution and what we've outlined even for our leverage expectations between that and the continued strong results should position us to have further credit rating upgrades as well. And all of that should be favorable when we eventually do come to market. So feel like we're in a good spot there.\n\nMeredith Burns: Thanks, Sean. Great. Okay. I'm going to ask Robert this next question. So Robert, it was great to read that we repurchased 5% of the float at what - at what we believe to be an attractive price to IVPS GAAP. What IRR do we typically target with our repurchases so that we can objectively say that repurchasing $1 of stock is better or worse use of capital than investing $1 in automating process X, Y, Z?\n\nRobert Keane: Okay. Let me just quickly answer your specific question and then give some context. I'd say 15%, and then I'll come back to talk about that in a little bit more detail. So I share - we share your point of view that it was an attractive price relative to our intrinsic value per share. And if you look at it via other metrics, it was roughly 8x trailing 12-month EBITDA, and you can do the multiples of unlevered free cash flow or free cash flow or steady state free cash flow. And again, those are all indications that it was also an attractive price. Now there's a few ways we look at returns on our share repurchases. Again, as you point out, your question, the most important thing is what our estimate of intrinsic value per share is relative to the price we can buy the shares at, which drives that. But we also look at cash flow yield, what we expect that cash flow to grow over time relative to what we pay per share. And of course, alternative investments, what can we do to improve the customer value to drive our competitive advantage. We believe we should be targeting an IRR on these in excess of 15%, which we believe is happening when we look at the purchases we've made based on the information we have. And so we think that they also will have a very attractive free cash flow per share return over time. So going back to alternative investments, that is a really important question. We look at other opportunities where, in general, all things being equal, we'd be biased towards organic investments, be that OpEx or CapEx first. When we are sticking within the leverage guidance we just provided last night and the policy we just described and where the returns and the profitability justify those investments organically on the individual projects. So going back to what I answered in the question before about our commentary last night in the earnings document, we're going to be making an increase we expect in CapEx in fiscal year 2025. And those have very good IRRs, and we like those projects, but there's limits to how much we can do in a given period of time and also do so while ensuring operational execution. So if I step way back right now, we're really doing as we've said for the last 12 months, 18 months, stay focused on what's most important from an operational and customer improvement perspective. And when the need for capital in that bucket get filled up and there's excess cash that we can use to either build liquidity and bring down our debt or earning yield or buy shares, we continue to do that. And once again, we think our new leverage policy and the target of continuing to delever down towards the 2.5x mark, we'll keep the bar high in terms of what investments we do, whether it's organic or share buyback or anything else.\n\nMeredith Burns: Thanks, Robert. So I've got a related question that I'm going to have Sean answer this time. Could you please remind us of what IRR thresholds we target for each of the capital allocation activities you identified on Page 3 of the earnings document, namely operating expense growth investments, CapEx for new products and enhancing productivity, M&A, repurchasing shares and debt repurchases?\n\nSean Quinn: Sure. I'll remind everyone what we've said in the past. And then I think there's probably a practical overlay on top of that, that, that might even be more relevant. So the ones that we talked about historically and the residual risk that's dependent as well was 10% for OpEx or CapEx investments in well-understood areas, where we have a long track record of driving returns and things that are very close into how we run the business every day, 15% for M&A of profitable businesses or for new product introduction areas that are adjacent to the ones that we know well and then 25% for investment in either new geographies or riskier new product introduction. And so those have been outlined in Robert's past annual letters and other venues. A lot has changed since we talked about those publicly, the last time, most importantly, cost of debt is a bit higher. And we've also learned some lessons about some of those areas of capital allocation, in particular, new developing geographies. And so the bar there is very high, practically speaking. Given the commentary that we gave last night and also the leverage policy that we've outlined, there's really - we have a strong desire to continue to maintain our focus and operational rigor. And so practically speaking, I think organic investments should right now have a bar that's a bit higher than that, let's call it 12% plus. But some of it, like some of the CapEx opportunities that we see for next year, will be much higher than that and very quick payback. So this should be very obvious. We're - from an M&A perspective, as we've said, we're not considering material M&A right now. And so anything that we've done there, which has been relatively small or even anything that we would expect to consider in the near future, which would also be smaller, would have that very obvious high returns. And that's how I would classify anything that we've done in our very recent past, and that would be 20% plus. So it should be just extremely obvious and relatively small. For share repurchases, Robert went through that, and so I won't repeat what he went through there. And then for debt repurchases, that return threshold is a bit lower. And I think the framework there is a bit different. So if we have sufficient liquidity, which we do, and we have cash on the balance sheet that is excess cash that's earning money market return right now, let's say, 5% plus, we can compare that to buying bonds. And if we can do that at a known yield in excess of 10%, which we've been able to do, that also reduces our gross debt and there's no execution risk attached to that, that's a no-brainer. And so that's been the framework we've used for those. And again, that's more of a function of cash liquidity position and then the relative opportunities to use excess cash.\n\nMeredith Burns: Thank you, Sean. All right. Another question for Robert. Robert, can you please elaborate on why philosophically it makes sense to run our business with 2.5x leverage and not 1x leverage or 4x leverage?\n\nRobert Keane: So in summary, philosophically, not 4x because 2.5x makes us much more robust and resilient and not 1x because debt does have clear advantages in returns to equity. And we think the new policy strikes the right balance between those. But to dive a little bit more behind that, the 2.5x, which is approximate - or we could go below that is not the output of a spreadsheet. There's a lot of discussion that got it there. But when we did look at it analytically and factoring in the possibilities of shocks to profitability, including future mega shocks like the pandemic we had four years ago and also considering the cost of debt at different leverage levels, we pretty quickly got to the 3x leverage and then the discussion continued from there about what's the advantage of delevering further than that. I would say it's not for Cimpress, a question about optimizing tax benefits of financing costs because of the way our corporate structure works, we don't get benefit of all of our interest costs. So there is a cost of capital part of this. There's a risk management piece from being more robust. And there's an intangible piece of this, which is how do we want to sleep at night and how do we want to operate the business. Again, stepping way back to the pandemic, we were in the midst of turning around Vista when the pandemic hit, we chose to continue that turnaround, but it led to an uncomfortably high leverage, which we've now come back out of and we'll go further. Another factor we talked about, and again, there's no overriding factor in this conversation, but just to expose you to some of the conversations we had in a world of real interest rates, which are materially higher, and having seen the shocks that have happened, we think delevering is just healthy and will help us through that volatility. Who knows when and if the interest rates will ever go back to where they were before. Finally, I'd say that there's a lot of value in not doing unnatural things that disrupt the business. And again, we've seen that in the pandemic. We - in the very early days, we had to really quickly cut costs, but then we had to go back and invest in areas we felt we needed to turn around the business for the longer term. And again, being at a lower level really helps us give us the flexibility in those types of cases, which are out of the middle of the bell curve of future events. That's all why it come down, going back to why we can go lower. Again, we do see a lot of opportunity to invest capital at above our cost of capital, and this level still gives us that, and therefore, again, it helps us in terms of returns on equity. And again, we don't know where we're not going to necessarily pay 2.5x and stay there. We certainly have no problem with building up dry powder with operating cash flow. We'll cross that bridge when we get to it.\n\nMeredith Burns: Great. Thank you, Robert. All right. We have exhausted the list of questions from a presubmitted and live perspective. And so I am going to ask Robert to wrap up the call.\n\nRobert Keane: Okay. Well, thank you, Meredith. And thank you to all of the investors for joining this call, and thank you for continuing to entrust your capital with us. We remain very focused on execution. Our team is very motivated and incentivized to continuously improve. Most importantly, the value we deliver to our customers, and we really believe in doing so that will continue to drive the financial results we deliver to our shareholders. Strategically and operationally, our significant investments over the past five years have really positioned us well for the future. Financially speaking, our strong profitability and a return to stronger profitability as we plan to do does mean that we're going to be operating at much more comfortable levels of leverage, as I just spoke about in the last question, even as we will continue to invest in our customer value and in doing so, investing and continuing to grow our intrinsic value per share. So have a great day, everyone. Again, we appreciate your interest and trust with us.\n\nOperator: Thank you. This concludes today's conference, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you for your participation.

Despite the current downturn, the company expects a dynamic upward trend in wafer demand beyond 2024 and remains committed to its ambitious growth targets for 2028. Siltronic's Q1 sales dipped slightly from the previous quarter, but EBITDA margin saw an increase to 26.4%.\n\nThe company has revised its 2024 guidance, anticipating sales to fall around 10% below the previous year and EBITDA margin to range between 21% and 25%. Capital expenditures are projected to be slightly below EUR 550 million, mainly due to the development of its next-generation fabrication plant, FabNext, in Singapore.\n\nKey Takeaways\n\nCompany Outlook\n\nBearish Highlights\n\nBullish Highlights\n\nMisses\n\nQ&A Highlights\n\nSiltronic's next investor relations event is the Annual General Meeting (AGM) scheduled for May 13th, with Q2 figures to be released on July 25th. The company's focus on growth drivers, especially the development of FabNext, is a pivotal part of their strategy to achieve long-term targets despite current market adversities.\n\nInvestingPro Insights\n\nAs Siltronic AG navigates a challenging semiconductor environment, its financial health and future outlook become critical for investors to monitor. According to real-time data from InvestingPro, Siltronic's market capitalization stands at $2.46 billion, reflecting its positioning in the market. The company's P/E ratio is currently 15.77, which may be considered by investors when evaluating the company's earnings relative to its share price.\n\nInvestingPro data also reveals a dip in revenue, with the last twelve months as of Q1 2024 showing a decline of 16.38% to $1.57 billion. This contraction aligns with the company's reported weakened demand and sales reduction. Despite this, Siltronic has maintained a gross profit margin of 22.44%, a figure that, while indicative of the company's ability to control costs, aligns with one of the InvestingPro Tips highlighting the company's weak gross profit margins.\n\nInvestingPro Tips suggest that Siltronic is quickly burning through cash and may suffer from valuation concerns due to a poor free cash flow yield. With analysts not anticipating profitability for the current year and expectations of net income dropping, these insights may be crucial for investors considering the company's prospects. It's worth noting, however, that Siltronic has been profitable over the last twelve months, which could be a sign of its underlying resilience.\n\nFor those looking to delve deeper into Siltronic's financials and projections, InvestingPro offers additional insights.

Please note that this call is being recorded and streamed on the Siltronic's website. The call is also be available as an on-demand version later today. Your participation in this call implies on your consent with this. At this time, it would like to turn the conference over to Verena Stutze, Head of Investor Relations and Communications of Siltronic. Please go ahead.\n\nVerena Stutze: Thank you, Sandra. Welcome everybody to our Q1 2024 results presentation. This call will also be webcast live on siltronic.com. A replay of the call will be available on our website shortly after the end of the call. Our CEO, Michael Heckmeier; and our CFO, Claudia Schmitt, will give you an overview of our financials, the current market development, and our guidance. After the presentation, we will be happy to take your questions. Please note that management comments during this call will include forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. For a discussion of risk factors, I encourage you to review the Safe Harbor statement contained in today's press release and presentation. All documents relating to our Q1 2024 reporting are available on our website. I now turn the call over to Michael for his remarks.\n\nMichael Heckmeier: Thank you, Verena and a warm welcome also from my side. As usual, let me start with the key messages of today's call. The first quarter of 2024 was without any major surprises and continued to be characterized by weak demand for wafers due to the high inventory levels at our customers. As you probably saw in our ad hoc announcement last week, this negative sentiment will remain with us for most of 2024. Accordingly, I would call it a year of transition. Our industry and the future growth will be driven by megatrends such as generative AI, digitalization, and electromobility, and therefore we confirm our ambition to increase our group sales to more than EUR2.2 billion and our EBITDA margin to a figure in the high 30s by 2028. Let me give you a quick glance on our Q1 figures, which will be presented in detail by Claudia in a minute. As already indicated, the first three months did not bring major surprises. Sales were slightly below the previous quarter, but the EBITDA margin increased from 25.5% to what I consider a respectable 26.4%, thanks to positive tailwind from the non-operating FX result. We achieved this with stable market shares and prices. Although, we have passed the peak of our investments in 2023, the CapEx primarily required for the ramp of FabNext led, as expected, to a continued negative net cash flow. Claudia will now give you a deep dive into our financial performance before I report back with updates on the market development and the outlook. Claudia, please.\n\nClaudia Schmitt: Thank you, Michael. A warm welcome also from my side. Let's jump directly into the analysis of our results. As Michael highlighted, the first quarter progressed largely as expected with no big surprises, and we have been managing the weak demand with resilience. Our sales totaled EUR344 million, a decrease of 3.7% quarter-on-quarter. The small decline is due to some shifts in product mix and a slight negative FX impact. It's important to note that product mix shifts are typical quarterly fluctuations. Both the wafer area sold and the prices remained largely stable sequentially. In the first quarter, our EBITDA was robust with EUR91 million with an EBITDA margin of 26.4%, marking a slight increase quarter-on-quarter. The small decline in sales was counterbalanced by a favorable FX result of EUR5 million in Q1, which arose partly due to hedging and partly due to valuations in the light of a strengthening U.S. dollar. Looking into the next quarters, please do not expect a similar positive hedging result. As we have already stated for this year compared to 2023, while we do forecast a positive impact from reduced energy and material costs, we expect this to be offset by a lower hedging result and increasing labor tariffs. The EBIT came in at EUR36 million and was in line with Q4. Our financial result saw a modest decline to minus EUR3 million. The tax rate for Q1 stood at 16%, an increase from the 7% rate in Q4. The lower tax rate in Q4 was mainly related to deferred taxes. Taking all these factors into account, we concluded Q1 with a net income of EUR28 million. Now, let's look at our balance sheet. Total assets summed up to roughly EUR4.6 billion by the end of March. The changes compared to Q4 are mainly driven by two factors. On the one hand, our investments increased the fixed assets by EUR153 million. Consequently, our cash and securities have decreased to less than EUR400 million by the end of March. On the other hand, you may recall that our working capital ratio at the end of 2023 was at an all-time low. We've recorded very favorable DSO and a CapEx related surge in trade payables. However, as already announced in the last call, we now saw a reversal of this. The DSO increased in general, and we've received customer payments just after the reporting date. Furthermore, the spillover from the trade payables from Q4 was significantly reduced in Q1. The equity ratio remains resilient and is at a very healthy level of 46%. Financial liabilities in Q1 increased quarter-on-quarter as we have drawn the first EUR50 million of our syndicated loan. Therefore, loans amounted to a total of roughly EUR850 million at the end of March. Customer prepayments were slightly above EUR600 million with EUR27 million received and EUR6 million refunded. In Q1, our CapEx totaled EUR173 million, which is roughly EUR200 million below Q4. Reflecting our increased focus on CapEx management, we have revised our full year CapEx guidance downward from less than EUR600 million to slightly below EUR550 million as compared to our March publication. Most of this CapEx is allocated to our new Fab. Let's dive deeper into our debt situation as illustrated in the bridge. End of '23, Siltronic was carrying net financial debt of EUR356 million. Our operating cash flow in Q1 was impacted by an increase in trade receivables, and therefore, came in at EUR62 million. As previously mentioned, our DSO were, in general, higher and we've received payments from customers just after the reporting date. Consequently, our operating cash flow was noticeably lower than the high CapEx payments we saw in Q1, also due to the CapEx liabilities overhang from the previous year. In Q1, we've recorded an investment grant of EUR32 million, which had a positive effect on our cash flow. In total, our net financial debt amounted to EUR501 million. You already know this financing picture. Therefore, only a brief update from my side. The first portion of the syn loan, EUR50 million, was drawn in Q1. As already announced, we will undertake refinancing this year and are currently evaluating our options. In this context, we currently have no plans for a capital increase. With this, I hand back to Michael.\n\nMichael Heckmeier: Thank you, Claudia. Ladies and gentlemen, when looking at this slide, let's begin with the good news. The end markets are anticipated to grow. Our March projections for end market growth were slightly lowered from 7% to 8% to approximately 5% due to some new data points, especially for the Industrial & Automotive segment. Servers driven by AI, especially generative AI, will see the largest growth this year. From the end markets, the growth would perfectly fit to our 4% to 5% CAGR assumption. However, the still elevated inventories of our customers are being reduced slower than expected. As a result, we anticipate a higher negative inventory impact. This inventory situation overshadows the positive trend from the end markets and results in an overall negative wafer demand in the mid to high single digit percentage range. Therefore, we expect the inventories to last for several more quarters, further delaying the turnaround in our industry. Let's take a closer look at our market assessment for the three wafer segments and our most important market channels. Whilst memory inventory is decreasing slowly, we already see the first positive impacts from one of the big megatrends driving our industry. Artificial intelligence. The strongest growth we see in servers used for AI applications is driven by high-end DRAM chips used for high bandwidth memory. The inventories for HBM appear improving compared to other DRAM and NAND, which are still pretty elevated and only decreasing slowly. When it comes to logic, the inventory levels show a mixed picture at different customers. Regrettably, we observe similar trends when the inventory levels are only improving slowly. And unfortunately, power inventories further increased based on the latest data points. Please be aware that this is a combination of our own models and market data based on several data points and that segment dynamics are influenced by individual customer patterns. The overall picture can deviate significantly due to different inventory types and also our customer mix. When looking at the more positive news flow from certain chip manufacturers, these announcements appear to be more price than volume driven. And you know, for us, volume is the decisive factor. As you may have noted from our ad hoc announcement last week, we've observed further significant volume postponements from customers, particularly for the second half of 2024. Overall, the demand situation has not improved in the past few weeks. And as already mentioned, we anticipate 2024 to be a transition year. Looking beyond 2024, we expect a dynamic upward trend for overall wafer demand, in particular for 300 and 200 millimeter wafers. I'm sure you are familiar with this chart. As you know, for 300 millimeter, we anticipate a strong CAGR of 6%. For 200 millimeter, we expect a small growth and for diameters up to 150 millimeters, a continued decline. Today will be the last time we report on the small diameters market. Since a few weeks ago, we announced that we will phase out the SD wafer production during 2025. As communicated for us, SD wafers are approaching the end of their life cycle. The significant decline in volumes we saw in 2023 and early '24 triggered our decision to discontinue the production of polished and epitaxial small diameter wafers. The process is set to be completed in the course of 2025 and will not have a substantial negative effect on our results this year. Going forward, we will further increase our focus on the growth drivers power and leading edge also fueled by 300 millimeter wafers. And this is supported by FabNext in Singapore. So, we are very pleased with the development of FabNext. The transition of the project to the local team is completed and the capacity ramp is on schedule. Let's now turn to the guidance for the financial year 2024, which had to be adjusted due to the still challenging demand situation driven by high customer inventories. Due to the ongoing weakness in demand reaching into the second half of the year, we now expect 2024 sales to be roughly 10% below 2023. This is mostly volume driven, but we also see both a small FX and price effect. We expect our EBITDA margin to be in the range of 21% to 25%. Depreciation is projected to be below EUR300 million, a significant increase from the previous year's EUR203 million. However, this new guidance is considerably lower due to the later start of FabNext's depreciation in Q4. As indicated, CapEx will be significantly reduced compared to the record high of more than EUR1.3 billion in 2023. We expect it to reach an amount of slightly below EUR550 million, which is roughly EUR50 million lower than our guidance in March. This reduction is driven by our high focus on CapEx management. Due to the steep decline in CapEx, we will see a pronounced improvement in net cash flow, although it will still remain significantly negative. I would like to conclude this presentation confirming our midterm ambitions for 2028. We expect a substantial sales growth to more than EUR2.2 billion and an improvement of the EBITDA margin to the high 30s by 2028. Thank you very much for your attention. With this, we close our presentation, and Claudia and I will be happy to take your questions. Sandra, please open the Q&A.\n\nOperator: We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Daniel Schafei from Citi. Please go ahead.\n\nDaniel Schafei: Hi, good morning. Yes, so I have a couple of questions. The first one being, so now that given we have seen the pushouts in the second half, can we still expect that the first half in terms of sales will be still the low points, especially in 2Q or might it be even 3Q and 4Q now? And also, now that you've seen those pushouts and adjusted the guidance accordingly, is this guidance now already conservative enough, or is there potential for more pushouts to come? Thank you.\n\nMichael Heckmeier: Thank you, Daniel. I will take these two questions. With regards to more details about quarterly phasing, we would refrain now to give a great amount of more of this. As you know, we gave a full year guidance, our Q1 results, and then you can do some math. And we don't expect any significant pickup during the year. So, I think that's maybe enough for your further quarterly modeling. With regards to your second question, do we expect more pushouts? Currently, we built all what we know into the guidance. We have some downside potential and margin there in the guidance. But I also have to say the environment is a very dynamic one. But we know -- what we know is included and we don't have a clear view on what to come. But what we know by today is embedded in this guidance.\n\nDaniel Schafei: Okay. Thank you. I understand. And just maybe a follow-up, a quick one on pricing. What price reductions do you guys see for 200 millimeters and 300 millimeters, respectively currently in the spot and LTA markets?\n\nMichael Heckmeier: Yeah. We said clearly for the time being pricing is stable. That was the Q1 numbers. Going forward, we will see and we do see some price effects. And as we indicated earlier, it's a kind of mixed bag. Let me start with the lowest one, the small diameters experiencing significant price pressure, which at the end was one of the reasons for us to discontinue that business. In the second corner, 200 millimeters, we would say it's a mixed bag. So, some more high-tech areas are pretty stable and unchanged. And some others are also experienced pricing pressure. 300 millimeter is mainly covered by LTAs. Of course, no change in that statement. And we see a good adherence to LTA contracts. But also on the spot side there, we do see increasing price discussions. Overall, it's not significant, but that's maybe the overall situation we can explain.\n\nDaniel Schafei: Perfect. Thank you.\n\nOperator: The next question comes from Harry Blaiklock from UBS. Please go ahead.\n\nHarry Blaiklock: Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I've got a follow up to that pricing question. I just wondered what gives you confidence that pricing will stay at that slightly negative effects that you're guiding for and you won't see any further pressure beyond that?\n\nMichael Heckmeier: Yeah. So, I think the good news is the LTA coverage and it's holding. But we early on already said the longer this, let's say, demand weakness is hanging on, the more we will also see pricing effects kicking in. So, for the time being, we're quite comfortable. As I said, Q1, we can confidently report a stable price situation. We see this discussion is increasing, but we also don't have any hint for total gear change in this space of discussions.\n\nHarry Blaiklock: Got it. And then, I mean, based on your comments around LTAs, I guess, you haven't had any customers coming to you kind of asking for flexibility on pricing.\n\nMichael Heckmeier: Sorry, I didn't get this acoustically in the LTAs. We had what?\n\nHarry Blaiklock: Have you had any customers coming to you and asking for any flexibility kind of around pricing?\n\nMichael Heckmeier: So, the LTAs are including some price margins, right, as we discussed. This goes to single digit ups and downs, and there are discussions in this framework currently.\n\nHarry Blaiklock: Got it. Very useful. And then, I think in the past you said that for this year you don't have any major LTAs expiring. Is that the same going into 2025 as well?\n\nMichael Heckmeier: So, no major LTAs expiring, and particularly, let's say, important ones covering our FabNext, as we said, run times until 2028 or 2030. So, nothing major changing there.\n\nHarry Blaiklock: Great. Thank you, Michael.\n\nOperator: The next question comes from Constantin Hesse from Jefferies. Please go ahead.\n\nConstantin Hesse: Good morning. Thank you very much for taking my questions as well. The first one is, Michael, I know that you guys typically don't comment on competition, but given the dynamics, I'm very surprised about the different outlook that you guys are giving relative to Shin-Etsu. Shin-Etsu clearly stated last week that they saw the bottom in Q1 and that every quarter from now on they're seeing a recovery. So, I'm trying to understand, because typically, you, Shin-Etsu, Sumco (OTC: SUOPY ), there might be some timing differences, but typically you do move in tandem. So, is there something fundamentally happening here? Are you losing market share for some reason? Or is it simply a timing situation as to maybe you were supplying more wafers compared to Shin-Etsu and as a result, they're basically catching up a bit? What's the dynamic here? Why are they saying something completely different to you in that sense? That's my first question.\n\nMichael Heckmeier: Thank you, Constantin. I mean, we don't comment, resize on individual competitor statements. But what I can say is the following, and I repeat what I said already. Q1 data very clearly indicates no change in market share. So that means for the time being, and particularly through all those shifts happening last week. And of course, there's some phasing effects, et cetera. But we don't have any indication that our market share changes for the time being. Now, going forward, I mean, we need to check quarter-by-quarter as we do anyway. And that could well be that different wafer suppliers have different customer mix, different product mix. And then it depends, of course, for example, in the memory space, some of the customers did pull the brake earlier, others later. And then, some wafer suppliers have different exposure to different customers and depend on individual pickup times of the business. This could lead to such a mix effect. We don't have any indication for a structural or fundamental change happening at all. So, what we see is a stable situation and then some phasing and potential mix effects here and there. But that's what I can comment on. And when we read the very details of different announcements, it's not so different when you study them word by word than what we are saying.\n\nConstantin Hesse: Yeah. I was just a bit surprised that they're seeing an improvement following Q1 and you are. So, just some food for thought. Then, on the price, I understand that the change of the guidance, I assume that's now primarily driven by continued weakness in spot. And you just said something interesting there. My understanding was that there was no compromise on price in the LTAs, zero compromise across you, across Sumco, across Shin-Etsu. Now you're saying that the LTAs actually do have price ranges which can be negotiated in the single digits. And you're basically having these discussions now. So, concerning the LTAs, do you compromise on price here? So, are there discussions ongoing to potentially see price declines in LTAs?\n\nMichael Heckmeier: Thank you, Constantin. What I said about LTA pricing and the margins in the contract is nothing new. We said that already last year and it's part of the contract. And those discussions are happening, let's say, on a six-month and on a yearly basis. I don't see -- just to be clear, I don't see a significant change there. There's nothing new. The more price discussions starting in the spot part of it. But the LTA pricing is happening as committed in the contracts and there is no change.\n\nConstantin Hesse: Okay. So, no compromise on price on the LTA side.\n\nMichael Heckmeier: So, as contracted, as I said, some contracts have margins. Those are discussions, but no change compared to contracted pricing.\n\nConstantin Hesse: Okay. Understood. And then lastly, is on the production exit of the smaller diameter size in '25. You mentioned that there will not be a big impact in '24. Could I please understand what the impact is in '25? What is the current exposure you still have? I believe in previous conversations, I think it was something around 10% to 15% of volumes, market level anyways. And you always said that you were relatively similar to the market. So, what kind of a vote [ph] could we actually see up to a 10% volume impact next year, driven by the fact that you're exiting the SD market?\n\nMichael Heckmeier: Yeah. Thank you, Constantin. So, the reason why we don't see any -- or foresee no major impact for this year is that customer reactions were fairly relaxed. So, we never got customers that were cutting orders immediately. On the outside, we didn't also see an indication to harvest some very early upside. Because, of course, we were hoping some customers start a kind of last order race. So both did not happen. And that's the basis for the statement that '24 will not widely be impacted. In '25, we will continuously ramp down the revenue. It's a single digit, mid-single digit in our overall sales pattern. And from a margin side, we also said it will be slightly supportive in EBITDA margin, as the SD margin, of course, was and is below average of our group margin. So, these are the two effects. Revenue is slightly down, single digit in the overall portfolio and margins slightly up.\n\nConstantin Hesse: Okay. So, the revenue for SD is only mid-single digit. Brilliant.\n\nOperator: The next question comes from Gustav Froberg from Berenberg. Please go ahead.\n\nGustav Froberg: Good morning, everyone. Thank you for taking my question as well. I just have one just on balance sheet and funding. Could you run me through how you look at your balance sheet as of today, given the recent cut to guidance? Do you see any need to top up with equity, or are you happy to fund with debt? And what are some of the assumptions and thoughts that underlie the thinking around your funding and your balance sheet, please? Thank you.\n\nClaudia Schmitt: Good morning, Gustav. I will take your question regarding balance sheet. As we mentioned, the equity share of 46% is pretty comfortable with this. And we expect it to stay roughly in that range going further. Of course, we have drawn now the first part of our Syn loan and as such, our loan amount will go up during the year until end of this year. And those are the major changes that we see in our balance sheet for this year.\n\nGustav Froberg: Okay. Do you have any comments on covenants or anything of the like with the debt that you have and maybe the debt that you will take on? Whether or not you see any need for equity at all in the business?\n\nClaudia Schmitt: As we stated, we do not plan a capital increase this year. So, you see that we still feel very comfortable regarding our financial covenants.\n\nGustav Froberg: And final question on the same topic. Is the scope for you to take out more debt beyond what you have already talked about in terms of the syndicated loan, et cetera?\n\nClaudia Schmitt: Yeah. We announced that we will start refinancing around this year and this will take -- during this year we are evaluating our options and depending on the instrument that we choose and the general conditions, we will decide on how much we will take there, how much additional refinancing.\n\nGustav Froberg: Thanks, Claudia. Very clear.\n\nOperator: The next question comes from Florian Treisch from Kepler Cheuvreux. Please go ahead.\n\nFlorian Treisch: Yeah. Thank you very much. Two questions. The one is around the inventory correction you are now facing. So, the first question is a bit in Q1, was the impact still rising relative to Q4? Or do you expect it to really come down now quarter-by-quarter? And more in general on inventory correction, what is really your visibility? I think we have two major shifts in more pronounced inventory advance in the last five months, so clearly is it just hoping to have the right number or do you really get decent information from your key clients? The second part is around your reiteration of the ambition for '28. As they have now heard, SD will go out, which will be an impact. The whole recovery is delayed by excess inventory. So, is it implicitly meaning you're more confident than ever or is it just offering enough room for error to still get to this ambition? Thank you.\n\nMichael Heckmeier: Yeah. Thank you, Florian. With regards to inventories, I mean, you're right. There is a more general discussion picture and data point when we talk about memory, logic and power and the trend here. We kind of analyze with the same or similar data than you do. Yeah, this is pretty much from MI side and institutes what is published. And then, of course, in addition, we have the insight into our customers. So, here we can say if we take memory as an example, yes, inventories are going down, but much slower than we anticipated. So, this is, let's say, a very persistent topic. And some of our customers are still very elevated. That's a fact and has to do with their business situation. Some of them start reporting, let's say, growth and then, let's say, very positive dynamics. But then when you look into more details, it's more on the high value HBM and other side, which for them is more price than volume driven. So, means they can drive their P&L, but it's not by volume happening, but it's more on the price side. So that's not helping us a lot, but it's still good for our customers for the overall industry dynamics. So, we have a very clear picture of some of those inventories still elevated, going down. But it's hanging on for a longer time than everybody did foresee. Coming to your second question around our 2028 ambition. I mean, we have no doubt that the drivers of this industry are unchanged. And even I would say with Gen AI, there's even more midterm potential for the industry in total. So, a bad year or two bad years do not change our overall belief and ambition. And of course, we do the math and we are still confident that we can do the '28 numbers.\n\nMartin Jungfleisch: Hi, good morning. I have two questions, please. On FabNext, first of all, on the ramp speed. I understood initially it was like 100,000 wafers per month, final annualized output by year-end. Has this changed? And also, what you hear or see from competitors that are also expanding? Do you see a somewhat rational behavior? Or so, do you also adjust output speed according to market demand? Or is there any signs of them trying to gain market share? And the second question is really on the ramp cost. In your previous release, you were expecting a 300 basis point margin hit from ramp cost. Now with the Fab ramp delayed, what would be the impact this year? And also, would this mean that the majority of this 300 basis point impact would be now pushed to next year? Thank you.\n\nMichael Heckmeier: So let me start maybe with more outside perspective on FabNext. Then Claudia will give you some details about ramp cost and depreciation. And then, I come back with your second question about competitors behavior. So, FabNext, overall, our ramp plan is in place and there's no change. And this is, I think, very good news. The project has been handed over from the internal project organization to the local organization, which is always a very important milestone for such a, let's say, massive construction project. And things are happening on plan and on schedule there. With regards to customer qualifications, we see some of them sliding into Q4. And that is also, of course, related to the overall market environment, but not a change for overall ramp situation and ramp capacity. Now that's more the high-level statement. And maybe Claudia can then discuss a bit more the ramp cost situation and this depreciation impact.\n\nClaudia Schmitt: Yeah. I will take over for this part. To be very clear, the ramp costs are still there cash wise. So, there are ramp costs. But until we start to the depreciation of FabNext, they are capitalized. So, they show up in the assets and starting Q4, they will show up in the P&L. So, they are still there, but in our result only from Q4.\n\nOperator: The next question comes from Robert Sanders from Deutsche Bank (ETR: DBKGn ). Please go ahead.\n\nMichael Heckmeier: So, there was one from Martin around competitors, whether there's a change in competitors ramping their capacity. And Martin, I would also stay to my old statements. We see some of them also delaying ramping slower for some of them, which are, let's say, more in the shell phase. Still, we don't have very detailed insights. But overall, this high-level statement of rational behavior when it comes to capacity add and extensions is unchangeably true.\n\nRobert Sanders: Yeah. Hi. Good morning. I guess, given that you're delaying FabNext, the ramp of it, I was just wondering when you now thought that line would reach kind of cost parity with the existing Singapore line. Second question would just be around the SD impact. Did you say mid-single digit percentage of sales in 2024? Is that right, as opposed to mid-single digit millions? Just to double check. And then the last question, which is, can you comment around the impact of currency? Because obviously the yen has been very weak, which could give your Japanese competitors an advantage and perhaps a desire to be more aggressive on price. Thank you.\n\nMichael Heckmeier: So, let me take the first one, FabNext. When it's low, that's been ramping to a certain extent. We have no doubt that it will be very attractive and will contribute with EBITDA margins above 50%. So, now your question is, of course, when will that happen? And our honest answer is we don't know that, because it really will completely depend on market pickup and further ramp opportunities with our customers. So, it's now would be really misleading to give you any date in the current situation. Once market is picking up and we see volume developments coming in, then we would be again in a position to be more precise on that, what do you call cost parity or accretive margin contributions from FabNext. And to be honest, I didn't get the second one, but I think it was around SD. Is it mid-single digit overall sales? And I can reconfirm the answer, yes. It's mid-single...\n\nRobert Sanders: Yeah. That's what I thought. It was a 1 million wafer per month line in Berghausen, right? But I assume you've scaled that down already. I was just actually interested. Is that -- when is that going to be zero? Basically, when are you going to be completely shut down? Is it the end of '25?\n\nMichael Heckmeier: It will depend on final customer dependence and let's say all the patterns coming in. But in the course of '25, we will be discontinued that business.\n\nRobert Sanders: Got it. I actually just have one other last question just on the debt side. So, how much of your $900 million odd of debt is actually being refinanced this year? And what is your cost of debt now that your leverage is heading above two times? Is it above 6% or below? Thanks.\n\nClaudia Schmitt: As already mentioned just a second ago, we have not fixed the amount that we will refinance this year. We will see. It will heavily depend on the instrument that we will choose in the end. But we will let you know as soon as we know.\n\nRobert Sanders: Got it. Thanks a lot.\n\nClaudia Schmitt: And your question regarding FX, I think it's still open regarding the Japanese yen. Yes, of course, our Japanese customers may have benefits of the development. But of course, we won't comment on that. Our Japanese yen share in sales is pretty low, so it's not nice to see that development, but it's okay for us.\n\nRobert Sanders: Thanks a lot.\n\nOperator: The next question comes from Jurgen Wagner from Stifel. Please go ahead.\n\nJurgen Wagner: Yeah. Good morning. Looking at page 11 on your handout, which market segments would you regard yourself as being significantly overexposed? And then, you talked about rational behavior on a high-level. What would be your view on longer term pricing once this inventory correction is over and all the new wafer fabs have ramped up in volumes in, let's say, '26 or so? Thank you.\n\nMichael Heckmeier: Thank you, Jurgen. In terms of our market exposure, there is basically no change. I mean, we are almost equally represented in the three segments, memory, logic and power. And of course, we have a slight overexposure in memory. But the recent developments or shifts did not change our overall, let's say, market situation and exposure to those segments. What is surprising once inventories are melt down? The honest answer, we don't know. I mean, we eagerly wait for that time to happen. We would still be then in the position where around two-thirds of our 300 millimeter businesses in LTAs with the margins and price corridors I described there. And then we would assume, of course, if demand is picking up very quickly, that there will be upside spot opportunities again. But it's a bit speculative when you're still, let's say, in the middle of this rally and wait for the uptick. That would be my more high-level statement to your question.\n\nJurgen Wagner: And your long-term targets, they are basically based on the assumption that you will have two-thirds in LTAs, right?\n\nMichael Heckmeier: The long-term target is, of course, unchanged. And the assumption is, of course, kicking in of the FebNext benefits here, where the fully automated, let's say, very low-cost base, which then would provide this above average and eventually above 50% EBITDA margin contribution to the group. That's the main value driver together with our strategy, focusing on high value, leading edge and power.\n\nJurgen Wagner: Okay. Thank you.\n\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Ladies and gentlemen, that was the last question. I would now like to turn the conference back over to Dr. Michael Heckmeier for closing remarks.\n\nVerena Stutze: Thank you, Michael. This concludes our Q&A session. Thank you for joining us today. Our next Investor Relations highlight will be the AGM on May 13th. And the speeches of this AGM will also be streamed on our IR webpage. For our Q2 figures, this will be released on July 25th. Stay healthy and let's talk again soon. Bye.\n\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, the conference is now over. Thank you for choosing Chorus Call and thank you for participating in the conference.

Management's commentary will not specifically walk through the presentation on the call, rather it is a summary of the results and guidance they will discuss today. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Billy Cyr, chief executive officer.\n\nBilly Cyr -- Chief Executive Officer\n\nThank you, Rachel, and good morning, everyone. The message I would like you to take away from today's call is that these strong quarterly results prove that some of the most critical financial metrics in our 2027 goals are achievable. Now, we must prove to you that we can deliver them consistently over time. These results did not happen by accident.\n\nThey were the result of a disciplined focus on the key drivers of profit improvement and the changes we have made as an organization, and we are determined to continue those disciplined efforts until these results become a long-term trend. Further, these results demonstrate that with increased scale comes increased profitability, which was the basis of our Fresh Future plan that we announced in early 2023. It was then that we pivoted to a more balanced approach to growth and profitability versus our previous single-minded focus on growth alone. We were able to deliver these results because of the strength of the Freshpet business model and consumer proposition and strong improvement in the key fundamentals that drive our business.\n\nThere are several important points I would like you to take away from these results. First, our growth model continues to deliver. We have successfully absorbed the most significant pricing we have ever faced, delivered strong volume-based growth in the quarter, and returned to the greater than 20% household penetration growth rate embedded in our long-term targets. Further, we added those households at a customer acquisition cost, or CAC, that is comparable to the levels we experienced prior to the price increases of the last two years.\n\nThis demonstrates the strength of the Freshpet growth model, the power of our marketing, and also provides the confidence that the model can continue to deliver the 25% net sales growth embedded in our fiscal year 2027 goals. Second, we have improved our operational effectiveness. We are now delivering significant year-on-year improvements in our quality, input, and logistics costs, the cost that we've been intensely focusing on, and that has resulted in a step change in our adjusted gross margin and adjusted EBITDA margin. Our operational achievements stemmed from our efforts to build strong organizational capability at all levels, beginning with our Freshpet Academy that has strengthened our production workforce and also including some of the senior leaders we have hired in the past year and a half.\n\nAnd while these operational improvements are significant, we believe we are just getting started and that our team is capable of delivering this type of operational excellence more consistently over time and potentially doing even better. Finally, we are demonstrating the capability and operating discipline needed to balance capacity and demand at such a high rate of growth. We're adding capacity on budget and on time and at a pace that enables us to keep up with our high growth rate without carrying too much excess capacity. This enables us to deliver strong fill rates to our customers while simultaneously improving our margins and is a result of the rigor and discipline that we have put in place around our growth planning.\n\nThis is the balancing act between growth and capital investment that we have described to you previously, and we are increasingly mastering it at a high rate of growth. While we are pleased with the performance we delivered, we are not satisfied. We need to deliver this level of performance consistently over time. And once we have proven our ability to do that, we would consider revising our long-term targets.\n\nBut right now, we are focused on maintaining momentum in each of the remaining three quarters of this year. As we've mentioned many times before, the manufacturing systems to make fresh pet food are still in their infancy. We are investing heavily in organizational capability and technology to make those systems more reliable, consistent, and efficient and are making good progress on many aspects of the process. But we also know that we are still in the early days of the fresh pet food category and the opportunities for improvement are sizable.\n\nWe fully intend to realize those opportunities over time and have numerous initiatives underway to do that. Now, let me walk through some of the highlights of the first quarter. We had strong momentum in the first quarter and made tremendous progress against our long-term plan, and you can see that in our financial results. First, we started the year with very strong net sales growth with first quarter net sales of $223.8 million, up 34% year over year, driven primarily by volume growth of 31% and 3% price/mix.\n\nSecond, we saw significant improvement in adjusted gross margin, as well as adjusted EBITDA. First quarter adjusted gross margin was 45.3%, compared to 41.1% in the fourth quarter and 38.5% in the prior-year period. First quarter adjusted EBITDA was $30.6 million, an increase of approximately $28 million year over year. Our diluted earnings per share were $0.37.\n\nExcluding a mark-up in the value of our equity investment, EPS was $0.17 per share. I've been looking forward to the day that I can say those words for a very long time, and I expect that to become a habit going forward. In addition to those financial highlights, we made progress on our retail availability and visibility as well. We placed 617 fridges in the first quarter, including new stores, upgrades, and second/third fridges, bringing us to a total of 34,812 fridges at retail or more than 1.7 million cubic feet of retail space.\n\nAs of March 31, 2024, Freshpet could be found in 27,097 stores, 23% of which now have multiple fridges in the U.S. Fridge placements and store growth were supported by continued strong fill rates that ended the quarter in the high 90s again. We have rallied the organization around our Mainstream, Main Meal, More Profitable plans, what we refer to as Main & More. We're making the Freshpet brand more mainstream and getting people to use it as a main meal component, and this creates intensity and concentration in the business that we believe will allow us to be more profitable.\n\nFocusing on the idea of mainstream. According to Nielsen omnichannel data, which includes e-commerce and direct-to-consumer, as of March 30, 2024, total U.S. pet food is a $53 billion category. We only have a 3% market share within the $37 billion dog food segment, which the majority of our business is today, leaving a vast runway for growth.\n\nWithin the fresh/frozen subcategory in measured channels, which continues to outperform the broader pet food category, Freshpet has a 96% market share. The idea of the humanization of pets is becoming more and more mainstream, appealing to every income group and demographic, and it is our goal to make fresh food the standard way to feed your pets. Our household penetration at the end of the first quarter was 12.367 million households, up 24% year over year and growing. Our high-profit pet-owning households, or HIPPOHs for short, are growing even faster, up 34% versus the prior-year period.\n\nWe remain on track to meet our target of 20 million households by 2027. Overall, retail availability continued to grow, with ACV of almost 65%, and we continue to see upside in continued distribution gains going forward. We will continue to focus on increasing the percentage of stores with second and third fridges. Turning to the concept of main meal.\n\nWe use our advertising to educate consumers on the benefits of fresh food for their pets, and that is the key driver to convert more consumers to use Freshpet as a main meal. Today, 48% of Freshpet buyers use the product as the main component of their pet's meal, and there is a significant opportunity to increase this percentage, even with our heavy users. Thirty-seven percent of Freshpet's users are HIPPOHs, and they represented 89% of our sales in the first quarter. By focusing on fresh healthy food, offering a wide range of price points, and expanding our recipes, we believe consumers will naturally convert from using Freshpet as a topper to more of a main meal item, centering the plate around fresh.\n\nThis concept of converting toppers into main meal users will, in turn, increase buy rate, too, which was $96.84 at quarter-end, up 5% versus a year ago. Based on MegaChannel data, we currently have an average of 18.9 SKUs per point of distribution, up from 16.4 SKUs one year ago. We plan to increase the number of SKUs available at each retailer by adding second and third fridges, which amplifies our marketing spend and drives visibility for the brand, while also allowing us to showcase a wider range of our portfolio. Turning to the more part of main and more, more profitable.\n\nAs I mentioned earlier, we significantly improved margins this quarter, with solid operating performance, thanks to the work of our team. Quality, yield, input costs, and throughput all drove the over-delivery. Last quarter, I suggested that we had reached an inflection point, and we're turning a corner on profitability because we are now at a point where we can leverage our scale, increase business intensity and concentration. We are now seeing those benefits of scale play out, and they are driving increased profitability.\n\nFirst quarter adjusted gross margin increased 680 basis points year over year to 45.3%, and adjusted EBITDA as a percent of net sales was 13.7%, compared to 1.8% in the prior-year period. Logistics has been a key area of focus for us, and it was only 6.4% of net sales in the first quarter, improving 290 basis points year over year and coming in below our long-term target of 7.5%. We are greatly encouraged by these results and believe there is a significant opportunity to drive further profit improvement going forward, with our Ennis facility still ramping up production and our continued work on OEE to increase yield and throughput. That leads me to an update on our capacity.\n\nWe feel confident in our expansion and efficiency projects, which are all on budget. Ennis currently has three lines operating today, one roll line and two bag lines, and this facility is producing approximately 25% of our total production volume. Our fourth line in Ennis is slightly ahead of schedule and expected to start up by the end of the third quarter. This additional line kicks off phase 2 in Ennis and will alleviate some complexity of changeovers and SKU assortment since it will be our second roll line in this facility.\n\nWe've continued to evolve our capacity expansion plans to drive greater capital efficiency. We are intently focused on, first, maximizing the throughput of our existing lines by investing in an operational excellence program designed to increase our OEE. We've seen steady progress on this, particularly in Bethlehem, where the program has been underway for more than a year. Second, maximizing the capacity of our three existing sites so that we can avoid the high cost of incremental infrastructure and overhead.\n\nFor example, in Bethlehem, we are converting storage space to add a seventh line; in Kitchens South, we believe there is room to add one or two more lines in the existing building; and in Ennis, we are looking at ways to add more lines as well. Third, developing and implementing new technologies that generate more throughput per line and improve yield and quality. We have developed one technology that has shown great promise, and others are in earlier stages of development. It is still too early to tell when these might impact our capacity or P&L, but we believe these technology investments are important because our need for capacity will only grow as time progresses and we continue to believe that our manufacturing expertise will be a key strategic advantage over the long haul.\n\nScott, who successfully pioneered the development of our existing products and processes, is leading our efforts to develop and commercialize these potentially breakthrough technologies. As I said earlier, our first quarter results demonstrate that scale leads to improved profitability. Todd will walk through our updated guidance, but I'd like to provide an update on our results versus our long-term targets. We are clearly ahead of the pace required to deliver our original 2027 goals, which gives us increased confidence in our ability to either meet or exceed those goals, but we need to show we can deliver these results consistently.\n\nAlbeit encouraging, it is still early in the year, and we want to be measured in our forecasts for the balance of the year. We knew the first quarter sales were going to be strong because of our sizable media investment in Q4 of 2023 and the momentum that generated and the 34% first quarter net sales growth still exceeded our own forecast. We plan to carefully manage our top-line growth for the remainder of the year so that we do not get ahead of our installed capacity or organizational capability. We believe our model works very well at approximately 25% growth, generating the right balance of growth, capital investment, and cash generation.\n\nAdjusted gross margin of 45.3% in the first quarter was above our 2027 target of 45%, giving us even more reason to believe we can deliver our long-term goals. We were able to deliver this despite the fact that Ennis is still subscale and in start-up mode, and we have not implemented any of the new technologies we are working on yet. Further, our Freshpet operational excellence program is still in the early innings, and we believe there is lots of upside as we implement that program. But as I mentioned earlier, we want to demonstrate consistent performance at this level before we commit to anything beyond that.\n\nAdjusted EBITDA margin of 13.7% in the first quarter is tracking ahead of plan to achieve our goal of 18% adjusted EBITDA margin in 2027. As you know, we tend to front-load our media investment. Q1 media investment as a percent of net sales was more than 300 basis points higher than it will average for the year. So, when you adjust for that media spending cadence, Q1 adjusted EBITDA margin was closer to 17%, very close to our 2027 goal.\n\nWe believe that if we can consistently deliver the adjusted gross margin we delivered in Q1, that we can deliver the remaining building blocks of our adjusted EBITDA margin target of 18% through effectively leveraging the added scale that comes with our growth. Operating cash generation of $5.4 million was ahead of our plan, further increasing our confidence we can self-fund our growth, with no need for additional equity and potentially not even needing any new debt. In summary, we are off to a fast start this year. We have more work to do to prove to our shareholders that we can maintain or exceed this level of performance, but we are confident in our ability to execute based on what we know today and what is within our control.\n\nNow, let me turn it over to Todd to walk you through the details of the Q1 results and our updated guidance. Todd.\n\nTodd Cunfer -- Chief Financial Officer\n\nThank you, Billy, and good morning, everyone. As Billy mentioned, we had an excellent first quarter. Now, I'll give you some more color on our financials and updated guidance for the year. First quarter net sales were $223.8 million, up 34% year over year.\n\nNielsen measured dollar growth was 26% versus prior-year period, with broad-based consumption growth across channels. We saw 28% growth in XAOC, 25% in U.S. food, 13% growth in pet specialty, and over 100% growth in the unmeasured channels. First quarter adjusted gross margin was 45.3%, up 680 basis points year over year.\n\nThis was driven by improvements in input cost, quality, yield, and throughput. Specifically, input costs as a percent of net sales improved 390 basis points, reflecting a small amount of pricing from last year's price increase, improving yields in our manufacturing operation, and lower commodity costs. Quality costs improved by 240 basis points, and plant costs improved by 60 basis points, both driven by strong operating performance across all three manufacturing sites. Within plant costs, we were able to build much-needed inventory, which contributed about 100 basis points in the quarter.\n\nFirst quarter adjusted SG&A was 31.7% of net sales, compared to 36.7% in the prior-year period. We spent 14.3% of net sales on media in the quarter, down from 15.5% of net sales in the prior-year period. Total media investment was up 23% year over year, in line with our plan to have our media spending a bit less front-loaded this year. Logistics costs continued to improve and were 6.4% of net sales in the first quarter, a decrease of 290 basis points compared to the prior-year period.\n\nWe believe that about one-third of this improvement was due to market conditions such as lane rates and diesel costs, and the remainder was due to deliberate actions we took to increase fill rates, reduce miles, and other efficiency-focused efforts. In fact, our logistics costs in the quarter were $1.3 million lower than in the year-ago period despite shipping 31% more pounds of finished product. First quarter adjusted EBITDA was $30.6 million, or 13.7% of net sales, compared to $3 million, or 1.8% of net sales, in the prior-year period. This sharp increase was driven by better-than-expected net sales and improvement across input, quality, logistics, and plant costs.\n\nCapital spending for the first quarter was 46.5 million, in line with our expectations. Operating cash flow was 5.4 million, and we had cash on hand of 258 million at the end of the quarter. We continue to believe that we have adequate cash to fully fund our growth through 2024 and we will be free cash flow positive in 2026. We also believe that we will have access to traditional nondilutive forms of capital to bridge a gap in 2025, if it occurs.\n\nNow, turning to guidance for 2024. We are maintaining our net sales guidance of at least $950 million until we have greater confidence that we will have adequate rolls capacity to meet a higher level of demand later this year. This will also allow us to manage our growth to deliver the right balance between growth and capital investment. As we have said, we are carefully managing our growth to live within our capacity plans.\n\nIf we do find that our production performance from existing lines and facilities exceeds our plan, we would be comfortable letting the growth drift a bit higher this year. However, we also need to be mindful that we need to have adequate capacity to meet demand for next year as we exit the year. So, we are managing this closely, and we will not commit to a higher level of growth until we are sure that we can supply it reliably, both this year and next year, even if that means our growth rate later in the year is below our long-term rate of 25%. We can reaccelerate as capacity becomes available.\n\nIn terms of cadence, we still expect the first quarter to have the highest percent net sales growth year over year and expect sequentially lower percent growth throughout the remainder of the year. We may pull back media to control growth in line with long-term algorithm, not because demand is slowing, we are just managing the pace of growth as we expand capacity. We are raising our adjusted EBITDA outlook from our previous guidance of 100 million to 110 million to now at least 120 million to reflect the over-delivery in Q1. While our performance to date has been very encouraging, we will not commit to a higher level of profitability for the balance of the year until we have proven that we can repeat Q1's performance reliably.\n\nAs such, our revised guidance adds the Q1 over-delivery to our target for the year, but has not changed our expectations for the remaining quarters yet. We now expect adjusted gross margin to expand by at least 300 basis points for the full year, compared to 100 basis points previously, and expect commodity deflation in 2024. Capital expenditures will be approximately 210 million to support the installation of capacity to meet demand in 2025, consistent with our previous guidance. In summary, we are encouraged by the first quarter results.\n\nHowever, it is still early. And given the potential for the environment to change as we progress throughout the year and the unforeseen issues that arise from time to time, especially for high-growth businesses, we are going to be prudent in our forecasting. We said last quarter that we were at an inflection point and believe we have turned the corner on profitability. We have gained scale and are beginning to see the benefits of that.\n\nLike Billy mentioned, there is more upside longer term as we continue to work on operational efficiencies and bring more capacity online across our facilities, especially in Ennis. For now, though, we feel comfortable maintaining our long-term targets of 45% adjusted gross margin and 18% adjusted EBITDA margin because we want to prove we can consistently deliver on our profitability metrics over time before we commit to new targets. Finally, this step change in our profitability adds to our confidence that we will be able to fulfill our mission of elevating the way we feed our pets with fresh food that nourishes all. We are building Freshpet into an iconic market-leading brand that is redefining what pet food is, and that, we believe, is better for pets, people, and the planet.\n\nThat concludes our overview. We will now be glad to answer your questions. As a reminder, we ask that you please focus your questions on the quarter, guidance, and the company's operations. Operator.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. At this time, we'll now be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Ken Goldman with J.P. Morgan.\n\nYeah, thank you. Good morning. In speaking with investors this morning, I think there's a general feeling, you know, you guys have addressed this a little bit that your outlook, you know, maybe remains conservative. And I understand, you know, there's still uncertainty about production capacity toward the end of the year.\n\nBut just going beyond that, in addition to those capacity questions, I guess, is it reasonable to think that, you know, there is still a little bit of prudence as well in your top- and bottom-line guidance outside that? I'm just trying to think of areas where you might be a little more circumspect, just looking forward than what maybe current conditions might indicate.\n\nBilly Cyr -- Chief Executive Officer\n\nYeah. Thanks for the question, Ken. I'll take the top-line part of that, and then Todd will give you our view on the bottom-line part of that. But as you know, we are very thrilled with the Q1 performance, and it was a real good confidence-confirming point that said our strong -- our volume-based growth is back and we have -- our household penetration growth is back to where we want them to be.\n\nI mean, demonstrated consistent strong performance on that level. And it's also proving that the media is driving our growth. You know, we have really strong Q4 media that drove the growth in Q1. But as you acknowledged, you know, the reality is that we have to be very mindful of the balance between demand, capacity, and the cash that it takes to deliver the capacity.\n\nAnd we're trying to find that fine line. We're not particularly concerned based on what we see about the macro market. Although we're hearing everybody else's reports on it, we're not seeing it in the environment that we're operating in. We're seeing the strong household penetration growth across a variety of income groups.\n\nWe're seeing very good pull across a variety of classes of trade. So, we feel very good about that. Our concern is really based on capacity available this year and capacity next year. And if we get too far ahead of ourselves, our fill rates go down, and we start needing to pull forward more capacity additions.\n\nThe counter to all that and the antidote to that for us is if we continue to see very strong operating performance, meaning throughput on our existing lines. It'll give us a license to lean in a little bit more than what we're already doing. But we're really going to be focused on managing the growth to fit within that very tight band that we've outlined because that's where we operate best. And Todd can give you a little bit of view on the bottom line.\n\nTodd Cunfer -- Chief Financial Officer\n\nYeah. I mean, obviously, the big variable from an EBITDA perspective is the gross margin line. So, obviously, terrific Q1, a little bit over 45%. We've given guidance of at least 43%.\n\nSo, kind of what are the -- what are some of the issues that could bring that down for the rest of the year? So, first and foremost is, as we had in the opening remarks, we built much-needed inventory, particularly in rolls, in Q1. That helped us by about 100 basis points from a fixed cost leverage perspective. That will not repeat later in the year. And in fact, it will likely unwind.\n\nSo, that will put a little bit of a headwind on gross margin for the remainder of the year. We had a great quality quarter. As you know, that can move around. So, we're being a little cautious on, you know, can we continue to be at that less than 3% rate on quality.\n\nSo, we're a little more conservative there. We do have our annual wage increase in the plants coming in June, not a huge impact, but will put a little pressure on gross margins. And then there's the fourth line in Ennis we'll be starting up in the third quarter. We've done a much better job of bringing up lines, not as big of an impact on the P&L as in the previous years, but there will be, you know, an increase in fixed cost on the balance sheet at the end of Q3, going into Q4.\n\nSo, I feel great about the start. We do have some pressures. But, you know, if some things go our way, obviously, we can do a bit better.\n\nKen Goldman -- JPMorgan Chase and Company -- Analyst\n\nThank you for that. That's helpful. And then a quick follow-up. As we think about modeling this -- the upcoming quarter, 2Q, are there any particular factors we should consider, you know, either positive or negative? And I'm just thinking about areas like the timing of media spending, bridge placements, and I guess the timing of that inventory unwind you mentioned.\n\nYeah. You know, obviously, a sequential build in revenue, not a huge one, but we will have a sequential build in revenue in the Q2. A fairly strong media spend for the quarter. We're still working through a couple of things that could change a little bit.\n\nBut we'll have a fair amount of spend, as we always do, in the second quarter. I don't -- we may unwind some of the inventory in Q2. More of it might be in Q3. That is still a variable, but it will unwind, you know, later in the year.\n\nBut those are the big areas. And logistics, you know, continues to be favorable for us.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. The next question is coming from the line of Mark Astrachan with Stifel. Please proceed with your questions.\n\nMark Astrachan -- Stifel Financial Corp. -- Analyst\n\nOK. Thanks. Good morning, everyone. I guess maybe a big-picture question.\n\nIf you look at the expanded scanner data that we now get, Freshpet is driving, I don't know, 50% of the dog food category growth year to date, 60% since March. You know, it certainly seems like the category acceptances has increased among consumers. I guess, how do you think about that as it relates to discussions with retailers regarding expanding existing fridges, adding second and third fridges, going into some of those places where you're under-penetrated and retailers where you don't exist like Sam's? And maybe talk big picture about kind of how you're approaching that today versus where you were 12 or 18 months ago, particularly as you come out of that period of capacity constraints. Thanks.\n\nBilly Cyr -- Chief Executive Officer\n\nHey, Mark. So, look, I feel like this is the work we've been doing for a very, very long period of time. We're really confident we're offering a superior product, and I think it's increasingly recognized not only by consumers, but I think just generally the marketplace. We're seeing retailers kind of just really kind of reassess what's going on in the category and be more and more comfortable with adding more fridges deeper into their distribution.\n\nSo, I think what we'll start to see is we'll continue to see second and third fridges added over time.\n\nMark Astrachan -- Stifel Financial Corp. -- Analyst\n\nGot it. That's helpful. And then maybe another question just on capacity. So, you haven't formally updated kind of where we're going beyond this year.\n\nYou've talked obviously about the efficiency programs and existing facilities and those added to Ennis as it's ramping. You also talked about all these added lines. I guess, any way to frame just how much incremental capacity all of this stuff together collectively can be as we sit here today?\n\nBilly Cyr -- Chief Executive Officer\n\nYeah, Mark. It is a little bit of a complex work because there is, you know, capacity additions that come from our existing lines as we get the higher throughput, additional lines in the existing facilities, and then obviously the new technologies that we've talked about. I think what we would prefer to do is just have people think about us as tightly managing the capacity additions to be consistent with the net sales growth that we're projecting. We are -- we've gotten really good and really tight at projecting our volume and net sales out over extended periods of time and then building a capital spending plan and an operational improvement plan that is able to supply that.\n\nWe're really guided by getting to fill rates that are very high fill rates because what we've seen over time is if we have a high fill rate, that's a really good indicator that we have a lot of good performance on the operation side, whether it's the quality part, whether it's the freight cost, but getting a high fill rate becomes a very good marker for operational effectiveness or operational performance. So, I would look at the net sales line and say that we'll build capacity to adequately supply that over an extended period of time. And if there's variations in the growth rate, we'll find a way to match it. But we'd really like to manage the growth rate to live within our long-term guidance.\n\nOur next question is from the line of Peter Benedict with Baird. Please proceed with your questions.\n\nPeter Benedict -- Robert W. Baird and Company -- Analyst\n\nYeah. Good morning, guys. Thanks for taking the question. My first is just on there was a comment around kind of adding organizational capacity to support the growth.\n\nMaybe talk about your views on that, both short term and longer term, just as you think about kind of the cadence of growth of the business and what's going on just from an organizational capacity and where are you focused?\n\nBilly Cyr -- Chief Executive Officer\n\nYeah. I mean, obviously, we've added quite a bit of talent in the last 18 months. We added, you know, a head of manufacturing. We added a head of quality.\n\nWe added a general counsel. We added Rachel and her role in investor relations. And I think it's fair to say that if we're a company that's guided to $950 million in sales this year and will be, you know, $1.8 billion in 2027, there will be fairly sizable increases in the overall organizational capability, but we've filled in many of the most critical top roles. That doesn't mean we won't add any other top roles as we kind of expand the footprint of the company and develop higher level of sophistication in several of the areas.\n\nAnd it's something we're always doing. We're always looking for what's next. And just like we plan the capacity out over a longer period of time, we're now planning the organizational capability. If there's one learning that we've had over the last couple of years is that during the pandemic, we probably got a little bit behind on building organizational capability, and we're not going to let that happen again.\n\nPeter Benedict -- Robert W. Baird and Company -- Analyst\n\nNo, that makes sense. Thanks for that, Billy. And then just maybe, Todd, just as you think about, you know, the 18% target in 2027, you know, the gross margin number already kind of getting to that 45. As you think about upside to that, do you think that is more opportunity in gross margin if that were to potentially come through? I'm just trying to think about how -- or understand how you're thinking about some of the upside opportunities within the operating margin profile for the business longer term.\n\nYeah, sure. So, obviously, we're not going to -- we're not in the position right now to change our guidance, but, you know, where the upside could come from? Clearly, the biggest piece is gross margin. So, we're ahead of schedule. We think we have a lot of projects and a lot of room to grow over the next few years.\n\nSo, you know, we're going to shoot to try to beat the 45 at some point, but obviously, we're not changing that right now. The other piece, obviously, is logistics, which is below our definition of adjusted gross margin. You know, we're already 100 basis points below that long-term target that we called out in CAGNY last year. So, that's the other piece, but gross margin is the biggest component.\n\nOur next questions are from the line of Rupesh Parikh with Oppenheimer. Please proceed with your questions.\n\nRupesh Parikh -- Oppenheimer and Company -- Analyst\n\nGood morning and thanks for taking my question. So, just going back to the unmeasured channel, so, you know, greater than 100% growth in consumption this quarter. How do you guys feel about the sustainability there? And then just curious what you're seeing in the online channel.\n\nScott Morris -- Chief Operating Officer\n\nSo, Rupesh, how are you doing? So, look, we have so much opportunity to expand accessibility to this business and this brand, and it's not -- it's in all the unmeasured channel, especially through e-commerce. We talked about club. We talked about, you know, opportunities in mass. There is such tremendous opportunity and a long, long runway in front of us to continue to kind of expand accessibility and make sure that we -- wherever consumers want to buy our products, we're as accessible as we possibly can be.\n\nSo, we feel terrific about the runway there for the next several years. If you look at them, they're outpacing growth -- those unmeasured channels have been outpacing growth. We started talking about it over a year ago. We think we have several years where we have that opportunity, and then there's several other growth levers that we have behind that we'll continue to kind of press out and expand to.\n\nWe'll talk about those, I think, more into the future.\n\nRupesh Parikh -- Oppenheimer and Company -- Analyst\n\nGreat. And then maybe just one follow-up question. So, to the extent that we continue seeing EBITDA upside, are there opportunities to pull forward investments into this fiscal year?\n\nTodd Cunfer -- Chief Financial Officer\n\nYeah, we're -- I mean, we're always assessing that. There are some opportunities. It's probably not as much traditionally from a marketing perspective, but there are some project work from a gross margin improvement that we're looking at right now that, you know, not -- we're not saying -- we're not talking huge amounts here. But like I said earlier, there's a number of projects that -- and Scott is leading many of them, to try to improve gross margin over the next couple of years.\n\nAnd we'd like to spend a little bit money now and into '25 to try to fast forward as many of those as possible.\n\nScott Morris -- Chief Operating Officer\n\nWe've actively identified a whole bunch of work that's hoping to create more longer-term annuities and margin expansion over time. So, there's actually even two areas that we're working around.\n\nBilly Cyr -- Chief Executive Officer\n\nI would add to that that we're also thinking about that from an organizational capability perspective, too. If there's places where we see an opportunity where increased organizational capability can accelerate our margin improvement, we'll make that investment as well.\n\nScott Morris -- Chief Operating Officer\n\nIt really -- we feel incredibly fortunate as a company, an organization. And look, the work that team's done is extraordinary, like every single area of the organization is performing incredibly well. And what that leads us to is how do we think as far forward as we possibly can in every single area and kind of leverage the leadership position that we have and be as thoughtful about our business as possible.\n\nOur next question is from the line of Brian Holland with D.A. Davidson. Please proceed with your questions.\n\nBrian Holland -- D.A. Davidson -- Analyst\n\nYeah. Thanks. Good morning. Just if I triangulate the commentary about, you know, some of the throughput initiatives that we're working through and as we get increasingly flexible with how we think about the existing manufacturing base and adding lines, etc., are there any implications for that or ramifications that flow through to capex as we think about the next few years? And maybe with that, you know, I haven't heard any commentary about the -- a change in the free cash flow inflection timing.\n\nBut, you know, if the throughput initiatives are coming through, if we can add existing -- if we can add more capacity within the existing network, and we have this EBITDA margin upside, can we get free cash flow positive in fiscal '25?\n\nTodd Cunfer -- Chief Financial Officer\n\nThe -- look, everything that we're doing on that front is obviously starting to pay some huge dividends. And our -- you know, my goal and the organization's goal is to push out those capex investments to the right as far as possible, obviously still maintaining enough capacity to grow the business around the 25% rate. So, I think the organization is doing a really, really good job around that. Getting free cash flow positive in '25 would be challenging.\n\nI still feel great about '26. I would say, you know, obviously, the operating cash flow has improved dramatically in the last 12 to 18 months. We're sitting on a fair amount of cash right now. As every day goes by, I feel more and more secure that we will not have to go out and raise additional funds.\n\nWe may have to, you know, a little bit of a bridge term loan or something or revolver, but that cash flow position, that liquidity position continues to improve. So, everything that were going on from a throughput and yield is not only improving margins but increasing free cash flow. But we, you know, continue to feel great about the forecasts in that area that we put out.\n\nBrian Holland -- D.A. Davidson -- Analyst\n\nAppreciate the color, Todd. And then just kind of stepping back and, you know, appreciate the, you know, appropriately conservative management of your guidance, both, you know, near and longer term, but we talked about the inflection that we're seeing this morning and the earnings power of this model. But obviously, this is a culmination of, you know, at least the past five quarters kind of building to this. So, when you talk about sort of wanting to be careful here and, you know, watching kind of quarter by quarter, what particularly keeps you up at night right now with respect to like kind of what you see in Q1 and some sort of anxiety about, hey, we're not sure whether we can sustain this because, clearly, we have, you know, some points on the board now of sustained progress to this point.\n\nSo, I just want to make sure I understand what you were particularly focused on that would create some variability in the model as we look over the next 12 months and certainly beyond.\n\nBilly Cyr -- Chief Executive Officer\n\nYeah. I mean, Brian, I think you have to start with the fact that the -- especially on the gross margin and the EBITDA margin, it was a very significant step-up from the trajectory that we had built, as you pointed out, over the last five quarters. And so, what we want to be is appropriately conservative to say that maybe not all of that will stick in the subsequent three quarters of this year. We hope it does, and we're trying to plan to make that happen.\n\nBut the reality is it was a very big step up, and we just don't want to plan on everything happening right every quarter until we've demonstrated that over a much longer period of time. This is a new business. This is a completely new technology. Nobody else does what we do.\n\nAnd so, there's more variability in it than you would normally see in a much more well-established business. But we're getting better and better at it. We're managing it better and better. The top-line part of this is the part that, as you know, has been much, much more stable over a long period of time.\n\nWe're able to predict that really well. In this case, the top line is being driven by our ability to supply it reliably. Let me go back to the comment I made earlier. We believe having a very good fill rate is a very strong indicator of operational performance, and we do not want to get ourselves in a position where we don't have a strong -- a high fill rate because that will indicate that we're having some other issues.\n\nSo, we're going to plan the growth to live within the capacity and deliver that strong fill rate.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question is from the line of Bill Chappell with Truist. Please proceed with your questions.\n\nJust had a first kind of question or maybe a little more color on the roll capacity issues that you might run into later this year. Maybe any sense of just -- I'm just trying to understand, as this early in the year, it seems -- and roll production is fairly straightforward. I'm just trying to understand, you know, one, have you seen a surge in kind of rolls versus bags in -- as new customers have come in? Kind of what's the difference there? And then, two, you know, do you see there being some other issue? I'm just trying to understand why roll capacity would be tough to do that or if you're just trying to be conservative, let's move to the back half of the year just in case.\n\nBilly Cyr -- Chief Executive Officer\n\nBill, I think as we've said since the beginning, we knew that, you know, this is a little bit of a game of leapfrog. You know, you bring up a line, it gives you a big surge in the capacity for that particular product form and you do fine, and then you have to think about bringing up the next line, which might be on bags. In this case, the one we're bringing up now is rolls. But after that, they'll be bag lines.\n\nAnd we have them, you know, spaced out just right or we believe it's just about right, but you're dependent upon bringing that line up at the rate you want on the timing that you want. And that means construction has to be complete. You have to do all the line commissioning qualification, then you have to go through a ramp-up curve on the line. And we are at the point now where our growth has been very robust on both rolls and bags, so we're dependent upon the next roll line coming online, and we just don't want to get ahead of ourselves.\n\nThere's always some variability in the start-up of a line and we just don't want to get too far ahead of ourselves. The growth has been good on rolls, and we are at the point now where the operational improvements we've made in Bethlehem are helping us build inventory on rolls so that as the net -- as the consumption of rolls continues to grow in Q2 and Q3, we can supply it from the existing facilities and existing lines, but we need that line to come on in Ennis, otherwise we will get in a position where we'll start short shipping our rolls or, at a minimum, drawing down our inventories and our fill rates will drop. So, it's what it was planned. It's built in the plan all along.\n\nAnd I would say, like you mentioned -- you know, I think in the beginning of your question, you mentioned an issue, there is no issue. We just want to make sure we stay within a band that we are comfortable with. And as Billy said, we're running actually slightly ahead from a standpoint of bringing capacity online.\n\nBill Chappell -- Truist Securities -- Analyst\n\nGot it. OK. I'll follow up later on that. And second, just on the second cooler initiative, I mean, certainly, I understand and you've got more than enough metrics showing how as you add a second cooler, you drive velocity.\n\nBut, you know, at some point, do you need more SKUs, do you need more forms or different products to fill those coolers to really keep the velocity going, or are you fine with kind of the core four or five SKUs that you have in both coolers just to drive forward?\n\nScott Morris -- Chief Operating Officer\n\nActually, Bill, that is actually a really good question and something we have been doing a ton of workaround. And you're going to see over the next 12 to 18 months, you'll kind of see us basically looking through the portfolio and actually bringing down -- we've actually been on a downward path on bringing down complexity and the number of SKUs we have across the portfolio. OK? So, you'll see simplification, and you'll see products that are more suited to our kind of future state manufacturing. And when I say future state, it's like within the next 12 months.\n\nIt will be literally optimized portfolio to make sure it works incredibly well within our overall manufacturing network while balancing out the demand that we need from a consumer standpoint. So, we're really trying to optimize the entire portfolio to maximize on consumer demand and maximize on profitability. And that -- there's a huge piece of work that we're -- I was talking a little bit earlier about leaning forward and thinking forward on what we need to do with the company. That's exactly the work that we're embarking upon.\n\nNow, all that being said, I will say we are having incredible success as we're going into second coolers. And one of the things we're doing in second coolers is we are spreading out on some core SKUs to make sure that we have holding capacity through the weekend because the reality is in storage with high velocity, we are still seeing some out of stocks, and there's definitely potential for us to, you know, build out on some of the core SKUs. We are seeing core SKUs, basic -- SKUs that have been around for 15 years, continue to grow at kind of mid-teens rates. That's like really good stuff.\n\nOn the other piece of it, we are definitely seeing kind of the more specialized parts of the portfolio, some of the little more feature-oriented, benefit-oriented, and actually most humanized and most expensive products, we have leading growth rates. So, we're kind of seeing it across. And while we don't need many more, we need to optimize what we have. And again, that'll go to the work that we're embarking upon.\n\nOur next question is from the line of Bryan Spillane with Bank of America. Please proceed with your questions.\n\nBryan Spillane -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst\n\nHey. Thanks, operator. Good morning, everyone. I just had a follow-up on the questions around free cash flow and cash.\n\nSo, maybe, Todd, you know, you were -- you know, cash from operations is positive this quarter, and, you know, it looks like a lot of it is just the profitability. But can you talk a little bit about the path to free cash flow, how much of it will be just, you know, the increase in profits versus, you know, sourcing from working capital or I guess overtime capex? But just trying to get an understanding of other things we should watch, you know, in terms of monitoring free cash flow other than capex and profits.\n\nTodd Cunfer -- Chief Financial Officer\n\nYeah. So, look, we're trying to manage -- we're still growing, obviously, at an extraordinary rate, and so we will have to continue to spend, you know, a fairly heavy amount of capex to build out capacity over the next few years. We're trying to manage that in the kind of the 200 to 225 zone. We've done a nice job of doing that.\n\nAnd, you know, we're off to a good start this year, so I feel very comfortable that we can manage within that range. Most -- almost all of where we're going to get to positive free cash flow, to your question, will come from profitability. So, as though -- as the business expands, as the margins expand, the amount of EBITDA that we're going to throw off is obviously going to, you know, increase fairly substantially over the next couple of years if we're able to execute our plan. So, nothing dramatic in working capital.\n\nWe'll obviously try to manage that as closely as we can. But it really is just the profitability and the scale and the growth of this business that will drive all the -- the vast majority of the operating cash flow.\n\nBryan Spillane -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst\n\nAll right. Cool. That's super simple. I can follow that.\n\nAnd then the second question, just around the convert, can you remind us just at -- you know, given the share price, just the mechanics -- I think we're bumping up close in terms of it being convertible. But just could you just remind us all of just the mechanics and what should we be watching for in terms of the share price?\n\nTodd Cunfer -- Chief Financial Officer\n\nYeah. I mean, look, we -- it's obviously a five-year convert. We cannot force that conversion on our end for the -- until Year 3. So, we're -- you know, nothing to do from our side.\n\nWe're at a point where someone actually could force -- they could convert -- the bondholders could force us to convert, but because of the optionality value of it, no one has any rationale to do it. They could trade out the bond and take a profit, but they're -- they would leave money on the table if they would force a convert. So, that's highly, highly unlikely. There will be no dilution from a GAAP perspective until we get net income well over $100 million.\n\nAnd then just don't forget, we have -- from an economic perspective, we have the cap call at -- you know, that we put on that protects us economically to about -- to $120 a share. After that, it will become somewhat dilutive economically. But, you know, obviously, we're thrilled that we're getting -- looks like we might be at the 120 today if the price stays where it is. But we're sitting tight from our perspective for two more years until we kind of decide at that point whether we want to force the conversion or not.\n\nBryan Spillane -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst\n\nAll right. Thanks, Todd. And just maybe if I could sneak one last one in, just, you know, are we -- do we have a comfortable level of cash on the balance sheet, you know, just given how fast the business is growing, capex needs, just kind of your feeling of comfort level with the cash you have on the balance sheet now?\n\nTodd Cunfer -- Chief Financial Officer\n\nYeah, I feel really good. Obviously, we got plenty of cash for this year. I think there's a very good chance -- you know, we have a good chance of having enough cash for next year. And then obviously, we think we're going to be free cash flow positive in '26.\n\nAnd look, based on the amount of EBITDA we're driving right now, if we do need a small amount of capital in '25 or '26, clearly we have enough profitability to borrow that pretty effectively.\n\nThank you. Our next question is from the line of Robert Moskow with TD Cowen. Please proceed with your question.\n\nRob Moskow -- TD Cowen -- Analyst\n\nHey. Thanks for the question. I think I've asked this question in a different way last quarter, but I'm going to try it -- try to do it this way this time. Do you have any data on what progress you're making on shifting your mix to main meal versus toppers? You said 48%.\n\nDoes that demonstrate any progress? And then if you fast forward like a few years from now, you know, what does success look like? Does it have to be significantly higher to hit 2027 goals or to what extent does it matter? Thanks.\n\nScott Morris -- Chief Operating Officer\n\nSo, hey, Rob. So, let me start with the way -- here's what we're seeing in the business, right? So, from a penetration standpoint, we are -- we're very consistent on the penetration growth that we're consistently seeing, and the people that we're building the most with, they're outpacing -- or basically those super heavy heavy or the people that we refer to as the HIPPOHs, right? So, that means that those -- that naturally basically pushing buy rate. That group is really the one who pushes the buy rate forward. So, the way we have basically planned the majority of this is it's going to be a penetration focus, but we want to make sure that the focus -- that within that penetration piece, we're getting a lot of those super heavy and heavy households.\n\nThey're coming in and pushing the buy rate forward. We definitely have some expansion in buy rate. We're consistently seeing that. And then we have so many data points now that are starting to show where people are not just buying ones, they're buying twos, and now they're starting to buy six packs, like we're looking at like where people are buying bulk packs of our products.\n\nAnd I think that clearly speaks to this ideology of this is not a topper. This is something that is a main meal for my dog. This is a replacement. So, you got the super heavy heavy stats.\n\nYou got everything that we're doing around selling multipacks, and you're going to see more and more of these multipacks come out there. And we feel like that answers -- like that demonstrates the consumers, and it really answers, you know, any questions that we have around how this is not a topper, it is a main meal.\n\nRob Moskow -- TD Cowen -- Analyst\n\nOK, but, Scott, that explains the marketing, but like I guess my question is, quantifiably, does it -- does that number have to go higher to hit your 2027 goals or could you get there without it going higher?\n\nBilly Cyr -- Chief Executive Officer\n\nRob, we look at this pretty closely because ultimately if you're going to drive 25% growth, in a simplistic form, portion of it is going to come from penetration, a portion of it is going to come from buy rate. And the way we think the model works is low 20% growth on the penetration, that gets us to our 20 million households, and you have to have, call it, low to mid-single digits growth in the buy rate in order for that to work. So, the sum of those two should be 25%, 26% kind of number. And the mix is not particularly important.\n\nObviously, you want to have some of both, but we want it really to be led by household penetration being in the low to mid-20s. That's the range that we're looking for. So, in -- you know, the direct answer to your question is you do need to see buying rate continue to grow, but it needs to grow at a low to mid-single digits.\n\nOur next question is from the line of Michael Lavery with Piper Sandler. Please proceed with your question.\n\nMichael Lavery -- Piper Sandler -- Analyst\n\nThank you. Good morning. I just wanted to come back to some of the new technologies you've touched on, and I understand that they're in process and you probably don't want to be too specific, but can you just help us understand, is it more -- would it be retrofitting equipment or replacing it or is it like a software upgrade that can increase speeds or maybe just some way to have it in our heads the right way? And then a little bit of a sense of the magnitude of cost and is that already contemplated in things like potentially -- I don't know if the timing could be as soon as this year, but would it be in this year's capex? How do we think about just where it fits from a magnitude and timing of cost piece of that as well?\n\nScott Morris -- Chief Operating Officer\n\nSo, Michael, I'll handle the first part and either Todd and/or Billy can touch on the second part from a capital standpoint. So, the very first thing that we're doing and the single biggest focus is to optimize the current manufacturing footprint that we have and the lines that we have. And there is a lot of opportunity there. And we're -- within the results that we're showing in this quarter and that we have planned over the next 12 to 18 months, you'll continue to see really nice progress in that area.\n\nSecondarily, there are small retrofits to existing lines that we have, and we've done a lot -- enough work on where we know that they can be increased productivity and throughput levels on those lines. And then third, there is a next generation of technology that we've touched on. We are 100% confident it is going to work. It's just a question of when.\n\nAnd we -- and I'll turn it over to Todd from a capital standpoint, but we -- we're basically going to work this out over the next kind of periods of time here in the not distant future, where we'll look at what's happening on the throughput we're getting and then the new technologies, and we will layer these things in at the appropriate levels. But we have budgeted this very, very conservatively, too.\n\nTodd Cunfer -- Chief Financial Officer\n\nSo, from a capex perspective, this new technology, as you know, will be the seventh line that we have on the Bethlehem campus. We believe it'll be ready to start producing products sometime in the first half of 2025. It absolutely -- we're spending money on it now. It's absolutely part of the $210 million capital guidance we've given the year.\n\nYou know, a big chunk of the spend on this new technology will be this year. There will be some in next year as well, but a good chunk of it is this year. As we look forward and if it proves to be successful, we will use this technology on new lines in places like Ennis as we build out bag capacity. And then potentially, depending on how big of a margin improvement we have with this new technology, we will look at potentially retrofitting existing lines as well, but that's kind of the TBD.\n\nBilly Cyr -- Chief Executive Officer\n\nYeah. I just want to amplify that we view manufacturing as a core competency for us and a significant competitive advantage. And so, both Scott and Todd referenced a, you know, significant investment in the new technology. But as Scott indicated, there are other pieces, too, that are less significant than this seventh line in Bethlehem that we are implementing as we go along.\n\nThe ultimate goal of all of this, though, is to end up in a situation where we're delivering a significant improvement in the return on invested capital for our shareholders and we're also delivering improvements in the quality that the consumer gets. And we think if we do those things well, it will be very, very difficult for somebody to match our execution and our capability.\n\nMichael Lavery -- Piper Sandler -- Analyst\n\nOK. That's great color. And just a quick follow-up on the commodity color. You had, I think, about almost a 400-basis-point benefit there.\n\nAnything in particular driving that? And I think the chicken processing plant in Ennis, not only is going to get more favorable as volumes build, but I think has pricing that's a little bit more stable. So, it -- would it be right to think chicken isn't a big swing factor there or is that favorable as well?\n\nTodd Cunfer -- Chief Financial Officer\n\nYeah. So, obviously, as we talked about on the call back in February, we do have some deflation. We're about 75% covered now. So, you know, obviously, we got risk and opportunity for about a quarter of our input costs at this point.\n\nBut, you know, we feel very good about where we are from an input cost perspective. You mentioned chicken processing. It's going really, really well. I mean, it was a headwind last year as we were -- as we brought it up as there just was not enough volume going through that facility, by design, as Ennis grows in volume over time.\n\nBut with Ennis being, you know, close to 25% of our capacity this year, it's starting to -- the economics of that are improving greatly this year, and they will continue to improve over the next couple of years. We obviously -- yield, you know, Billy, in his comments, has mentioned what a fantastic start to the year we've had in yield. All the OEE projects we have, particularly in Bethlehem, and also in Ennis, have been tremendous. Our Kitchens South facility is operating really, really well right now.\n\nWe're -- we could not be more pleased with what's going on there. And then we obviously had some -- a little bit of pricing in Q1 that has benefited that. That's the last piece of that that does not persist for the remainder of the year. But those are the components of it.\n\nThank you. Our final question for today comes from the line of Jon Andersen with William Blair. Please proceed with your questions.\n\nJon Andersen -- William Blair and Company -- Analyst\n\nHey. Good morning. Thanks for the question. Mine is on -- I have a two-parter on media.\n\nI think you mentioned in the prepared remarks that media was about 14% of sales in the quarter. Can you remind us what your kind of plan for the year is and talk a little bit about the cadence there? And then I think I also heard -- maybe Billy mentioned that the customer acquisition costs have improved of late. Could you discuss a little bit how volatile that CAC figure is -- has been in the past and perhaps why you think you're seeing, you know, current improvement? Thanks.\n\nTodd Cunfer -- Chief Financial Officer\n\nYeah, I'll start off, and I'll let Scott talk about the CAC. Yes, about 14% of net sales this year, grew about 23%, 24% year over year. That percent of net is down year over year. So, we are starting to get a little bit of, you know, leverage in the P&L from media.\n\nOur expectation is it will grow relatively with sales for the full year. So, you know, last year, it was around 11%. We think it will be approximately 11% or slightly less this year. As we've talked about, if volume is too strong, we will potentially look at pulling back a little bit of media spend to cool things off a bit, and we continue to monitor that very, very closely.\n\nFrom a cadence perspective, we will spend fairly heavily in Q2, but from first half-second half, it'll be a little bit more balanced than we've normally have. So, more in the first half, but less as a percentage as -- than we've historically had. I'll let Scott talk about the CAC.\n\nScott Morris -- Chief Operating Officer\n\nYeah. I'll start by saying when we planned this out over many years, we did not anticipate that we would be able to keep CAC as stable as it has been. It's been really -- it's been pretty amazing to be able to -- like years and years in to have a similar CAC level. Typically, the deeper you get into your TAM, your total addressable market, typically the higher your CACs go up.\n\nNow, it's -- now, to even start talking about CAC from a packaged goods organization is a little bit unusual. But we do think about it that way and track it that way. So, we're getting further and further into our theoretical TAM, which we watch and continues to expand a little bit every year also. We see our CAC being incredibly stable.\n\nThe only time we really saw volatility in our CAC -- it's been very rangebound. The only time we really push toward the top, top of the range and stayed there for a bit was during like kind of the unwinding of COVID and along with the really significant price increases that we put through. It took a while for that to settle, consumers to get comfortable, and then for the CAC to return kind of into those normal levels. Now, one piece on that that I think is helpful, when we look at not only the communication and the advertising, the performance is extraordinary on the creative.\n\nBut the other piece is on the media planning piece, there's incredible work that goes into that, and we continue to press into some new areas. And some people -- I have people come and go, oh, I saw one of your ads for the first time. You were on golf. Or you were on, you know, some type of sports.\n\nWe continue to kind of press into these new areas, and we're actually seeing, in some of them, better performance than we have in existing areas, which leads us to believe that as we continue to expand into these new media channels and using some of these new techniques and even technologies, that we have a really nice runway ahead of us to continue to keep CAC within that range.\n\nBilly Cyr -- Chief Executive Officer\n\nAnd let me just add to that, Jon, is one of the things that we've seen is as we have grown the visibility of our retail presence, meaning second fridges, larger fridges, end cap fridges, and whatnot, it does help with the efficiency of the media, meaning advertising that you're spending against a business that has a very high level of retail visibility is much more efficient than if we were spending the media against, you know, small fridges in the middle of the aisle. And so, the significant improvement in second and third fridges and end caps and fridge islands in some retailers is helping maintain that CAC at a very, very effective or efficient level.\n\nThank you.

This conference call will be available on our website at axt.com through May 2, 2025. Also before we begin, I want to note that shortly following the close of market today, we issued a press release reporting financial results for the first quarter of 2024. This information is available on the Investor Relations portion of our website at axt.com. I would now like to turn the call over to Gary Fischer for a review of our first quarter 2024 results. Gary?\n\nGary Fischer: Thank you, Leslie, and good afternoon to everyone. Revenue for the first quarter of 2024 was $22.7 million. That's up from $20.4 million in the fourth quarter of 2023 and up from $19.4 million in the first quarter of 2023. To break down our Q1 204 revenue for you by product category, Indium phosphide increased sequentially to $8.1 million. That's reflecting strong growth from data center applications, including AI and continued improvement in passive optical networks, Gallium our side also grew to $7.5 million with broad-based improvement across a number of applications. Germanium substrates were $1.4 million, up from the prior quarter with renewed strength in demand for satellite solar cells. Finally, as expected, revenue from our consolidated raw material joint venture companies in Q1 was $5.8 million, down from Q4 as we consumed a greater portion of their output for our growing substrate demand.\n\nIn the first quarter of 2024, revenue from Asia Pacific was 79%, Europe was 16%, and North America was 5%. The top 5 customers generated approximately 33% of total revenue and 1 customer was over the 10% level. Non-GAAP gross margin in the first quarter was 27.3% compared with 23.2% in Q4 and 26.9% in Q1 of 2023. For those who prefer to track results on a GAAP basis, gross margin in the first quarter was 26.9% compared with 22.6% in Q4 and 26.3% in Q1. Beyond the near-term, we remain confident that we can get back to the mid-30% range as the environment strengthens through higher overall volume, favorable product mix and the benefits of our recycling programs, along with continued efficiency improvements throughout our business. Moving to operating expense.\n\nTotal non-GAAP operating expense in Q1 was $8.7 million compared with $7.5 million in Q4 of 2023 and $8.7 million in Q1 of 2023. On a GAAP basis, total operating expense in Q1 was $9.4 million compared with $8.2 million in Q4 and down from $9.5 million in Q1 of 2023. As you've seen from our quarterly run rate in 2023, we had put in a number of constraints in place for OpEx to align with market conditions as things are beginning to trend up, we're loosening up some of these constraints, which has brought OpEx up from the previous run rates. We do expect to hold it at approximately this level throughout the rest of this year. Our non-GAAP operating loss for the first quarter of 2024 was $2.5 million compared with a non-GAAP operating loss in Q4 2023 of $2.7 million and a non-GAAP operating loss of $3.5 million in Q1 of 2023.\n\nFor reference, our GAAP operating line for the first quarter of 2024 was a loss of $3.3 million compared with an operating loss of $3.6 million in Q4 and an operating loss of $4.4 million in Q1. Nonoperating other income and expense and other items below the operating line for the first quarter in 2024 was a net gain of $1.3 million. The details can be seen in the P&L included in our press release today. For Q1 2024, we had a non-GAAP net loss of $1.3 million or $0.03 per share compared with non-GAAP net loss of $2.8 million or $0.07 per share in the fourth quarter and non-GAAP net loss in Q1 of 2022 was $2.4 million or $0.06 per share. On a GAAP basis, net loss in Q1 was $2.1 million or $0.05 per share. By comparison, net loss was $3.6 million or $0.09 per share in the fourth quarter and GAAP net loss in Q1 of 2023 was $3.3 million or $0.08 per share.\n\nThe weighted average basic shares outstanding in Q1 of 2024 was 43.0 million shares. Cash and cash equivalents and investments were $41.3 million as of March 31. By comparison at December 31, it was 52.3%. Cash is down for 2 main reasons. First, our revenue billings tended to be back-end loaded in the first quarter as most of China shuts down for Chinese New Year. As a result, Q1 and Q1 accounts receivable increased by $6.1 million. This is simply a timing issue as most of that cash can be collected in Q2. The second reason for the decline in cash in Q1 was CapEx spending of $5.7 million. This is not new commitments to facilities. This was work done in 2023 and for which payment was due in Q1. As we look to the balance of the year, we expect CapEx to be in the $2 million to $3 million range quarter per quarter, most of which goes towards facilities work, which was done in 2023.\n\nOne more note on cash. From time-to-time, we have had outside parties approach us with an interest to invest in our supply chain companies. Currently, interest in China is growing, perhaps related to the change in the economic circumstances in China. We believe that there is real value in these assets to be unlocked and may consider monetizing a portion of them this year. As a reminder, we now have over 10 companies in our supply chain where we have partial ownership shared with industry partners. Depreciation and amortization in the first quarter was $2.2 million. Total stock comp was $800,000. Net inventory was down $600,000 in the first quarter. This includes inventory added through our recycling program. 33% of the inventory is raw materials and WIP was 63%, finished goods makes up approximately 4%.\n\nThe increase in WIP is primarily the result of increased crystal growth in anticipation of higher demand in Q2. With improving demand, we hope to bring our total inventory down by approximately $10 million over the year. Okay. This concludes our discussion of our quarterly financial results. Turning to our plan to list our subsidiary, Tong May in China on the Star market in Shanghai. We now believe that we have had some significant developments on the issue that the CSRC previously raised, and we believe the likely next step is that the CSRC can resume consideration of our application. As we've said, this is a lengthy process, but we continue to believe that Tongmei is an excellent candidate for listing. With that, I'll now turn the call over to Dr. Morris Young for a review of our business and markets.\n\nMorris Young: Thank you, Gary. We believe our business is on a firm path to recovery, as evidenced by the continued growth in our business and solid execution, which allowed us to exceed our Q1 revenue and profitability pace. In the first quarter, we achieved 11% sequential growth in our revenues and 29% sequential improvement in our non-GAAP net income. While certain parts of the demand environment remains somewhat soft, all three of our substrate product line showed improvement, including a 48% growth in time phosphide revenue from Q4. Looking individually at these product lines. Indium phosphide once again became our biggest selling material in Q1. Sales was driven by continued recovery in the power market and a meaningful increase in demand related to AI.\n\nWe review AI as an exciting catalyst for Indium phosphide in the years to come. As AI requires high-speed lasers and detectors for rapid data transfer with increased bandwidth, low attenuation and low distortion. Today, AI applications are primarily oxide pixels, which require a relatively small amount of substrate material. But as the industry moves to 800 gig and then 1.6 terabyte speed, we expect that there will be a necessary transition to indium phosphide. We are already seeing development work happening today with next-generation silicon photonics devices and electro-absorption modulated laser or EML for high-speed data center transceivers. Revenue from these applications contributed to our strong indium phosphide growth in Q1 and will help drive our expected growth in 2024.\n\nOur gallium phosphide revenue grew 24% sequentially in Q1, reflecting increased demand across a broad base of applications, including power amplifiers, HPT applications for wireless our switches, high-power lasers and LEDs. We believe much of the excess inventory in the supply chain has been decided, and we are benefiting from a desire among our customers to diversify their supply base as the market recovers. For example, today, our share of the HPT market is relatively small, but we believe we have a great opportunity to increase our market share over time and are pleased with early customer traction. In addition, our 8-inch gallium site development efforts have led to a groundbreaking advancements in both of our defect densities and yields.\n\nWe believe this innovation can be applied to our 6-inch gallium state products, allowing us to further enhance our competitiveness across all of our market research. In germanium substrate, demand for satellite solar cells were down substantially throughout 2023, is now beginning to recover. Sales increased 25% in Q1 over the prior quarter with renewed strength in Europe and Asia. And finally, coming off three quarters of strong sales in our raw material business as well as contribution from our recycling efforts sales from our raw material business declined as we expected in Q1. This decline was primarily the result of our consuming a greater portion of the output from our consolidated joint venture as our substrate business has strengthened.\n\nIn total, our portfolio joint venture companies continues to be a strategic value to our business, providing money of the critical material we use to make our products and allowing us to benefit from the cost and efficiency advantages. Now in closing, we are optimistic about the coming year and the growth and expansion of our business. We are seeing tangible signs of recovery across all of our product lines with new catalysts such as AI, providing strong incremental opportunity. We've worked hard over the last two years to pave the way for an exciting future by providing world-class products for a highly dynamic technology landscape, elevating our own business practices to meet the requirements of Tier 1 customers, delivering breakthrough innovations in the development of large diameter gallium arsenide and indium phosphide substrates and executing on a recycling program that both advances our ESG commitments and improves our cost structure.\n\nWe remain status focused on business efficiency and accelerating our return to profitability. With that, I will turn the call back to Gary for our second quarter guidance. Gary?\n\nGary Fischer: Thank you, Morris. In keeping with our comments today, we expect Q2 revenue to be between $25.5 million and $27.5 million. We expect our non-GAAP net loss will be in the range of $0.03 to $0.05, and GAAP net loss will be in the range of $0.05 to $0.07. Share count will be approximately 43.0 million shares. Okay. Well, this concludes our prepared comments. Morris and I will be glad to answer your questions now. John, can you take it back?\n\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from the line of Charles Shi from Needham.

For the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024, we delivered net revenue of 682 million, an increase of 7% compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023. This is on top of delivering outstanding revenue growth of 44% in the fourth quarter last year. Also on top of 66% growth in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022. All financial metrics discussed today are inclusive of the 53rd week in fiscal 2024, except for comparable sales. Comparable sales declined 3% for the quarter as we cycled a remarkable 32% increase in Q4 last year. In the U.S., our net revenue increased 9% for the quarter, while sales grew 4% in Canada in our retail channel, net revenue increased in the fourth quarter by 15%. This was driven by the progress we've made on our real estate expansion strategy. During the quarter, we opened three new boutiques, Indianapolis, Indiana, Corte Madera, California, and Roseville, California. We also opened a newly repositioned location in Skokie, Illinois thus far in Q1, we've completed the repositioning of our Oak Grove, Illinois boutique. We also opened a Reigning Champ pop-up at Yorkdale in Toronto. Finally, we plan to open a new boutique in Boca return later this month. Our fourth boutique in the state of Florida. This is significant because boutique openings have been our most consistent, predictable driver of top line growth the performance of our new boutiques remains strong beyond our expectation, a cohort of six new boutique openings in fiscal 2024 is tracking to payback in under 12 months. This beats our own projection of 12 to 18 months, but it's not just the new boutiques that are performing very well and driving our top line growth. Our boutique repositions are delivering as well, reposition elevate the customer experience and drive increased revenue and profitability from fiscal 2022 to 2024, we completed six three positions in the US. Collectively, we more than doubled the square footage of these boutiques and drove an even higher increase in sales. This resulted in a mid single digit lift and sales per square foot. Turning to e-commerce net revenue decreased by 3% in the fourth quarter. This was driven by a lower volume of markdown sales compared to the fourth quarter last year. The tremendous opportunity we see in e-commerce is far greater than our recent performance, but we also recognize we're coming off three years of unprecedented growth, delivering a four year e-commerce net revenue behavior of 34%. We're confident that as we continue to optimize the composition of our product spreads will reaccelerate, in addition to optimizing our product for focusing on three areas to further support growth in e-commerce. One, we're investing in digital performance marketing. This will help amplify our product franchises, grow brand awareness in the U.S. and drive customer engagement. Two, we're making good progress on upgrading the technology that underpins our e-commerce platform. We have bold creative plans for delivering an outstanding customer experience on a riskier.com. This latest technology will allow us to reach these goals. And three, we're optimizing our omni capabilities. As a reminder, in Q three, in Canada, we completed the rollout of buy online ship from store and continued piloting Buy Online Pickup in Store in Q4, we launched omnichannel capabilities in the US. Early results are encouraging, and we look forward to ramping up Buy Online Pickup in Store to more than 100 boutiques this quarter. Omnichannel services optimize their inventory and lower our distribution costs. In addition, we believe omnichannel will ultimately drive incremental low to mid-single digit e-commerce sales growth. Turning now to product. One of our primary goals continues to be improving the composition of our product, both online and in our boutiques. And that's exactly what we're doing. We have achieved a much better balance of newness and client favorites, and our competition has continued to improve in Q1. Furthermore, our new styles have been well received, which is a positive indicator for future seasons. We're pleased with the progress we made on our inventory position. We successfully cleared through our fall winter inventory ending Q4 with inventory down 27% compared to last year. In March, we launched gold and gold and have an expansion of the athletic assortment we offered under our TENA brand and allows us to address even more of our clients active wear needs. Golden is designed for the athletes who can who loved all things refined. It features like seriously crafted Essentials made with high-performing fabrics and next level detail. This represents billions for something we call the aesthetics of athletic in marketing, our springs wet food campaign featured international supermodel and ongoing brand fan arena, Shake establishing cultural relevance and fashion credibility alongside the campaign, more than 100 aspirational influencers highlighted the styling versatility of sweat, please, by showing their audience how they were hashtags spotted and swiftly. We also continued growing our community of celebrity fans, including blade widely in bad times at the Super Bowl and Maeghan Markel (NYSE:MKL) in the Super Puff. In addition to propelling brand awareness and driving client engagement, we also see a tremendous opportunity in marketing to amplify our product franchises over the last 40 years for Raytheon (NYSE:RTN) has become the creator and purveyor of everyday luxury. Our clients know and love the Aritzia brand, which has inspired us to offer more versatile than direct DNA. This enabled us to focus and augment the brand, and we continue to increase awareness, particularly in the US. Of course, our multi-brand strategy is one of our key competitive advantages. So we will continue to create design and evolve our collection of exclusive brands that cater to the lifestyles of our clients. During the quarter, we continued to optimize our distribution network and the ramp-up of our new Ontario distribution center has gone extremely well. Productivity KPIs continue to beat our expectations. Pick-and-pack metrics have increased by more than 70% compared to the prior third party facility. Ecommerce specifically has increased by more than 90% per unit. Labor costs are down meaningfully, and we have now exited all of our temporary off-site facilities, resulting in a significant reduction in our inventory management costs. Now I'll turn the call over to Todd.\n\nTodd Ingledew: Thanks, Jennifer. And good afternoon, everyone. Before I begin note that all financial metrics discussed today are inclusive of the 53rd week except for comparable sales. I'll now take you through the results net revenue for the fourth quarter was in line with our outlook. And as expected, we delivered further margin improvement and continued to optimize our inventory and completed and progressed multiple infrastructure projects to support our future growth. In the fourth quarter, we generated net revenue of $682 million, representing an increase of 7% from last year. This increases on top of two years of extraordinary growth in the fourth quarter, 44% in fiscal 2023 and 66% in fiscal 2022, resulting in a three year CAGR of 37%. As expected, we saw an approximate $32 million benefit from the 53rd week following a remarkable increase of 32% last year. Our comparable sales for the quarter declined 3% due to our improved inventory position. Our composite comparable sales performance was impacted by a lower volume of markdown sales in the fourth quarter compared to last year. Net revenue in the United States increased 9% to $369 million on top of an increase in the fourth quarter last year of 56% and 109% in fiscal 2022. In Canada, net revenue increased 4% to $313 million on top of an increase of 32% in fiscal 2023 and 39% in fiscal 2022. Comparable sales results were similar across geographies as we saw consistent shopping behavior on both sides of the border. Net revenue in our retail channel was 416 million, an increase of 15% from the fourth quarter last year. And this was driven by the performance of our new and repositioned boutiques, which continue to generate better than expected payback periods. Comparable sales growth in our boutiques was positive in e-commerce. Net revenue for the quarter was 266 million, a decrease of 3% from last year. E-commerce was impacted more heavily by the lower volume of markdown sales. We delivered gross profit of $261 million, an increase of 8% compared to the fourth quarter last year. As expected, gross profit margin inflected positively increasing 30 basis points to 38.3% from 38% last year. The increase was primarily driven by select pricing adjustments and lower warehousing and distribution costs, partially offset by inflation in product costs and pre-opening lease amortization for flagship boutiques. SG&A expenses for the quarter were $197 million, up 15% from last year. SG&A as a percent of net revenue was slightly better than our expectations, up 200 basis points to 28.9% compared to 26.9% last year. This was driven by investments in talent made through the end of fiscal 2023, as well as digital marketing initiatives, protect and propel our brand and technology to enhance our e-commerce platform. Adjusted EBITDA in the fourth quarter was $73 million, a decrease of 9% from last year. Adjusted EBITDA was 10.6% of net revenue compared to 12.4% last year, representing further sequential improvement as the end of the fourth quarter. Inventory was 340 million, down 27% from the end of the fourth quarter last year. We are pleased with our improved inventory position and continue to optimize the composition. During the fourth quarter, we generated $23 million in free cash flow and ended the quarter with 163 million in cash and zero drawn on our $300 million revolving credit facility. We remain focused on maintaining a strong balance sheet and expect to see meaningful free cash flow generation starting in the back half of fiscal 2025 as we finish our major capital projects, I will now shift to our outlook for the first quarter and fiscal year 2025. Based on quarter-to-date trends, net revenue in the first quarter of fiscal 2025 is expected to be in the range of 475 to 495 million, representing an increase of 3% to 7% compared to the first quarter last year. We expect gross profit margin in the first quarter to increase by approximately 450 basis points compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2024, driven by IMU improvements, lower warehousing costs, lower markdowns and savings from our smart spending initiatives. We forecast SG&A as a percent of net revenue to increase by approximately 250 basis points in the first quarter, driven by investments in digital marketing and technology initiatives. For the full year, we currently expect net revenue in the range of 2.52 to 2.62 billion. This outlook represents growth for the year of 8% to 12% from fiscal 2024, excluding the 53rd week in fiscal 2024. This represents growth of 10% to 14%. Our fiscal 2025 net revenue outlook reflects the anticipated cadence of our boutique openings and accommodates for a range of macroeconomic scenarios. In fiscal 2025, we plan to open 11 to 13 new boutiques, including our Chicago flagship and to reposition three to four boutiques, including two of our Manhattan flagships other than one new boutique and one repositioned in Canada, all openings and repositions our in the United States, we anticipate total square footage growth of approximately 20% to 25% I can't emphasize enough that our new stores are our most consistent growth driver, delivering predictable revenue growth and attractive payback periods. In addition to building brand awareness, driving significant client acquisition and fueling e-commerce sales. We forecast meaningful gross profit margin expansion for the year, an increase of approximately 400 to 450 basis points compared to last year. This reflects IMU improvements, lower warehousing costs, lower markdowns and savings from our Smart Spending initiative. SG&A as a percentage of net revenue is expected to be approximately flat to down 50 basis points compared to fiscal 2024, driven by savings from our smart spending initiatives and leverage on fixed costs offset by investments in digital marketing. Further, we expect depreciation and amortization of approximately $80 million compared to 65 million in fiscal 2024. We expect our adjusted EBITDA margin to expand by approximately 400 to 500 basis points reflecting the leverage across the range of potential net revenue outcomes. The expansion is primarily driven by improvements in gross margin. We expect capital expenditures for fiscal 2025 of approximately 230 million. This includes approximately 100 and mid 190 million related to investments in new and repositioned boutiques for fiscal 2025 and the start of construction for boutiques opening in early fiscal 2026. We continue to see our most recent new boutiques tracking to payback in approximately one year or less exceeding our projections for 12 to 18 months. Our CapEx spend also includes approximately $40 million, primarily related to the expansion of our distribution center network. This includes a portion of the cost for our new facility in the Vancouver area, which is planned to open in fiscal 2026 and investments in our expanded distribution center in Columbus, Ohio throughout fiscal 2025, we plan to use our NCIB to purchase shares opportunistically to offset the dilution of option exercises. We anticipate that our buying this fiscal year will be concentrated during open trading windows and closing, we expect sales growth to increase this year, driven by an improvement in the composition of our inventory, total square footage growth of 20% to 25% and momentum in e-commerce. In addition, we expect meaningful gross profit margin expansion for the year and modest improvements in SG&A leverage for the fiscal year. The combination of the revenue acceleration and margin expansion will nearly double our earnings. With that, I'll now turn the call back to Jennifer.\n\nJennifer Wong: Thanks, Todd. After two years of exceptional growth in our business, 74% in fiscal 2022 and 47% in fiscal 2023. Fiscal 2024 was a year of building infrastructure and rightsizing our inventory while continuing to service our clients following our unprecedented growth, it was absolutely critical that we rightsize our infrastructure and optimize our operations. We made substantial progress in five key areas. We expanded our distribution center network to accommodate record volume, including the addition of our new 550,000 square foot facility in Ontario. We improved our inventory position, including the composition of our product and enhanced our proven operating model, which has served us well for decades. We executed on our smart spending initiatives around resulting in annualized run rate savings of more than 60 million. We develop a pipeline of boutique openings in premier locations, including four brands, compelling flagship projects. And last but not least, we kicked off the process of integrating our digital channel from driving traffic through to optimizing our omnichannel services. Our focus on investing in the scalability of our business throughout this past year, set the stage for our next phase of expected growth, helping to ensure we can expand at a consistent measured pace moving forward. Q1 is off to a good start, and we're pleased with our clients' response to our product. We expect the composition of our product to continue to improve throughout the quarter and be further optimized for fall. The performance of our new boutiques continues to beat our own expectation. We have an extraordinary pipeline of boutiques opening this year, representing total square footage growth of 20% to 25%. With the vast majority in the US, the increased pace of openings is expected to fuel retail sales growth and drive incremental e-commerce sales as we expand into five new markets in e-commerce, we believe our revenue growth will reaccelerate as we continue to optimize the composition of our product. And additionally, our strategic focus on digital marketing, technology and omnichannel further supports growth in our digital business. In closing, our brand is strong. Our financial position is solid and we have a tremendous multiyear runway for growth in the U.S. All of our people, thank you for your hard work and unwavering commitment to our received future, particularly throughout the last year. During that time, we solidified our platform for the next phase of growth. I'm very optimistic about all of the opportunities on deck for fiscal 2025 and beyond as we continue to plan and bring everyday luxury to more and more clients than ever before. Thank you. And with that, we're ready to open the line for Q&A.\n\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. The first question comes from Mark Petrie with CIBC.\n\nMark Petrie: Yes, good afternoon. Maybe on just first on the on the SG&A guide, can you just help help sort of bridge the pieces there. I recall 150 to 200 basis points cost efficiencies and from the from the smart spend initiatives and the majority of that in SG&A. So could you just talk about what other pieces are going on in SG&A?\n\nJennifer Wong: Yes, absolutely, Mark. And it was approximately 60% of the benefits we were expecting from the smart spending to hit in SG&A. So as a reminder, for the full year, we're expecting to be flat to down 50 basis points, so an improvement of 50 basis points. And that's driven by, as you're suggesting the spend management initiatives, which are offset by investments in the digital marketing. So effectively, that's why you're seeing pressure in the first quarter. And then we're expecting that to improve modestly in the second quarter. And then we're expecting expansion in the third and fourth quarter in SG&A as as the revenue growth begins to accelerate and we're lapping some of the improvements that are in basically in to further focus on the first quarter, have we have digital marketing this year where we didn't in the first quarter last year, and then we have technology initiatives that we made in the back half as well as higher spend in the first quarter this year on projects. So there is really a cadence thing with pressure in the first quarter that dissipates in the second and then turns to a positive for the third and fourth quarter.\n\nMark Petrie: Okay. That's helpful. And if I could just follow up then on that digital marketing spend, it has been ramping up. And I'm just curious if you can speak quantitatively or even just qualitatively about the payoffs and the returns that you're seeing from that? And then related, if you're able to quantify the impact of the lesser availability of clearance goods on either comp sales or the e-com sales?\n\nJennifer Wong: Exactly. And Mark, I think I'll take both of those. The I'll take the last first to quantify the on lower volume of markdown sales in Q4, it's about 15 million, and we are especially pleased, though, because inventory was down 27%. So I think that's the important thing to note here is we're in a better inventory position despite the lower volume of markdown sales on the performance marketing one are grounded on the fact that we have done zero performance marketing to date is just started up, but digital, more digital marketing and we believe we need a baseline level. If we're going to be a player in the digital space, we need a baseline level of digital marketing. The majority of that is to protect and propel our brand and our product franchises and of course, overall to drive traffic and conversion were really only about six weeks into it. We just signed on with the digital agency the beginning of this year or wrapping them up. We're taking a crawl, walk run approach. And the early indicators, if you looked at it apples to apples against the industry is that what we're doing right now, we are focused on the bottom of the funnel, particularly on conversion is we're performing at industry if not better than industry when we are compared to and many in our peer set. So I find that to be quite encouraging and we'll continue to monitor and assess it. And as long as it adding incremental incrementally to our business. We'll continue with it and adjust as necessary.\n\nOperator: The next question comes from Dylan Carden with William Blair.\n\nDylan Carden: Great. Thanks. Just a point of clarification on the gross margin guide. I guess taking a step back, the 500 basis points, the kind of previously spoken to on total EBITDA expansion that's kind of embedded the current guide on the sort of 400 to 450. There's no change there, really exactly. There's no change. We're still targeting the 500 basis points?\n\nTodd Ingledew: Yes, 100%. The range that we provided is simply based on the variance in the fixed cost leverage, right from the top of the range to the bottom.\n\nDylan Carden: Sure. I will. I guess to that point, can you touch you sort of mentioned a range of macro outcomes. Anything you can kind of speak to is where your consumer is that prevalent, you agree, meaning by jurisdiction and kind of what the top and bottom end of the guidance kind of and visions as far as how that trends in one word impacted the same as a lot of others are observing right now.\n\nJennifer Wong: Our customers impacted by macro challenges that are out of our control on. Nothing's really changed quarter over quarter we did see that in our consumer is shopping when she shopping, she is discerning with her spend. So and this is just showing up in terms of in terms of volume overall, but we still have a customer that is shopping with us and basically our basket size and average order value continues to be consistent.\n\nDylan Carden: Great. And then on the digital marketing front, was there certain by reality of the brand that sort of happened organically over the last two or so years on that you're kind of seeing a low and sort of before you really start ramping this digital spend, is that essentially a hole you need to fill? Or is it more the future going from zero and the incremental demand that you can grow through that.\n\nJennifer Wong: Fair to say your question is that we've grown, we've grown with no additional no digital marketing included in our overall digital cyber, and we've experienced phenomenal growth in eCommerce coming out of COVID. We've spoken a lot about that. And I think what's happened coming out of COVID when there everybody was with digital, is that the ad space is noisier. It's noisier. There's everyone is doing some form of digital marketing and more and more of it. And so for us to ensure that we remain top of mind and continue to have share of mine and attention of the customer. We are going to participate and have at least a baseline level of digital marketing. And to be clear, only a component of our overall e-commerce digital playbook at the end of the day, the key driver of our business is our product that we've always said that regardless of both channels, the key driver is our product. So in our minds, a lot of focus on digital marketing because we haven't done it before, and we're just introducing it as of late. And as I said a minute ago, the early indicators are that it is contributing and it is incrementally positive for us, but it's only a component of our overall playbook at the end of the day, we see e-commerce content will reaccelerate and get back to more of the same levels that we saw in our organic growth when our product is optimized.\n\nOperator: The next question comes from Luke Hannan with Canaccord Genuity.\n\nLuke Hannan: Thanks. Good afternoon. Jeff, you mentioned that you were pretty happy with the rollout of buy online pickup in store and ship from store so far in the US. I'm just wondering if we can get a little bit more granularity on that, I guess either quantitatively or qualitatively that you're pleased with, are you able to convert more, call it more casual clientele into into more repeat purchasers of Aritzia product? Or just anything else you can share there?\n\nJennifer Wong: Yes, yes. What is really underlying all is that what it's done is it's opened up the availability of our pretty much our full inventory to the online customer, whereas before when the inventory for the online customer was yes, what was in our distribution centers and we had items that were in the stores, they wouldn't be able to purchase it. So it opens up so when I say it optimizes our inventory, it opens up so much more availability to that online customer. And then on top of it, she has a choice as we are picking up and picking it up in store, which means you can get even sooner. And the customer experience is fantastic and they were achieved in the store and on the Sally advisers assisting her. There's only if there can be a lift there, too. So and we love about it first and foremost that it optimizes our inventory, makes it more efficient and then ultimately for those items that are in the stores and not in the distribution center that might not otherwise be in the stores, it lowers our distribution costs at the end of the day and all to say that it does add incremental sales to the e-commerce channel.\n\nLuke Hannan: That's great. Thanks. And then my follow-up here is just on the cadence of comparable comparable sales growth for the balance of the year, recognizing that there will be positive contributions from this investment in digital. But then I imagine going up against tougher comps when it comes to markdown sales as we get closer to the Q2 and Q3. So I'd love to hear your thoughts there.\n\nTodd Ingledew: Yes. From a revenue cadence perspective, obviously, the growth is more heavily weighted in the back half of the year. And we have we're, as I said, if you exclude the 53rd week, we're expecting 10% to 14% revenue growth for the year. And then within the first quarter, that growth is expected to be 3% to 7%, and that's compared to growth of 13% in Q1 last year. So actually the compares get easier now as we as we move through the fiscal year. And so therefore, with the combination of you, our new stores opening in the back half of the year and easier compares and all of the initiatives underway within e-commerce and the product positioning, we expect that we will still see sort of revenue acceleration quarter on quarter through the year. And as you know, that will be both for non-comp and comp color.\n\nOperator: The next question comes from Martin Landry with Stifel.\n\nMartin Landry: Good afternoon. I'd like to talk about a little bit the cadence of EBITDA margin improvement. Todd, you mentioned that you're going to have some SG&A leverage that's going to kick in a little later this year. You know how it's going to be. Can you give us a bit of color on the cadence of the EBITDA margin improvement throughout the year? And what could the exit rate look like, yes, 100%.\n\nTodd Ingledew: And so I've already laid out the the SG&A cadence with increases again in the back half and pressure in the first half. And so obviously, going along with that is the the gross margin expansion that we're expecting, which obviously is a significant add of 400 to 450 basis points of improvement and the cadence of that that we're expecting is that so roughly near the top of that range in Q1 and Q2 and near the lower end of that range in Q3 and Q4. And that's really driven by our one of the components of benefit we're seeing gross profit is our distribution center costs, and we were already benefiting in the back half of last year from the opening of our new DC. So we don't expect we won't see as much year over year benefit in the back part. That's why there's a cadence there but obviously in the in the back half of the year, if you take the average 400 call it at the bottom end of the range for gross profit plus roughly 100 basis points of leverage in SG&A and which is what we're expecting in the back half. If you model it out, as you'll get that exit point of roughly 500 basis points of improvement in the back half of the year.\n\nMartin Landry: Okay. That's helpful. And can you just talk a little bit about your and your aspirational goal of bringing EBITDA margins towards 19%? And is this still a goal that you can you think you can achieve in the coming years? And what would be the the moving parts get there?\n\nTodd Ingledew: Yes, we're still targeting the high 10s EBITDA margin. Obviously, we're taking taking a meaningful step this year. And then next year, we would expect another another jump in our in our EBITDA margin as we add them one benefit from the revenue from all of the stores that we're adding this year and further leverage from new stores next year, but also from the rent that will be coming off as we as we open our new flagship locations. We've talked about the pressure that we're seeing today that will will drive improvement in FY. 26 as well as what we think is a multiyear IMU improvement opportunity will be part of the building blocks and potentially lower markdowns as well as we work through FY 26 and 27, both from an IMU and markdown perspective. And then also as we as we continue to say that as our mix shift toward the United States that becomes a larger and larger portion of our business, there is an underlying benefit that will help support margin expansion, right the way through FY 27 and beyond, frankly.\n\nOperator: The next question comes from Irene Nattel with RBC Capital Markets.\n\nIrene Nattel: Good afternoon, everyone. And most my questions have been answered, but just a couple of more housekeeping items. As you very helpfully at the Q3 call provided the timing of the new store openings in F 25, I believe in your comments you said that they're largely unchanged, but can you please confirm the quarterly cadence?\n\nJennifer Wong: Yes, of course, Irene. So we're right now we're expecting one new boutique and one reposition, which has already opened in the first quarter as three new boutiques in the second quarter and then nine new boutiques and two repositions, which include the Chicago flagship as well as the SoHo and Fifth Avenue flagships in the back half of the year. And those should be weighted more more towards the end of the the third quarter.\n\nIrene Nattel: Okay. That's that is that is super helpful. Thank you. And then can you give us a little bit on a little bit more color around the basket composition and how you're seeing consumers your customer shopping you noted that there's great response to the newness of it or so if you can give us some examples of that and also how you feel about newness and what we should be seeing in the stores as we move really into the heart of spring summer says, Irene, in the single digits in Montreal SPILL?\n\nJennifer Wong: Listen, I'll take the second question first. We've as I said, we've made great progress in our product composition and we have a much better balance now going into spring. We made tremendous progress, get even better for summer and will largely be where we need to be for fall. So it's the progressive. It's sort of a progressive optimization here. As far as newness, it confirm when you walk into the store and what we see merchandise, I think we're hitting our targets and our goals of having half the store merchandise and in newness and the other 50% of merchandise in our client favorites. We've never ever had a problem with fashion selling all of all of items, all of the styles and the whole entire assortment are absolutely pieces. And it really just what we're working on right now is getting the right composition between the two. As far as what we're seeing trending. As I mentioned, our goal then was extremely well received and I personally love love Golden amazingly had a fantastic campaign around it as well. With this, wet fleece is performing well. And really as always, we've had items pretty much in every department performing, whether it be shirts, sweaters, pants, even accessories. So we're pleased with getting back on track with our product playbooks, and we're seeing the response now early in Q1 and I'm super now optimistic and more than optimistic, I feel very, very confident that this trend will continue as we progress through the year with total revenue. And that's great for me.\n\nIrene Nattel: Thank you. And then just one last question, if I might. Around swim should come because it on the side, it looks like there's a lot of discounting going on. So just kind of wondering how swim has performed relative to expectations and P-8 and sell.\n\nJennifer Wong: And we don't want if we didn't save all of our targets as well, and that doesn't mean that we have continued with there's a bit of background noise there. We have not continued with swimming on the collection going into this spring or summer. So I'm not quite sure what you're talking about as far as far as discounting, because I think we've kind of given your commentary in terms of the markdown sales and how that was quite markedly reduced in Q4 of fiscal 2024. Although I am still given where our inventory levels are, we're feeling again like we're getting, we're getting back on track to our more historical levels of Vamos. And at that, I'll I will add that for Q4 despite the lower than last year and was for Q4, our markdown levels were yes, although slightly higher than last year. They're still below pre-pandemic levels, if that's what you're wondering about our tax team for the AMP (OTC:AMLTF).\n\nIrene Nattel: That's great.\n\nTodd Ingledew: Thank you for that senior team divestiture, our free cash flow growing at the year over year and the operator standardizing what we have from various lines open to someone else. We're excited about the cloud. Let me child attack against that our next generation.\n\nOperator: The next question comes from Brian Morrison with TD Securities.\n\nBrian Morrison: Your comment with respect to the new products, and you say that they're having great progress and being well received. You gave examples of Goldman your sweat fleece, but I just want to know like are the are you hitting your sales targets with respect to your new products.\n\nJennifer Wong: Yes, absolutely.\n\nBrian Morrison: Perfect. And then, Todd, I got cut off on the call a bit, but just in terms of your margin progression, the 500 basis points, the items within your control, whether it be the transitory costs, the smart spend, the IMUs, are there any that are underperforming or outperforming with respect to good results that you've seen so far to date?\n\nTodd Ingledew: Note that for the we saw a 30 basis point improvement in the fourth quarter, which is what we were anticipating and have already can have obviously good visibility into the IMUP. for the first quarter and for spring, the warehousing costs. But that has already happened. As I said, the benefits we're receiving those benefits and we were in the fourth quarter. So we expect to receive them in the first and the back end. And then obviously the improved markdowns, while there's some benefit in the first quarter because because we're lapping some some runoff sales and markdowns the last few one add, but that will predominantly be seeing those obviously during our sale periods, the benefit of that. So in the second and the fourth quarter. But no, we have great visibility into the gross profit margin expansion for the year and are already seeing those benefits today. So in terms of those four key buckets, it's fair to say they're all between 125 and 150 basis points, and then there'll be a slight offset with respect to the growth in the rent expense and the IMU., if they would go in the order of IMU., then the warehousing and distribution center costs, the lower markdowns and then spend management and they kind of one is slightly bigger than the other.\n\nOperator: The next question comes from Michael Glen with Raymond James.\n\nMichael Glen: Okay. Thanks for getting me. And maybe just can you speak to how we should think about e-commerce sales trending in Q1 on a year-over-year basis?\n\nTodd Ingledew: Yes, our e-commerce sales in the first quarter are trending within that. That's for the 3% to 7% range and that we laid out. Okay. So no that we shouldn't expect any meaningful variance between retail and e-commerce growth in Q1. I think we would continue to anticipate that the retail growth will be slightly higher than our e-commerce growth driven by the new stores.\n\nMichael Glen: Okay. And then when when I know you've spent a lot of time talking about customer customer activity, when you opened new stores, are you still seeing the same level of customer response when you've opened new stores relative to the fact to the past or has there been a change? Have you seen any slowdown in terms of the traffic experience when you open new stores?\n\nTodd Ingledew: No, we've we have overwhelming response when we open new stores. I think that that's proven in terms of some of the metrics that we shared with you on the call with the opening remarks, when we open new stores, they perform extremely well. And I might add for e-commerce when we open a new store in a new market, we see a 70% Halo eCommerce lift. So the new store openings and as we said in the opening remarks, are proven consistent, most predictable driver of sales.\n\nMichael Glen: Okay. And any changes at all in terms of how you see have you seen any slowing on the paybacks for new stores that you have you referenced in the past?\n\nTodd Ingledew: No, no, we have not. We continue to see, as we said, better than our expectations of 12 to 18 months, we consider to continue to see paybacks of beating that. So we have not seen any slowdown.\n\nOperator: The next question comes from Mauricio Serna with UBS.\n\nMauricio Serna: Great. Good afternoon and thanks for taking my questions. I just wanted to get a better sense on how are you thinking about comp sales for the year? And maybe you could provide I mean, I understand from like the total sales will accelerate because of the boutique openings. But from a comp sales standpoint, how are you thinking about that, you know, starting Q1 in as the quarters progress? And then maybe I guess just wanted to make sure like from a Hello Mark from a digital sorry. From the adjusted EBITDA margin, like the big change relative to like the previous outlook of 500 basis points to now this range is essentially some of the as you're reinvesting some of the gains into digital marketing. Is that is that the right way to think about it? Thanks.\n\nTodd Ingledew: Yes, I mean, I'll take the first one or the second first. And that's that we are still targeting 500 basis points at the top of the range and that the range provided simply reflect, again, the deleverage that we would experience with the declines at the bottom of the range and so that that that's the gap. And yes, we are as I think it will, as we have said last Q1, we reported that we would be investing in digital marketing and that that is offsetting some of the benefits that we had within the spend management within SG&A, but worse, and we're still targeting the 500 at the top of the range. And then from a to answer your first question from a cadence of the comp or maybe composition of the revenue that again, we're forecasting or for 10% to 14% growth. If you exclude the benefit of the 53rd week in FY 24 and that is broken down into two components, non-comp and comp. And the non-comp component, which is obviously the new and repositioned boutiques is approximately 60% of the revenue. And that component, we expect to be relatively consistent through the range. And the range is really the comp component, which is made up of both retail comp and e-commerce. And the obviously the e-commerce being the majority of that comp growth. And so the range that we have outlined there reflect different scenarios for our comp growth, and that's how we're looking at that revenue growth. So if you flex the call using that $100 million range, and that's how we're looking at it. And obviously, the comp growth we're expecting to be lower in the first quarter and then grow in the second, third and fourth.\n\nOperator: The next question comes from Stephen MacLeod with BMO Capital Markets.\n\nStephen MacLeod: Thank you. Good evening. Lots of my questions have already been answered. So I just had a couple of just a couple of clarifying questions. Just on the on the new store timing, it sounded like it was slightly different than what it was before. I just wanted to just wondering, Tom, if you can run through those through the timing of those new stores and repositionings and then when when one the flagships come online as well?\n\nJennifer Wong: Yes. So there hasn't been any material change in the timing. Again, one new boutique and one repositioned in Q1, three new boutiques in Q2. And then the majority of the stores in the back half are planned for close to the end of the third quarter. But I guess I just want to caution against putting them early in the third quarter, we have nine new boutiques are coming online. So those will we'll be coming in effectively majority in that October, November timeframe and some could bleed into December and January. So I that it's just obviously with construction. It's hard to pin exactly when they're going to open and we have major projects going on right now. With our Chicago flagship, Soho And fifth, and we expect the Chicago flagship to open first in the back half, then. So home and followed by fifth. And those again, those projects are large. And so there could be some movement from from our expectations. But we do we do feel confident that by the end of the back half of the year and likely by December, we will have the vast majority of those stores open and in the backup.\n\nStephen MacLeod: Okay. That's great. And then just in terms of the Q, the Q. one guide did you say that comps are like embedded in that total growth of 3% to 5.37% comps? Are we expect it to be positive in Q1?\n\nTodd Ingledew: No, I said what we have to I mean, what I said was that our revenues in the 3% to 7% range and e-commerce would land within that retail growth, total retail growth will likely be slightly over time like slightly higher than e-commerce.\n\nStephen MacLeod: Okay. Okay. Great. Thank you. And then maybe just finally, just some sort of just a modeling question with respect to just the IFRS 16 adjustments related to on the depreciation and interest. Are you able to talk a little bit about how those are going to expected to grow through 2025 and 2026. As I know, that sometimes impacts the margins and EBITDA.\n\nTodd Ingledew: The depreciation and amortization, we're expecting to be roughly $80 million provided by my commentary, John and yes, that's the expectation.\n\nStephen MacLeod: Okay. What about the IFRS. 16? T's depreciation on ROU assets and the interest expense on lease liabilities?\n\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] The next question comes from Mauricio Serna with UBS.\n\nMauricio Serna: Great, thanks. I just had a quick follow-up because when you were answering the question about the comp sales and the growth, I just want to make sure I got her right it. It's the non-comp 50% of the revenue growth is coming from from the non-comp. I just want to make sure I heard that right?\n\nTodd Ingledew: It roughly 60%. So if you take the midpoint of our range and then remove the 53rd week from last year, so you get 2.3 billion, that's the difference there, roughly 60% of that is expected to be coming from the stores, the new stores and would be classified as non-comp. And then the other 40% would be expected to come from comp sales, which are majority e-commerce\n\nOperator: This concludes the question-and-answer session. I would now like now like to turn the call back over to Beth Reed for any closing remarks. Please go ahead.\n\nBeth Reed: And thank you again to everyone for joining us this afternoon. We're available after the call you any further questions and we look forward to providing another update next quarter. Have a great evening.\n\nOperator: This concludes today's conference call.

(NASDAQ:FARO) Q1 2024 Earnings Call Transcript", "body": "FARO Technologies, Inc. isn't one of the 30 most popular stocks among hedge funds at the end of the third quarter (see the details here).\n\nOperator: Good day, everyone, and welcome to the FARO Technologies First Quarter 2024 Earnings Call. For opening remarks and introductions, I will now turn the call over to Michael Funari at Sapphire Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nMike Funari: Thank you, and good morning. With me today from FARO are Peter Lau, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Matt Horwath, Chief Financial Officer. Yesterday after market close, the company released its financial results for the first quarter of 2024. The related press release and Form 10-Q is available on FARO's website at www.faro.com. Please note certain statements in this conference call, which are not historical facts may be considered forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties, some of which are beyond our control and include statements regarding future business results, product technology development, customer demand, inventory levels, our outlook and financial guidance, economic industry projections or subsequent events.\n\nVarious factors could cause actual results to differ materially. For a more detailed description of these and other risks and uncertainties, please refer to today's press release and our annual and quarterly SEC filings. Forward-looking statements reflect our views only as of today, and except as required by law, we undertake no obligation to update or revise them. During today's conference call, management will discuss certain financial measures that are not presented in accordance with the U.S. generally accepted accounting principles or non-GAAP financial measures. In the press release, you will find additional disclosures regarding these non-GAAP measures, including reconciliations to comparable GAAP measures. While not recognized on GAAP, management believes these non-GAAP financial measures provide investors with relevant period comparisons of core operations.\n\nHowever, they should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for a measure of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. Now I'd like to turn the call over to Peter Lau.\n\nPeter Lau: Thank you, Mike. Good morning, and welcome, everyone, to our call. In the first quarter, our focus on executing the strategic plan we outlined in March, continued to drive meaningful results. We again exceeded our targets in the quarter, delivering $84.2 million in revenue, which was towards the high end of our guidance range, $0.09 of non-GAAP EPS, which was above the high end of our guidance range, $5.6 million of adjusted EBITDA and $4.2 million of free cash flow. We've taken significant strides in the past few quarters in enhancing the operational efficiency of our business. Our first quarter earnings and cash flow demonstrate this progress, marking the first time in four years, where we've achieved positive non-GAAP EPS and cash flow during what is traditionally our slowest quarter.\n\nThis accomplishment is particularly noteworthy as it signifies a fundamental shift in our operating model, establishing a new starting point from which we expect to benefit from in the forthcoming quarters. From a top line perspective, in the first quarter, we continued to see strong demand across a wide range of industries. The better-than-expected performance in the quarter was mainly driven by several large manufacturing orders out of the Asia Pacific region. While pleasantly surprised with the orders, they tended to be specific to individual customer situations. We remain cautious on the overall near-term outlook in the Asia Pacific region, given the ongoing challenges in the construction market within China. Across the broader global market, we have seen our overall pipeline continue to grow, but have seen a shift in customer behavior in mature markets such as the U.S. and Western Europe in the quarter.\n\nThere has been both a move to prioritize larger capacity-related investment initiatives and increasing caution on the outlook within commercial construction. As a result, we've seen an elongating sales cycle in these markets, which is evidenced in our first quarter geographical mix. Operationally, we again saw a notable year-over-year improvement in gross margin, along with a positive sequential trend considering our revenue seasonality. As we have discussed in prior calls, our focus on variable cost productivity, mitigation of broker fees and supply chain localization efforts within Southeast Asia continue to progress as planned. These actions contributed meaningfully to the first quarter results, and we expect this focus on operational excellence to positively impact our results over the next several quarters.\n\nTaken all together, our non-GAAP gross margin improved 420 basis points year-over-year to 51.8%. As I mentioned earlier, from a cash flow perspective, we successfully generated $4.2 million in free cash flow in the first quarter, marking our second sequential quarter of meaningful cash flow generation and the first positive Q1 in several years. The initiatives we put in place to monetize our balance sheet are paying off, and we are increasingly confident in our ability to drive sustained cash flow generation under the current market conditions. While we've made great strides in improving financial performance over the past several quarters, it's important to note we're still in the early stages of refining our execution strategies and enhancing outcomes.\n\nOur team fully understands the extent of work ahead and is dedicated to delivering on our plans. The adjustments made to our cost structure thus far, evidenced by our first quarter expense base, improving gross margins and working capital efficiencies demonstrate the progress we've made in refining our operational framework. Moving forward, we remain focused on productivity and continuing to expand gross margins while simultaneously making strategic investments in new products and technologies. We understand the importance of continuing to foster innovation and growth through focused investments in our core. By maintaining this balanced approach, we aim to both increase shareholder value and expand our competitive position in the marketplace.\n\nOn the product front, I'm pleased to report that now two quarters after the launch, feedback on our new Orbis mobile scanner remains very positive. Notably, the revenue for our mobile scanning solutions has increased double digits year-over-year, reflecting the increasing adoption of our technology. In addition, the success of Orbis underscores the growth opportunity potential of expanding into adjacent markets within our core. By targeting the mobile scanning market with a diversified set of solutions, we've been able to expand our served addressable market, providing an initial proof point towards our long-term growth strategy of entering markets adjacent to our core, where FARO has the right to play and the right to win. Bolstering our software offering in the last quarter, we showcased a strong software release cadence with advancements across our portfolio.\n\nMultiple software updates were rolled out, solidifying our commitment to enhancing customer experience. A key highlight was the enhancement of FARO CAM2 our leading 3D metrology software with an upgraded CAD translator, which supports additional CAD formats and improves interoperability. Additionally, FARO Connect, our mobile scanning software received advanced processing options tailored to diverse use cases, empowering customers with greater control of their data. We also unveiled a groundbreaking innovation in FARO Zone 3D aimed at public safety customers, the MassZone collision prediction system, facilitating the creation of immersive what-if crash animations by seamlessly blending real-world and digital data. Furthermore, with the release of 3D model import, the FARO Sphere XG digital reality cloud solution has become the singular platform where AECO professionals can seamlessly visualize 3D models alongside the reality capture data.\n\nOur R&D roadmap, which integrates both hardware and software into value-added solutions for our customers is firmly directed towards increasing our served addressable market by 40% over our strategic horizon. As we move through 2024, we look forward to discussing impactful new product launches with you in greater detail, including the markets they target and opportunities they represent. To further support the momentum in our business and align the success of all of our stakeholders, I'm very excited to share that we recently announced a stock ground program for all FARO employees. By extending ownership opportunities to all levels of the organization, we align the interest of every single employee with the company's long-term goals, driving motivation, creativity and dedication to those goals.\n\nThis program underscores FARO's commitment to our people and our vision of building a stronger, more resilient organization for the future. At our recent investor event held in March, we outlined our commitment to enhancing shareholder value through a strategic approach anchored on three fundamental principles: first, accelerating revenue growth ahead of the market trends we operate within; second, to grow earnings at a pace exceeding that of our revenue expansion; and third, to expand our free cash flow at a velocity surpassing our earnings growth. FARO operates within highly promising markets poised for growth. By prioritizing our core customers and understanding their evolving needs, we position ourselves to deliver innovative solutions that effectively address their most pressing challenges, giving us the opportunity to outpace market growth rates.\n\nThrough the combination of diligent efforts to expand our gross margins and a milestone funding approach to operating expense management, we expect to be in a position to realize meaningful operating leverage as revenue grows. This disciplined approach ensures sustainable growth while fostering increased profitability and facilitating heightened cash flow generation. The implementation of the strategic playbook over the last four quarters has significantly bolstered FARO's financial standing. We are enthusiastic about the continued execution of this strategy in the years ahead and are confident in its capacity to drive substantial shareholder value creation. With that, I'll now turn the call over to Matt to provide an overview of our first quarter financial resorts and our second quarter outlook.\n\nMatt Horwath: Thank you, Peter, and good morning, everyone. First quarter revenue of $84.2 million was approximately flat with the first quarter of 2023. Geographically, demand strength in the Europe and Asia Pacific regions helped offset incremental softness in the Americas as a result of lengthening sales cycles, which Peter mentioned earlier. First quarter hardware revenue of $52.6 million was down 4% year-over-year, while software revenue of $10.9 million was up 6% and service revenue of $20.7 million increased by 5%. Recurring revenue was $16.7 million and represented 20% of sales. GAAP gross margin was 51.4% and non-GAAP gross margin was 51.8% for the first quarter of 2024 compared to 47.6% in 2023. As Peter mentioned, in the first quarter, we executed on our variable cost productivity initiatives, including mitigating broker fees and incremental benefits from supply chain localization.\n\nNon-GAAP gross margin increased 420 basis points year-over-year. GAAP operating expenses were $48.6 million and included approximately $5.2 million in acquisition-related intangible amortization and stock compensation expenses and $2.7 million in restructuring and other executive transition costs. Non-GAAP operating expense of $40.7 million was down $8.1 million from Q1 last year as we realized the benefit of our restructuring efforts and continued productivity improvements. GAAP operating loss was $5.3 million in the first quarter of 2024 compared with an operating loss of $18.6 million in the first quarter of 2023. Non-GAAP operating income was $3 million in the first quarter of 2024 compared to a loss of $8.3 million in the first quarter of 2023.\n\nAdjusted EBITDA was $5.6 million for approximately 6.6% of sales compared to an EBITDA loss of $5.5 million in the first quarter of 2023. Our GAAP net loss was $7.3 million or $0.38 per share. Our non-GAAP net income was $1.7 million or $0.09 per share for the first quarter of 2024 compared to a net loss of $7.1 million or $0.38 per share in Q1 2023. Our cash and short-term investment balance at the end of the quarter was $99.3 million, up $3 million from Q4 due to profitability levels and continued working capital improvements. Given our current accounts receivable balance, expectations for revenue and our new expense base as well as further enhancements to our inventory management, we continue to expect to be cash flow positive throughout the first half of 2024.\n\nWhile we are pleased with our first quarter results and view them as evidence the business is moving in the right direction, we remain cautious in the near term. From a geographic perspective, we do not expect the construction market in China to rebound in the second quarter. And together with the elongating sales cycles in select geographies, we want to remain thoughtful and measured in setting expectations for the second quarter of 2024. Although the macro environment remains choppy, our confidence level continues to increase in our ability to deliver on our execution priorities that we outlined during our March Investor event, specifically in our ability to expand gross margins, control our operating expenses and generate positive free cash flow.\n\nAs a result, at present FX rates, we expect second quarter revenue of between $79 million and $87 million. At those revenue levels and given corresponding non-GAAP gross margin between 51% and 52.5% and non-GAAP operating expenses of between $41 million and $43 million, we would expect non-GAAP earnings per share ranging from negative $0.08 per share to positive $0.12 per share for second quarter profitability. This concludes our prepared remarks. And at this time, we'd be pleased to take your questions.\n\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] I will take our first question from James Ricchiuti with Needham.

This top-line growth will also allow us to make significant progress towards our adjusted EBITDA breakeven goal.\"\n\nFirst Quarter 2024 Financial Results\n\nWorldwide revenue was $37.9 million in the first quarter 2024, a ~16% increase from $32.7 million in the corresponding period in 2023. U.S. revenue for the first quarter 2024 was $35.4 million, a ~16% increase from $30.5 million in the corresponding period in 2023. International revenue growth for the first quarter 2024 was $2.4 million compared to $2.3 million in the corresponding period in 2023.\n\nGross margin was ~79% for the first quarter 2024, as compared to ~82% in the corresponding period in 2023.

The change in operating expenses was primarily driven by increases in commission related to revenue growth, research and development investments, as well as higher stock based compensation. Operating expenses were also impacted by the timing of our global sales meeting, which was held in the first quarter of 2024 compared to in the second quarter of 2023.\n\nOperating loss increased by ~7% to $12.0 million in the first quarter 2024, as compared to an operating loss of $11.3 million in the corresponding period in 2023.\n\nNet loss improved by ~2%, to $10.9 million, or $0.27 per diluted share for the first quarter 2024, as compared to a net loss of $11.1 million, or $0.32 per diluted share in the corresponding period in 2023.\n\nAdjusted EBITDA loss in the first quarter of 2024 was nearly flat compared to the corresponding period in 2023 at $4.0 million.\n\nCash and marketable securities were $157.8 million and borrowings were $36.1 million as of March 31, 2024.\n\n2024 Updated Financial Guidance\n\nSI-BONE is updating 2024 worldwide revenue guidance to be in the range of $164 million to $166 million, an increase from the previous guidance of $162 million to $165 million. Compared to 2023, the updated guidance translates to growth of ~18% to ~20%, versus growth of ~17% to ~19% implied in the earlier guidance.\n\nWebcast Information\n\nSI-BONE will host a conference call to discuss the first quarter 2024 financial results after market close on Monday, November 6, 2023 at 4:30 P.M.

All Rights Reserved.\n\nForward Looking Statements\n\nThe statements in this press release regarding expectations of future events or results, including SI-BONE's expectations of continued revenue and procedure growth and financial outlook, contained in this press release are \"forward-looking\" statements. These forward-looking statements are based on SI-BONE's current expectations and inherently involve significant risks and uncertainties. These risks include SI-BONE's ability to introduce and commercialize new products and indications, SI-BONE's ability to maintain favorable reimbursement for procedures using its products, the impact of any future economic weakness on the ability and desire of patients to undergo elective procedures including those using SI-BONE's devices, SI-BONE's ability to manage risks to its supply chain, future capital requirements driven by new surgical systems requiring instrument tray and implant inventory investment, and the pace of the re-normalization of the healthcare operating environment including the ability and desire of patients and physicians to undergo and perform procedures using SI-BONE's devices. Actual results and the timing of events could differ materially from those anticipated in such forward-looking statements as a result of these and other risks and uncertainties, many of which are described in the company's most recent filing on Form 10-K, and the company's other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) available at the SEC's Internet site (www.sec.gov), especially under the caption \"Risk Factors.\" SI-BONE does not undertake any obligation to update forward-looking statements and expressly disclaims any obligations or undertaking to release publicly any updates or revisions to any forward-looking statements contained herein, except as required by law.\n\nUse of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\n\nSI-BONE uses adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP financial measures that excludes from net loss the effects of interest income, interest expense, depreciation and amortization and stock-based compensation. SI-BONE believes the presentation of adjusted EBITDA is useful to management because it allows management to more consistently analyze period-to-period financial performance and provides meaningful supplemental information with respect to core operational activities used to evaluate management's performance. SI-BONE also believes the presentation of adjusted EBITDA is useful to investors and other interested persons as it enables these persons to use this additional information to assess the company's performance in using this additional metric that management uses to assess the company's performance.\n\nAdjusted EBITDA should be considered supplemental to, and not a substitute for, financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. Because adjusted EBITDA excludes the effect of items that increase or decrease SI-BONE's reported results of operations, management strongly encourages investors to review, when they become available, the company's consolidated financial statements and publicly filed reports in their entirety.

We will provide a reconciliation of each non-GAAP financial measure to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure in our earnings press release, which is posted on our website. I will now turn the call over to Sunny.\n\nSunny Sanyal: Thank you, Chris. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us for our second quarter earnings call. Sales in the second quarter was in line with our expectations, resulting in revenue of $206 million. Non-GAAP gross margin of 33% was within the guided range, and non-GAAP earnings per share was $0.16 in the quarter. Revenue in the second quarter was down 10% year-over-year. Revenue in the Medical segment decreased 15% year-over-year, while the Industrial segment revenue increased 6%. Non-GAAP gross margin in the second quarter was 33%, which was flat compared to the same quarter last year, and non-GAAP EPS was $0.16 compared to $0.26 last year. We ended the second quarter with $190 million worth of cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities on the balance sheet, up $68 million compared to the second quarter of fiscal 2023.\n\nNow let me give you some insights into the sales detail by modality in the quarter compared to a five-quarter average, which we will refer to as the sales trend. Sales in our Medical segment was down in the quarter due to cautious purchasing behavior by our customers in addition to the continued softness in China. Global sales of CT tubes improved in the quarter and is now in line with the sales trend. Fluoroscopy and mammography were both in line with their respective sales trends. Oncology, radiographic, and dental modalities were all below their respective sales trends. Global sales of our industrial products were solid in the quarter and in line with our sales trend. Our cargo inspection products and industrial tubes continued to see strong sales while we experienced some softness in other industrial end markets, primarily in semiconductor, electronics, and battery inspection.\n\nNow I'd like to take a moment to give you an update on our photon-counting technology. As we highlighted in the past quarters, photon-counting detector technologies are a significant focus across the entire imaging industry. Both medical and industrial OEMs continue to explore the use of photon-counting in imaging applications across various modalities, from food inspection to full body medical CT. Engagement with our OEM customers has accelerated over the past year, and we believe Varex continues to be well positioned to benefit from these trends given our innovative technology and breadth of our product portfolio. Our Industrial segment, where technology adoption tends to be faster, continues to be the main driver of our photon-counting detector sales.\n\nThe technology is being adopted in high growth niche verticals where there's a need for high speed and high sensitivity imaging. Our photon-counting detectors continue to be integrated into new customer systems, and we expect industrial applications to remain solid source of sales of Varex's photon-counting products in the future. In addition, last year we provided an overview of two collaborative photon-counting projects in our industrial business, PARSEC and GRINNER. These projects are sponsored under the Horizon Europe program, the European Union's key funding program for research and innovation. Both projects are focused on the speed of imaging and material discrimination, which are distinctive strengths of photon-counting. The PARSEC project, aimed at addressing the potential abuse of postal and express courier services by criminals and terrorists, is making solid progress.\n\nThe material discrimination capability of our photon-counting technology, coupled with AI software, is being used to test the detection of illicit substances within clusters of parcels. The GRINNER project, which is aimed at preventing battery-caused fires in the electronics waste management chain, is also progressing well. A prototype incorporating our photon-counting technology is expected to be deployed to an end user facility in Europe for gathering data and field-testing. Once testing at the recycling facility is complete in late fiscal 2024, we expect to work with our customer on commercialization of the final system. In our Medical segment, our photon-counting technology is being used in full body scans and panoramic dental imaging. As we noted on our first quarter earnings call, we're working with a major OEM to integrate our photon-counting technology in their next generation of CT scanners.\n\nThis process is moving along as planned. We also now have other prospects in the pipeline who are in various stages in assessing our technology for CT applications. We expect new and existing applications of our photon-counting technology to contribute strong sales growth over the next five years. Specifically, we expect additional applications in medical, including CT, to add over $100 million of revenue over this timeframe. Coupled with traction in our industrial markets, we expect our photon-counting portfolio to contribute more than $150 million of revenue annually by fiscal 2029. We continue to be encouraged by the acceptance of photon-counting technologies for medical and industrial applications. With that, let me hand over the call to Sam.\n\nSam Maheshwari: Thanks, Sunny, and hello, everyone. Our revenues in the second quarter were $206 million at the midpoint of our guidance, while non-GAAP gross margin was 33%, within our guided range. Non-GAAP EPS was $0.16 below the midpoint of our guided range. Second quarter revenues decreased 10% compared to the second quarter of fiscal 2023. Medical revenues were $149 million and Industrial revenues were $57 million. Medical revenues were 72%, and Industrial revenues were 28% of our total revenues for the quarter. Looking at revenues by region. Americas increased 1% compared to the second quarter of fiscal 2023, while EMEA increased 2% and APAC decreased 27%. The decline in APAC was primarily the result of lower sales in China due to the government's anticorruption campaign there and investigation into its healthcare system.\n\nChina accounted for 12% of overall revenues in the second quarter, compared to 17% in the second quarter of prior fiscal year. Further, sales to China in the second quarter declined sequentially from the first quarter. Given this trend, we no longer expect a pickup in China sales before the start of our next fiscal year. We remain optimistic about the prospects of long-term healthcare-related growth in China. Let me now cover our results on a GAAP basis. Second quarter gross margin was 32%, flat year-over-year. Operating expenses were $58 million, up $1 million compared to the second quarter of fiscal 2023, and operating income was $8 million, down $8 million from Q2 of 2023. GAAP net earnings were $1 million, and EPS was $0.03 per share, based on a fully diluted 41 million shares.\n\nMoving on to the non-GAAP results for the quarter. Gross margin was 33% flat compared to the second quarter of fiscal 2023. Gross margin benefited by approximately 1 percentage point due to a reclassification of fixed expense related to our joint venture dpiX from cost of goods sold to SG&A expense. This change is expected to remain in place for foreseeable future, and we are assessing ways to reduce this expense. This benefit to gross margin was offset by approximately one percentage point of higher warranty expense in the quarter. We expect the higher warranty expense to taper off and return to historical levels by the end of our fiscal year. R&D spending was $23 million, flat compared to the second quarter of fiscal 20'23. R&D was 11% of revenues.\n\nIn the second quarter, we made the fourth milestone payment of $1 million to Micro-X. Generally, our target for R&D spending is 8% to 10% of revenue on an annual basis, R&D spending is expected to remain around current levels. However, R&D as a percentage of sales may fluctuate due to overall sales levels. SG&A expense was approximately $32 million, up $3 million compared to the second quarter of fiscal 2023. SG&A was 16% of revenues. The increase in SG&A in the quarter was primarily the result of the aforementioned reclassification of fixed expense related to our joint venture dpiX. Operating expenses were $54 million, or 26% of revenues, above our expectations for the quarter. Operating income was $13 million, down $10 million compared to the same quarter last year.\n\nOperating margin was 6% of revenue, compared to 10% in the second quarter of fiscal 2023. Tax expense was $2 million, or 19% of pre-tax income, compared to $4 million, or 28%, in the second quarter of the prior year. We continue to expect a tax rate of 21% to 23% for full fiscal year 2024. Net earnings were $7 million, or $0.16 per diluted share, down $0.10 year-over-year. Average diluted shares for the quarter were 41 million on a non-GAAP basis. Now, turning to the balance sheet, accounts receivables increased by $12 million from the first quarter of fiscal 2024, primarily the result of higher sales in the quarter. Days sales outstanding remained flat at 67 days. Inventory decreased $4 million sequentially in the second quarter, and days of inventory decreased by 13 days to 185 days.\n\nAccounts payable decreased by $5 million, and days payable decreased five days to forty-five days. Now moving to debt and cash flow information, net cash flow from operations was $3 million. We ended the quarter with cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities of $190 million, up $68 million compared to the second quarter of the prior year, and down $5 million compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2024. Please note that $190 million includes $142 million of cash and cash equivalents and $47 million of marketable securities, which is now broken out as a separate line item on our balance sheet. Gross debt outstanding at the end of the quarter was $447 million and debt, net of $190 million of cash and marketable securities, was $257 million.\n\nRegarding capital structure, we implemented a $155 million revolver on March 26. Separately, we recently secured an additional $20 million financing as a delayed draw term loan. Both of these actions put us in a comfortable liquidity position as we approach refinancing of our convertible bonds. Now moving on to the outlook for the third quarter and the remainder of fiscal 2024, as discussed by Sunny, due to cautious purchasing behavior by our customers broadly, in addition to continued softness in China, we are reducing our expectations for the remainder of the fiscal year. Based on our current visibility, we expect revenue in the fourth fiscal quarter of 2024 to be flat with that of the third quarter. While demand is soft in the near term, we continue to be optimistic in the long term and continue to invest in promising technologies such as photon counting.\n\nWith the above context, guidance for the third quarter is: revenues are expected between $200 million and $220 million; and non-GAAP earnings per diluted share are expected between $0.05 and $0.25. Our expectations are based on non-GAAP gross margin in a range of 33% to 34%; non-GAAP operating expenses in a range of $52 million to $53 million; tax rate of about 22% for the third quarter; and non-GAAP diluted share count of about $41 million shares. And with that, we'll now open the call for your questions.\n\nOperator: Thank you. We will now conduct a question-and-answer session.

Welcome to the Badger Infrastructure Solutions Ltd 2024 First Quarter Results Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speakers' presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. I would now like to hand the conference over to your host today, Lisa Olarte, Director of Investor Relations and Financial Planning. Please go ahead.\n\nLisa Olarte: Good morning everyone and welcome to our first quarter 2024 earnings call. My name is Lisa Olarte, Badger's Director of Investor Relations and Financial Planning. Joining me on the call this morning are Badger's President and CEO, Rob Blackadar; and our CFO, Rob Dawson. Badger's 2024 first quarter earnings release, MD&A and financial statements were released after market closed yesterday and are available on the Investors section of Badger's website and on SEDAR+. We are required to note that some of the statements made today may contain forward-looking information. In fact, all statements made today, which are not statements of historical facts, are considered to be forward-looking statements. We make these forward-looking statements based on certain assumptions that we consider to be reasonable. However, forward-looking statements are always subject to certain risks and uncertainties and undue reliance should not be placed on them as actual results may differ materially from those expressed or implied. For more information about material assumptions, risks, and uncertainties that may be relevant to such forward-looking statements, please refer to Badger's 2023 MD&A, along with the 2023 AIF. I will now turn the call over to Rob Blackadar.\n\nRob Blackadar: Thanks Lisa and good morning everyone and thank you for joining our 2024 first quarter earnings call. Before we get into the results, I'd like to take a moment to talk about safety. Safety is at the center of everything we do here at Badger. April was Distracted Driving Awareness Month. Every day, we have thousands of operators and vehicles on the road and each vehicle is equipped with machine learning AI technology to encourage safe driving habits. Maintaining a Just Drive mindset is crucial for all of our team members when they are behind the wheel. Just Drive is just as it states, eliminating all distractions while in the vehicle, so our operators can just drive. Now, on to the first quarter results. The team had another strong quarter with record revenues, gross profit, and adjusted EBITDA. Our top line revenue of $161.6 million grew by 13%, driven by the strength of our U.S. operations, which saw a revenue increase of 19% year-over-year. We continue to experience softness in our Canadian markets due to a decrease in overall construction activity, the completion of several large projects on the West Coast, and delayed starts of some significant projects in Central Canada. This overall slowdown in the market led to an increased supply of idle hydrovacs across Canada. We continue to monitor closely the end market activity in our Canadian region and will align our sales resources as well as our fleet to pivot with the overall demand. We achieved RPT, or revenue per truck per month of $36,904 in Q1, down slightly from the previous year due to the slowdown in the Canadian market. RPT in the U.S. for the quarter was up 3% compared with last year. We continue to see growth in adjusted EBITDA track higher than our revenue growth, up 22% year-over-year, driven by improved operating leverage and cost management strategies. Our adjusted EBITDA margin was 18.1%, up from 16.7% in 2023. And as a reminder, the first quarter is our slowest most seasonal quarter of the year. The Red Deer plant manufactured 52 hydrovacs this quarter versus 57 units in Q1 of 2023. The fleet team used a seasonally slower quarter to retire 66 units and refurbish eight units. We also took the opportunity to accelerate some Q2 and Q3 retirements from our Canadian region due to the project start delays discussed earlier. We ended the quarter with 1,529 units, growing our fleet by 10% since Q1 of 2023. Our full year fleet plan remains unchanged from previous guidance, manufacturing between 190 to 220 hydrovacs, retiring between 70 to 90 units and refurbishing between 35 to 45 hydrovacs. I'll now turn the call over to Rob Dawson to discuss our Q1 financial results in more detail.\n\nRob Dawson: Thank you, Rob. As you saw in our first quarter release, our team delivered another strong quarter of results. We had record first quarter revenue up 13% from last year, driven by our U.S. operations, which was up almost 19%. Partially offsetting this, our Canadian operations were down 18% from last year due to the reasons Rob mentioned earlier. The team is prepared to execute on our pipeline of projects coming up later this year and into next. Our margins have continued to rise, reflecting the operating leverage gain from our pricing strategies and the scalability of our branch network and support functions. Our gross profit margins were strong for the first quarter at 24.8% compared with 22.9% last year, also driven by our U.S. operations. The trend in our adjusted EBITDA margins continued to improve at 18.1% compared with 16.7% in the prior year. Our four-quarter trailing EBITDA margins also continued to grow in line with our long-term objectives. G&A expenses were $10.8 million or 6.7% of revenue compared with $8.8 million or 6.2% of revenue in the prior year. Total G&A expenses were slightly elevated from our run rate over the second half of 2023 due primarily to the timing of IT spend in the first quarter. We continue to expect relatively stable full year G&A spend. Q1 adjusted earnings per share was $0.14 per share, up 27% compared to the prior year due to the higher adjusted EBITDA margins, offset in part by higher depreciation expense associated with the 10% increase in our fleet and higher right-of-use assets. With revenues up 13%, adjusted EBITDA up 22%, and adjusted EPS up 27%, we are encouraged by the continued scalability and growth in margins. Now, on to the balance sheet. Our capital allocation priorities are unchanged. We continue to maintain a strong flexible balance sheet to support our organic growth and commercial strategy. Our compliance leverage ended the year at 1.5 times debt to EBITDA -- ended the quarter my apologies, down from 1.6 times a year ago. This is up from 1.3 times at the end of 2023. The increase from year-end primarily reflects the impact of the payments made under our share-based compensation plans in the first quarter. I will now turn things back over to Rob Blackadar for some final comments. Rob?\n\nRob Blackadar: Thanks Rob. So before we open it up for questions, a few last comments. We are pleased with our continued strategy to further diversify the company's business across key markets in both the U.S. and Canada. Badger's overall performance continues to scale and grow with broad exposure in our resilient end markets. Badger's long-term growth prospects remain unchanged and we continue to believe Badger is uniquely positioned to capitalize on the significant opportunity for nondestructive excavation services across North America. Finally, I want to remind everyone that we have our virtual Annual Meeting of Shareholders today at noon Eastern Time, 10 a.m. Mountain time. To get more information, please visit our Investor Relations page at ir.badgerinc.com. So, with those comments, I'll turn it back over to the operator to open it up for Q&A. Operator?\n\nOperator: Thank you. At this time, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Yuri Lynk with Canaccord Genuity Inc. Your line is now open.\n\nYuri Lynk: Good morning Rob. Nice quarter. I think it could have been even better if Canada had performed like it did even last year. Can you talk a little bit more about the delays that you saw? And it doesn't sound like those projects are going to ramp up until the back half of the year. So, just wondering why you weren't able to put those trucks to work in other markets or maybe even move them into the U.S. and put them to work there?\n\nRob Blackadar: Yes. So, a couple of quick things. I'll talk a little about the first part of your question and then I'll talk a little bit about the ability to kind of redeploy the trucks and why we did what we did on our retirements. So, regarding the Canadian markets specifically, we had been on several large projects the last few years across Canada. Probably the most notable that most folks if they work in Canadian markets are aware of Trans Mountain pipeline and for our part of that work, it largely ended in Q4 for everything we had going on with that and that represented a significant amount of trucks. We had a few other large projects as well, but they all were sunsetting at the end of last year. We have bid and successfully bid on several large projects that we were anticipating being started by now for Q1. So, we really weren't expecting much of a hiccup at all and just continuation of keeping the trucks working and on projects. Those larger projects -- and we don't give out future projects or current projects we're on. We will -- we are -- from time-to-time, we'll talk about past projects, but for competitive reasons, and especially in Canada, we're not going to discuss the ones that we're bidding on, but most anyone can Google (NASDAQ: GOOGL ) or figure out what the large projects are coming up. They continue to be delayed. One of them was going to start at the end of Q4. It got delayed to the beginning of Q2 and now it's being delayed to end of Q3, beginning of Q4. The -- for us, our core business, our regular construction business and a lot of our utility business is unchanged, remains unchanged and our trucks are busy. The large projects, though absorbed on a relatively smaller number of these projects, a lot of our fleet. When these got delayed, we looked at it and said, we can either -- we had a few options. We can sit on the current trucks we have and just kind of wait for those large projects to start if they start at the end of Q3, beginning of Q4, we can identify trucks that we were going to retire in Q2, Q3, maybe the beginning of Q4, and maybe we could accelerate that. So, we made the decision in Q1 to accelerate those retirements and not carry them if we're not going to keep them busy. We don't make it a regular practice. We move our trucks all across Canada and all across the U.S., but we don't make it a regular practice to move trucks north and south of the border. Typically, we have what's called FET or Federal Excise Tax implications by moving trucks because we actually use these as they are purpose-built trucks, vocational trucks and because of that, we have a lot of duty and tax implications to move them north and south of the border. So, that's -- when we looked at the fleet and we said it feels like we're going to have some potential excess fleet until these large projects start. We identified some of the oldest units and we said, let's accelerate the retirement of those instead of waiting when we would normal course do it. That's the whole story behind that, Yuri. There's not a lot of additional color other than what I just laid out for you.\n\nYuri Lynk: Okay. No, that makes sense. And the Canadian outlook, I mean, I think the language in the MD&A changed a little bit. You're not talking about growth now in Canada. So, should we expect a kind of a similar quarter in Q2? And then maybe the ramp-up of those projects in Q3 and Q4, but Canada largely down in 2024?\n\nRob Blackadar: Yes. So, my perspective and visiting with our Canadian leaders across the country, they are sharing that the business, the backlog of their day-to-day business is continuing robust and we're expecting a normal course season. What's missing is some of these large projects and the volume. So, if looking at it from a year-over-year perspective, I think you're largely correct that we are going to see lift in Q2. We're going to see a lift in Q3 relative to Q1 because we saw that it's a seasonal business. The summer season is going to be rolling, but I would not be expecting any growth. And as we are looking at some of the projects, if they start in Q4, and again, these have been pushed twice now. But if they start in Q4, we believe we'll have the opportunity to get back to close to even on some opportunities, but it's not so robust that we think that we're going to have any kind of growth across Canada. And Rob, I don't know if you want to add anything on that.\n\nOperator: Thank you so much. Our next question comes from the line of Krista Friesen with CIBC. Your line is now open.\n\nKrista Friesen: Hi, thanks for taking my question. Just on the refurbishments, it looks like you continue to do them in Q1. Is that progressing kind of as planned in terms of sorting out all the issues with your suppliers and also just the cost to do the refurbishments as well?\n\nRob Blackadar: Yes, absolutely. So, we just had an update just the other day with some of the management team and the Board and shared the same, Krista, that we're pretty pleased that the eight that we have here are kind of the cleanup. If you remember, there's a little bit of a hangover. When we first launched, we put out a lot of our refurbishments out to multiple shops, and we realize there's a more efficient way to do it. These eight are coming from some of these multiple shops and getting cleaned up. We still have a few more but not many. And then the trucks that we're seeing coming out of our one focused shop, we're actually seeing the good cost and pricing that we were expecting. And as I think we had said in Q4, it was a little bit harder whenever we have disparate shops, and they're doing a one-off or one or two trucks at a clip on the cost to be as controlled as it is when we're funneling them all through one. We're satisfied with the one shop and their cost, but the cleanup on some of the ones that we just have received were just slightly higher. If you remember, we had originally said 125 to 150 range, and these were in that 160-ish range. But the shop that we have coalesced on, we're having the main focus of refurbishments on as well within the range that we've shared with investors.\n\nKrista Friesen: Okay, great. And then maybe just on Canada, the results this quarter, is that really just reflecting the delay of some of these large projects? Or are there may be some issues in pushing through increased pricing in Canada and executing on some of the sales strategy up here?\n\nRob Blackadar: Yes. So, certainly, we've had a pricing focus across the entire company. And it's our perspective that we don't believe that pricing is what's driving the volume and lack of volume there in Canada. The reason I feel pretty comfortable with that, Krista is our CPQ pricing engine actually is dynamic in nature. And so as the utilization or the business slows down in a certain branch, the pricing actually will decrease to make sure that we don't lose a deal to keep our utilization on a proper level. As utilization increases, obviously, the pricing will increase. And with that dynamic pricing model, we don't feel like pricing is what the driver is of the revenue decline. But certainly, we keep an eye on it. We're also just in the early stages of starting to track what we call like a lost deal log, and that concept is if you lose a deal, why are we losing? Are we losing to price, are we losing to availability, to service levels or something like that, even to a customer credit issue or something like that? And we haven't. As we're just starting that exercise, we haven't seen any kind of uptick regarding losing a bunch of deals on pricing. We're very mindful of that, though, because very quickly, you can start to lose deals on pricing if you don't keep an eyeball on it, but our Head of Canadian operations and our Head of Sales are -- they watch it like a hawk. Rob, do you want to add anything on that?\n\nRob Dawson: No, I don't think I have anything else to add on that. I mean, obviously, in the winter season when utilization is generally low. And then it was a little lower than anticipated in Q1. That's not the point in time when we're going to be pressing on price either. So, I would say that would just reinforce Rob's comments that we feel that the work we're receiving and the work we're getting is still representative of the full market available, and it's not just a Badger issue.\n\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of [Indiscernible] with Scotia Bank. Your line is now open.\n\nUnknown Analyst: Hi. This is [indiscernible], I'm calling in for Michael. I just wanted to ask, at your recent Investor Relations Day, you spoke about leveraging technology and click management, HR and marketing. I mean I would like you to provide an update on how those initiatives are progressing? And should we look at those initiatives as first time incremental cost before it's an incremental benefit? You know what I mean?\n\nRob Blackadar: Yes. Thanks. And yes, we understand Michael wasn't able to join, so thank you for asking the question. Yes, so we are progressing. If you remember, we said we're going to start toward the end of the year to start to introduce some leveraging data a lot more for some of the business decisions made within the business. And we are progressing along with that on time and on schedule. We've actually had a couple of key stakeholder meetings since Investor Day and structuring our kind of our data warehouse and our data technology and what some of the things are that we're going to start leveraging. So, we're pretty satisfied with that. We built that into our business plan for 2024. So, we feel comfortable there's not going to be a bunch of excessive costs tied to or any kind of major expense jumps tied to this data journey that we're starting. And we feel pretty comfortable with that. We also believe though as the business gets more ramped up leveraging data that it will actually take and drive more efficiency within the business. We see it today as it sits. We leverage today right now a bunch of data on our driving and our drivers behaviors behind the wheel. We leveraged something called [Indiscernible], which is an AI-based and obviously, we are not an AI company. So, I'm cautious leveraging the term AI. But in this case, it's an AI-based system that identifies our drivers' behaviors, and it helps coach and help our drivers drive more safely and more efficiently. And so far, we've actually -- we were chatting about this yesterday in a meeting. We're watching our safety and our statistics and our vehicle incidents and accidents decrease in a big way, and it's tied to leveraging that data. That obviously translates into lower cost regarding insurance, et cetera. And anything we can do to mitigate all the insurance costs that are increasing by showing that we actually are driving safer, more miles, and with less incidents. That's just an example, but we're going to be doing that on steroids. I don't know if you want to talk anything more about the data, Rob.\n\nRob Dawson: One example is just this quarter, we've implemented Fleet TO, as I think Rob has mentioned a number of times over the past while. And that's a fleet management system, and it's providing us with a significant amount of data already, and we've already identified opportunities in our maintenance and repair spend, both in planned maintenance and in other opportunities. We think these savings are going to be material. And it's all part of the plan that we have to increase the scalability of the business. That's just one example. As we roll out a lot of these data platforms and aggregate going forward.\n\nUnknown Analyst: Thank you. Maybe just a final question from my end. I mean could you also just speak on inflationary trends, labor with I mean whatever color you can provide?\n\nRob Blackadar: So, inflation wise, just like every other business in North America and probably even globally, Badger is not immune to inflation and some of the cost pressures we're getting from our own suppliers and vendors, et cetera. We've seen some inflationary pressures on our truck build program and from some of our suppliers because we've been steady state on our manufacturing, which we always felt was going to be the case, but we've become a more predictable customer and consumer for some of our suppliers. We are getting inflationary pressures and some cost increases, but I don't believe we're getting them at the same level as we see some of our competitors who are -- they're not buying necessarily at the same volume at the same steady state as Badger is. As far as labor inflationary pressures, just like with everyone else, our employees expect to be paid and we will pay a fair wage for our employees. Everyone, for the most part, depending on their situation gets an annual raise and that type of thing, but there's nothing out of the ordinary that we're seeing unless you want to add anything regarding inflationary pressures.\n\nRob Dawson: Yes, I would say we've disclosed our truck build costs, and you can see that they've really moderated over the last six quarters, I would say, maybe six to eight quarters. and we're back into a low single-digit inflationary environment, which was elevated into the double-digits two or three years ago. Same thing goes for our operating costs. You see our gross margin ticking up almost 200 points year-on-year at a time when we're seasonally low on revenue, and we do have a pretty good operating leverage/fixed cost environment with our current footprint of branches. So, not only is their low single-digit inflation, there's also a lot of very good work that's underway to partially offset the impact of that inflation. So, it's in no way -- it is fully within the plan that we laid out at our Investor Day that we would be -- continue to be exposed to this level of inflation. And I would say it's all following according to plan so far.\n\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ian Gillies with Stifel. Your line is now open.\n\nIan Gillies: In the U.S., the operating cadence seemed to do pretty well during Q1 given the plethora of weather issues. Can you talk a little bit about the operating cadence so far in Q2 and how you're thinking about it into Q3 and kind of what your customers may be saying?\n\nRob Blackadar: Repeat the question, the phone was scratching a little bit, if you don't mind, Ian?\n\nIan Gillies: No, apologies. I was just asking about what the operating cadence looks like moving into Q2 in the U.S. and Q3 after the business held up quite well in Q1?\n\nRob Blackadar: Yes. So, right now, for Q2, we have started off. We're pretty pleased with everything we've seen for the month of April. Again, we're on -- today is May 2nd, so early yet -- and early into the quarter. But so far, pretty pleased with what we saw at the beginning of the quarter. The biggest thing for us is our end markets, and we chat about this a little bit in the script, certainly in some of our MD&A and documents and our press release us kind of the resiliency of the markets and what we have and what we see as far as Badger's footprint and the ability to capture that. Right now, the markets are -- continue to be very strong in the U.S. and very, very pleased. And you have to remember, like a significant portion of our revenues are U.S.-based. And so we feel like we're in a really good position to capture that. A lot of our projects that we've been bidding and winning are starting to build into a nice kind of a backlog of business going into Q2, the end of Q2 and beginning of Q3. So, we're pleased in how it's set up. We're on almost every single major project across the United States, and we're being a lot more hawkish on that than we ever have been in addition to our local business, and we're pretty pleased with that. So, Rob, anything you want to add on that?\n\nRob Dawson: No, I have nothing to add. I think it's just good to point out that although Canada has been a little soft, it really does show the value of the diversification both in our geography and customer segment base that we talked about, that we do talk about. The value of that is really showing clear because the overall results are still in line with what we're planning on our longer-term objectives.\n\nIan Gillies: And if I could drill in on that a little bit, just because I'm curious. There's obviously a lot of capital being deployed towards semi fabs. The CapEx numbers, quite frankly, astounding. And I was wondering how you're trying to position Badger in and around some of that spending and how you think you can perhaps capture some of that market?\n\nRob Blackadar: Yes. So, very similar to the previous caller in the question is we're actually starting to leverage data like the company has never done before regarding our market share in each one of our largest markets. If you remember from both Investor Day and previous discussions we've had is we have a strategy of focusing on top 10, 12 markets and then looking also at our secondary markets, but really making sure that we are leveraging our market position and the ability to capture and maintain strong market share in each one of those key markets. The upside on that remains very strong. We're very enthusiastic about that. What we're doing, though, is we're now leveraging some data, and we're saying, what is our market share? What is our utilization and what are our returns by each one of those markets and where do we need to basically the concept, if you think about it from a basketball concept, Ian, feed the hot hand. And if there's markets, and we have several that are hot in the United States, we're feeding those hot hands. We're feeding the markets that are hitting. And the beauty of our model being vertically integrated. It's just so unique that we can control doing that. And what it does is it continues to allow us to hit these quarters of growth. And one thing Rob and I are very, very proud of our team and our teams in the field is they're not just growing revenue for the sake of growing revenue in the States, but they're also trying to drive additional margins as well. So, just very proud of that. And Rob, anything you want to add?\n\nIan Gillies: No, that's helpful. And if I could sneak in a third one, and it's a bit more theoretical in nature. The average build cost for a third-party hydrovac now is obviously up significantly from five years ago. And when you look across your markets in the U.S., do you think pricing is anywhere close to reflecting what it needs to be to generate a sufficient return there? Or do you think pricing just naturally has to go higher over the course of time to meet those hurdles?\n\nRob Blackadar: I think -- I don't see cost going -- ever getting to anytime soon getting back to either flat or going back down on any of this. So, absolutely, I feel like Badger has inflationary pressures, but I also feel that some of our competitors in the field, whether they be small mom-and-pop or like a local player with one, two, three hydrovacs, a regional player with maybe 10 to 20 hydrovacs or even, let's just say, a private equity type player that maybe has 100 hydrovacs. I don't see any one of those competitors not having inflationary pressures on all of their costs and especially the truck replacements. So, as people get into the business, if you were able to get into some trucks and you were able to pick them up for -- on the used market, $250,000 to $500,000, on the new market, you picked them up in the past at $400,000 to $600,000. Those same trucks expect the specked the exact same way are $750,000 and higher as brand new fresh off the showroom floor. Rob and I have actually been fortunate enough to talk to not only a few competitors, but several customers who have considered buying hydrovacs and the outlay cost of capital for that is tremendous right now, Ian. I just don't see that going backwards.\n\nSean Jack: Hey good morning guys. So, I know that you don't have a crystal ball, but just thinking about with how strong U.S. markets are looking right now and some of the past performance you've been having, is it possible that we see U.S. EBITDA margins hit or exceed the upper end of the range in the back half of the year that was set out in the Investor Day?\n\nRob Dawson: Hi Sean, it's Rob here. I would say it's very premature to be revising the guidance that we provided at Investor Day six or eight weeks ago. So, I do believe that there are opportunities, as I said at that meeting to be in the lower end of that range on a consolidated basis over the next few years, and we still see that opportunity for sure. And there might be some great quarters that pop us into that range. But I think we're going to be more focused on our trailing four-quarter margins, as I mentioned in our prepared script of this call and making sure that we have sustainable growth in those margins.\n\nSean Jack: Great. Okay, makes sense. And then I'm not sure if it was touched upon in an earlier question, but just to do with the Canadian trucks, wondering if there's any opportunities, obviously, you're looking to pull retirements forward and retire the fleet. Is there any opportunities to dispose of them? Is there any sources of demand that you guys could be able to find to look to get a bit of a return on those assets?\n\nRob Blackadar: So, yes, I'll cover that one. This is Rob Blackadar, Sean. Yes, so we actually dispose of all of our trucks a handful of ways. One of them is through public auctions that are non-reserve such as like a Ritchie Brothers or someone like that, Taylor Martin truck auctions. And other things we do is we will sell them on the private market if we feel we can get better on the private market than we can at the public auctions. And we have a whole team that is on the disposition side of it. We do not sell though -- we're very similar the way Badger views our fleet. We're very similar to the waste business and similar to the concrete cement business. And in both those industries, they don't sell used trucks as a whole truck on purpose because we don't want to be competing against our same trucks at a much lower cost basis because we believe we have a pretty strong truck. And so just like in the waste business or the cement business, they will take their tool off the back of a chassis. It could be a trash compactor, it could be a cement bowl, a cement mixer, They remove the component off the back. We did the same thing with our hydrovac. We removed the hydrovac componentry off the back. We will refurb it or repurpose it for used parts for other trucks within our fleet, and we sell just the chassis. Do I suspect at some future time, we want to sell our whole units, we can get some really strong pricing? Probably, but we would also potentially be competing against our own trucks that in our world, we just -- we've never had that program in place, and I don't see us changing that model today.\n\nOperator: Thank you. I am showing no further questions at this time. I would now like to turn it back to Rob Blackadar for closing remarks.\n\nRob Blackadar: Thank you, operator. And on behalf of all of us at Badger, thanks to our customers, our employees, suppliers, and shareholders for your ongoing support that drives Badger's success. Operator, you may now end the call. Thank you.\n\nOperator: Thank you for your participation in today's conference. This does conclude the program. You may now disconnect.", "source": {"uri": "in.investing.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Investing.com India"}, "authors": [{"uri": "earnings_call@in.investing.com", "name": "Earnings Call",

My name is Chuck, and I'll be your operator for today's call. [Operator Instructions] Please note this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Oksana Lukasheva. Please go ahead.\n\nOksana Lukasheva: Thank you, operator. Good morning, and thank you for joining us for our quarterly conference call. We will begin today's call with prepared remarks from Jack Roche, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Jeff Farber, our Chief Financial Officer. Available to answer your questions after our prepared remarks are Dick Lavey, President of Agency Markets; and Bryan Salvatore, President of Specialty Lines. Before I turn the call over to Jack, let me note that our earnings press release, financial supplement and a complete slide presentation for today's call are available in the Investors section of our website at www.hanover.com. After the presentation, we will answer questions in the Q&A session. Our prepared remarks and responses to your questions today, other than statements of historical fact, include forward-looking statements as defined under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.\n\nThese statements can relate to, among other things, our outlook and guidance for 2024 economic conditions and related effects, including economic and social inflation, potential recessionary impacts as well as other risks and uncertainties such as severe weather and catastrophes that could affect the company's performance and/or cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated. We caution you with respect to reliance with forward-looking statements, and in this respect, refer you to the forward-looking statements section in our press release, the presentation deck and our filings with the SEC. Today's discussion will also reference certain non-GAAP financial measures such as operating income and accident year loss and combined ratio, excluding catastrophes, among others.\n\nA reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the closest GAAP measure on historical basis can be found in the press release, the slide presentation or the financial supplement, which are posted on our website, as I mentioned earlier. With those comments, I will turn the call over to Jack.\n\nJohn Roche: Thank you, Oksana. Good morning, everyone, and thank you all for joining us. We opened 2024 with an excellent first quarter, delivering robust earnings and effectively executing on our margin recapture and CAT mitigation plans. Consistent with our focus over the past several quarters, we remain disciplined and discerning in our growth as we continue to reposition our Personal Lines business and to improve earnings resiliency in our overall mix in order to drive strong, sustainable returns for our shareholders over the long term. On today's call, I will share my perspective on our results, as well as my thoughts on why we believe our company is well positioned to continue to deliver improving financial performance in 2024.\n\nJeff will review our financial and operating results in more detail, and discuss our expectations for the second quarter and through year-end. Finally, we will open the line for questions. After-tax operating income for the quarter was $112 million, or $3.08 per diluted share, generating an operating return on equity of 15%. We improved our ex-CAT combined ratio by more than 2 points in the quarter demonstrating the effectiveness of our margin recapture initiatives. As expected, overall growth was subdued in the quarter at 2.3% as we continue to prioritize profitability improvement actions. We expect to accelerate the pace of growth throughout 2024, and we expect to generate net written premium growth in the mid-single-digit range for the full year.\n\nWe continue to effectively leverage our strong relationships with our best-in-class independent agent partners, helping them successfully navigate the dynamic marketplace and enabling us to build momentum in our target markets. Turning to our segment highlights. In Specialty, we delivered another quarter of exceptional profitability, generating a combined ratio of 87.6%. Consistent with the outlook we provided on our year-end call, Specialty growth picked up from the low watermark in the fourth quarter. The market is very healthy and remains robust with exciting opportunities across Multiple Lines including Excess and Surplus Lines, Marine, Specialty Industrial Property, Healthcare and Surety. Other areas such as Professional and Executive Lines remain competitive, but we are seeing opportunities and premium growth picking up as well.\n\nIn light of our robust profitability in this subsegment, we will continue to strike a prudent balance appropriately pricing risk while protecting our highly profitable book of business and pursuing quality new business opportunities. At the same time, our Specialty top line results still reflect the impact of underwriting actions on specific underperforming programs within our Specialty P&C subsegment. The impact of these actions is expected to decrease as the year progresses. We expect Specialty net written premium growth in the upper single digits for the full year of 2024 as we further capitalize on our broad diversification and favorable market dynamics in most of our segments. In Marine, we anticipate significant growth in 2024 as we capitalize on opportunities across our diverse portfolio of inland marine products and sectors.\n\nIn E&S, we expect the recent implementation of our new policy platform will enable us to capture even more market share beginning in the current quarter. In Professional and Executive Lines, we see potential for increased growth in areas such as management liability and selected areas of our Professional Liability business. We're confident we can capitalize on these opportunities as they present themselves throughout the year, and that we will drive meaningful top line growth and further diversification across our overall business mix. Looking at Core Commercial, we are pleased with the segment's strong performance as we continue to provide our agents with a highly attractive portfolio of capabilities. Our Core Commercial team maintained its focus on driving growth in Small Commercial while executing on margin improvement initiatives in Middle Market.\n\nSmall Commercial grew by approximately 8% in the quarter, fueled by the continued success of our highly intuitive TAP sales platform. Our national rollout of this quote-to-issue platform for bot business is now complete. With that, we are actively working on adding the workers' compensation line of business to the platform, which will support our new business growth efforts in that area. In addition, we are expanding the use of APIs to further enhance our TAP sales reach by efficiently connecting to additional sources of business and adding targeted products to our specialized offerings. In Middle Market, we continue to achieve better and more consistent earnings performance by aggressively nonrenewing bottom decile property business. We're also adjusting our new business appetite to reflect the changing environment, and ensuring that our pursuits are focused on high-quality accounts in targeted sectors and geographies.\n\nAdditionally, we are making considerable progress against our IoT sensor enrollment program. While the program is targeted at most of our Property Lines, Middle Market remains in the epicenter of these actions given the higher limits profile. Across all of our business lines, we've deployed over 10,000 water and temperature sensors. That program has already resulted in numerous instances of loss prevention and mitigation. We believe we have achieved scale, meaning that operationally, we have enough sensors deployed where we can collect data and recognize trends, such as identifying geographic territories with higher risk profiles, several types of system failures or trends across certain industry sectors. We believe this data will enable us to work even more effectively with our policyholders, providing guidance on how best to build resiliency.\n\nOverall, the Commercial P&C market remains rational, and continues to support needed price increases amid recent property loss trends and emerging industry concerns about casualty. For example, new business pricing in Small Commercial continues to accelerate and outpace loss trends. In what has become an increasingly dynamic loss trend environment, we're often asked about our position relative to the social inflation challenges affecting the P&C industry. As a member of the American Property Casualty Insurance Association and other trade associations, we are actively engaged in promoting awareness and reforms to stem the cost of legal system abuse and in advocating for change. In addition, we believe our current liability profile will help us effectively navigate current social inflation trends.\n\nOn a relative basis, we have a low policy limit profile with over 93% of our liability policy limits at or below $1 million. We have secured and are maintaining low per-risk reinsurance retention, which attaches at $2.5 million, and we have avoided areas that attract a higher level of liability severity and are increasingly challenging to price adequately such as public D&O insurance and stand-alone excess umbrella policies. Over the last several years, we've also taken steps to lower our risk exposure in large metropolitan areas and in industries that are more susceptible to social inflation, reducing umbrella limits in certain lines in highly litigious jurisdictions and executing rate increases to stay on top of trend assumptions. We have approached this issue with a thoughtful and intentional strategy that we believe enables us to effectively manage the current liability environment.\n\nTurning to Personal Lines. The business continues to demonstrate improved profitability and is performing largely on track relative to our expectations. Our loss ratio in both Auto and Home decreased compared with the first quarter of last year, in line with our assumptions. Personal Lines renewal price change was a robust 22.8% in the quarter. What's more? All targeted new business is subject to product changes, including an increase in all peril deductibles and the addition of wind and hail deductibles in certain geographies. These changes also are being rolled out with the renewals in targeted states. In addition, we continued to address geographic micro concentrations in the Midwest. As a result of our intense focus on profit improvement, as expected, net written premium growth in Personal Lines was flat year-over-year in the first quarter.\n\nWe reduced our exposure in the Midwest in a deliberate and controlled manner during the quarter, resulting in a 4% decline in premiums in this region and an approximate 8% decline in policies in force. Having the flexibility and the willingness to shed premiums to reposition our book will lead to improved profit margins in a higher, more resilient profit pool in the future. To that point, excluding Midwestern states, we have delivered growth of 4% with PIF down only 2% year-over-year. Primarily driven by lower new business, while retention remained relatively stable at over 84%. This said, in select geographies, we are already pivoting to a more aggressive new business stance where we have hit our profitability milestones on a written basis and where we are already comfortable with diversification positioning.\n\nOverall, the Personal Lines market remains robust. We expect premium growth to accelerate from this point forward and pricing to remain firm in 2024. In the Midwest, we are seeing others follow our lead, implementing higher deductibles and introducing other product changes to offset loss trends. Our Personal Line's account orientation is unique in the independent agency channel, with about 88% of our business representing a whole account. In our view, that orientation creates a preferred customer base that is both more protection minded and far less price elastic which we believe will position us for continued success. As we work to institute increased pricing deductibles and to adjust terms and conditions, our strong independent agency relationships are once again proving to be critical.\n\nJust a few weeks ago, we met with over 120 of our largest, most successful agents at our Annual President's Club Conference. We held a number of executive meetings focused on how we can best support our agents in the current dynamic market environment and grow our business together. We believe our independent partner agents fully recognize the critical role they play in our efforts to advance customer adoption of risk prevention and mitigation tools as well as in garnering customer support for the needed pricing increases we are implementing. We walked away from this annual event with more confidence than ever in the strength of our distribution platform and the commitment of our agent partners. In summary, our excellent performance in Q1 underscores the strength, diversification and resilience of our business.\n\nWe already have begun to see the positive effects of our underwriting actions, catastrophe management initiatives and other proactive steps to enhance profitability across our businesses. We look forward through year-end and beyond with a tremendous sense of optimism. Confident in our ability to deliver increasingly stronger results to execute on our strategic priorities and to deliver value for our shareholders, agent partners and customers. With that, I'll turn the call over to Jeff.\n\nJeff Farber: Thank you, Jack, and good morning, everyone. I'll begin with an overview of our first quarter results, discuss our segment financial highlights and investment performance and then mention our 2024 outlook. We are very pleased with our strong start for the year, posting a first quarter combined ratio of 95.5%. We delivered a combined ratio, excluding catastrophes, of 89.5%, a 2.2 point improvement over the prior year quarter. Our current accident year loss ratio, excluding catastrophes, improved 1.9 points to 59.3% reflecting the continued earning-in of price increases. Our results were highlighted by a year-over-year reduction in the underlying loss ratio in Personal Lines and Specialty. Strong and steady margins in Core Commercial also contributed to the excellent performance.\n\nThe continued improvement in profitability validates the effectiveness of our margin recapture plan, and gives us confidence that we are on the right path to deliver on our long-term ROE target of 14% or higher. At 30.9%, our first quarter expense ratio was slightly above our full year target of 30.7%, primarily due to the timing of certain expenses. Relative to the first quarter of last year, the expense ratio is higher primarily driven by changes in variable compensation accruals between the two periods as well as increased investments in our Specialty business this year, consistent with our growth and market share gain strategy. We remain on track to deliver a full year expense ratio of 30.7% in 2024. Catastrophe activity was within our CAT assumption for the quarter, accounting for 6% of net earned premium.\n\nNortheast floods in January and hail events in February and March were the main contributors to CAT losses. Ex-CAT prior year development was approximately $10 million favorable in the quarter driven by overall favorability in Core Commercial and Specialty. Each of the main lines of business in our Core segment developed favorably. Personal Lines prior year development was immaterial overall. Favorable development in Auto was offset by some unfavorable development in Home and Other. As we noted in our year-end call, the industry is experiencing elevated auto-related umbrella losses, and we prudently increased our recent prior year loss expectations in response. Overall, a combination of reserving prudence and favorable liability mix characteristics in Commercial Lines continues to serve us well.\n\nNow I'll review underlying segment results beginning with Specialty. Our Specialty book continued its track record of profitability in the quarter, delivering an ex-CAT combined ratio of 85.4%, 2.4 points better than the prior year quarter. The underlying loss ratio of 48.7% marked an improvement of 4.8 points over the prior year quarter, primarily from lower-than-expected losses in our Specialty Property business. Our longer-term loss expectation for Specialty remains in the low 50s. From a top line perspective, we remain on track to accelerate Specialty growth to the upper single digits for the full 2024 year. Our Core Commercial segment delivered an ex-CAT combined ratio of 90.0% in the first quarter. a 2.1 point improvement year-over-year.\n\nThe Core Commercial current accident year loss ratio, excluding catastrophes, was relatively in line with our expectations and the prior year quarter at 58.5%. At the same time, we are intently watching for liability trends, including social inflation pressures in Casualty Lines. Trends in our book of business so far remains stable and very manageable. Our litigated frequency per exposure has returned to normal levels in 2022 and '23 after unusually low frequency of litigation in 2020 and '21. Overall, general liability loss frequency continues to decline, while the mix of claims is shifting to more complex claims, contributing to an increased loss severity. Commercial auto liability frequency seems to have settled at a new normal somewhat below the pre-pandemic levels, while severity is elevated but manageable.\n\nWorkers' compensation remains stable, with a slight increase in indemnity while medical inflation remains within our expectations. Of course, we continue to monitor trends closely. We are managing our liability profile very carefully, as Jack discussed. Importantly, we are maintaining a very disciplined approach to our prudent liability loss picks and prior year estimations, taking small adjustments if and when needed, and promptly incorporating our updated view of trends into pricing and terms and conditions. We established this approach back in 2016 when we materially added to our reserve position as a new leadership team, while at the same time, initiating a shift in liability mix. We also adhered to thoughtful prudence during low-frequency COVID periods.\n\nWe continue to feel confident in our reserve position. Core Commercial Lines net written premiums grew 3% in the first quarter. Rates continue to hold firm in both property and most liability lines, while retention ticked down 1.7 points for the quarter due to targeted nonrenewals in middle market, in-keeping with our positive strategic decision to sacrifice some top line growth in exchange for improved margin. Now moving on to Personal Lines. This segment delivered an ex-CAT combined ratio of 91.1%, an improvement of 5.1 points over the first quarter of 2023. The Personal Lines current accident year loss ratio, excluding catastrophes, improved 2.4 points to 65.6%, with the accelerating benefit of prior and current rate increases earning-in, coupled with moderating collision and property loss costs, we expect meaningful improvement in our ex-CAT loss ratio to continue throughout 2024.\n\nAuto current accident year loss ratio, excluding catastrophes of 73.6% in the first quarter improved 2.2 points year-over-year, driven by the benefit of earned pricing increases. Additionally, our data indicates that collision loss severity is easing, in particular for used car prices. We are also experiencing some deceleration in the cost of parts as well as lower rental costs due to shorter repair cycle times. At the same time, we remain cautious about liability coverages in auto and therefore, reflected an elevated loss expectation in current accident year picks in bodily injury. Similar to Commercial Auto, bodily injury frequency seems to have settled at a level below pre-COVID, while severity is elevated due to a higher occurrence of catastrophic claims, including pedestrian, bicycle and motorcycle hits and crashes at high speeds.\n\nHowever, as the benefit of higher rate continues to earn-in and the property loss trends ease, we expect significant loss ratio improvement for Auto throughout 2024. Home and Other current accident year loss ratio, excluding catastrophes, improved 2.4 points to 54.5%, driven by rate and exposure adjustments earning in. Also within Home and Other, we prudently increased loss ratio expectation for umbrella coverage in response to prior year development and an increase in catastrophic auto accidents in the industry. Of course, umbrella rates are up meaningfully compared to historical levels and the market is reacting accordingly. Both Auto and Home Lines of business achieved strong pricing increases in the first quarter. Auto price was up 18.2%, and we expect it to continue to stay solid throughout the year.\n\nHome price was up 30.2% on average in the first quarter including 19.6 points of rate and 10.5 points of exposure increases. We expect Personal Lines pricing to remain robust for the remainder of the year. However, Home exposures will tick down starting in the second quarter as insurance to value inflation adjustments return to more normal levels. Additionally, all peril and wind and hail deductibles start being applied to the majority of our target renewals in April, effectively lowering our risk on every property where such deductibles are applied. Equally important, earned prices will continue to accelerate for some time, increasing underwriting margins. Looking ahead, we expect the benefit of strong earned Personal Lines pricing and more stable property loss trend to drive a meaningfully improved Personal Lines current accident year ex-CAT loss ratio throughout 2024.\n\nFurthermore, we anticipate some additional improvements as the result of increased home inspections and new business rigor implemented in 2023 in homeowners. We expect significant margin improvement in Auto and Home to pace a return to target profitability by the end of this year on a written basis and in 2025 on an earned basis. Moving on to investment performance. Net investment income increased $11 million or about 14% to $89.7 million in the first quarter 2024, primarily driven by strong fixed income results from higher bond yields. The current rate environment should continue to provide an accumulating benefit to net investment income in 2024 and subsequent years. Historically, much of our investment portfolio was internally managed. After an in-depth and thoughtful analysis, we have made the decision to transfer management of the investment-grade fixed maturity portion of our investment assets to an external manager.\n\nWe believe the switch to an outsourced model will allow us to benefit from the expansive capabilities of a large-scale asset manager, including their market depth and knowledge among others. Longer term, we hope that the external asset manager will help us to further optimize our investment portfolio's contribution to The Hanover's bottom line. We expect to complete this transition before the end of the second quarter. Moving on to book value and capital position. Strong earnings in the first quarter were partially offset by an increase in the fixed income portfolio's unrealized loss position, marking a 1.9% sequential increase in GAAP book value per share to $70.22. Statutory surplus increased by about 5% to $2.8 billion. In this dynamic environment, we remain focused on ensuring we maintain ample financial flexibility to support our business.\n\nAlthough we refrained from making any share repurchases this quarter, returning capital to shareholders through regular quarterly dividends and share buybacks remain important elements of our long-term capital allocation strategy. For the second quarter of 2024 our planned CAT load is 8.5%. As we mentioned in February, we have intended to pick higher on the probability curve in establishing our full year 2024 CAT load of 7%, and that it should decline for 2025. Our CAT guidance does not yet reflect the ultimate impact of substantial terms and conditions changes in Personal Lines that are currently underway. In summary, we are off to a strong start in 2024. We are executing successfully on our margin recapture initiatives and disciplined growth strategies concentrated in our most profitable lines of business.\n\nOur financial and operational performance is underpinned by targeted underwriting, strong pricing and a commitment to provide the products and services our agent partners and customers value most. We will continue to focus on creating long-term growth and superior returns for our shareholders. With that, we will now open the line for questions.

All participants will be in a listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] After today's presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions [Operator Instructions]. Please note this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Kelly Harvey, Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nKelly Harvey: Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us to discuss our first quarter 2024 results. The release and accompanying presentation was filed with the SEC and is posted on our website at stoneridge.com in the Investors Section under Presentations and Events. Joining me on today's call are Jim Zizelman, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Matt Horvath, our Chief Financial Officer. During today's call, we will be referring to certain non-GAAP financial measures. Please see the appendix for a reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures. In addition, I need to inform you that certain statements today may be forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements include statements that are not historical in nature and include information concerning our future results or plans.\n\nAlthough, we believe such statements are based upon reasonable assumptions, you should understand that these statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, and actual results may differ materially. Additional information about such factors and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ may be found in our 10-Q, which was filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission yesterday under the heading forward-looking Statements. After Jim and Matt have finished their formal remarks, we will then open up the call to questions. And with that, I will hand it over to Jim.\n\nJames Zizelman: Thank you, and good morning, everyone. Beginning on Page 3. Our first quarter financial performance was driven by continued strong topline growth in Electronics and progression across each of our key priorities for 2024. Our efforts to reduce material costs and improve our operating efficiency contributed to a 170 basis point improvement in gross margin, a 160 basis point improvement in operating margin and a 120 basis point improvement to EBITDA margin over the first quarter of last year. Additionally, we remain focused on cash performance and improvement in our leverage ratio. During the quarter, we generated $9.1 million of operating cash, an improvement of $18.3 million compared to the first quarter of last year.\n\nThis is due in part to our continued efforts to reduce our inventory balance, which declined by $7.9 million. As a result, our leverage ratio improved by approximately a quarter of a turn relative to the end of 2023. Despite the significant momentum we have and the fundamentals of the business, we must continue to focus on mitigating some of the historical execution issues that resulted in $2 million of incremental warranty-related costs this quarter. Through recent actions taken to centralize and redesign product line and program management organizations, as well as our global engineering organization, we are specifically focused on improving built-in quality, reducing material costs and improving manufacturing efficiency to drive profitability.\n\nThere is no question. We are seeing the positive impact of these structural changes and expect the momentum from these changes to drive improved profitability as we continue to grow. In fact, as a result of the improvement, we expect due to these changes, despite some of the challenges in the first quarter, we are maintaining our full-year 2024 guidance. Matt will provide further detail on our first quarter performance and our full-year guidance later in the call. While we continue to improve our existing programs, we remain focused on flawless execution of the program launches that will drive strong growth going forward. Our next MirrorEye OEM programs launched with Volvo in Europe and with Peterbilt in North America later this year, followed by two additional programs in North America in the first quarter of next year.\n\nLast week, Peterbilt announced the introduction of its new Digital Vision System-Mirrors as an option on both the Model 579 and Model 567 trucks, which helped improve driver safety and improve fuel economy by up to 1.5%. We will continue to work with all of our OEM customers, their dealer networks and the fleets to drive MirrorEye adoption. We are seeing good momentum across our MirrorEye end markets and applications and expect continued growth as we launch new OEM programs, increased take rates for existing OEM programs and continue to expand our fleet activities with both new and existing customers. Furthermore, we expect our next-generation tachograph, the Smart 2 to provide significant growth in both OEM and aftermarket applications over the next several years based on the requirements of the EU Mobility Package standard.\n\nI will provide more details of these regulation requirements and our expectations for our Smart 2 tachograph program later in the call. Page 4 summarizes our key financial metrics for the first quarter of this year compared to the first quarter of 2023. First quarter sales growth of 3% was driven by strong topline growth in our Electronics segment due in part to the ramp-up of the recently launched Smart 2 tachograph program in Europe. This was offset by lower sales in the North American passenger vehicle end market, primarily due to the slowing demand for electric vehicles as well as some end-of-life programs which we expected. Our growth of 3% compares to an approximately flat weighted average end market over the same time. We expect to continue to outperform our underlying end markets driven by new launches and the continued ramp-up of recently launched programs.\n\nDriven by continued progression on key company initiatives, margins continued to expand in the first quarter compared to last year. Material cost improvement actions and our focus on manufacturing efficiency contributed to the 170 basis point improvement in gross margin over the first quarter of last year. We will continue to implement material cost improvement opportunities to further enhance the impact of actions already taken. Operating margin improved by 160 basis points over the first quarter of last year due to our continued focus on a lean, efficient operating structure, including the centralization of certain functions to create more streamlined processes and reduced operating costs. Earlier this week, we continue to take action to improve our engineering organization by rebalancing our footprint to improve our capacity and our capabilities and reduce our total costs.\n\nFinally, EBITDA margin improved by 120 basis points compared to the first quarter of last year. This was despite non-operating foreign currency and equity interest expenses that unfavorably impacted the current quarter by approximately $2.3 million. Excluding the incremental warranty and non-operating expenses in the quarter, EBITDA would have been approximately $10.9 million or 4.6% of revenue. And Matt will provide additional details on our segment level performance later in the call. Turning to Page 5. This morning, I would like to provide an update on our Smart 2 tachograph program that continues to ramp up in Europe on both OEM and aftermarket applications. As discussed on prior calls, the Smart 2 tachograph is our next-generation tachograph that provides incremental capabilities to conform with the EU Mobility Package standards.\n\nThe mobility package is a collection of European laws and regulations for the transport sector and then contains new rules to improve social conditions for drivers, increased road safety and provide equal access to European markets. As such, the regulation requires the adoption of the second-generation tachograph, Smart 2, on various vehicle types over the next several years. Beginning in mid-August of last year, the second-generation smart tachograph was required to be on all newly registered vehicles over 3.5 tons, which comprises our existing OEM market. In addition, before the end of 2024, all international transport vehicles with existing analog or 1B digital tachographs are required to retrofit their vehicles to this new technology, which is the basis for what drives our aftermarket opportunity this year.\n\nAs a result of these requirements, the incremental content on next-generation product and our current estimates of addressable market, we are estimating Smart 2 tachograph revenue to be approximately $60 million in 2024 for both OEM and aftermarket applications. As this product is based on both OEM orders and aftermarket customer adoption, the timing of the revenue contribution is more variable than what is typical for purely OEM programs. As a result, we saw a slower ramp-up in aftermarket sales in the first quarter as end users hoped for a pushout of the regulatory requirements or are simply delaying adoption until closer to the deadline. Recently, the European Commission, which governs the adoption of the mobility package reiterated the existing deadlines and requirements.\n\nAs such, we are expecting an uptick in aftermarket sales going forward as the addressable market this year has not changed and the regulations remain as previously communicated. This should provide both revenue growth and accretive margin benefit for the remainder of the year as our aftermarket channel continues to ramp up. Looking beyond 2024, there are incremental regulations requiring adoption on additional vehicles in Europe, which is expected to drive continued growth for the next few years. These incremental requirements come online in 2025 and 2026 and expand the requirements to more vehicles, including vehicles equipped with first-generation tachographs and smaller vehicles between 2.5 and 3.5 tons that are involved in international transport.\n\nOverall, the mobility package and the new Smart 2 tachograph legislation represent a significant step forward for the transportation industry in Europe. By increasing road safety, improving working conditions and ensuring fair competition, the EU is creating a more sustainable and efficient transport sector for the future, and Stoneridge is very excited to be part of it. Based on the regulatory requirements and the competitive landscape for this product, we expect significant growth over the next several years with at least a 30% market share and $100 million in peak annual revenue. This program is yet another example of our strong portfolio of technologies and vehicle systems aligned with global industry megatrends. As part of our long-term strategy, we remain focused on vehicle intelligence and connectivity as we expand our content per vehicle to drive continued long-term growth.\n\nTurning to Page 6. I'd like to take this opportunity to mention that I'm extremely proud that we recently released our inaugural Sustainability Report, detailing our latest efforts and our ongoing commitment to environmental, social and governance initiatives. Our commitment to sustainability and social responsibility is a core component of our business strategy. This begins with our well-positioned technology-forward product portfolio aligned with improving vehicle safety and efficiency as well as reducing greenhouse gas emissions. At Stoneridge, we strive for continual improvements in our operations that deliver a lasting impact on the environment and our society, benefiting our employees, our customers and the communities that we serve. Through our continued efforts, we have made meaningful progress towards our sustainability goals, including reducing our Scope 1 and Scope 2 greenhouse gas emissions by 18.6%, reducing our absolute water withdrawal by 5.8%, creating a safe workspace environment and minimizing our environmental footprint in our manufacturing facilities over time.\n\nOur Sustainability Report marks a significant step in Stoneridge's sustainability journey and reflects our dedication to transparency, accountability and continuous improvement. I would like to express my gratitude to the Stoneridge team for their efforts and contributions in this space and on publishing such a meaningful report. I encourage all of you to visit our sustainability website if you have not done so already. Turning to Page 7. We remain committed to the 2024 goals I outlined on our fourth quarter call. First, we are focused on driving continued growth and market outperformance. As discussed earlier on the call, we are maintaining our 2024 revenue guidance midpoint of $1 billion, which is expected to outperform our weighted average underlying end markets by 8 percentage points.\n\nAs discussed earlier on the call, we outperformed our weighted average OEM end markets in the first quarter and expect this to continue driven primarily by Stoneridge specific growth drivers, including new programs, incremental content and the expansion of our existing opportunities. Second, we are focused on gross margin expansion through material cost improvement in an enterprise-wide operational excellence. We remain keenly focused on these initiatives as we achieved gross margin expansion of 170 basis points over the first quarter of 2023. As we continue to focus on quality-related costs and recognize the run rate benefits of these material costs and operational actions, we expect continued gross margin expansion. Third, we are focused on leveraging our global footprint to maximize our capabilities and output.\n\nBased on the actions taken last year to centralize many of our global functions and drive synergies between our business units from both a cost and efficiency perspective, we achieved 160 basis points of operating margin expansion in the first quarter, resulting in a 120 basis point improvement in EBITDA margin compared to the prior year. We continue to evaluate and optimize our organizational structure as shown by our recent actions taken in our engineering organization to rebalance our global footprint. Fourth, we are focused on efficient cash generation through effective inventory management. Through our focused efforts on reducing inventory to improve working capital and generate more cash, we reduced our inventory balance by $7.9 million, which translates to approximately an 8% improvement in inventory turns during the quarter.\n\nWe remain focused on inventory reduction and cash performance. Finally, we are focused on efficient capital deployment, while maintaining an appropriate capital structure. This includes prioritizing our organic investment opportunities with a focus on return on engineering and investing in technology to develop new products for customers that will facilitate future growth. In 2024, we are targeting approximately $40 million of capital focused primarily on supporting organic growth initiatives. We remain on track to meet both our organic growth and capital expenditure targets for 2024. As evidenced by our progress made so far this year, this team is focused on executing against our priorities to drive strong growth, continued margin improvement and an improved balance sheet.\n\nWe continue to see the benefits of the actions we took in 2023, and we'll continue to take actions aligned with our key priorities to drive performance. With that, I'll turn it over to Matt to discuss our financial results in more detail. Matt?\n\nMatthew Horvath: Thank you, Jim. Turning to Page 9. Sales in the first quarter were $239.2 million, an increase of 3% relative to the first quarter of 2023. Adjusted operating income was $300,000, which resulted in a 160 basis point improvement in operating margin relative to the first quarter of last year. As Jim discussed earlier in the call, we are maintaining our full-year 2024 guidance. Our full-year sales guidance midpoint of $1 billion is expected to outpace our weighted average OEM end markets by over 8 percentage points. We expect to outperform our end markets driven by the continued ramp-up of recently launched programs, including both the OEM and aftermarket applications of MirrorEye and the Smart 2 tachograph. We expect an improvement in our material costs for the remainder of the year will offset the incremental warranty costs we incurred in the first quarter.\n\nAs such, we are maintaining our full-year gross margin expectations with a gross margin midpoint of 22.4%, which implies a 140 basis point expansion versus the prior year. Based on our efforts to drive a more efficient global operating structure, we expect that operating performance will remain within our previously provided range, but improved slightly relative to our prior expectations. As such, we are maintaining our full-year operating margin expectations with an operating margin midpoint of 3%, which implies a 130 basis point expansion versus last year. Similarly, we expect slightly improved operating performance to offset the non-operating foreign currency and equity interest expenses incurred in the first quarter. As a result, we are also maintaining our expectations for full-year EBITDA and EPS.\n\nOur expectation of approximately $67 million of EBITDA at the midpoint of our guidance range results in a 170 basis point improvement and 39% growth in EBITDA over 2023. We expect the revenue and EBITDA cadence for the year to be relatively consistent with previous expectations. However, we now expect the second quarter performance will be slightly better than previously expected to approximately breakeven EPS. Due to expanding MirrorEye sales in the second half of the year, primarily driven by new program launches and the continued ramp-up of the Smart 2 tachograph, we continue to expect revenue to be back half weighted. We expect slight growth from the first to the second quarter and relatively larger growth between the second and third quarter, aligned with these key program launches.\n\nAligned with our revenue cadence for the year, we expect EBITDA to be more back half weighted as well. Based on the actions we have taken to improve our cost structure and our operating performance, we expect to continue to significantly outperform our underlying end markets and drive continued earnings expansion as the year progresses. Turning to Page 10. During the quarter, we were impacted by two warranty issues that accounted for approximately $2 million of incremental costs. Although, these issues are historical in nature, and we expect they have been contained through either reengineering or resourcing material, these incremental costs highlight the importance of our focus on execution to drive operational excellence and built-in quality going forward.\n\nWe have taken actions that we expect to improve the operating structure and processes that have led to these issues historically, which resulted in the incremental warranty costs during the quarter. The quarter was also unfavorably impacted by approximately $2 million related to the non-operating impact that foreign currency had on intercompany balances and approximately $300,000 related to our minority interest in Autotech Ventures. Excluding the incremental warranty and non-operating expenses in the quarter, EBITDA would have been approximately $10.9 million or 4.6% of revenue. The first quarter was also impacted by unfavorable sales volume and product mix, primarily related to the reduced demand for electric vehicles compared to prior expectations and the retiming of Smart 2 tachograph aftermarket sales, as Jim discussed previously.\n\nHowever, these headwinds were generally offset by material cost improvement actions completed in the first quarter, primarily related to supplier negotiations and pricing and reduced operating expenses as a result of the actions taken in 2023 to centralize functions and reduce costs. In addition, EPS was impacted by slightly higher tax expense during the quarter, primarily due to our geographical mix of earnings. Despite the headwinds we faced in the first quarter, we continued to improve the foundation of the business and take actions that will drive run rate performance improvement going forward, helping us achieve our previously provided guidance. Page 11 summarizes our key financial metrics specific to Control Devices. Control Devices first quarter sales declined by approximately $8.7 million versus the first quarter of 2023, primarily related to the expected wind down of end-of-life programs and slower demand for electric vehicle platforms.\n\nThis was slightly offset by higher sales in China. First quarter operating margin of 2.8% increased by 120 basis points compared to the first quarter of 2023, primarily as a result of favorable product mix and improvements in material and logistics costs. We continue to expect relatively flat end market performance and slow growth in actuation programs due to the continued slow ramp-up of electric vehicle platforms. As a result, we continue to expect Control Devices full-year sales to slightly decline this year relative to 2023. That said, and as demonstrated in the first quarter, we have identified several opportunities to reduce material costs through redesigns or supply chain strategies to help improve gross margin going forward and offset the slight decline in sales, resulting in a stable margin profile.\n\nFinally, as discussed on previous earnings calls, we remain focused on drivetrain agnostic technologies to drive new business awards as the market continues to evolve. We continue to focus on operational excellence and enterprise-wide cost reduction, including material cost reduction plans to drive margin improvement going forward. Page 12 summarizes our key financial metrics specific to Electronics. Electronics first quarter sales increased by $15.6 million or 11.1% compared to the first quarter of 2023. Sales growth was driven primarily by higher sales in both the European and North American commercial vehicle end markets, due in part to the ramp-up of the Smart 2 tachograph programs in Europe. We expect continued strong sales growth in 2024, driven by new program launches and the ramp-up of recently launched programs.\n\nOur next MirrorEye OEM programs launched with Volvo in Europe and with Peterbilt in North America later this year. Similarly, we expect significant growth related to the Smart 2 tachograph as regulatory requirements force adoption, both in OEM applications as well as in the aftermarket. First quarter operating margin expanded by approximately 330 basis points compared to the first quarter of the prior year, primarily due to contribution on incremental revenue and material cost improvement, partially offset by higher overhead costs. More specifically, $1.5 million of the $2 million of total incremental warranty-related costs impacted Electronics during the quarter. Looking forward, we expect continued margin expansion as we focus on improving our manufacturing performance and focus on quality-driven processes and efficient execution of new program launches as well as the continued ramp-up of existing programs.\n\nElectronics remains well positioned to take advantage of significant future growth and margin expansion as a result of a strong product portfolio, a substantial and growing backlog of awarded programs, continued improvement in material cost and cost structure and organizational optimization. Page 13 summarizes our key financial metrics, specific to Stoneridge Brazil. Stoneridge Brazil's first quarter sales totaled approximately $12.2 million, a decrease of $2 million relative to the first quarter of last year. This decrease was primarily as a result of two onetime revenue opportunities in the local OEM market totaling approximately $2.1 million in 2023 that were not expected to recur this year. First quarter operating profit declined by approximately $1.1 million relative to the first quarter of 2023, primarily driven by reduced fixed cost leverage on decreased sales.\n\nThis decrease was partially offset by lower material costs as a result of favorable sales mix. We expect relatively stable revenue and operating margin in 2024 as we continue to shift our portfolio in Brazil to more closely align with our global growth initiatives and further expand our local OEM programs to support our global customers. Brazil has become a critical engineering center as we continue to align our global engineering capabilities and footprint. We will continue to utilize our global footprint to cost-effectively support our global business. Turning to Page 14. Net debt to trailing 12-month EBITDA, as calculated for compliance purposes, improved by quarter of a turn, resulting in a leverage ratio of approximately 2.86x. During the quarter, we generated $9.1 million of operating cash, an improvement of $18.3 million compared to the first quarter of last year.\n\nThis is due in part to our continued efforts to reduce our inventory balance, which declined by $7.9 million in the quarter. We are focused on reducing net working capital to improve cash performance and reduce net debt and related interest expense. Based on our 2024 guidance and net working capital initiatives, we expect a compliance leverage ratio between 2x and 2.5x by the end of the year as both our earnings and inventory balance are expected to continue to improve. We are focused on maximizing cash performance to drive value to shareholders. Moving to Slide 15. In summary, our first quarter performance was driven by strong topline growth and progression across each of our key priorities for 2024. Our strategy sets us up for strong short-term and long-term performance through Stoneridge-specific growth drivers, including new programs, incremental content and expansion of our existing opportunities.\n\nWe will continue to focus on enterprise-wide cost improvement and operational execution to drive strong contribution margin and focus on inventory reduction to improve our cash position and continue to reduce our leverage profile. Stoneridge remains well positioned to outpace our underlying end market growth and drive significant earnings expansion going forward. As always, driving shareholder value is at the forefront of all of Stoneridge's strategic initiatives. With that, I will open up the call for questions.", "source": {"uri": "ca.finance.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo!

Welcome to the Cactus Q1 2024 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speaker's presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Alan Boyd, Director of Corporate Development and Investor Relations.\n\nAlan Boyd: Thank you, and good morning. We appreciate you joining us on today's call. Our speakers will be Scott Bender, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Al Keifer, our Interim Chief Financial Officer. Also joining us today are Joel Bender, President; Steven Bender, Chief Operating Officer; Steve Tadlock, CEO of FlexSteel; and Will Marsh, our General Counsel. Please note that any comments we make on today's call regarding projections or expectations for future events are forward-looking statements covered by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act. Forward-looking statements are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, many of which are beyond our control. These risks and uncertainties can cause actual results to differ materially from our current expectations.\n\nWe advise listeners to review our earnings release and the risk factors discussed in our filings with the SEC. Any forward-looking statements we make today are only as of today's date, and we undertake no obligation to publicly update or review any forward-looking statements. In addition, during today's call, we will reference certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are included in our earnings release. With that, I'll turn the call over to Scott.\n\nScott Bender: Thanks, Alan, and good morning to everyone. We began 2024 with solid execution as revenues in both segments exceeded our expectations. I'm particularly pleased with Spoolable Technologies' sales in the first quarter, which increased from the fourth quarter, largely due to strong sales to our large integrated customers. During this period, we also saw renewed international activity in the segment. This strength, which provides usual seasonal softness in the first quarter, further demonstrates the differentiation inherent in our spoolable products as well as the benefits of expanding the product line of our overall Cactus portfolio. Some first quarter total company highlights include revenue of $274 million, adjusted EBITDA of $95 million, adjusted EBITDA margins of 34.8%.\n\nWe paid a quarterly dividend of $0.12 per share, and we increased our cash balance to a $194 million. I'll now turn the call over to Al Keifer, our CFO, who will review our financial results. Following his remarks, I'll provide some thoughts on our outlook for the near term before opening the lines for Q&A. So Al?\n\nAlan Keifer: Thank you. As Scott mentioned, total Q1 revenues were $274 million. For our Pressure Control segment, revenues of $175 million were down 3% sequentially, driven primarily by decreased customer activity. Operating income decreased $4.4 million or 7.8% sequentially, with operating margins decreasing 160 basis points. Adjusted segment EBITDA decreased $4 million or 6.2% sequentially with margins decreasing by 120 basis points. The margin declines were primarily due to lower operating leverage. For our Spoolable Technologies segment, revenues of $99 million were up 5% sequentially on higher customer demand largely from the majors. Operating income decreased $11.8 million sequentially due primarily to an increase in the expense resulting from the remeasurement of the FlexSteel earn-out liability.\n\nAdjusted segment EBITDA decreased $0.4 million or 1.1% sequentially, while margins decreased by 240 basis points due to an increase in input costs. Corporate and other expenses were $5.5 million in Q1, down $0.2 million sequentially. On a total company basis, first quarter adjusted EBITDA was $95 million, down 4.8% from $100 million during the fourth quarter. Adjusted EBITDA margin for the first quarter was 34.8% compared to 36.4% for the fourth quarter. Adjustments to total company EBITDA during the first quarter included noncash charges of $4.4 million in stock-based compensation and a $13.3 million loss related to the FlexSteel earn-out liability remeasurement. Depreciation and amortization expense for the first quarter was $15 million, which includes $4 million of amortization expense related to intangible assets recorded as part of purchase accounting.\n\nTotal depreciation and amortization expense during the second quarter is expected to be approximately $15 million, $7 million of which is associated with our Pressure Control segment and $8 million of which is associated with Spoolable Technologies. Income tax expense during the first quarter was approximately $13 million. During the first quarter, the public or Class A ownership of the company was 82%. Barring further changes in our public ownership percentage, we expect an effective tax rate of approximately 22% for Q2 2024. GAAP net income was $50 million in the first quarter versus $62 million during the fourth quarter. The decrease was largely driven by the increase in the remeasurement of the earn-out liability. Adjusted net income and earnings per share were $60 million and $0.75 per share, respectively, during the first quarter, compared to $65 million and $0.81 per share in the fourth quarter.\n\nAdjusted net income for the first quarter was net of a 26% tax rate applied to our adjusted pretax income. We estimate that the tax rate for adjusted EPS will be 26% during the second quarter of 2024. During the first quarter, we paid a quarterly dividend of $0.12 per share, resulting in a cash outflow of approximately $10 million, including related distributions to members. The Board has approved a quarterly dividend of $0.12 per share to be paid in June. We ended the quarter with a cash balance of $194 million, a sequential increase of approximately $60 million. Net capex was approximately $7 million during the first quarter. Our full year 2024 capex outlook remains in the range of $45 million to $55 million. In conclusion, the revenue-based FlexSteel earn-out payment is currently estimated to be approximately $34.1 million, which will be paid in the third quarter of this year.\n\nThis additional consideration has been more than offset by the substantial outperformance of the business, relative to our expectations. That covers the financial review, and I will now turn the call back over to Scott.\n\nScott Bender: Thanks, Al. I'll now touch on our expectations for the second quarter of 2024, our reporting segment. During the second quarter, we expect Pressure Control revenue to be relatively flat versus the first quarter, despite our anticipation that the U.S. land rig count will be slightly down from the first quarter average levels in the period as the effects of rig releases in gas basins lead to lower activity. Adjusted EBITDA margins in our Pressure Control segment are expected to be essentially flat at 33% to 35% for the second quarter. This adjusted EBITDA guidance excludes approximately $3 million of stock-based comp expense within the segment. As mentioned previously, we anticipate introducing our latest generation wellhead to customers in the coming months, which should begin to more significantly impact operating results late this year depending on our inventory position.\n\nRegarding our Mid-East expansion plans, we are pursuing 2 viable options in the region. But as we are at a commercially sensitive stage, I do not plan to share further details with you at this time. We believe the current market for surface pressure control equipment in Saudi Arabia exceeds $0.5 billion annually, and we look forward to establishing a more material presence in this market in the coming years. We view the recent shift towards onshore unconventional gas production to be net positive to our potential business. In addition, we are currently finalizing the terms of a significant international order outside of the Mid-East. Switching over to Spoolable Technologies' segment, we expect second quarter revenue to be slightly up from the first quarter with increased installation efficiency from better seasonal activity, sales to midstream customers and continued international shipments, offsetting general industry trends.\n\nOur cross-selling initiatives continue to expand, and we're enjoying the benefits of enhanced relationships with our core customers. We expect adjusted EBITDA margins in this segment to be approximately 36% to 38% for the second quarter. Increased input costs are impacting margins in the first half of the year, although we have seen a moderation from the recent peak. Additionally, we began to utilize our pressure control, low-cost supply chain to source select components of our spoolable pipe product, which should enhance margins as the sourcing effort expands throughout 2024. Note that this margin guidance excludes approximately $1 million of stock-based comp in this segment. Adjusted corporate EBITDA is expected to be approximately a $4 million loss in Q2, flat from the first quarter, which excludes approximately $1.5 million of stock-based compensation.\n\nAlthough the macro backdrop provides little reason for optimism about 2024 U.S. activity levels, we remain well positioned at the market and plan to execute on several internal initiatives this year that should improve cash flows and returns. These initiatives include our low-cost supply chain diversification strategy, the introduction of our latest generation wellhead, enhanced frac innovations and the progression of our expansion into international markets. Additionally, I remain very pleased with the integration of our Spoolable Technologies business, which has recently received inquiries from several non-oil and gas customers for large international projects and increasing number of orders of our pipe from a major new midstream customer with a strong outlook for larger awards later this year.\n\nFurther, CCUS related inquiries are increasing, and we are involved with a customer in hydrogen transmission testing. We believe these new applications, along with the opportunity to gain market share with our existing E&P customer base, should lead to further above market growth in this segment. These recent inquiries and wins further demonstrate the differentiation in the business and reinforce our rationale for this acquisition. So with that, I'll turn it back over to the operator, and we can begin Q&A. Operator?", "source": {"uri": "ca.finance.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo!

[Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Mike Morrison, CFO. You may begin.\n\nMike Morrison: Thank you, Justin, and thank you for joining the NCS Multistage first quarter 2024 conference call. Our call today will be led by our CEO, Ryan Hummer, and I will also provide comments. I want to remind listeners that some of today's comments include forward-looking statements such as our financial guidance and comments regarding our future expectations for financial results and business operations. These statements are subject to many risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from any expectation expressed herein. Please refer to our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and our latest SEC filings for risk factors and cautions regarding forward-looking statements. Our comments today, as well as the results of operations included in our earnings release, contain the following non-GAAP financial measures, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA margin, adjusted gross profit, adjusted gross margin, free cashflow less distributions to non-controlling interests, and net working capital.\n\nThe underlying details and reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP financial measures are provided in our first quarter earnings release, which can be found on our website, ncsmultistage.com. I'll now turn the call over to Ryan.\n\nRyan Hummer: Thank you, Mike, and welcome to our investors, analysts, and employees joining our first quarter 2024 earnings conference call. NCS is off to a strong start in 2024. Our first quarter revenue of $43.9 million, exceeded the high end of our guided range by nearly $4 million. The strength was broad-based as we achieved or exceeded the high end of our guided revenue range for each of our US, Canadian, and international markets, with the largest relative outperformance coming from Canada. Our adjusted gross margin of 40%, which excludes depreciation and amortization expense, was within our guided range for the quarter. Our SG&A expense of $13.8 million for the quarter was $2.3 million lower than in the first quarter of 2023, resulting from cost savings measures that demonstrate our commitment to control expenses and a year-over-year reduction in litigation-related professional fees.\n\nWe also benefited from an increase in other income as compared to the first quarter of last year, primarily royalty income related to licensing our intellectual property, and the benefits from a technical services agreement with a local partner in Oman. Our adjusted EBITDA for the first quarter of $6.1 million, exceeded our estimate of $3 million to $4 million, and represents a year-over-year improvement of $1.2 million and a sequential improvement of $3.5 million. In prior earnings calls. I've referenced NCS's core strategies for creating value for our stakeholders. We've included a new slide in our investor presentation, which is available on our website, Slide 13, that helps to illustrate our strategy and provide examples of our progress.\n\nThe first core strategy is to build upon our leading market positions. We've demonstrated our commitment to this strategy in Canada thus far in 2024. Our Q1 revenue in Canada of $32 million, increased by 3% as compared to the first quarter of 2023, despite a reduction in the average rig count in Canada of 6% for the same period. This performance reflects the initiatives to leverage the strength of our market position and customer relationships developed over time in our fracturing systems business, and to pull through additional revenue opportunities across our other product lines. In particular, we continue to capture additional well construction opportunities with our fracturing systems customers and to grow the customer base for our purple seal frack plugs and fracture express systems and plug-and-perf completions in Canada.\n\nOur second core strategy is to capitalize on international and offshore opportunities. We've previously discussed our efforts to grow our customer base in the North Sea and to position the company for long-term growth opportunities in the Middle East in particular. We are now benefiting from these strategic investments. We're off to a good start so far this year, having sold sliding sleeves to a new North Sea customer in the first quarter. As we move to the second quarter, we expect activity in the North Sea to improve on a seasonal basis, with installation and completion activity increasing, including the expected delivery of sliding sleeves to yet another new North Sea customer. In addition, we are experiencing a meaningful increase in Tracer Diagnostics activity in the Middle East.\n\nIn April, we completed tracing the first of multiple pads for a leading national oil company in the Middle East, supporting development plans for their unconventional resource base. We expect to participate in at least two similar projects over the remainder of 2024. In addition, NCS has been awarded the opportunity to trace additional conventional wells for the same customer, supporting activity between the unconventional well pads. This is only possible because of the tireless effort of individuals across our organization to educate our customer on the value that our tracer diagnostic services can bring to tackle the procurement and logistical challenges of the work, and to provide outstanding customer service throughout the jobs and for the reporting process.\n\nIncluding the expected midpoint for international revenue guidance for the second quarter, our international revenues would approximate $7.2 million for the first half of 2024. This compares to $3.3 million in the first half of 2023, and would exceed our full-year 2023 international revenue of $6.5 million. As a reminder, full-year international revenue for NCS exceeded $10 million for each of 2018 through 2021, reaching a high of over $15 million during that period, highlighting our opportunity outside of North America. The third core strategy for NCS is to commercialize innovative solutions to complex customer challenges. We have internal objectives this year tied to obtaining field trials for new products and successfully entering new markets and regions.\n\nI spoke to this extensively on our prior call, so will just briefly highlight some of these exciting projects. We had a successful onshore trial during the first quarter for a completion system designed for deep water operations. This was developed in conjunction with an international oil company, with potential applications in the Gulf of Mexico and other deepwater regions. We've completed initial field trials for our pinpoint oriented perforating gun system at Repeat Precision, and we continue to advance further testing and validation, aligned with an influential customer's requirements. In the second quarter, we expect to install a well that will represent our highest ever sleeve count in the US at over 200 sleeves. The well will be utilizing fiber optic technology to help the customer optimize a horizontal water flood program.\n\nWe had a successful entry into the SAGD market in Canada for our fracturing systems technology earlier this year. This is a first for NCS, and we expect to utilize our technology for additional applications and customers in this market over time. In addition to these projects, we have several other technology developments underway across our various product lines, which I'm looking forward to discussing as they roll out. Mike will now review our results for the first quarter and our guidance for the second quarter.\n\nAn engineer adjusting a robotic arm in a factory line to control engineered air movement solutions.\n\nMike Morrison: Thank you, Ryan. As reported in yesterday's earnings release, our first quarter revenues were $43.9 million, a 1% increase year-over-year, with our Canadian and international revenues up 3% and 39%, respectively, and our US revenues down 12%. Despite a slight decrease in the average rig count, we saw a modest increase in our Canadian revenues. Additionally, our international revenues experienced growth, driven by the sale of a frac systems to a customer in the North Sea. Our US revenues continued to be impacted by lower natural gas prices that have curtailed some customer activity. Sequentially, our revenues in the first quarter increased by 24%, with Canada up 27%, and the US up 10%, while international revenues nearly doubled.\n\nOur adjusted gross profit, defined as total revenues less total cost of sales, excluding depreciation and amortization expense, was $17.6 million in the first quarter of 2024. Our adjusted gross margin was 40%, down compared to our adjusted gross margin of 43% for the same period in 2023, but up sequentially from 37% for the fourth quarter of 2023. Selling, general, and administrative costs were $13.8 million for the first quarter, down by $2.3 million compared to the same period last year. The significant reduction was due in part to our restructuring efforts in 2023 to streamline operations and better leverage our SG&A spend. For the first quarter, we reported net income of $2.1 million or diluted earnings per share of $0.82, compared to a net loss of $15 million or a loss per share of $6.10 for the same period in 2023.\n\nOur prior year net loss was impacted by a $17.5 million litigation provision we recorded in the first quarter of 2023 that was later settled and reversed in the fourth quarter of 2023. Adjusted EBITDA for the first quarter was $6.1 million, an improvement to the $4.9 million in the same period in 2023. Now, turning to cashflow items on the balance sheet. Cashflow from operating activities and free cashflows less distributions to non-controlling interest, were uses of cash of $1.9 million and $2.5 million, respectively. Our forecast for the full year of 2024 is to be free cashflow-positive. However, similar to the first quarter of 2023, our negative cashflow was primarily due to an increase in net working capital of approximately $6 million.\n\nThis was due in part to an increase in our accounts receivable, partially offset by a reduction in our inventory balances. On March 31, we had $14 million in cash, and total debt of $8.9 million, which consists primarily of finance lease obligations, resulting in a positive net cash position of $5.1 million. At the end of March 2024, the borrowing base availability under our undrawn ABL facility was $20.4 million, and Repeat had $6 million of outstanding borrowings under a promissory note that was repaid in full in April. Now, turning to a few points of guidance for the second quarter. We currently expect second quarter total revenue in the range of $27 million to $30 million. We expect Canadian revenue in the range of $12.5 million to $13.5 million, US revenue of $10 million to $11 million, and international revenues of $4.5 million to $5.5 million.\n\nWe expect our adjusted gross margin to be between 36% and 38%, an improvement to our adjusted gross margin for the second quarter of 2023. Due to the Canadian seasonal impact of spring breakup, we expect our adjusted EBITDA to be between breakeven and a negative $2 million, and our second quarter depreciation and amortization expense to be approximately $1.2 million. With that, I'll hand it back over to Ryan to discuss our 2024 full-year guidance and for closing remarks.\n\nRyan Hummer: Thanks, Mike. We're making only slight adjustments to our full-year guidance for 2024 at this time. We currently expect full-year revenue of $150 million to $160 million. This guidance increases the low end of the revenue range by $5 million, and maintains the top end of the range. As a reminder, we expect our revenue growth will primarily result from increased sales at Repeat Precision and our fracturing systems product line in the US, and in international markets, the North Sea and Middle East in particular. We're cautiously optimistic about Canadian activity as well. There are fundamental drivers supporting customer activity in Canada, including the TMX oil pipeline coming online this quarter, and the Canada LNG facility due to come online in 2025, which is driving activity increases to support increased natural gas production in advance of this facility's commissioning.\n\nIn addition, the strong US dollar supports Canadian activity, as our Canadian customers have operating expenses in Canadian dollars, but can sell oil and condensate at prices linked to the strong US dollar. These positive fundamental factors are tempered by the drought conditions that continue to exist in Western Canada. If we have a dry spring or an active wildfire season like we did in 2023, access to fresh water for our customers could be reduced, which could result in lower completions activity, as firefighting and agricultural activity would have preferential access to fresh water. At this point, our guidance incorporates at least some disruption from the drought conditions and wildfire prospects. So, there can certainly be more favorable Canadian customer activity levels if we continue to benefit from a wet spring, as we have thus far, and a less active fire season.\n\nWe've increased our adjusted EBITDA range to $14.5 million to $17.5 million, with a midpoint of $16 million. The increase to the midpoint of the range is $1 million, with increases to both the bottom and top end. Due to the seasonality of our business, and consistent with prior years, we anticipate that the achievement of our annual adjusted EBITDA guidance range will be weighted to the second half of the year. The $4 million year-over-year increase in adjusted EBITDA at the midpoint of the current range, represents an incremental adjusted EBITDA margin of over 32% on the $12.4 million increase implied by the midpoint of our revenue guidance range, reflecting the impact of the business optimization initiatives undertaken by NCS in 2023, and our relatively fixed operating expenses.\n\nWe expect our gross capital expenditures for the year to be between $1.5 million and $2.5 million, and we expect to generate over $5 million in free cashflow in 2024, after distributions to non-con controlling interests, despite the modest investment in net working capital that could result from supporting our revenue growth. We believe that our expectation for revenue and earnings growth in the current industry environment, paired with our strong balance sheet, positions us favorably amongst other publicly-traded oil field services and equipment peers. This is illustrated on Slide 19 of our investor presentation, which benchmarks analyst consensus revenue and EBITDA growth for 2024 for us and a group of publicly-traded peers with a market capitalization of below $1 billion.\n\nThe charts illustrate that NCS is expected to generate revenue and earnings growth that is above the median of the peer set. Another chart on the slide demonstrates that our debt to capitalization ratio at December 31, 2023, was below the median for the peer set, reflecting our resilient balance sheet. However, this favorable growth in balance sheet profile is not reflected in our trading multiple, which at 3.4x enterprise value the 2024 EBITDA, was one multiple turn below that of the peer with the next lowest multiple, and approximately two multiple turns below the peer median. Before we open the call to Q&A, I'll close with a couple of brief comments. We're benefiting from the core strategies that we put in place in 2022 aimed at generating value for our stakeholders through organic growth and technology development.\n\nWe have the infrastructure in place to support revenue growth in each of our geographic markets, providing leverage to growth future earnings. As demonstrated by our current guidance for 2024, achieving the midpoint of our guidance range would grow our annual revenue by 9% and our adjusted EBITDA by over 30%. We maintain a strong balance sheet and liquidity position, with a cash balance of over $14 million at the end of the first quarter. In addition, we expect to add to that cash balance by generating positive free cashflow in 2024, providing us with financial and strategic flexibility. Finally, we continue to benefit from the successful introduction of new technologies that meet the needs of our customers, adding to our portfolio, and expanding our addressable market.", "source": {"uri": "ca.finance.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo!

Despite the current downturn, the company expects a dynamic upward trend in wafer demand beyond 2024 and remains committed to its ambitious growth targets for 2028. Siltronic's Q1 sales dipped slightly from the previous quarter, but EBITDA margin saw an increase to 26.4%.\n\nThe company has revised its 2024 guidance, anticipating sales to fall around 10% below the previous year and EBITDA margin to range between 21% and 25%. Capital expenditures are projected to be slightly below EUR 550 million, mainly due to the development of its next-generation fabrication plant, FabNext, in Singapore.\n\nSiltronic's next investor relations event is the Annual General Meeting (AGM) scheduled for May 13th, with Q2 figures to be released on July 25th. The company's focus on growth drivers, especially the development of FabNext, is a pivotal part of their strategy to achieve long-term targets despite current market adversities.\n\nAs Siltronic AG navigates a challenging semiconductor environment, its financial health and future outlook become critical for investors to monitor. According to real-time data from InvestingPro, Siltronic's market capitalization stands at $2.46 billion, reflecting its positioning in the market. The company's P/E ratio is currently 15.77, which may be considered by investors when evaluating the company's earnings relative to its share price.\n\nInvestingPro data also reveals a dip in revenue, with the last twelve months as of Q1 2024 showing a decline of 16.38% to $1.57 billion. This contraction aligns with the company's reported weakened demand and sales reduction. Despite this, Siltronic has maintained a gross profit margin of 22.44%, a figure that, while indicative of the company's ability to control costs, aligns with one of the InvestingPro Tips highlighting the company's weak gross profit margins.\n\nInvestingPro Tips suggest that Siltronic is quickly burning through cash and may suffer from valuation concerns due to a poor free cash flow yield. With analysts not anticipating profitability for the current year and expectations of net income dropping, these insights may be crucial for investors considering the company's prospects. It's worth noting, however, that Siltronic has been profitable over the last twelve months, which could be a sign of its underlying resilience.\n\nFor those looking to delve deeper into Siltronic's financials and projections, InvestingPro offers additional insights.

Please note that this call is being recorded and streamed on the Siltronic's website. The call is also be available as an on-demand version later today. Your participation in this call implies on your consent with this. At this time, it would like to turn the conference over to Verena Stutze, Head of Investor Relations and Communications of Siltronic. Please go ahead.\n\nVerena Stutze: Thank you, Sandra. Welcome everybody to our Q1 2024 results presentation. This call will also be webcast live on siltronic.com. A replay of the call will be available on our website shortly after the end of the call. Our CEO, Michael Heckmeier; and our CFO, Claudia Schmitt, will give you an overview of our financials, the current market development, and our guidance. After the presentation, we will be happy to take your questions. Please note that management comments during this call will include forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. For a discussion of risk factors, I encourage you to review the Safe Harbor statement contained in today's press release and presentation. All documents relating to our Q1 2024 reporting are available on our website. I now turn the call over to Michael for his remarks.\n\nMichael Heckmeier: Thank you, Verena and a warm welcome also from my side. As usual, let me start with the key messages of today's call. The first quarter of 2024 was without any major surprises and continued to be characterized by weak demand for wafers due to the high inventory levels at our customers. As you probably saw in our ad hoc announcement last week, this negative sentiment will remain with us for most of 2024. Accordingly, I would call it a year of transition. Our industry and the future growth will be driven by megatrends such as generative AI, digitalization, and electromobility, and therefore we confirm our ambition to increase our group sales to more than EUR2.2 billion and our EBITDA margin to a figure in the high 30s by 2028. Let me give you a quick glance on our Q1 figures, which will be presented in detail by Claudia in a minute. As already indicated, the first three months did not bring major surprises. Sales were slightly below the previous quarter, but the EBITDA margin increased from 25.5% to what I consider a respectable 26.4%, thanks to positive tailwind from the non-operating FX result. We achieved this with stable market shares and prices. Although, we have passed the peak of our investments in 2023, the CapEx primarily required for the ramp of FabNext led, as expected, to a continued negative net cash flow. Claudia will now give you a deep dive into our financial performance before I report back with updates on the market development and the outlook. Claudia, please.\n\nClaudia Schmitt: Thank you, Michael. A warm welcome also from my side. Let's jump directly into the analysis of our results. As Michael highlighted, the first quarter progressed largely as expected with no big surprises, and we have been managing the weak demand with resilience. Our sales totaled EUR344 million, a decrease of 3.7% quarter-on-quarter. The small decline is due to some shifts in product mix and a slight negative FX impact. It's important to note that product mix shifts are typical quarterly fluctuations. Both the wafer area sold and the prices remained largely stable sequentially. In the first quarter, our EBITDA was robust with EUR91 million with an EBITDA margin of 26.4%, marking a slight increase quarter-on-quarter. The small decline in sales was counterbalanced by a favorable FX result of EUR5 million in Q1, which arose partly due to hedging and partly due to valuations in the light of a strengthening U.S. dollar. Looking into the next quarters, please do not expect a similar positive hedging result. As we have already stated for this year compared to 2023, while we do forecast a positive impact from reduced energy and material costs, we expect this to be offset by a lower hedging result and increasing labor tariffs. The EBIT came in at EUR36 million and was in line with Q4. Our financial result saw a modest decline to minus EUR3 million. The tax rate for Q1 stood at 16%, an increase from the 7% rate in Q4. The lower tax rate in Q4 was mainly related to deferred taxes. Taking all these factors into account, we concluded Q1 with a net income of EUR28 million. Now, let's look at our balance sheet. Total assets summed up to roughly EUR4.6 billion by the end of March. The changes compared to Q4 are mainly driven by two factors. On the one hand, our investments increased the fixed assets by EUR153 million. Consequently, our cash and securities have decreased to less than EUR400 million by the end of March. On the other hand, you may recall that our working capital ratio at the end of 2023 was at an all-time low. We've recorded very favorable DSO and a CapEx related surge in trade payables. However, as already announced in the last call, we now saw a reversal of this. The DSO increased in general, and we've received customer payments just after the reporting date. Furthermore, the spillover from the trade payables from Q4 was significantly reduced in Q1. The equity ratio remains resilient and is at a very healthy level of 46%. Financial liabilities in Q1 increased quarter-on-quarter as we have drawn the first EUR50 million of our syndicated loan. Therefore, loans amounted to a total of roughly EUR850 million at the end of March. Customer prepayments were slightly above EUR600 million with EUR27 million received and EUR6 million refunded. In Q1, our CapEx totaled EUR173 million, which is roughly EUR200 million below Q4. Reflecting our increased focus on CapEx management, we have revised our full year CapEx guidance downward from less than EUR600 million to slightly below EUR550 million as compared to our March publication. Most of this CapEx is allocated to our new Fab. Let's dive deeper into our debt situation as illustrated in the bridge. End of '23, Siltronic was carrying net financial debt of EUR356 million. Our operating cash flow in Q1 was impacted by an increase in trade receivables, and therefore, came in at EUR62 million. As previously mentioned, our DSO were, in general, higher and we've received payments from customers just after the reporting date. Consequently, our operating cash flow was noticeably lower than the high CapEx payments we saw in Q1, also due to the CapEx liabilities overhang from the previous year. In Q1, we've recorded an investment grant of EUR32 million, which had a positive effect on our cash flow. In total, our net financial debt amounted to EUR501 million. You already know this financing picture. Therefore, only a brief update from my side. The first portion of the syn loan, EUR50 million, was drawn in Q1. As already announced, we will undertake refinancing this year and are currently evaluating our options. In this context, we currently have no plans for a capital increase. With this, I hand back to Michael.\n\nMichael Heckmeier: Thank you, Claudia. Ladies and gentlemen, when looking at this slide, let's begin with the good news. The end markets are anticipated to grow. Our March projections for end market growth were slightly lowered from 7% to 8% to approximately 5% due to some new data points, especially for the Industrial & Automotive segment. Servers driven by AI, especially generative AI, will see the largest growth this year. From the end markets, the growth would perfectly fit to our 4% to 5% CAGR assumption. However, the still elevated inventories of our customers are being reduced slower than expected. As a result, we anticipate a higher negative inventory impact. This inventory situation overshadows the positive trend from the end markets and results in an overall negative wafer demand in the mid to high single digit percentage range. Therefore, we expect the inventories to last for several more quarters, further delaying the turnaround in our industry. Let's take a closer look at our market assessment for the three wafer segments and our most important market channels. Whilst memory inventory is decreasing slowly, we already see the first positive impacts from one of the big megatrends driving our industry. Artificial intelligence. The strongest growth we see in servers used for AI applications is driven by high-end DRAM chips used for high bandwidth memory. The inventories for HBM appear improving compared to other DRAM and NAND, which are still pretty elevated and only decreasing slowly. When it comes to logic, the inventory levels show a mixed picture at different customers. Regrettably, we observe similar trends when the inventory levels are only improving slowly. And unfortunately, power inventories further increased based on the latest data points. Please be aware that this is a combination of our own models and market data based on several data points and that segment dynamics are influenced by individual customer patterns. The overall picture can deviate significantly due to different inventory types and also our customer mix. When looking at the more positive news flow from certain chip manufacturers, these announcements appear to be more price than volume driven. And you know, for us, volume is the decisive factor. As you may have noted from our ad hoc announcement last week, we've observed further significant volume postponements from customers, particularly for the second half of 2024. Overall, the demand situation has not improved in the past few weeks. And as already mentioned, we anticipate 2024 to be a transition year. Looking beyond 2024, we expect a dynamic upward trend for overall wafer demand, in particular for 300 and 200 millimeter wafers. I'm sure you are familiar with this chart. As you know, for 300 millimeter, we anticipate a strong CAGR of 6%. For 200 millimeter, we expect a small growth and for diameters up to 150 millimeters, a continued decline. Today will be the last time we report on the small diameters market. Since a few weeks ago, we announced that we will phase out the SD wafer production during 2025. As communicated for us, SD wafers are approaching the end of their life cycle. The significant decline in volumes we saw in 2023 and early '24 triggered our decision to discontinue the production of polished and epitaxial small diameter wafers. The process is set to be completed in the course of 2025 and will not have a substantial negative effect on our results this year. Going forward, we will further increase our focus on the growth drivers power and leading edge also fueled by 300 millimeter wafers. And this is supported by FabNext in Singapore. So, we are very pleased with the development of FabNext. The transition of the project to the local team is completed and the capacity ramp is on schedule. Let's now turn to the guidance for the financial year 2024, which had to be adjusted due to the still challenging demand situation driven by high customer inventories. Due to the ongoing weakness in demand reaching into the second half of the year, we now expect 2024 sales to be roughly 10% below 2023. This is mostly volume driven, but we also see both a small FX and price effect. We expect our EBITDA margin to be in the range of 21% to 25%. Depreciation is projected to be below EUR300 million, a significant increase from the previous year's EUR203 million. However, this new guidance is considerably lower due to the later start of FabNext's depreciation in Q4. As indicated, CapEx will be significantly reduced compared to the record high of more than EUR1.3 billion in 2023. We expect it to reach an amount of slightly below EUR550 million, which is roughly EUR50 million lower than our guidance in March. This reduction is driven by our high focus on CapEx management. Due to the steep decline in CapEx, we will see a pronounced improvement in net cash flow, although it will still remain significantly negative. I would like to conclude this presentation confirming our midterm ambitions for 2028. We expect a substantial sales growth to more than EUR2.2 billion and an improvement of the EBITDA margin to the high 30s by 2028. Thank you very much for your attention. With this, we close our presentation, and Claudia and I will be happy to take your questions. Sandra, please open the Q&A.\n\nOperator: We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Daniel Schafei from Citi. Please go ahead.\n\nDaniel Schafei: Hi, good morning. Yes, so I have a couple of questions. The first one being, so now that given we have seen the pushouts in the second half, can we still expect that the first half in terms of sales will be still the low points, especially in 2Q or might it be even 3Q and 4Q now? And also, now that you've seen those pushouts and adjusted the guidance accordingly, is this guidance now already conservative enough, or is there potential for more pushouts to come? Thank you.\n\nMichael Heckmeier: Thank you, Daniel. I will take these two questions. With regards to more details about quarterly phasing, we would refrain now to give a great amount of more of this. As you know, we gave a full year guidance, our Q1 results, and then you can do some math. And we don't expect any significant pickup during the year. So, I think that's maybe enough for your further quarterly modeling. With regards to your second question, do we expect more pushouts? Currently, we built all what we know into the guidance. We have some downside potential and margin there in the guidance. But I also have to say the environment is a very dynamic one. But we know -- what we know is included and we don't have a clear view on what to come. But what we know by today is embedded in this guidance.\n\nDaniel Schafei: Okay. Thank you. I understand. And just maybe a follow-up, a quick one on pricing. What price reductions do you guys see for 200 millimeters and 300 millimeters, respectively currently in the spot and LTA markets?\n\nMichael Heckmeier: Yeah. We said clearly for the time being pricing is stable. That was the Q1 numbers. Going forward, we will see and we do see some price effects. And as we indicated earlier, it's a kind of mixed bag. Let me start with the lowest one, the small diameters experiencing significant price pressure, which at the end was one of the reasons for us to discontinue that business. In the second corner, 200 millimeters, we would say it's a mixed bag. So, some more high-tech areas are pretty stable and unchanged. And some others are also experienced pricing pressure. 300 millimeter is mainly covered by LTAs. Of course, no change in that statement. And we see a good adherence to LTA contracts. But also on the spot side there, we do see increasing price discussions. Overall, it's not significant, but that's maybe the overall situation we can explain.\n\nDaniel Schafei: Perfect. Thank you.\n\nOperator: The next question comes from Harry Blaiklock from UBS. Please go ahead.\n\nHarry Blaiklock: Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I've got a follow up to that pricing question. I just wondered what gives you confidence that pricing will stay at that slightly negative effects that you're guiding for and you won't see any further pressure beyond that?\n\nMichael Heckmeier: Yeah. So, I think the good news is the LTA coverage and it's holding. But we early on already said the longer this, let's say, demand weakness is hanging on, the more we will also see pricing effects kicking in. So, for the time being, we're quite comfortable. As I said, Q1, we can confidently report a stable price situation. We see this discussion is increasing, but we also don't have any hint for total gear change in this space of discussions.\n\nHarry Blaiklock: Got it. And then, I mean, based on your comments around LTAs, I guess, you haven't had any customers coming to you kind of asking for flexibility on pricing.\n\nMichael Heckmeier: Sorry, I didn't get this acoustically in the LTAs. We had what?\n\nHarry Blaiklock: Have you had any customers coming to you and asking for any flexibility kind of around pricing?\n\nMichael Heckmeier: So, the LTAs are including some price margins, right, as we discussed. This goes to single digit ups and downs, and there are discussions in this framework currently.\n\nHarry Blaiklock: Got it. Very useful. And then, I think in the past you said that for this year you don't have any major LTAs expiring. Is that the same going into 2025 as well?\n\nMichael Heckmeier: So, no major LTAs expiring, and particularly, let's say, important ones covering our FabNext, as we said, run times until 2028 or 2030. So, nothing major changing there.\n\nHarry Blaiklock: Great. Thank you, Michael.\n\nOperator: The next question comes from Constantin Hesse from Jefferies. Please go ahead.\n\nConstantin Hesse: Good morning. Thank you very much for taking my questions as well. The first one is, Michael, I know that you guys typically don't comment on competition, but given the dynamics, I'm very surprised about the different outlook that you guys are giving relative to Shin-Etsu. Shin-Etsu clearly stated last week that they saw the bottom in Q1 and that every quarter from now on they're seeing a recovery. So, I'm trying to understand, because typically, you, Shin-Etsu, Sumco (OTC:SUOPY), there might be some timing differences, but typically you do move in tandem. So, is there something fundamentally happening here? Are you losing market share for some reason? Or is it simply a timing situation as to maybe you were supplying more wafers compared to Shin-Etsu and as a result, they're basically catching up a bit? What's the dynamic here? Why are they saying something completely different to you in that sense? That's my first question.\n\nMichael Heckmeier: Thank you, Constantin. I mean, we don't comment, resize on individual competitor statements. But what I can say is the following, and I repeat what I said already. Q1 data very clearly indicates no change in market share. So that means for the time being, and particularly through all those shifts happening last week. And of course, there's some phasing effects, et cetera. But we don't have any indication that our market share changes for the time being. Now, going forward, I mean, we need to check quarter-by-quarter as we do anyway. And that could well be that different wafer suppliers have different customer mix, different product mix. And then it depends, of course, for example, in the memory space, some of the customers did pull the brake earlier, others later. And then, some wafer suppliers have different exposure to different customers and depend on individual pickup times of the business. This could lead to such a mix effect. We don't have any indication for a structural or fundamental change happening at all. So, what we see is a stable situation and then some phasing and potential mix effects here and there. But that's what I can comment on. And when we read the very details of different announcements, it's not so different when you study them word by word than what we are saying.\n\nConstantin Hesse: Yeah. I was just a bit surprised that they're seeing an improvement following Q1 and you are. So, just some food for thought. Then, on the price, I understand that the change of the guidance, I assume that's now primarily driven by continued weakness in spot. And you just said something interesting there. My understanding was that there was no compromise on price in the LTAs, zero compromise across you, across Sumco, across Shin-Etsu. Now you're saying that the LTAs actually do have price ranges which can be negotiated in the single digits. And you're basically having these discussions now. So, concerning the LTAs, do you compromise on price here? So, are there discussions ongoing to potentially see price declines in LTAs?\n\nMichael Heckmeier: Thank you, Constantin. What I said about LTA pricing and the margins in the contract is nothing new. We said that already last year and it's part of the contract. And those discussions are happening, let's say, on a six-month and on a yearly basis. I don't see -- just to be clear, I don't see a significant change there. There's nothing new. The more price discussions starting in the spot part of it. But the LTA pricing is happening as committed in the contracts and there is no change.\n\nConstantin Hesse: Okay. So, no compromise on price on the LTA side.\n\nMichael Heckmeier: So, as contracted, as I said, some contracts have margins. Those are discussions, but no change compared to contracted pricing.\n\nConstantin Hesse: Okay. Understood. And then lastly, is on the production exit of the smaller diameter size in '25. You mentioned that there will not be a big impact in '24. Could I please understand what the impact is in '25? What is the current exposure you still have? I believe in previous conversations, I think it was something around 10% to 15% of volumes, market level anyways. And you always said that you were relatively similar to the market. So, what kind of a vote [ph] could we actually see up to a 10% volume impact next year, driven by the fact that you're exiting the SD market?\n\nMichael Heckmeier: Yeah. Thank you, Constantin. So, the reason why we don't see any -- or foresee no major impact for this year is that customer reactions were fairly relaxed. So, we never got customers that were cutting orders immediately. On the outside, we didn't also see an indication to harvest some very early upside. Because, of course, we were hoping some customers start a kind of last order race. So both did not happen. And that's the basis for the statement that '24 will not widely be impacted. In '25, we will continuously ramp down the revenue. It's a single digit, mid-single digit in our overall sales pattern. And from a margin side, we also said it will be slightly supportive in EBITDA margin, as the SD margin, of course, was and is below average of our group margin. So, these are the two effects. Revenue is slightly down, single digit in the overall portfolio and margins slightly up.\n\nConstantin Hesse: Okay. So, the revenue for SD is only mid-single digit. Brilliant.\n\nOperator: The next question comes from Gustav Froberg from Berenberg. Please go ahead.\n\nGustav Froberg: Good morning, everyone. Thank you for taking my question as well. I just have one just on balance sheet and funding. Could you run me through how you look at your balance sheet as of today, given the recent cut to guidance? Do you see any need to top up with equity, or are you happy to fund with debt? And what are some of the assumptions and thoughts that underlie the thinking around your funding and your balance sheet, please? Thank you.\n\nClaudia Schmitt: Good morning, Gustav. I will take your question regarding balance sheet. As we mentioned, the equity share of 46% is pretty comfortable with this. And we expect it to stay roughly in that range going further. Of course, we have drawn now the first part of our Syn loan and as such, our loan amount will go up during the year until end of this year. And those are the major changes that we see in our balance sheet for this year.\n\nGustav Froberg: Okay. Do you have any comments on covenants or anything of the like with the debt that you have and maybe the debt that you will take on? Whether or not you see any need for equity at all in the business?\n\nClaudia Schmitt: As we stated, we do not plan a capital increase this year. So, you see that we still feel very comfortable regarding our financial covenants.\n\nGustav Froberg: And final question on the same topic. Is the scope for you to take out more debt beyond what you have already talked about in terms of the syndicated loan, et cetera?\n\nClaudia Schmitt: Yeah. We announced that we will start refinancing around this year and this will take -- during this year we are evaluating our options and depending on the instrument that we choose and the general conditions, we will decide on how much we will take there, how much additional refinancing.\n\nGustav Froberg: Thanks, Claudia. Very clear.\n\nOperator: The next question comes from Florian Treisch from Kepler Cheuvreux. Please go ahead.\n\nFlorian Treisch: Yeah. Thank you very much. Two questions. The one is around the inventory correction you are now facing. So, the first question is a bit in Q1, was the impact still rising relative to Q4? Or do you expect it to really come down now quarter-by-quarter? And more in general on inventory correction, what is really your visibility? I think we have two major shifts in more pronounced inventory advance in the last five months, so clearly is it just hoping to have the right number or do you really get decent information from your key clients? The second part is around your reiteration of the ambition for '28. As they have now heard, SD will go out, which will be an impact. The whole recovery is delayed by excess inventory. So, is it implicitly meaning you're more confident than ever or is it just offering enough room for error to still get to this ambition? Thank you.\n\nMichael Heckmeier: Yeah. Thank you, Florian. With regards to inventories, I mean, you're right. There is a more general discussion picture and data point when we talk about memory, logic and power and the trend here. We kind of analyze with the same or similar data than you do. Yeah, this is pretty much from MI side and institutes what is published. And then, of course, in addition, we have the insight into our customers. So, here we can say if we take memory as an example, yes, inventories are going down, but much slower than we anticipated. So, this is, let's say, a very persistent topic. And some of our customers are still very elevated. That's a fact and has to do with their business situation. Some of them start reporting, let's say, growth and then, let's say, very positive dynamics. But then when you look into more details, it's more on the high value HBM and other side, which for them is more price than volume driven. So, means they can drive their P&L, but it's not by volume happening, but it's more on the price side. So that's not helping us a lot, but it's still good for our customers for the overall industry dynamics. So, we have a very clear picture of some of those inventories still elevated, going down. But it's hanging on for a longer time than everybody did foresee. Coming to your second question around our 2028 ambition. I mean, we have no doubt that the drivers of this industry are unchanged. And even I would say with Gen AI, there's even more midterm potential for the industry in total. So, a bad year or two bad years do not change our overall belief and ambition. And of course, we do the math and we are still confident that we can do the '28 numbers.\n\nMartin Jungfleisch: Hi, good morning. I have two questions, please. On FabNext, first of all, on the ramp speed. I understood initially it was like 100,000 wafers per month, final annualized output by year-end. Has this changed? And also, what you hear or see from competitors that are also expanding? Do you see a somewhat rational behavior? Or so, do you also adjust output speed according to market demand? Or is there any signs of them trying to gain market share? And the second question is really on the ramp cost. In your previous release, you were expecting a 300 basis point margin hit from ramp cost. Now with the Fab ramp delayed, what would be the impact this year? And also, would this mean that the majority of this 300 basis point impact would be now pushed to next year? Thank you.\n\nMichael Heckmeier: So let me start maybe with more outside perspective on FabNext. Then Claudia will give you some details about ramp cost and depreciation. And then, I come back with your second question about competitors behavior. So, FabNext, overall, our ramp plan is in place and there's no change. And this is, I think, very good news. The project has been handed over from the internal project organization to the local organization, which is always a very important milestone for such a, let's say, massive construction project. And things are happening on plan and on schedule there. With regards to customer qualifications, we see some of them sliding into Q4. And that is also, of course, related to the overall market environment, but not a change for overall ramp situation and ramp capacity. Now that's more the high-level statement. And maybe Claudia can then discuss a bit more the ramp cost situation and this depreciation impact.\n\nClaudia Schmitt: Yeah. I will take over for this part. To be very clear, the ramp costs are still there cash wise. So, there are ramp costs. But until we start to the depreciation of FabNext, they are capitalized. So, they show up in the assets and starting Q4, they will show up in the P&L. So, they are still there, but in our result only from Q4.\n\nOperator: The next question comes from Robert Sanders from Deutsche Bank (ETR:DBKGn). Please go ahead.\n\nMichael Heckmeier: So, there was one from Martin around competitors, whether there's a change in competitors ramping their capacity. And Martin, I would also stay to my old statements. We see some of them also delaying ramping slower for some of them, which are, let's say, more in the shell phase. Still, we don't have very detailed insights. But overall, this high-level statement of rational behavior when it comes to capacity add and extensions is unchangeably true.\n\nRobert Sanders: Yeah. Hi. Good morning. I guess, given that you're delaying FabNext, the ramp of it, I was just wondering when you now thought that line would reach kind of cost parity with the existing Singapore line. Second question would just be around the SD impact. Did you say mid-single digit percentage of sales in 2024? Is that right, as opposed to mid-single digit millions? Just to double check. And then the last question, which is, can you comment around the impact of currency? Because obviously the yen has been very weak, which could give your Japanese competitors an advantage and perhaps a desire to be more aggressive on price. Thank you.\n\nMichael Heckmeier: So, let me take the first one, FabNext. When it's low, that's been ramping to a certain extent. We have no doubt that it will be very attractive and will contribute with EBITDA margins above 50%. So, now your question is, of course, when will that happen? And our honest answer is we don't know that, because it really will completely depend on market pickup and further ramp opportunities with our customers. So, it's now would be really misleading to give you any date in the current situation. Once market is picking up and we see volume developments coming in, then we would be again in a position to be more precise on that, what do you call cost parity or accretive margin contributions from FabNext. And to be honest, I didn't get the second one, but I think it was around SD. Is it mid-single digit overall sales? And I can reconfirm the answer, yes. It's mid-single...\n\nRobert Sanders: Yeah. That's what I thought. It was a 1 million wafer per month line in Berghausen, right? But I assume you've scaled that down already. I was just actually interested. Is that -- when is that going to be zero? Basically, when are you going to be completely shut down? Is it the end of '25?\n\nMichael Heckmeier: It will depend on final customer dependence and let's say all the patterns coming in. But in the course of '25, we will be discontinued that business.\n\nRobert Sanders: Got it. I actually just have one other last question just on the debt side. So, how much of your $900 million odd of debt is actually being refinanced this year? And what is your cost of debt now that your leverage is heading above two times? Is it above 6% or below? Thanks.\n\nClaudia Schmitt: As already mentioned just a second ago, we have not fixed the amount that we will refinance this year. We will see. It will heavily depend on the instrument that we will choose in the end. But we will let you know as soon as we know.\n\nRobert Sanders: Got it. Thanks a lot.\n\nClaudia Schmitt: And your question regarding FX, I think it's still open regarding the Japanese yen. Yes, of course, our Japanese customers may have benefits of the development. But of course, we won't comment on that. Our Japanese yen share in sales is pretty low, so it's not nice to see that development, but it's okay for us.\n\nRobert Sanders: Thanks a lot.\n\nOperator: The next question comes from Jurgen Wagner from Stifel. Please go ahead.\n\nJurgen Wagner: Yeah. Good morning. Looking at page 11 on your handout, which market segments would you regard yourself as being significantly overexposed? And then, you talked about rational behavior on a high-level. What would be your view on longer term pricing once this inventory correction is over and all the new wafer fabs have ramped up in volumes in, let's say, '26 or so? Thank you.\n\nMichael Heckmeier: Thank you, Jurgen. In terms of our market exposure, there is basically no change. I mean, we are almost equally represented in the three segments, memory, logic and power. And of course, we have a slight overexposure in memory. But the recent developments or shifts did not change our overall, let's say, market situation and exposure to those segments. What is surprising once inventories are melt down? The honest answer, we don't know. I mean, we eagerly wait for that time to happen. We would still be then in the position where around two-thirds of our 300 millimeter businesses in LTAs with the margins and price corridors I described there. And then we would assume, of course, if demand is picking up very quickly, that there will be upside spot opportunities again. But it's a bit speculative when you're still, let's say, in the middle of this rally and wait for the uptick. That would be my more high-level statement to your question.\n\nJurgen Wagner: And your long-term targets, they are basically based on the assumption that you will have two-thirds in LTAs, right?\n\nMichael Heckmeier: The long-term target is, of course, unchanged. And the assumption is, of course, kicking in of the FebNext benefits here, where the fully automated, let's say, very low-cost base, which then would provide this above average and eventually above 50% EBITDA margin contribution to the group. That's the main value driver together with our strategy, focusing on high value, leading edge and power.\n\nJurgen Wagner: Okay. Thank you.\n\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Ladies and gentlemen, that was the last question. I would now like to turn the conference back over to Dr. Michael Heckmeier for closing remarks.\n\nVerena Stutze: Thank you, Michael. This concludes our Q&A session. Thank you for joining us today. Our next Investor Relations highlight will be the AGM on May 13th. And the speeches of this AGM will also be streamed on our IR webpage. For our Q2 figures, this will be released on July 25th. Stay healthy and let's talk again soon. Bye.\n\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, the conference is now over. Thank you for choosing Chorus Call and thank you for participating in the conference.

This conference call will be available on our website at axt.com through May 2, 2025. Also before we begin, I want to note that shortly following the close of market today, we issued a press release reporting financial results for the first quarter of 2024. This information is available on the Investor Relations portion of our website at axt.com. I would now like to turn the call over to Gary Fischer for a review of our first quarter 2024 results. Gary?\n\nGary Fischer: Thank you, Leslie, and good afternoon to everyone. Revenue for the first quarter of 2024 was $22.7 million. That's up from $20.4 million in the fourth quarter of 2023 and up from $19.4 million in the first quarter of 2023. To break down our Q1 204 revenue for you by product category, Indium phosphide increased sequentially to $8.1 million. That's reflecting strong growth from data center applications, including AI and continued improvement in passive optical networks, Gallium our side also grew to $7.5 million with broad-based improvement across a number of applications. Germanium substrates were $1.4 million, up from the prior quarter with renewed strength in demand for satellite solar cells. Finally, as expected, revenue from our consolidated raw material joint venture companies in Q1 was $5.8 million, down from Q4 as we consumed a greater portion of their output for our growing substrate demand. In the first quarter of 2024, revenue from Asia Pacific was 79%, Europe was 16%, and North America was 5%. The top 5 customers generated approximately 33% of total revenue and 1 customer was over the 10% level. Non-GAAP gross margin in the first quarter was 27.3% compared with 23.2% in Q4 and 26.9% in Q1 of 2023. For those who prefer to track results on a GAAP basis, gross margin in the first quarter was 26.9% compared with 22.6% in Q4 and 26.3% in Q1. Beyond the near-term, we remain confident that we can get back to the mid-30% range as the environment strengthens through higher overall volume, favorable product mix and the benefits of our recycling programs, along with continued efficiency improvements throughout our business. Moving to operating expense. Total non-GAAP operating expense in Q1 was $8.7 million compared with $7.5 million in Q4 of 2023 and $8.7 million in Q1 of 2023. On a GAAP basis, total operating expense in Q1 was $9.4 million compared with $8.2 million in Q4 and down from $9.5 million in Q1 of 2023. As you've seen from our quarterly run rate in 2023, we had put in a number of constraints in place for OpEx to align with market conditions as things are beginning to trend up, we're loosening up some of these constraints, which has brought OpEx up from the previous run rates. We do expect to hold it at approximately this level throughout the rest of this year. Our non-GAAP operating loss for the first quarter of 2024 was $2.5 million compared with a non-GAAP operating loss in Q4 2023 of $2.7 million and a non-GAAP operating loss of $3.5 million in Q1 of 2023. For reference, our GAAP operating line for the first quarter of 2024 was a loss of $3.3 million compared with an operating loss of $3.6 million in Q4 and an operating loss of $4.4 million in Q1. Nonoperating other income and expense and other items below the operating line for the first quarter in 2024 was a net gain of $1.3 million. The details can be seen in the P&L included in our press release today. For Q1 2024, we had a non-GAAP net loss of $1.3 million or $0.03 per share compared with non-GAAP net loss of $2.8 million or $0.07 per share in the fourth quarter and non-GAAP net loss in Q1 of 2022 was $2.4 million or $0.06 per share. On a GAAP basis, net loss in Q1 was $2.1 million or $0.05 per share. By comparison, net loss was $3.6 million or $0.09 per share in the fourth quarter and GAAP net loss in Q1 of 2023 was $3.3 million or $0.08 per share. The weighted average basic shares outstanding in Q1 of 2024 was 43.0 million shares. Cash and cash equivalents and investments were $41.3 million as of March 31. By comparison at December 31, it was 52.3%. Cash is down for 2 main reasons. First, our revenue billings tended to be back-end loaded in the first quarter as most of China shuts down for Chinese New Year. As a result, Q1 and Q1 accounts receivable increased by $6.1 million. This is simply a timing issue as most of that cash can be collected in Q2. The second reason for the decline in cash in Q1 was CapEx spending of $5.7 million. This is not new commitments to facilities. This was work done in 2023 and for which payment was due in Q1. As we look to the balance of the year, we expect CapEx to be in the $2 million to $3 million range quarter per quarter, most of which goes towards facilities work, which was done in 2023. One more note on cash. From time-to-time, we have had outside parties approach us with an interest to invest in our supply chain companies. Currently, interest in China is growing, perhaps related to the change in the economic circumstances in China. We believe that there is real value in these assets to be unlocked and may consider monetizing a portion of them this year. As a reminder, we now have over 10 companies in our supply chain where we have partial ownership shared with industry partners. Depreciation and amortization in the first quarter was $2.2 million. Total stock comp was $800,000. Net inventory was down $600,000 in the first quarter. This includes inventory added through our recycling program. 33% of the inventory is raw materials and WIP was 63%, finished goods makes up approximately 4%. The increase in WIP is primarily the result of increased crystal growth in anticipation of higher demand in Q2. With improving demand, we hope to bring our total inventory down by approximately $10 million over the year. Okay. This concludes our discussion of our quarterly financial results. Turning to our plan to list our subsidiary, Tong May in China on the Star market in Shanghai. We now believe that we have had some significant developments on the issue that the CSRC previously raised, and we believe the likely next step is that the CSRC can resume consideration of our application. As we've said, this is a lengthy process, but we continue to believe that Tongmei is an excellent candidate for listing. With that, I'll now turn the call over to Dr. Morris Young for a review of our business and markets.\n\nMorris Young: Thank you, Gary. We believe our business is on a firm path to recovery, as evidenced by the continued growth in our business and solid execution, which allowed us to exceed our Q1 revenue and profitability pace. In the first quarter, we achieved 11% sequential growth in our revenues and 29% sequential improvement in our non-GAAP net income. While certain parts of the demand environment remains somewhat soft, all three of our substrate product line showed improvement, including a 48% growth in time phosphide revenue from Q4. Looking individually at these product lines. Indium phosphide once again became our biggest selling material in Q1. Sales was driven by continued recovery in the power market and a meaningful increase in demand related to AI. We review AI as an exciting catalyst for Indium phosphide in the years to come. As AI requires high-speed lasers and detectors for rapid data transfer with increased bandwidth, low attenuation and low distortion. Today, AI applications are primarily oxide pixels, which require a relatively small amount of substrate material. But as the industry moves to 800 gig and then 1.6 terabyte speed, we expect that there will be a necessary transition to indium phosphide. We are already seeing development work happening today with next-generation silicon photonics devices and electro-absorption modulated laser or EML for high-speed data center transceivers. Revenue from these applications contributed to our strong indium phosphide growth in Q1 and will help drive our expected growth in 2024. Our gallium phosphide revenue grew 24% sequentially in Q1, reflecting increased demand across a broad base of applications, including power amplifiers, HPT applications for wireless our switches, high-power lasers and LEDs. We believe much of the excess inventory in the supply chain has been decided, and we are benefiting from a desire among our customers to diversify their supply base as the market recovers. For example, today, our share of the HPT market is relatively small, but we believe we have a great opportunity to increase our market share over time and are pleased with early customer traction. In addition, our 8-inch gallium site development efforts have led to a groundbreaking advancements in both of our defect densities and yields. We believe this innovation can be applied to our 6-inch gallium state products, allowing us to further enhance our competitiveness across all of our market research. In germanium substrate, demand for satellite solar cells were down substantially throughout 2023, is now beginning to recover. Sales increased 25% in Q1 over the prior quarter with renewed strength in Europe and Asia. And finally, coming off three quarters of strong sales in our raw material business as well as contribution from our recycling efforts sales from our raw material business declined as we expected in Q1. This decline was primarily the result of our consuming a greater portion of the output from our consolidated joint venture as our substrate business has strengthened. In total, our portfolio joint venture companies continues to be a strategic value to our business, providing money of the critical material we use to make our products and allowing us to benefit from the cost and efficiency advantages. Now in closing, we are optimistic about the coming year and the growth and expansion of our business. We are seeing tangible signs of recovery across all of our product lines with new catalysts such as AI, providing strong incremental opportunity. We've worked hard over the last two years to pave the way for an exciting future by providing world-class products for a highly dynamic technology landscape, elevating our own business practices to meet the requirements of Tier 1 customers, delivering breakthrough innovations in the development of large diameter gallium arsenide and indium phosphide substrates and executing on a recycling program that both advances our ESG commitments and improves our cost structure. We remain status focused on business efficiency and accelerating our return to profitability. With that, I will turn the call back to Gary for our second quarter guidance. Gary?\n\nGary Fischer: Thank you, Morris. In keeping with our comments today, we expect Q2 revenue to be between $25.5 million and $27.5 million. We expect our non-GAAP net loss will be in the range of $0.03 to $0.05, and GAAP net loss will be in the range of $0.05 to $0.07. Share count will be approximately 43.0 million shares. Okay. Well, this concludes our prepared comments. Morris and I will be glad to answer your questions now. John, can you take it back?\n\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from the line of Charles Shi from Needham. Please go ahead.\n\nCharles Shi: Hi, Morris. Gary, congrats on the good Q1 results and very happy about Q2 guidance. I want to start with the AI really related question. The indium phosphide, I think that last time when we speak -- when we spoke about this, you were talking about semi-insulating indium phosphide wafers potentially being used for some of the high-speed detectors application. But in your prepared remarks, it sounds like you are getting a little bit more upbeat about the high-speed laser type of applications for 800 gig, 1.6 tera those kind of applications for the next-generation EML et cetera. So can you provide us a little bit of update your engagement on these AI applications so far? Do you -- when do you see the laser application will start to contribute some meaningful revenues for the indium phosphide business?\n\nMorris Young: Charles, first of all, the order we received one customer specifically told us is for us for AI, and that was from selling germanium phosphide. And the fact that we're guessing if it was for detectors, it was a guess, okay? Because usually, indium phosphide good semi-insulating either for electronic applications or for high-speed detectors. However, recently in the industry, we also heard some of the EMLs require semi-insulating substrates. So this -- whether it's for lasers or for detectors, we all know from what we are making, the customer demand for our product is sort of a slight change from silicon do -- I mean sulfate semiconducting substrates, usually good for lasers. And now it's for semi-insulating in of the indium phosphide, but whether it's detectors or lasers, it's a an insulate estimate. We don't really know. I'm sorry. But we do hear from our customer, it's for a pretty large AI customer.\n\nCharles Shi: Got it. Thanks. Well, Morris, thanks for the color you provide. I guess it's something we will continue to chat. And obviously, we don't want to dig more if there's something about your customer you don't want to share. So maybe a second question, maybe for Gary, I think in your prepared remarks, you talked a little bit more about the SAR listing. It sounds like you're making some progress on that front. Can you kind of provide a little bit more color in terms of what kind of progress exactly? And give us a little bit better sense about why you think it's moving forward a little bit more at this time.\n\nGary Fischer: So the process of communication with Shanghai Stock Exchange a CSRC is such that once we send in our applications, they will continue to ask questions. They want us to clarify a few things. And there are things which that they express, they have concerns with and we provide them with answers. And we think we made some good progress on the questions they have. And so now we think we are ready to go through the next step, which is go through their review process again, and they will then look at our whole application and either continue to ask questions or improve -- approve...\n\nCharles Shi: All right, thanks for the update. Okay, that's all from me for now. Thanks so much and congrats again on the results and guide.\n\nOperator: Yes. The next question comes from the line of Richard Shannon from Craig-Hallum. Please go ahead.\n\nRichard Shannon: Well, hi, guys. Thanks for taking my question as well. And congratulations on a really nice guide here. Great to see you. To that point here on the guidance here, I wonder if you could elaborate on a couple of items here, first of all, just trying to understand the relative growth dynamics of each of your four revenue buckets here, I would assume you deposits probably your best growth driver, but wondering if you can kind of rank those and whether you expect them all to be growing sequentially. And then second of all, trying to get a sense of what's implied here for gross margins, given that you said that OpEx could generally be the same in the second quarter as the first. I'm kind of getting a number that's slightly higher than the first quarter, maybe as high as $30 or 30%, but just wondering if I'm doing the right math on that one.\n\nMorris Young: Yes. So let me first try on the business conditions. Actually, the strongest growth we think next quarter is going to come from Gallium phosphide and also germanium. Germanium seems to be very strong and raw material is very strong as well. Indium phosphide actually at this point of the timing that we are projecting flat. And one other thing which is interesting about this business environment right now is that wherever the customer wants something, it's the short -- the lead time is extremely short. I mean, we usually ask the customer to give us at least four weeks lead time because we need to process the wafers and sometimes we even have to grow crystal. So the lead time issue is long. We don't have a standard product for offering. But nowadays, I mean, customers just want two weeks lead time, which is great. However, it's all of prevented from having better visibility. But we can see that gallium phosphide is extremely busy. And indium phosphide right now, as we see now is a flat quarter, but things can change because we still got almost two months to go, given two weeks lead time. We have six weeks to take orders and deliver. And on the margin, Gary?\n\nGary Fischer: Maybe we can do this on a follow-up call, Richard, because it gets kind of complicated and I didn't understand exactly what your model is telling you, but we can work on it with you, so.\n\nRichard Shannon: Okay. Fair enough. Morris, I did want to follow-up on your comment regarding gallium phosphide being your highest growth driver here. To what degree is this maybe some inventory fill in some product areas that were driven down so hard in the last 1.5 years? And then I think you also mentioned some pickup in the wireless/HPT market. So I'm wondering to what degree that's contributing in this quarter.\n\nMorris Young: Well, first of all, I would say gallium phosphide was the first product coming down in terms of revenue, right? I mean, I remember it was the second quarter of 2022, gallium phosphide start to come down. So it takes usually six weeks before all the inventory got depleted. So now it's coming back. So because indium phosphide takes, I think, three longer weeks before it start to come down. Three, yes, three quarters, too. So I expect indium phosphide perhaps not to recover as quickly as gallium phosphide. Although the pickup of indium phosphide last quarter, I attribute that to the new business on AI and because I see PAM business is doing okay but not really robust. The telecom business is not great. And data center, from what I see, they are still inventory out there. So I think the AI part of the data center, I think, is pulling the demand for us and increase our revenue by, what, 40-some-odd percent 48% from Q4 to Q1. So the -- yes.\n\nRichard Shannon: I didn't mean to interrupt Morris, so please continue.\n\nMorris Young: No, I actually have forgotten what my. So what was another part of your question? Yes.\n\nRichard Shannon: Yes, I think so. But there is an interesting follow-up to those comments here, which is like how much of your Indium phosphide businesses is AI today? It seems like given these kind of growth rates, it's got to be a pretty substantial part now. Can you quantify that in any way?\n\nMorris Young: Well, I think last quarter was significant. I would say, could be as much as 20%, although it's a little bit difficult for us to really nail it because some customers would tell us and some customers don't, okay? But as I said, indium phosphide business is very interesting. I want to encourage analysts to help us to do that analysis. There are two parts of indium phosphide one is semi-insulating and the other semi-conducting. The semi-insulating is usually made for detectors and electronic applications. And the software do semiconducting are usually low EPD and good for lasers, and they are the dominant demand for indium phosphide for many, many years. It's almost like eight-one in favor of semiconducting wafers, okay? But the last two or three quarters, the trend is reversed. There's so much more demand on semi-insulating iron doled wafers. So it's as if the laser just didn't grow or maybe they still got too much inventory. And this new demand of iron doled making either some kind of laser or more likely high-speed detector is growing very strong. So what I'm hoping for is that the sulfide material will recover as the inventory get consumed and will come back again. But this iron actually is a new application will continue its own trajectory of growth.\n\nRichard Shannon: Okay. Very interesting dynamics there. I'm going to ponder that while I ask a couple of other questions here. I guess just a quick one here. You had a 10% customer in the quarter. Can you identify that or at least the sector and whether that they've been a 10% customer in the past.\n\nGary Fischer: Okay. Yes. It's a historically long-term customer for us that does EPPE. And we don't know for sure where that was going. But actually, we do know, but we can't say I'm not going to lie to you.\n\nRichard Shannon: Okay. Fair enough, Gary. Maybe just a couple of last questions here, and I'll ask both of you to put on your long-term lenses here, or I guess we'll call it a medium-term lens here. But just kind of wanted to conjecture on the opportunity for getting back to breakeven level by the end of this year or early next year? And maybe just as a reminder what that model looks like in terms of revenues and gross margins.\n\nGary Fischer: Well, we certainly think that it's a reasonable target and goal to do that maybe this year. So we're not giving up on it.\n\nMorris Young: I would say it's this year. Yes. So...\n\nGary Fischer: Yes. It's probably somewhere between $28 million and $30 million a quarter, and we would need to get the gross margins to go up maybe close to 28% and keep the OpEx somewhere around 9.3%, 9.4%. That's GAAP and OpEx, by the way. So...\n\nMorris Young: And I think we do need some help from indium phosphide. I mean right now indium phosphide is only 50% of what we used to do at a peak.\n\nGary Fischer: Yes. I mean that's probably the wildcard. And it's -- I would say that the indium phosphide surge, especially since it's centered in the artificial intelligence area, it's happening sooner than we expected. We thought it would -- we believe early on it was going to happen, but it's happening sooner. So the question is what's going to happen in the next two or three quarters. But it's a tremendous opportunity, and there's billions and billions of dollars that are being invested in the hardware side of AI and the software side. So -- and of course, we play in the hardware side. So it's pretty amazing what's on the horizon. So...\n\nRichard Shannon: Okay. One last question, I'll jump on the line here, guys. The short report that came out on your stock early last month, I think, is -- I think we've established pretty well, there's a bunch of Malarky for the most part. But it does bring up an interesting topic that I think it would be very interesting for you to address. And I think it's risk that a lot of investors bring up with me. And that is related to the STAR listing and the investment by private equity investors. And if there's any rejection of the application for whatever reason here, what's the risk? And how do you get around the risk of having to repay that money and then find other ways to finance the company.\n\nGary Fischer: Well, as long as we're in the process they have no right for redemption. And equally important, they don't want to be redeemed. I mean the last thing they want is their money back. And so they're very willing to be patient and that work with us. And it's everyone was disappointed that it's taken longer than we all expected. But...\n\nMorris Young: So let me try to help out a little bit here, Gary. Look, I think -- I mean, hard assets and doing manufacturing semiconductor or materials job industry is hot in demand in China. And that is showing up in the fact that we have other investors interested in acquiring a minority share of our other joint ventures, okay. So although the IPO takes longer than we thought it is. But I think our assets in China are highly valuable. I think the psychology or the thinking from a Chinese investor point of view, the money no longer can go into real estate to invest and doing materials and doing manufacturing and the real fundamental business manufacturing is highly desirable. So if we don't, for whatever reason, we don't go IPO, I would say one possibility is inviting other customers -- I mean, investors investing into our joint ventures. And we have several of them, which are highly valuable. I mean, of course, the most valuable is Toma manufacturing substrates, and we have the world ranking leadership in those fields, although they are smaller, but nevertheless, it's highly desirable. But because we're going public in China, so we cannot separate them and then invite investor into the main body of the investment to me. But for our joint ventures, we can certainly get other investors investing in those joint ventures.\n\nGary Fischer: Yes, let me give you -- we have talked about this internally. So, we're not worried about it. But as I said, the PE companies want us to go public. They don't want to pull out. So these equity -- private equity investors are all large and premier institutions, each with an investment of just under $5 million, which represents a relatively small part of their respective portfolios. And so far, since they have to be patient no matter what, they're being patient. So and another thing that's probably interesting to note is that they don't have any recourse or their investment is not collateralized. So that's why they needed to succeed. So -- and we made some significant progress and some developments that we really can't give any details, but some very good steps were taken in the recent quarter, which continues to sustain our hope regarding the IPO.\n\nRichard Shannon: Well, great I appreciate all that detail I think a lot of investors wanted to hear that, and I think that's a great response. So appreciate the time, guys. That's all for me.\n\nOperator: The next question comes from the line of Tim Savageaux from Northland Securities. Please go ahead.\n\nTim Savageaux: Hi. Good afternoon, and congrats on both the results and the outlook and especially the growth in indium phosphide. And I think there was a mention of kind of peak levels that you had achieved in indium phosphide. I think that's getting up towards $20 million a quarter, maybe $1 million -- but at that point, you also had some additional consumer business. And I guess my question is as you look at it now, the market opportunity you're seeing, do you think this AI kind of optical data center opportunity can move you back toward peak indium phosphide levels by itself? And I have a follow-up.\n\nMorris Young: That's a good question. I -- the customer who use our product for consumer products at the time -- I mean, they still have one product using it for consumer product, by the way. They didn't go all completely, and we are believe a big dominant supplier for that product. And we are also in negotiation and in qualification for yet other product although I don't know what's the launch time and whatnot. And the other thing is that talking to their engineers, at one time, they told us they have 11 projects centered around using indium phosphide in their consumer product devices. So I don't think I'm giving that up, but indium phosphide just has so many different characteristics such as fire infrared and using as a detector, et cetera, et cetera. So it's unique in its place to be used as a technology device. Whereas AI application, I think it's an extension of what people use it for data center. If you want high bandwidth, high-speed data transfer, low attenuation, I mean that's the perfect choice. And if you have AI, that means you've got to access data much in 100, 1,000 times, even 10,000 times, and you have so many more data center, you want to exchange information. What's the best way to transfer that information, it's no banner. It has to be some kind of an optical device to transfer that data. So I think it's difficult for me to say when it's going to be so strong and so how big but whether it's going to rival to the consumer product. But I think both of them do need indium phosphide...\n\nGary Fischer: Yes, when Morris said optical, that means it's got to have the indium phosphide because the wavelengths can be read by indium phosphide -- so -- but yes, we believe we will get back to those levels, Tim. As Morris says, we're not sure on the timing. And it very well could get back to that level sooner than we thought because of AI. Six months ago, we didn't have this kind of expectation. I don't know for the people listening to it. I think last week, there was really an amazing article in the New York Times about the amount of money invested in AI in Q1 of this year, and it was, I think, $32 billion. And that's not just software, that's hardware, too. So it's data center stuff. So I mean, we've all been around a long time and so we've seen stuff, but I was very amazed by that. And I sent it to Morris and Leslie, I said it to our Board of Directors because that's going to -- we know we're at the bottom of the food chain or the end of the train, but that's going to benefit any phosphide substrates. And so the dream or the hope is that the consumer comes back and it competes against AI for who's going to be the biggest contributor to indium phosphide revenue. And we don't need a miracle for that to happen. I think it's a very reasonable goal.\n\nTim Savageaux: Got it. And I want to ask a little bit more about the improvement or the pretty dramatic growth that you saw in Q1 in indium phosphide. And you've already talked about -- you have a unique perspective kind of in the ecosystem. And maybe I'm going to ask you to guess a little bit more here. But I guess my question is around the breadth and how you could characterize that strength. Obviously, you can sell to a lot of different folks in this arena, whether it's Epiwafer suppliers or vertically integrated laser manufacturers or module manufacturers. And I think you've done business with all of those types of guys. And so whether it's looking at the type of customers or looking at wafer sizes, what does that tell you about the breadth of demand that you see as the -- historically, you've had a couple of major customers on the data center side? Or can you see to the extent new customers are showing up? Or are there a couple of customers really moving the needle for you when you see this extraordinary growth in Q1?\n\nMorris Young: The Q1 customer actually is new. I mean they are a customer on other products. But for that application for AI was new. And they're telling us their customer, but I can't repeat it. It's a big, big customer.\n\nGary Fischer: Well, there's a -- we know the players, right? There's Meta (NASDAQ: META ), there's Google (NASDAQ: GOOGL ), there's Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT ), all of those data centers are going to -- where indium phosphide is going to have a play is rack to rack, rack to the aggregation point within the data center and then the aggregation point to a different data center. All of that needs high speed. If you think of the data that's computed in AI then you've got to transfer it and move it around in order to get an end result. And so within the rack, we don't think they'll go to AI to indium phosphide. But rack to rack and beyond, that's where indium-phosphide has a definite application. So...\n\nMorris Young: Of course, Gary, you're not saying anything different. Why is it AI, data set are already doing this. But it's just that data center has to get so busy talking to each other and exchange information a thousand times or 10,000 times that requires higher speed highway. That is where the indium phosphate come in.\n\nGary Fischer: The other thing that one of our marketing guys taught me is that some of the large data centers are now having a shortage of power of electricity to run the thing. So they're downsizing in the future architecture to smaller -- more data centers that are smaller but are spread around, and that's going to benefit us. So...\n\nTim Savageaux: Got it. Well, okay, it sounds like there was sort of a big customer helping to drive that growth in Q1. And sort of the rest of the color I was looking for. I know there's only so much you can say. But clearly, you're at the substrate level, you've got an Epiwafer supplier who maybe selling into a module manufacturer. I mean I imagine that you're maybe not all the way up to the cloud provider level, but you have customer touch points all along that ecosystem. And I was just looking for as you see the pieces move around what you're seeing in terms of opportunity at any of those levels, right, whether it's going directly to a chip supplier, obviously, you used to do a lot of business with Intel (NASDAQ: INTC ) and their module assets are over at Jabil now. Are you seeing sort of different customers kind of show up at different parts of the food chain, I guess, in driving this AI growth.\n\nMorris Young: Not yet. In fact, I think if I mean we have some China customer, which is showing up -- taking a lot of wafer as well, but they're not telling us anything. I mean I think the customer base seems to be shifting somewhat before these things all happen to consumer product that sort of win way. And then there was a data center that you were talking about, which was taking a lot of wafer, they are not prime customers at the table right now. There is a new Chinese customer coming in, but we don't know where that is coming from. And this new customer is taking this as leading in the phosphide and we know they're telling us it's going to AI. But I wish I can see that's the second one, the third one coming in, that would be great.\n\nGary Fischer: We think we understand the architectural needs well enough that there's little doubt in our mind, there's no doubt, frankly, that we're going to end up benefiting and getting into multiple data centers along the big names that I just ran off. So...\n\nOperator: The next question comes from the line of Danny Cheng from B. Riley Securities. Please go ahead.\n\nDanny Cheng: Good afternoon. My first question is actually on gallium arsenide. So you're expecting that to be the main driver from first quarter to second quarter. Just wondering if there any applications or customers kind of driving this strong growth?\n\nMorris Young: LED is strong for automobile. Lasers is strong, but not as high as at the peak. I would say it's about 50% of the peak level. Automobile is probably 70%, 80% of the peak and HPT is a new, I believe, opportunity for us, and we're trying very hard to get ourselves back into it. And if we are successful, we can expect more revenue growth for HPT as well. And the China market seems to be fairly strong in gallium arsenide.\n\nDanny Cheng: Got it. And just wondering how sustainable your expectation is on gallium arsenide, I mean are we talking just a few quarters or kind of a multiyear cycle.\n\nMorris Young: I can guarantee multiyear. I would say we have probably good visibility, at least to Q3. I mean demand is strong. But as you know that I do worry about the world economy. I mean, I think -- but then people are saying there's a recession, but it never come, right? It's -- I mean...\n\nGary Fischer: Yes, most of our cycles are more than one quarter. So Gallium arsenide is more robust than we expected it to be, but we're not thinking like, oh, then it's going to drop back down in July. So...\n\nDanny Cheng: Got it. And then just on indium phosphide for AI applications. Is there any data on market share? How big that is and the market share between you versus competitors?\n\nGary Fischer: No, we don't know. There is some public projections on markets that coherent shared publicly in one of their presentations. If you haven't seen that, you might want to take a look because there's some stuff in there that might give you some information. So...\n\nDanny Cheng: But just on the market share. I mean, you think -- should we expect maybe one-third each for you and your competitors or somebody has a dominant market share -- just for -- on the AI. Any color on that?\n\nMorris Young: The customer we have, I think, they are giving us all the order, but I don't know whether our competitor is taking order from a different customer okay? In other words, the order we got, we know we got 100% of that order from that customer. And they told us it's for AI. But I don't know whether our competitors are serving yet down the channel.\n\nOperator: The next question comes from the line of Matt Bryson from Wedbush Securities. Please go ahead.\n\nMatt Bryson: Hey thanks for taking my questions. On the HPT side of things, if you're successful in getting traction, any idea of what the size of that opportunity might be?\n\nMorris Young: Say it again, I didn't hear. The expected value...\n\nMatt Bryson: How big is the HBT market -- what could that look like on a quarterly or annual revenue run rate, assuming you're successful in getting traction in that market?\n\nGary Fischer: Okay. I would say close to $20 million a year.\n\nMatt Bryson: Got it. So that's a nice big round number. Similarly, or slightly different question. I think a lot of the focus on indium phosphide has been around the AI opportunity. But do you have any sense of how close to the point where inventory is normalized, we are? Like is that two, three quarters out? Is it a year out? And then any idea in terms of how much revenue you think you're losing because there's inventory out there right now? Or what might your revenue look like if that inventory didn't exist, any thoughts?\n\nMorris Young: Yes. I think right now, it's very difficult for me to estimate because I don't even know whether they are in full production or not, although the amount of substrate are buying doesn't look like it's pilot. I think they're making something. But we haven't seen -- I mean, the first thing I'd like to see is, I mean, the last order was at three months. If they give us other six months order, if they're increasing, then I can estimate and better yet is if there's a second customer sort of coming and wants the same thing, and that's even better. At this point...\n\nMatt Bryson: And sorry to interrupt Morris. So I'm actually -- I'm asking on kind of that traditional indium phosphide business, like where you know you have inventory kicking around in the supply chain. If you have any idea, so not so much the AI side, but the traditional business, if you have any idea like how -- what the impact on your revenue is today, how much it's holding it off? And then any thoughts on when that inventory might get worked out, and you might resume normal revenue run rate on that older business.\n\nMorris Young: I think that's -- because the business is right now just beginning, it's hard for me to tell. But I mean, I think we have the capacity. We can definitely make 3 times to 5 times what they are ordering now or even 10 times if giving us a little bit of time to increase our facility. So I think the volume is no problem. And I think our product quality really fits well with what they wanted. So at this point, it's I think -- I don't know whether I'm answering a question or not. I think I'm excited about it, and we're trying to get as much information as we can. And we know the customer and customer which is large, I don't think they're pulling around. So hopefully be coming back with increased order or somebody else is going to come in following their lead, please. So I think that's diversion.\n\nGary Fischer: Yes. I've had some of these conversations with our marketing guys. And I think they expect that we're going to continue to work through the inventory into the second-half of this year.\n\nGary Fischer: Data center Inventory. Yes. So that's what I was referring to. So -- there's still some out there. But...\n\nMatt Bryson: You're getting cleared out and then restoring normal levels, that's probably a -- an early 2025 type phenomenon as you're thinking right now?\n\nGary Fischer: Yes, maybe Q4 of this year, but definitely in 2025. So it's going to happen. So we can't wait. We're so excited about it.\n\nMatt Bryson: Yes. I guess last one for me, Gary. I completely understand that customers don't want to hold inventory. And so they're putting in rush orders, which makes it hard on your end to clear out your inventory because you don't want to turn down business. But I guess given that environment, how confident are you can take down inventory by $10 million? Or what are the dynamics involved in that where you're not effectively having a turn down business because you can't meet those rush orders?\n\nGary Fischer: Well, I wanted to take it down $10 million last year in -- it came down last year, but not as much as our target. However, I have a couple of reasons that I think it's a realistic target. One is, if you look back at our historical inventory levels compared to our revenue run rate levels, it was the inventory was in the $60 million level range, $65 million level range. So the difference is we have more inventory in the consolidated joint ventures now because they have different added product lines and things like that. And our recycling program, which is good, it helps us on gross margin and it helps us with ESG, but you're converting what I would call scraps of materials or slurry, which has a little or no book value, and then you bring it in at standard cost. So your inventory goes up. So it's counterintuitive. But even so, I'm absolutely convinced we can take money out of the inventory. Is it going to be $10 million? That's my target. And if revenue grows for us, then it makes it a little easier to take the inventory down. So yes, I don't need a miracle to have that happen. I just need some good business decisions, and if it was easier, frankly, when I could go to China because I would hold inventory review meetings and I haven't been there for a while because of the COVID thing, but I'm going to go this year. So we're getting back in that cycle. But it's a good question. So thanks.\n\nMatt Bryson: Awesome. Thanks for taking the question.\n\nOperator: As there are no further questions at the queue this time, this concludes our Q&A session. I would like to turn the call over back to Dr. Morris Young for closing remarks.\n\nMorris Young: Thank you for participating in our conference call. This quarter we will participate in the Northland Security Growth Conference until June 25, and I hope to see you there. As always, please feel free to contact me, Gary Fischer or Leslie Green, if you would like to set up a call with us. We look forward to speaking with you in the near future.\n\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Garrett Edson. Please go ahead.\n\nGarrett Edson: Thank you and good afternoon. By now, everyone should have access to our earnings announcement and supplemental presentation which were released prior to this call and may be found on our website at regionalmanagement.com. Before we begin our formal remarks, I will direct you to Page 2 of our supplemental presentation, which contains important disclosures concerning forward-looking statements and the use of non-GAAP financial measures. Part of our discussion today may include forward-looking statements which are based on management's current expectations, estimates, and projections about the company's future financial performance and business prospects. These forward-looking statements speak only as of today and are subject to various assumptions, risks, uncertainties and other factors that are difficult to predict and that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied in the forward-looking statements.\n\nThese statements are not guarantees of future performance and therefore you should not place undue reliance upon them. Refer all of you to our press release, presentation, and recent filings with the SEC for a more detailed discussion of our forward-looking statements and the risks and uncertainties that could impact our future operating results and financial condition. Also, our discussion today may include references to certain non-GAAP measures. A reconciliation of these measures to the most comparable GAAP measures can be found within our earnings announcement or earnings presentation and posted on our website at regionalmanagement.com. I would now like to introduce Rob Beck, President and CEO of Regional Management Corp.\n\nRob Beck: Thanks, Garrett, and welcome to our first quarter 2024 earnings call. I'm joined today by Harp Rana, our Chief Financial Officer. On this call, we'll cover our first quarter financial and operating results, discuss the credit performance of our portfolio, and share our expectations for the second quarter and the balance of the year. We had a very strong start to 2024 as we outperformed our outlook on both the top and bottom lines. For the quarter, we generated net income of $15.2 million, and diluted earnings per share of $1.56. Our portfolio liquidated by $27 million in the quarter, in line with our expectations and consistent with normal seasonal trends. The increased pricing that we've implemented over the past several quarters and the growth in our higher-margin, small loan portfolio drove total revenue yield to 32.8%, which was 80 basis points better than prior year and contributed to record quarterly revenue of $144 million.\n\nWe've also continued to aggressively manage our expense base while still investing in our growth and strategic initiatives, resulting in a sequential improvement in our operating expense ratio of 110 basis points. In sum, we're very pleased with our first quarter results, and I continue to be very proud of the way that our team members are navigating through the current environment. We remain cautiously optimistic about the direction of the economy and the credit performance of our portfolio. We continue to maintain tighter underwriting guidelines and thoughtfully grow our high-margin, small loan portfolio, which has grown by nearly $50 million, or 10%, since the middle of last year. We expect to continue to grow our small loan book in a measured way as the returns are very strong and more than make up for the higher loss rates on this portfolio.\n\nOverall, we're seeing the benefits of our prudent underwriting in our credit metrics, despite the growth of those loans with higher risk-adjusted margins. We again originated roughly 60% of our loans through our top two risk ranks in the first quarter. We ended the first quarter with a 30-plus day delinquency rate of 7.1%, a 10 basis points improvement from the first quarter of last year. Our auto-secured portfolio has also continued to grow, ending the quarter at 9.2% of our total portfolio, up from 2.1% three years ago. The credit performance of these loans has been very strong with a 30-plus day delinquency rate of 2.1% as of the end of the quarter. In addition, our front book continues to perform in line with our expectations despite macroeconomic stress.\n\nThe front book represented 78% of the portfolio at the end of the first quarter and had a 30-plus day delinquency rate of 6.5%, compared to 9.8% in our back book. The back book accounted for 25% of our 30-plus day delinquent accounts, despite representing only 18% of the portfolio at quarter end. By the end of 2024, we expect the back book to represent only 8% to 10% of the total portfolio. Compared to the back book, the front book continues to season at lower levels of loss, which should benefit our 2025 results. Our net credit losses also came in better than outlook. Despite indicators of improving credit performance within our portfolio, we marginally increased our loan loss reserve rate to 10.7 in the quarter in light of more recent mixed economic indicators, including inflation rates that remain elevated.\n\nWe believe this approach is appropriate during this time of relative economic uncertainty. While inflation and interest rates remain higher than expected, we are maintaining our full year guidance. The strong start to the year provides us with protection on the bottom line should macro conditions, namely inflation and interest rates, remain elevated for longer. In addition, our outperformance on G&A expenses in the first quarter, part of which is due to timing, gives us flexibility to invest more in marketing in the back half of the year to benefit 2025 results, assuming the economic conditions are conducive to faster growth. Against the current economic backdrop, we will continue to operate based on the guiding principles that I've laid out previously.\n\nFirst, we're committed to our core business of small and large loan installment lending. We have a long history and runway of controlled, profitable growth with these products. We'll continue to originate loans where we have a high degree of confidence in meeting our return hurdles. We're always keeping a close eye on economic data and its impact on our consumer base. Recent reports indicate a strong labor market and real wage growth. However, we continue to observe stress in certain segments of our portfolio caused by continued inflationary pressures. Given the economic uncertainty, at this time, we remain comfortable prioritizing credit quality over loan growth. As a result, we expect to remain highly selective in making loans within our tight credit box, at least in the near term.\n\nBy expanding to eight new states and increasing our addressable market by more than 80% since 2020, we have ample opportunity to take advantage of high levels of consumer demand to drive quality portfolio growth while remaining selective in approving borrowers under our more conservative underwriting criteria. Where appropriate, we'll also continue to pursue opportunities to increase pricing and expand our margins, including through growth in our small loan portfolio, a strategy that has been effective in recent quarters in improving our revenue yield. As we've always done, we'll manage the business with a goal of maximizing direct contribution margin and bottom line results. Second, we'll continue to meticulously manage expenses while also investing in our core business in a way that improves our operating efficiency over time and ensures our long-term success and profitability.\n\nWe continue to allocate capital to improve our capabilities and pursue our strategic initiatives, including several important technology, digital, and data and analytics projects that are key to the modernization and evolution of our platform and omnichannel business. These investments are critical to achieving our strategic objectives and will create additional sustainable growth, improved credit performance, and greater productivity, operating efficiency, and leverage over the long term. Finally, we'll maintain a strong balance sheet with ample liquidity and borrowing capacity, diversified and staggered funding sources, and a sensible interest rate management strategy. As of the end of the first quarter, we had $478 million of unused capacity on our credit facilities and 81% of our debt was at a fixed rate with a weighted average coupon of 3.7% and a weighted average revolving duration of one year.\n\nLater this year, we expect to access the securitization market. However, given our significant existing liquidity and borrowing capacity, we have the flexibility to go to market when conditions are most advantageous. In summary, we'll continue to stay focused on making fundamentally sound business decisions in line with these key principles. We're well positioned to operate effectively through the current economic cycle. Though we remain measured on growth at this time, we stand ready to make adjustments to our underwriting and growth strategy based on changes in our credit performance and the macroeconomic environment. With ample liquidity, significant borrowing capacity, and a large addressable market, we have the ability to lean back into growth when justified by the economic conditions.\n\nI'll now turn the call over to Harp to provide additional color on our first quarter results as well as second quarter guidance.\n\nHarp Rana: Thank you, Rob, and hello, everyone. I'll now take you through our first quarter results in more detail and provide you with an updated outlook for the second quarter. On Page 4 of the supplemental presentation, we provide our first quarter financial highlights. As Rob noted, we generated strong net income of $15.2 million, or diluted earnings per share of $1.56, driven by solid revenue growth and continued expense discipline. We also exited the quarter with a strong balance sheet, healthy loan loss reserves, and an improved credit profile. Turning to Page 5. Demand remained strong in the quarter, and we maintained a cautious approach to underwriting, with an emphasis on higher-margin segments. Total originations increased 8% year-over-year.\n\nBy channel, branch and direct mail originations increased by 2% and 30%, respectively, while digital originations were 9% lower year-over-year. As we've consistently noted, we've deliberately decelerated origination since 2022 as we appropriately balanced growth with credit quality and higher returns. Page 6 displays our portfolio growth and our product mix through the first quarter. We closed the quarter with net finance receivables of roughly $1.74 billion, down $27 million from year-end due to the normal seasonal liquidation expected in the quarter. As of the end of the first quarter, our large loan book comprised 72% of our total portfolio. In addition, slightly under 84% of our portfolio carried an APR at or below 36%, compared to just over 86% of our portfolio a year ago.\n\nAs Rob previously noted, we've purposefully leaned into growth of higher-margin small loans in recent quarters as they will support future revenue yield offsetting increasing funding costs and exceed our return hurdles despite higher expected net credit losses on these particular segments. Looking ahead, we expect our ending net receivables in the second quarter to increase by approximately $30 million to $35 million as we exit tax season and begin to regrow our portfolio. During the quarter, we'll continue to monitor the economy and focus on originating loans that maximize our margins. As economic circumstances dictate, we're prepared to further tighten our underwriting or lean back into growth, either of which could impact ending net receivables.\n\nTurning to Pages 7 and 8. Total revenue grew to a record $144 million in the first quarter, up 7% from the prior year period. Our total revenue yield and interest and fee yield were 32.8% and 29.3%, respectively. Sequentially, total revenue yield was up 50 basis points, exceeding our outlook. Year-over-year, our total revenue yield was up 80 basis points due in large part to our pricing increases on newer loans and growth in our higher-margin small loan portfolio. In the second quarter, we expect a roughly 50 basis point sequential decline in total revenue yield, primarily due to higher expected interest income reversals from net credit losses in the quarter. As credit outcomes improve in parallel with an improving economic environment, we would expect to see benefits to yield.\n\nMoving to Page 9. Our delinquency and net credit losses were roughly in line with our outlook, despite a slower start to the tax season and continued inflationary pressure. Our 30-plus day delinquency rate as of quarter end was 7.1%, up sequentially, but an improvement from 7.2% at the end of the first quarter of 2023. Our net credit losses of $46.7 million were modestly better than our first quarter outlook, while we recorded an annualized net credit loss rate of 10.6%. Page 10 provides additional information on the performance of our front book and back book. The front book ended the quarter at 78% of our total book compared to 73% at the end of 2023 and represents 71% of our 30-plus-day delinquency. Our back book, which represents 18% of our portfolio, accounts for 25% of our 30-plus-day delinquency.\n\nOur front book and back book reserve rates are 10.1% and 14.1%, respectively. In the second quarter, we expect our delinquency rate to improve consistent with seasonal patterns. In addition, we anticipate that our net credit losses will be approximately $55 million in the second quarter as more of our back book loans roll to loss. Turning to Page 11. We increased our first quarter allowance for credit losses reserve rate by 10 basis points to 10.7%, slightly above our outlook due to macroeconomic considerations. As of quarter end, the allowance was $187 million and assumes a 2024 year-end unemployment rate of 5.8%. Looking ahead, we expect to maintain a loan loss reserve rate of 10.5% at the end of the second quarter, which would be a 20 basis point reduction from the end of the first quarter, subject, of course, to economic conditions.\n\nFlipping to Page 12, we continue to closely manage our spending while still investing in our capabilities and strategic initiatives. Our G&A expenses of $60.4 million in the first quarter were substantially better than our outlook, partially due to timing. Our annualized operating expense ratio was 13.7% in the first quarter, 30 basis points better than the prior year period, and our first quarter 2024 year-over-year revenue growth outpaced our G&A expense growth by 7.9 times. We continue to aggressively manage our personnel expense. And as Rob noted, our beat on G&A expenses in the first quarter gives us the ability to spend more in marketing in the back half of the year to benefit 2025 results, assuming the economic conditions are right. We'll continue to manage our spending closely moving forward.\n\nIn the second quarter, we expect G&A expenses to be approximately $62 million to support our larger portfolio and continued targeted investments in our operations. Turning to Pages 13 and 14. Our interest expense for the first quarter was $17.5 million, or 4% of average net receivables on an annualized basis, slightly better than our outlook on lower average debt and lower rates. Despite the sharp increase in benchmark rates since early 2022, we've experienced a comparatively modest increase in interest expense as a percentage of average net receivables, thanks to our fixed rate debt issued through our asset-backed securitization program. As of March 31st, 81% of our debt is fixed rate, with a weighted average coupon of 3.7% and a weighted average revolving duration of one year.\n\nIn the second quarter, we expect interest expense to be approximately $18.5 million, or 4.2% of average net receivables. As our fixed rate funding matures, and we continue to grow using variable rate debt, our interest expense will increase as a percentage of average net receivables. We also have a strong balance sheet and continue to maintain ample liquidity to fund our growth. We have $187 million of lifetime loan loss reserves as well as $336 million of stockholders' equity, a little over $34 in book value per share. As of the end of the first quarter, we had $478 million of unused capacity on our credit facilities and $169 million of available liquidity, consisting of unrestricted cash on hand and immediate availability to draw down on our revolving credit facility.\n\nOur debt has staggered revolving duration stretching out to 2026. And since 2020, we've maintained a quarter-end unused borrowing capacity of between roughly $400 million and $700 million, demonstrating our ability to protect ourselves against short-term disruptions in the credit markets. Our first quarter funded debt to equity ratio remained a conservative 4.0 to 1, with ample capacity to fund our business. We incurred an effective tax rate of 23.7% in the first quarter, slightly lower than our guidance due to discrete tax benefits related to equity compensation. For the second quarter, we expect an effective tax rate of 24% to 25% prior to discrete items. We also continue to return capital to our shareholders. Our Board of Directors declared a dividend of $0.30 per common share for the second quarter.\n\nThe dividend will be paid on June 12, 2024, to shareholders of record as of the close of business on May 22, 2024. Finally, I'll note that we provide a summary of our second quarter 2024 guidance on Page 15 of our earnings supplement, and we've maintained our full year 2024 guidance. As a reminder, our quarterly net income typically is at its lowest point in the second quarter of each year, and we expect 2024 to be no different. That concludes my remarks. I'll now turn the call back over to Rob.\n\nRob Beck: Thanks, Harp. Before we get into Q&A, I'd like to take a moment to thank the Regional team for the hard work, commitment to our hard-working customers, and delivery of outstanding results in the first quarter. We had an excellent start to the new year, and we look forward to continuing the momentum in the second quarter and beyond. While we remain conservative on our underwriting at this time, we're cautiously optimistic about the direction of the economy, and we're well positioned to continue our growth and increase our market share when the conditions are right. In the meantime, we'll continue to provide best-in-class service to our customers, advance our capabilities and strategic initiatives, and deliver sustainable returns and long-term value to our shareholders. Thank you, again, for your time and interest. I'll now open up the call for questions. Operator, could you please open the line?\n\nSee also", "source": {"uri": "finance.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo!

Welcome to the First Quarter 2024 Skyward Specialty Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speakers' presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. I would now like to hand the conference over to Natalie Schoolcraft, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nNatalie Schoolcraft: Thank you, Liz. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to our first quarter 2024 earnings conference call. Today, I'm joined by our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Andrew Robinson; and Chief Financial Officer, Mark Haushill. We'll begin the call today with our prepared remarks and then we will open the line for questions. Our comments today may include forward-looking statements, which by their nature involve a number of risk factors and uncertainties, which may affect future financial performance, such risk factors may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in our projections or forward-looking statements, these types of factors are discussed in our press release as well as in our 10-K that was previously filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.\n\nFinancial schedules containing reconciliations of certain non-GAAP measures, along with other supplemental financial information are included as part of our press release and available on our website, skywardinsurance.com under the Investors section. With that, I will turn the call over to Andrew. Andrew?\n\nAndrew Robinson: Thank you, Natalie. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. We started 2024 strong, reporting Q1 adjusted operating income of $0.75 per diluted share. Gross written premiums grew 27%. Our continued strong growth is a direct reflection of our strategy to have a low diversified portfolio of underwriting divisions that allow us to allocate capital to those areas we believe offer the best opportunity for profitable growth and shareholder returns. I'll remind our analysts and investors that growth during 2023 was not the byproduct of already new property cat. We see limited property cat opportunities that fit with our Rule of Niche strategy in which we aim to build defensible positions that allow us to deliver top quartile underwriting profitability across all market cycles.\n\nOur combined ratio was 89.6%, and our annualized adjusted return on equity and tangible equity or 18.3% and 21.1% respectively, altogether, these metrics reflect the power of our Rule our Niche strategy and our outstanding execution across all in the underwriting divisions and the functions that support our underwriters. Operationally, rate retention and submission flow in the quarter continued to be strong, and we continue to find opportunities to profitably grow our business. I'll talk more about these later in the call. With that, I'll turn the call over to Mark to discuss our financial results in greater detail. Mark?\n\nMark Haushill: Thank you, Andrew. For the quarter, we reported net income of $36.8 million or $0.90 per diluted share compared to $15.6 million or $0.42 per diluted share for the same period a year ago. On an adjusted operating basis, we reported income [indiscernible] or $0.75 per diluted share compared to $15.5 million or $0.42 per diluted share for the same period a year ago. In the quarter, gross written premiums grew by approximately 27%, all of our underwriting divisions contributed to the growth in our captives, transactional E&S, surety, professional lines, global property and agriculture divisions were each up over 20%. Turning to our underwriting results. The first quarter combined ratio of 89.6% improved 0.6 points compared to the first quarter of 2023.\n\nThe 0.5 point improvement in the current accident year non-cat loss ratio to 60.6% was principally driven by a changing mix of business. During the quarter, catastrophe losses were minimal and accounted for less than 0.5 point on the combined ratio compared to the first quarter of 2023, which was impacted by 1.8 points of cat losses. Excluding the deferred benefit of the LPT, there was no net impact from prior year development. In Q1, as has been the case in the quarters leading up to being a public company and since going public, we increased our conservatism to an already strong loss reserve position. The expense ratio increased 1.3 points compared to the first quarter of 2023 and was in line with the full year 2023. We've talked in prior quarters regarding our business mix shift and investing in the business.\n\nSo this is in line with our expectations and target of a sub-30 expense ratio. Turning to our investment results. Net investment income was $18.3 million in the quarter, an increase of $13.7 million compared to the same period of 2023. During the quarter, you will note we changed how we disclose our investment portfolio and the net investment income results. We will speak to the portfolio in four categories; short-term investments in cash and cash equivalents, fixed income, equities and alternative and strategic investments. This change was driven by a couple of factors. Our desire to simplify how we talk about the portfolio more traditional presentation and in line with the industry and more reflective of our strategy and the underlying risk characteristics of the portfolio.\n\nConsistent with our investment strategy to deploy all free cash flow to fixed income in the first quarter, we put $98 million to work at 5.4%. The net investment income from our fixed income portfolio increased $5 million from $7.4 million in the prior quarter, driven by improving portfolio yield and the significant increase in the invested asset base. Our embedded yield was 4.7% at March 31 versus 4.0% a year ago and 4.6% at December 31. At March 31 we had approximately $298 million in short-term investments and our yield on short-term investments continue to be north of 5%. Lastly, April 1 is when we renew our property reinsurance programs, all these renewals were orderly and we are satisfied with the terms and structure of these programs.\n\nWe increased our property cat treaty net retention from $12 million to $15 million and the cover increased from $28 million to $36 million. We were able to improve the terms of the treaty while retaining the same model return period as the expiring treaty. With that, I will turn the call back over to Andrew for concluding remarks.\n\nAndrew Robinson: Thank you, Mark. Operationally, we had another strong quarter. We continue to realize pure pricing increases in the high mid-single digits, which is above our estimated loss cost trends, our new business pricing was up again over our in-force book an indicator that new business profitability is attractive and should contribute to margin expansion, we also continue to see strong submission activity which was up over 30% from the prior year quarter. Retention dipped into the 70s driven by business mix shift towards lower retention divisions such as transactional E&S as well as some continued trending of our commercial auto portfolio, which in Q1 was 14.7% of our writings compared to 18.3% in the prior year quarter.\n\nLet me turn to the competitive marketplace for a moment, from our vantage point it is most certainly an increasingly nuanced market for capturing profitable growth. But we continue to identify and invest in market segments that are attractive, and where execution of our strategy allows us to profitably grow and deliver attractive returns for our shareholders. In Q1, we launched a new media liability unit within special lines with a team of expert underwriting and claims professionals, each of whom has a distinctive standing and broker following in the marketplace. We remain confident in our ability to continue to attract the very best talent and arm those professionals with advanced technology and data analytics that has proven to be the winning formula for our success as our results in Q1 further reinforced and it's visible in our results, whether it be the talent add this past year in surety or transactional AMS with the launch of global agriculture, or Inland Marine, our investments are clearly paying off for our shareholders.\n\nFinally, we recently published our first ever annual people report, our people are the lifeblood of our success, and it is what makes Skyward truly unique. The report provides a wonderful view into our company, and we encourage our investors to visit our website to access this report or contact Natalie if you'd like to have a printed copy. I'd like to now turn the call back over to the operator to open it up for Q&A. Operator?", "source": {"uri": "ca.finance.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo!

Despite the growth, the Canadian market experienced a downturn in construction activity, leading to a surplus of idle hydrovac units. Badger also announced plans to realign its sales resources and fleet to better match demand.\n\nIn summary, Badger Infrastructure Solutions Ltd demonstrated a solid start to 2024 with increased revenues and profitability, particularly in its U.S. operations. The company is addressing challenges in the Canadian market and remains committed to its full-year fleet plan.

I will now turn the call over to Rob Blackadar.\n\nRob Blackadar: Thanks Lisa and good morning everyone and thank you for joining our 2024 first quarter earnings call. Before we get into the results, I'd like to take a moment to talk about safety. Safety is at the center of everything we do here at Badger. April was Distracted Driving Awareness Month. Every day, we have thousands of operators and vehicles on the road and each vehicle is equipped with machine learning AI technology to encourage safe driving habits. Maintaining a Just Drive mindset is crucial for all of our team members when they are behind the wheel. Just Drive is just as it states, eliminating all distractions while in the vehicle, so our operators can just drive. Now, on to the first quarter results. The team had another strong quarter with record revenues, gross profit, and adjusted EBITDA. Our top line revenue of $161.6 million grew by 13%, driven by the strength of our U.S. operations, which saw a revenue increase of 19% year-over-year. We continue to experience softness in our Canadian markets due to a decrease in overall construction activity, the completion of several large projects on the West Coast, and delayed starts of some significant projects in Central Canada. This overall slowdown in the market led to an increased supply of idle hydrovacs across Canada. We continue to monitor closely the end market activity in our Canadian region and will align our sales resources as well as our fleet to pivot with the overall demand. We achieved RPT, or revenue per truck per month of $36,904 in Q1, down slightly from the previous year due to the slowdown in the Canadian market. RPT in the U.S. for the quarter was up 3% compared with last year. We continue to see growth in adjusted EBITDA track higher than our revenue growth, up 22% year-over-year, driven by improved operating leverage and cost management strategies. Our adjusted EBITDA margin was 18.1%, up from 16.7% in 2023. And as a reminder, the first quarter is our slowest most seasonal quarter of the year. The Red Deer plant manufactured 52 hydrovacs this quarter versus 57 units in Q1 of 2023. The fleet team used a seasonally slower quarter to retire 66 units and refurbish eight units. We also took the opportunity to accelerate some Q2 and Q3 retirements from our Canadian region due to the project start delays discussed earlier. We ended the quarter with 1,529 units, growing our fleet by 10% since Q1 of 2023. Our full year fleet plan remains unchanged from previous guidance, manufacturing between 190 to 220 hydrovacs, retiring between 70 to 90 units and refurbishing between 35 to 45 hydrovacs. I'll now turn the call over to Rob Dawson to discuss our Q1 financial results in more detail.\n\nRob Dawson: Thank you, Rob. As you saw in our first quarter release, our team delivered another strong quarter of results. We had record first quarter revenue up 13% from last year, driven by our U.S. operations, which was up almost 19%. Partially offsetting this, our Canadian operations were down 18% from last year due to the reasons Rob mentioned earlier. The team is prepared to execute on our pipeline of projects coming up later this year and into next. Our margins have continued to rise, reflecting the operating leverage gain from our pricing strategies and the scalability of our branch network and support functions. Our gross profit margins were strong for the first quarter at 24.8% compared with 22.9% last year, also driven by our U.S. operations. The trend in our adjusted EBITDA margins continued to improve at 18.1% compared with 16.7% in the prior year. Our four-quarter trailing EBITDA margins also continued to grow in line with our long-term objectives. G&A expenses were $10.8 million or 6.7% of revenue compared with $8.8 million or 6.2% of revenue in the prior year. Total G&A expenses were slightly elevated from our run rate over the second half of 2023 due primarily to the timing of IT spend in the first quarter. We continue to expect relatively stable full year G&A spend. Q1 adjusted earnings per share was $0.14 per share, up 27% compared to the prior year due to the higher adjusted EBITDA margins, offset in part by higher depreciation expense associated with the 10% increase in our fleet and higher right-of-use assets. With revenues up 13%, adjusted EBITDA up 22%, and adjusted EPS up 27%, we are encouraged by the continued scalability and growth in margins. Now, on to the balance sheet. Our capital allocation priorities are unchanged. We continue to maintain a strong flexible balance sheet to support our organic growth and commercial strategy. Our compliance leverage ended the year at 1.5 times debt to EBITDA -- ended the quarter my apologies, down from 1.6 times a year ago. This is up from 1.3 times at the end of 2023. The increase from year-end primarily reflects the impact of the payments made under our share-based compensation plans in the first quarter. I will now turn things back over to Rob Blackadar for some final comments. Rob?\n\nRob Blackadar: Thanks Rob. So before we open it up for questions, a few last comments. We are pleased with our continued strategy to further diversify the company's business across key markets in both the U.S. and Canada. Badger's overall performance continues to scale and grow with broad exposure in our resilient end markets. Badger's long-term growth prospects remain unchanged and we continue to believe Badger is uniquely positioned to capitalize on the significant opportunity for nondestructive excavation services across North America. Finally, I want to remind everyone that we have our virtual Annual Meeting of Shareholders today at noon Eastern Time, 10 a.m. Mountain time. To get more information, please visit our Investor Relations page at ir.badgerinc.com. So, with those comments, I'll turn it back over to the operator to open it up for Q&A. Operator?\n\nOperator: Thank you. At this time, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Yuri Lynk with Canaccord Genuity Inc. Your line is now open.\n\nYuri Lynk: Good morning Rob. Nice quarter. I think it could have been even better if Canada had performed like it did even last year. Can you talk a little bit more about the delays that you saw? And it doesn't sound like those projects are going to ramp up until the back half of the year. So, just wondering why you weren't able to put those trucks to work in other markets or maybe even move them into the U.S. and put them to work there?\n\nRob Blackadar: Yes. So, a couple of quick things. I'll talk a little about the first part of your question and then I'll talk a little bit about the ability to kind of redeploy the trucks and why we did what we did on our retirements. So, regarding the Canadian markets specifically, we had been on several large projects the last few years across Canada. Probably the most notable that most folks if they work in Canadian markets are aware of Trans Mountain pipeline and for our part of that work, it largely ended in Q4 for everything we had going on with that and that represented a significant amount of trucks. We had a few other large projects as well, but they all were sunsetting at the end of last year. We have bid and successfully bid on several large projects that we were anticipating being started by now for Q1. So, we really weren't expecting much of a hiccup at all and just continuation of keeping the trucks working and on projects. Those larger projects -- and we don't give out future projects or current projects we're on. We will -- we are -- from time-to-time, we'll talk about past projects, but for competitive reasons, and especially in Canada, we're not going to discuss the ones that we're bidding on, but most anyone can Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) or figure out what the large projects are coming up. They continue to be delayed. One of them was going to start at the end of Q4. It got delayed to the beginning of Q2 and now it's being delayed to end of Q3, beginning of Q4. The -- for us, our core business, our regular construction business and a lot of our utility business is unchanged, remains unchanged and our trucks are busy. The large projects, though absorbed on a relatively smaller number of these projects, a lot of our fleet. When these got delayed, we looked at it and said, we can either -- we had a few options. We can sit on the current trucks we have and just kind of wait for those large projects to start if they start at the end of Q3, beginning of Q4, we can identify trucks that we were going to retire in Q2, Q3, maybe the beginning of Q4, and maybe we could accelerate that. So, we made the decision in Q1 to accelerate those retirements and not carry them if we're not going to keep them busy. We don't make it a regular practice. We move our trucks all across Canada and all across the U.S., but we don't make it a regular practice to move trucks north and south of the border. Typically, we have what's called FET or Federal Excise Tax implications by moving trucks because we actually use these as they are purpose-built trucks, vocational trucks and because of that, we have a lot of duty and tax implications to move them north and south of the border. So, that's -- when we looked at the fleet and we said it feels like we're going to have some potential excess fleet until these large projects start. We identified some of the oldest units and we said, let's accelerate the retirement of those instead of waiting when we would normal course do it. That's the whole story behind that, Yuri. There's not a lot of additional color other than what I just laid out for you.\n\nYuri Lynk: Okay. No, that makes sense. And the Canadian outlook, I mean, I think the language in the MD&A changed a little bit. You're not talking about growth now in Canada. So, should we expect a kind of a similar quarter in Q2? And then maybe the ramp-up of those projects in Q3 and Q4, but Canada largely down in 2024?\n\nRob Blackadar: Yes. So, my perspective and visiting with our Canadian leaders across the country, they are sharing that the business, the backlog of their day-to-day business is continuing robust and we're expecting a normal course season. What's missing is some of these large projects and the volume. So, if looking at it from a year-over-year perspective, I think you're largely correct that we are going to see lift in Q2. We're going to see a lift in Q3 relative to Q1 because we saw that it's a seasonal business. The summer season is going to be rolling, but I would not be expecting any growth. And as we are looking at some of the projects, if they start in Q4, and again, these have been pushed twice now. But if they start in Q4, we believe we'll have the opportunity to get back to close to even on some opportunities, but it's not so robust that we think that we're going to have any kind of growth across Canada. And Rob, I don't know if you want to add anything on that.\n\nOperator: Thank you so much. Our next question comes from the line of Krista Friesen with CIBC. Your line is now open.\n\nKrista Friesen: Hi, thanks for taking my question. Just on the refurbishments, it looks like you continue to do them in Q1. Is that progressing kind of as planned in terms of sorting out all the issues with your suppliers and also just the cost to do the refurbishments as well?\n\nRob Blackadar: Yes, absolutely. So, we just had an update just the other day with some of the management team and the Board and shared the same, Krista, that we're pretty pleased that the eight that we have here are kind of the cleanup. If you remember, there's a little bit of a hangover. When we first launched, we put out a lot of our refurbishments out to multiple shops, and we realize there's a more efficient way to do it. These eight are coming from some of these multiple shops and getting cleaned up. We still have a few more but not many. And then the trucks that we're seeing coming out of our one focused shop, we're actually seeing the good cost and pricing that we were expecting. And as I think we had said in Q4, it was a little bit harder whenever we have disparate shops, and they're doing a one-off or one or two trucks at a clip on the cost to be as controlled as it is when we're funneling them all through one. We're satisfied with the one shop and their cost, but the cleanup on some of the ones that we just have received were just slightly higher. If you remember, we had originally said 125 to 150 range, and these were in that 160-ish range. But the shop that we have coalesced on, we're having the main focus of refurbishments on as well within the range that we've shared with investors.\n\nKrista Friesen: Okay, great. And then maybe just on Canada, the results this quarter, is that really just reflecting the delay of some of these large projects? Or are there may be some issues in pushing through increased pricing in Canada and executing on some of the sales strategy up here?\n\nRob Blackadar: Yes. So, certainly, we've had a pricing focus across the entire company. And it's our perspective that we don't believe that pricing is what's driving the volume and lack of volume there in Canada. The reason I feel pretty comfortable with that, Krista is our CPQ pricing engine actually is dynamic in nature. And so as the utilization or the business slows down in a certain branch, the pricing actually will decrease to make sure that we don't lose a deal to keep our utilization on a proper level. As utilization increases, obviously, the pricing will increase. And with that dynamic pricing model, we don't feel like pricing is what the driver is of the revenue decline. But certainly, we keep an eye on it. We're also just in the early stages of starting to track what we call like a lost deal log, and that concept is if you lose a deal, why are we losing? Are we losing to price, are we losing to availability, to service levels or something like that, even to a customer credit issue or something like that? And we haven't. As we're just starting that exercise, we haven't seen any kind of uptick regarding losing a bunch of deals on pricing. We're very mindful of that, though, because very quickly, you can start to lose deals on pricing if you don't keep an eyeball on it, but our Head of Canadian operations and our Head of Sales are -- they watch it like a hawk. Rob, do you want to add anything on that?\n\nRob Dawson: No, I don't think I have anything else to add on that. I mean, obviously, in the winter season when utilization is generally low. And then it was a little lower than anticipated in Q1. That's not the point in time when we're going to be pressing on price either. So, I would say that would just reinforce Rob's comments that we feel that the work we're receiving and the work we're getting is still representative of the full market available, and it's not just a Badger issue.\n\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of [Indiscernible] with Scotia Bank. Your line is now open.\n\nUnknown Analyst: Hi. This is [indiscernible], I'm calling in for Michael. I just wanted to ask, at your recent Investor Relations Day, you spoke about leveraging technology and click management, HR and marketing. I mean I would like you to provide an update on how those initiatives are progressing? And should we look at those initiatives as first time incremental cost before it's an incremental benefit? You know what I mean?\n\nRob Blackadar: Yes. Thanks. And yes, we understand Michael wasn't able to join, so thank you for asking the question. Yes, so we are progressing. If you remember, we said we're going to start toward the end of the year to start to introduce some leveraging data a lot more for some of the business decisions made within the business. And we are progressing along with that on time and on schedule. We've actually had a couple of key stakeholder meetings since Investor Day and structuring our kind of our data warehouse and our data technology and what some of the things are that we're going to start leveraging. So, we're pretty satisfied with that. We built that into our business plan for 2024. So, we feel comfortable there's not going to be a bunch of excessive costs tied to or any kind of major expense jumps tied to this data journey that we're starting. And we feel pretty comfortable with that. We also believe though as the business gets more ramped up leveraging data that it will actually take and drive more efficiency within the business. We see it today as it sits. We leverage today right now a bunch of data on our driving and our drivers behaviors behind the wheel. We leveraged something called [Indiscernible], which is an AI-based and obviously, we are not an AI company. So, I'm cautious leveraging the term AI. But in this case, it's an AI-based system that identifies our drivers' behaviors, and it helps coach and help our drivers drive more safely and more efficiently. And so far, we've actually -- we were chatting about this yesterday in a meeting. We're watching our safety and our statistics and our vehicle incidents and accidents decrease in a big way, and it's tied to leveraging that data. That obviously translates into lower cost regarding insurance, et cetera. And anything we can do to mitigate all the insurance costs that are increasing by showing that we actually are driving safer, more miles, and with less incidents. That's just an example, but we're going to be doing that on steroids. I don't know if you want to talk anything more about the data, Rob.\n\nRob Dawson: One example is just this quarter, we've implemented Fleet TO, as I think Rob has mentioned a number of times over the past while. And that's a fleet management system, and it's providing us with a significant amount of data already, and we've already identified opportunities in our maintenance and repair spend, both in planned maintenance and in other opportunities. We think these savings are going to be material. And it's all part of the plan that we have to increase the scalability of the business. That's just one example. As we roll out a lot of these data platforms and aggregate going forward.\n\nUnknown Analyst: Thank you. Maybe just a final question from my end. I mean could you also just speak on inflationary trends, labor with I mean whatever color you can provide?\n\nRob Blackadar: So, inflation wise, just like every other business in North America and probably even globally, Badger is not immune to inflation and some of the cost pressures we're getting from our own suppliers and vendors, et cetera. We've seen some inflationary pressures on our truck build program and from some of our suppliers because we've been steady state on our manufacturing, which we always felt was going to be the case, but we've become a more predictable customer and consumer for some of our suppliers. We are getting inflationary pressures and some cost increases, but I don't believe we're getting them at the same level as we see some of our competitors who are -- they're not buying necessarily at the same volume at the same steady state as Badger is. As far as labor inflationary pressures, just like with everyone else, our employees expect to be paid and we will pay a fair wage for our employees. Everyone, for the most part, depending on their situation gets an annual raise and that type of thing, but there's nothing out of the ordinary that we're seeing unless you want to add anything regarding inflationary pressures.\n\nRob Dawson: Yes, I would say we've disclosed our truck build costs, and you can see that they've really moderated over the last six quarters, I would say, maybe six to eight quarters. and we're back into a low single-digit inflationary environment, which was elevated into the double-digits two or three years ago. Same thing goes for our operating costs. You see our gross margin ticking up almost 200 points year-on-year at a time when we're seasonally low on revenue, and we do have a pretty good operating leverage/fixed cost environment with our current footprint of branches. So, not only is their low single-digit inflation, there's also a lot of very good work that's underway to partially offset the impact of that inflation. So, it's in no way -- it is fully within the plan that we laid out at our Investor Day that we would be -- continue to be exposed to this level of inflation. And I would say it's all following according to plan so far.\n\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ian Gillies with Stifel. Your line is now open.\n\nIan Gillies: In the U.S., the operating cadence seemed to do pretty well during Q1 given the plethora of weather issues. Can you talk a little bit about the operating cadence so far in Q2 and how you're thinking about it into Q3 and kind of what your customers may be saying?\n\nRob Blackadar: Repeat the question, the phone was scratching a little bit, if you don't mind, Ian?\n\nIan Gillies: No, apologies. I was just asking about what the operating cadence looks like moving into Q2 in the U.S. and Q3 after the business held up quite well in Q1?\n\nRob Blackadar: Yes. So, right now, for Q2, we have started off. We're pretty pleased with everything we've seen for the month of April. Again, we're on -- today is May 2nd, so early yet -- and early into the quarter. But so far, pretty pleased with what we saw at the beginning of the quarter. The biggest thing for us is our end markets, and we chat about this a little bit in the script, certainly in some of our MD&A and documents and our press release us kind of the resiliency of the markets and what we have and what we see as far as Badger's footprint and the ability to capture that. Right now, the markets are -- continue to be very strong in the U.S. and very, very pleased. And you have to remember, like a significant portion of our revenues are U.S.-based. And so we feel like we're in a really good position to capture that. A lot of our projects that we've been bidding and winning are starting to build into a nice kind of a backlog of business going into Q2, the end of Q2 and beginning of Q3. So, we're pleased in how it's set up. We're on almost every single major project across the United States, and we're being a lot more hawkish on that than we ever have been in addition to our local business, and we're pretty pleased with that. So, Rob, anything you want to add on that?\n\nRob Dawson: No, I have nothing to add. I think it's just good to point out that although Canada has been a little soft, it really does show the value of the diversification both in our geography and customer segment base that we talked about, that we do talk about. The value of that is really showing clear because the overall results are still in line with what we're planning on our longer-term objectives.\n\nIan Gillies: And if I could drill in on that a little bit, just because I'm curious. There's obviously a lot of capital being deployed towards semi fabs. The CapEx numbers, quite frankly, astounding. And I was wondering how you're trying to position Badger in and around some of that spending and how you think you can perhaps capture some of that market?\n\nRob Blackadar: Yes. So, very similar to the previous caller in the question is we're actually starting to leverage data like the company has never done before regarding our market share in each one of our largest markets. If you remember from both Investor Day and previous discussions we've had is we have a strategy of focusing on top 10, 12 markets and then looking also at our secondary markets, but really making sure that we are leveraging our market position and the ability to capture and maintain strong market share in each one of those key markets. The upside on that remains very strong. We're very enthusiastic about that. What we're doing, though, is we're now leveraging some data, and we're saying, what is our market share? What is our utilization and what are our returns by each one of those markets and where do we need to basically the concept, if you think about it from a basketball concept, Ian, feed the hot hand. And if there's markets, and we have several that are hot in the United States, we're feeding those hot hands. We're feeding the markets that are hitting. And the beauty of our model being vertically integrated. It's just so unique that we can control doing that. And what it does is it continues to allow us to hit these quarters of growth. And one thing Rob and I are very, very proud of our team and our teams in the field is they're not just growing revenue for the sake of growing revenue in the States, but they're also trying to drive additional margins as well. So, just very proud of that. And Rob, anything you want to add?\n\nIan Gillies: No, that's helpful. And if I could sneak in a third one, and it's a bit more theoretical in nature. The average build cost for a third-party hydrovac now is obviously up significantly from five years ago. And when you look across your markets in the U.S., do you think pricing is anywhere close to reflecting what it needs to be to generate a sufficient return there? Or do you think pricing just naturally has to go higher over the course of time to meet those hurdles?\n\nRob Blackadar: I think -- I don't see cost going -- ever getting to anytime soon getting back to either flat or going back down on any of this. So, absolutely, I feel like Badger has inflationary pressures, but I also feel that some of our competitors in the field, whether they be small mom-and-pop or like a local player with one, two, three hydrovacs, a regional player with maybe 10 to 20 hydrovacs or even, let's just say, a private equity type player that maybe has 100 hydrovacs. I don't see any one of those competitors not having inflationary pressures on all of their costs and especially the truck replacements. So, as people get into the business, if you were able to get into some trucks and you were able to pick them up for -- on the used market, $250,000 to $500,000, on the new market, you picked them up in the past at $400,000 to $600,000. Those same trucks expect the specked the exact same way are $750,000 and higher as brand new fresh off the showroom floor. Rob and I have actually been fortunate enough to talk to not only a few competitors, but several customers who have considered buying hydrovacs and the outlay cost of capital for that is tremendous right now, Ian. I just don't see that going backwards.\n\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Sean Jack with Raymond James Ltd. Your line is now open.\n\nSean Jack: Hey good morning guys. So, I know that you don't have a crystal ball, but just thinking about with how strong U.S. markets are looking right now and some of the past performance you've been having, is it possible that we see U.S. EBITDA margins hit or exceed the upper end of the range in the back half of the year that was set out in the Investor Day?\n\nRob Dawson: Hi Sean, it's Rob here. I would say it's very premature to be revising the guidance that we provided at Investor Day six or eight weeks ago. So, I do believe that there are opportunities, as I said at that meeting to be in the lower end of that range on a consolidated basis over the next few years, and we still see that opportunity for sure. And there might be some great quarters that pop us into that range. But I think we're going to be more focused on our trailing four-quarter margins, as I mentioned in our prepared script of this call and making sure that we have sustainable growth in those margins.\n\nSean Jack: Great. Okay, makes sense. And then I'm not sure if it was touched upon in an earlier question, but just to do with the Canadian trucks, wondering if there's any opportunities, obviously, you're looking to pull retirements forward and retire the fleet. Is there any opportunities to dispose of them? Is there any sources of demand that you guys could be able to find to look to get a bit of a return on those assets?\n\nRob Blackadar: So, yes, I'll cover that one. This is Rob Blackadar, Sean. Yes, so we actually dispose of all of our trucks a handful of ways. One of them is through public auctions that are non-reserve such as like a Ritchie Brothers or someone like that, Taylor Martin truck auctions. And other things we do is we will sell them on the private market if we feel we can get better on the private market than we can at the public auctions. And we have a whole team that is on the disposition side of it. We do not sell though -- we're very similar the way Badger views our fleet. We're very similar to the waste business and similar to the concrete cement business. And in both those industries, they don't sell used trucks as a whole truck on purpose because we don't want to be competing against our same trucks at a much lower cost basis because we believe we have a pretty strong truck. And so just like in the waste business or the cement business, they will take their tool off the back of a chassis. It could be a trash compactor, it could be a cement bowl, a cement mixer, They remove the component off the back. We did the same thing with our hydrovac. We removed the hydrovac componentry off the back. We will refurb it or repurpose it for used parts for other trucks within our fleet, and we sell just the chassis. Do I suspect at some future time, we want to sell our whole units, we can get some really strong pricing? Probably, but we would also potentially be competing against our own trucks that in our world, we just -- we've never had that program in place, and I don't see us changing that model today.\n\nOperator: Thank you. I am showing no further questions at this time. I would now like to turn it back to Rob Blackadar for closing remarks.\n\nRob Blackadar: Thank you, operator. And on behalf of all of us at Badger, thanks to our customers, our employees, suppliers, and shareholders for your ongoing support that drives Badger's success. Operator, you may now end the call. Thank you.\n\nOperator: Thank you for your participation in today's conference. This does conclude the program.

Currently, all participants are in a listen-only mode, and at the end of the call, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. This call is being recorded today, May 2, 2024, and contains time-sensitive accurate information only today. Earlier, IRADIMED released its financial results for the first quarter of 2024. A copy of this press release announcing the Company's earnings is available under the heading News on the website, iradimed.com. A copy of the press release was also furnished to the Securities and Exchange Commission on Form 8-K and can be found at sec.gov. This call is being broadcast live over the Internet on the Company's website at iramimed.com.\n\nAnd a replay will be available on the website for the next 90 days. Some of the information in today's session will constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements focused on future performance, results, plans and events and may include the Company's expected future results. IRADIMED reminds you that future results may differ materially from these forward-looking statements due to several risk factors. For a description of relevant risks and uncertainties that may affect the Company's business, please see the Risk Factors section of the Company's most recent reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, which may be obtained free from the SEC website at sec.gov.\n\nI would like to turn the call over to Roger Susi, President and Chief Executive Officer of IRADIMED CORPORATION. Mr. Susi?\n\nRoger Susi: Good morning. Thank you all for joining us on today's call. As recently reported, I'm once again very pleased to announce yet another consecutive quarter of record IRADIMED net revenue generated in our recent Q1 2024 quarter. This is our 11th revenue increase in a row. As this morning's press release announced, in the first quarter of 2024, revenue came in at $17.6 million, representing a 13.7% increase over the first quarter of '23. GAAP diluted earnings per share for the first quarter were $0.32. While non-GAAP diluted earnings were $0.36 per share, a 20% increase over Q1 of '23. All product lines performed well with our inside and outside teams executing exceptionally well. From the revenue standpoint in Q1, the MR patient monitor bested the IV pump and increased by 38%, compared to Q1 of '23.\n\nHowever, this doesn't show the strength of one product line over the other as bookings for the MR IV pump product in Q1, greatly exceeded expectations. So we actually expect that in Q2, the table may turn in favor of pump revenue. As I previously discussed, we notified customers with pumps seven years and older that our extended maintenance would no longer be offered for such older devices. This, as expected, has prompted the uptick in pump orders we've seen in Q1, which we hope to continue to see in the upcoming quarters as well. To be sure, our major products remain viable and fitting for their markets, while we continue to make inroads with our newer FMD product. Previously, I had spoken about reducing our delivery time for disposables and the associated reduction of backlog, though as seen in financial disclosures, the disposable business remains strong and growing, we have managed to reduce the lead time of these products and continue to work to improve these lead times, though orders continue growing, production is not outpaced.\n\nAlong those lines, we recently began construction on our new 61,000 square foot manufacturing facility here in Orlando, Florida, to consolidate operations, improve efficiencies and prepare for the continued and expanding growth we foresee. We anticipate spending approximately $13 million on its development over the next 12 months. And we will keep you posted in these coming quarters as construction progresses towards a moving date. Now regarding the progress of our 510(k) submission for the new 3870 MRI IV pump. The team is focused and pushing very hard, yet we are still not quite there due primarily to some expanded testing. As previously reported, we have engaged a third-party consultant with two very recent ex-FDA reviewers on their staff, from whom we are getting excellent input.\n\nTheir feedback has, however, driven us to repeat some of the previous tests, mainly because of devices under test for many months ago, and they have undergone some changes. Our ex-FDA consultants sleeve, the FDA would be much more comfortable with all testing done on the absolute final configuration of the device. Therefore, the aim is to have the test reports referenced, the very latest version of the device, thus removing any questions, is anticipated that these steps should impact the delivery of the 510(k) by approximately 9 to 10 weeks. Still remain on plan with expected clearance in Q1 2025 and plan to show the revenue from the new device in the back half of 2025. Now I'd like to present our expected financial performance guidance for the coming quarter and the balance of the year.\n\nFor the second quarter of 2024 financial guidance, we expect revenues of $17.6 million to $17.8 million. GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.33 to $0.36 and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.36 to $0.39. We reiterate our guidance for the full year of 2024. We expect to report revenues of $72 million to $74 million, with GAAP diluted earnings per share of $1.37 to $1.47 and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $1.52 to $1.62. Lastly, I'm pleased to report that our Board of Directors has declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.15, payable on May 30, 2024. And we expect to pay the quarterly cash dividend going forward, to reward our loyal shareholders. Now I'd like to turn the call over to Jack Glenn, our CFO, to review the quarter's financial results.\n\nJack Glenn: Thank you, Roger, and good morning, everyone. As in the past, our results have been reported on both a GAAP and non-GAAP basis. You can find a description of our non-GAAP operating measures in this morning's earnings release and a reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to the GAAP measure on the last page of today's release. As we reported earlier this morning, revenue in the first quarter of 2024 was $17.6 million, an increase of 14% compared to the first quarter of 2023. Domestic sales increased 12% to $13.4 million and International sales increased 20% to $4.2 million. Overall, Domestic revenue accounted for 76% of total revenue for Q1 2024 compared to 77% for Q1 2023. Device revenue increased 13% to $11.9 million, driven by a 38% increase in Monitor revenue.\n\nRevenue from Disposables and Services increased 17% to a record $5.2 million for the first quarter of 2024, while our maintenance contracts remained stable at $487,000. The gross margin was 76.1% for the first 2024 quarter compared to 75.7% for the 2023 quarter. The increase in gross margin is primarily due to increased revenue, decreased raw material costs and direct labor efficiencies offset by overhead spending. Operating expenses were $8.6 million or 49% of revenue compared to $7.7 million or 50% of revenue for the first quarter of 2023. On a dollar basis, this increase is primarily due to higher sales and marketing expenses for higher sales commissions, sales activity expenses and payroll and benefit expenses. As a result, income from operations grew 18.5% to $4.7 million for the 2024 first quarter.\n\nWe recognized a tax expense of approximately $1.1 million during the first quarter of 2024, resulting in an effective tax rate of 21.1% for the quarter, which was in line with the effective tax rate of 20.9% in 2023. On a GAAP basis, net income was $0.32 per diluted share compared to $0.27 for the 2023 quarter. On a non-GAAP basis, adjusted net income was $0.36 per diluted share for the 2024 first quarter, compared to $0.30 for the first quarter of 2023. Cash from operations was $3.9 million for the three months ending March 31, 2024, down from $4.6 million for the same period in 2023. For the three months ended March 31, 2024, our free cash flow, a non-GAAP measure, was $3.4 million. This compares to a negative free cash flow figure of $1.9 million in the first quarter of 2023, when we purchased the land for our future facility for $6.2 million.\n\nOur cash and cash equivalents totaled $45.1 million as of March 31, 2024. And with that, I will now turn the call over to the operator for questions.\n\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Jason Wittes of ROTH Capital Partners.", "source": {"uri": "ca.finance.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo!

My name is Matt and I'll be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to Viad Corp's First Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Carrie Long, you may begin your conference.\n\nCarrie Long: Good afternoon and thank you for joining us for Viad's 2024 first quarter earnings conference call. We issued our earnings press release after the market closed today, along with an earnings presentation, which are both available on our website at viad.com. We will be referring to specific pages from the presentation during the call as we discuss their business performance and outlook. And I'd like to point out that our earnings press release and presentation contain important disclosures regarding non-GAAP measures that we'll be referring to during the call, including adjusted EBITDA and adjusted net loss. During the call, you'll hear from Steven Moster, our President and CEO and President of GES; Ellen Ingersoll, our Chief Financial Officer; and David Barry, President of Pursuit. Before turning the call over to Steve, I'd like to remind everyone that certain statements made during the call, which are not historical facts, may constitute forward-looking statements. Information concerning business and other risk factors that could cause actual results to materially differ from those in the forward-looking statements can be found in our annual, quarterly and other current reports filed with the SEC. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Steve, who will start on Page 4 of our earnings presentation.\n\nSteven Moster: Thanks, Carrie, and thanks to all of you for joining our call. I am happy to report that our first quarter results were in line with our expectations, and we're off to a strong start for 2024. GES' strong first quarter performance drove margin expansion with healthy revenue growth and Pursuit delivered 14% revenue growth during the seasonally slower period and successfully launched its new FlyOver Chicago attraction. We are optimistic about the year ahead and are maintaining our favorable outlook for strong growth as positive trends continue for both businesses. We're in a position of strength with accelerating business activity on the horizon and expect to deliver approximately 16% to 30% year-over-year growth in our full year consolidated adjusted EBITDA. At Pursuit, we have an exciting peak summer season ahead and are on track to continue setting new records for both revenue and EBITDA this year. We're seeing signs of robust demand for our destinations and experiences, including FlyOver Chicago. At GES, we expect to continue delivering impressive profitable growth this year from healthy industry demand, our strong non-annual show schedule and our transformed margin profile. Now let's get into the details, starting with Ellen, who will review our financial performance and guidance.\n\nEllen Ingersoll: Thanks, Steve. I'll start on Page 6 with our consolidated first quarter results. Revenue increased $12.7 million or 4.9% year-over-year with healthy growth at both Pursuit and GES. Consolidated adjusted EBITDA increased $0.9 million, and our first quarter adjusted net loss improved by $0.3 million. Our GAAP basis net loss attributable to Viad was $4.2 million higher than the 2023 first quarter, primarily reflecting increased non-operational items and income tax expense. As a reminder, our 2023 first quarter GAAP net loss included a $2.1 million favorable tax matter. As shown on Page 7, Pursuit's first quarter revenue grew $4.6 million or 14% year-over-year, and adjusted EBITDA decreased by $0.8 million during the seasonally slow period. Pursuit's revenue growth was led by attraction ticket revenue, which increased 25% due to higher effective ticket prices and a 10% increase in visitors. We saw a particularly strong demand for our Sky Lagoon attraction in Iceland and our new FlyOver Chicago attraction that opened in March. Pursuit's adjusted EBITDA decline primarily reflects increased operating cost to support higher business volume. And as we move into the next 2 quarters of higher activity, revenue growth will more than offset our wider seasonal loss. As shown on Page 8, GES delivered consolidated revenue growth of $8.1 million or 3.6% and adjusted EBITDA growth of $2.2 million during the first quarter. When adjusting to exclude the unfavorable impact of major non-annual shows, GES' first quarter year-over-year revenue growth was about 6%. Spiro delivered revenue growth of $0.9 million or 1.5%. Excluding the impact of major non-annual events, Spiro's revenue growth rate was about 7% versus the 2020 first quarter, driven by strong spending from existing and new clients. GES Exhibitions delivered revenue growth of $6.3 million or 3.7%. Excluding the impact of major non-annual events, GES Exhibitions revenue growth rate was about 5% versus the 2023 first quarter as show sizes continued to improve. We ended the 2024 first quarter with total liquidity of $137.2 million, comprising $48.8 million in cash and $88.4 million of available capacity on our revolving credit facility. Our first quarter cash flow from operations was an outflow of $7.5 million, which was lower than expected due to working capital timing. Our capital expenditures totaled $20.7 million, including approximately $8 million of growth CapEx at Pursuit. We ended the quarter with $488.4 million of debt, and our net leverage ratio was 2.7x, which is near the low end of our target ratio range of 2.5x to 3.5x. While we are comfortable with our level of debt and strong liquidity position, we've been focused on lowering the cost of our debt. On April 26, we successfully repriced our Term Loan B, which had a remaining outstanding balance of $320 million at the end of the quarter. I'm very pleased to say that we reduced our borrowing rate by 75 basis points to SOFR plus 4.25% and remove the additional silver credit spread adjustment. This repricing will reduce our annual interest cost by more than $2.5 million. Next, I'll cover our 2024 outlook on Page 9 before turning the call over to David for additional color on Pursuit. We continue to expect very strong growth in full year consolidated adjusted EBITDA and are reaffirming our guidance range of $171 million to $191 million. For Pursuit, we continue to expect full year adjusted EBITDA to be in the range of $105 million to $115 million on mid-single-digit revenue growth with a full year adjusted EBITDA margin of about 30% as compared to 26.4% in 2023. For Pursuit's second quarter, we expect adjusted EBITDA to be in the range of $20 million to $24 million as compared to $19.5 million in the 2023 second quarter. For GES, we continue to expect full year adjusted EBITDA to be in the range of $80 million to $90 million as compared to $68.2 million in 2023, with a full year adjusted EBITDA margin of about 8.5% as compared to 7.7% in 2023. We expect CES to deliver low double-digit revenue growth, including about $65 million of net incremental revenue from major non-annual shows. We expect GES' second quarter adjusted EBITDA to be in the range of $34.5 million to $38.5 million versus $26.8 million in the 2023 second quarter. We expect new wins and continued underlying growth to more than offset the impact of major non-annual shows which are expected to negatively impact revenue by about $10 million during the second quarter. With the meaningful full year EBITDA growth we are anticipating, we also expect very strong operating cash flow, particularly in the third quarter with Pursuit's seasonal contribution and GES' two largest non-annual shows taking place. For the full year, we continue to anticipate an operating cash inflow in the range of $120 million to $140 million, and we are planning for full year capital expenditures of $65 million to $70 million, including growth CapEx of about $20 million at Pursuit. We are committed to being good stewards of shareholder capital and will balance value-enhancing growth investments with maintaining a strong balance sheet and ample liquidity. I also want to quickly comment on our expectations for tax expense, which absent guidance from us is very challenging to model given our jurisdictional tax positions. For the full year, we anticipate an effective tax rate of 27% to 28%. And during the second quarter, we expect an effective tax rate of 15% to 16%. Now David and Steve will provide further insight into our business performance and the exciting growth coming our way at Pursuit and GES. David, over to you.\n\nDavid Barry: Thanks, Ellen. All right. Let's dive into Pursuit. We've had an encouraging start to what should be another year of record-setting revenue and EBITDA and continued margin expansion. I'll start by discussing our attractions performance on Page 11. Pursuit's year-round bucket list attraction started 2024 with strong momentum. Our ticket revenue grew approximately 25% to $18 million, and this was driven by the powerful delivery of our guest experiences, an impressive increase in visitation, which was up about 10%, and continued focus on our revenue maximization and pricing initiatives. Our same-store ticket revenue grew by 18% year-over-year, with substantially higher effective ticket prices. Sky Lagoon was a big contributor to our success with robust demand for the geothermal attraction experience in Iceland. We continue to benefit from the increase in volcanic activity that has affected certain parts of the country, bringing more visitors into the center of Reykjavik. Iceland has been experiencing higher visitation and our team has done a terrific job growing the business and increasing awareness at Sky Lagoon. Additionally, on March 1st, we successfully opened our new world-class attraction, FlyOver Chicago. It is a phenomenal experience with an exhilarating flight ride that captures the story and spirit of Chicago. We have an ideal location at Navy Pier, which sees about 9 million visitors each year. In our first month of operation, we have strong visitation, received really favorable reviews, and delivered positive adjusted EBITDA. We're well positioned for a solid first year for our newest build growth investment. So next, on Page 12 for hospitality. Our one-of-a-kind lodges delivered solid room revenue performance of about $8 million during the seasonally slower period. We experienced some softness early in the year from unfavorable weather and ski conditions within our destinations. But as conditions normalize later in the quarter, results rebounded quickly with about 7% year-over-year room revenue growth in March, and our team did an incredible job maximizing revenue, and hustled to offset the weaker early season. The Forest Park Alpine Hotel that we opened in 2022 continues to be a solid build to growth investment in addition to our portfolio. This elevated forest-inspired property in the heart of the mountain town of Jasper realized strong year-over-year room revenue and RevPAR increases during the quarter. Additionally, the new Founder's Cabins that we added to Pyramid Lake Lodge last summer contributed incremental room revenue and available rooms during the quarter. These new accommodations are a great example of a recent successful refresh growth investment that enhance the guest experience and expanded capacity within our existing well-performing business. We continue to expect growth in full year room revenue in RevPAR as our seasonal properties ramp open in the coming months. Our hospitality businesses are in iconic destinations with strong perennial demand. And as this demand builds into the season, it creates compression in the market. Iconic destinations with strong perennial demand, a finite bed base and high occupancy, when you combine it together with pricing power, it's a great recipe for success. As shown on Page 13, our room revenue on the books for 2024 is ahead of this time last year with strong improvements in ADRs for both our Canadian and U.S. lodging properties. This early booking pacing trend is encouraging, and I'm optimistic about the peak season ahead. Lodging pacing is a leading indicator of destination demand and the strength we're seeing in advanced booking supports our favorable outlook for both our lodging and our attractions. We continue to expect favorable leisure travel trends and the prioritization of discretionary spend on experiences. And we provide the iconic, unforgettable and inspiring bucket list experiences that global travelers are looking for. So overall revenue growth, you can see on Page 14, our overall revenue growth trajectory. For the first 3 months of the year, our revenue increased about 14% and set a new record for the first quarter. We continue to expect full year revenue to grow mid-single digits from strong guest demand, pricing power and increased visitation from both home and abroad. We're gearing up for a busy peak summer season, and we're in great shape from a seasonal staffing perspective. Next let's look at Page 15 and discuss our adjusted EBITDA margin expansion. For the full year, we expect to drive further margin improvement and achieve our target adjusted EBITDA margin of about 30% through higher attraction visitation with strong throughput, revenue management, and careful focus on labor and expense management. We're ready to deliver another year of record-breaking results with our full year adjusted EBITDA expected to be in the range of $105 million to $115 million, and this is about triple the amount of EBITDA we produced in 2015 and reflects the strength of our powerful refresh build by growth strategy. Our results will benefit from our newest build investment, FlyOver Chicago, as well as other smaller refresh investments at our well instrumented and high-performing existing experiences. These refresh investments include expanding the wellness ritual at Sky Lagoon in Iceland, launching a new tour experience at the Columbia Icefield Adventure in Jasper, expanding our guest capacity with a new boat at Maligne Lake and opening a new food and beverage experience at the West Glacier Village in Montana. So now let's talk about our exciting future beyond 2024 with continued profitable growth. Looking ahead, we expect continued multiyear margin expansion with a goal of reaching an adjusted EBITDA margin of 33%. We remain very focused on boosting our profitability and believe that 33% is the optimal level for our business, while still having appropriate resources to continue to deliver great staff and guest experiences, maintain our assets, maximize our pricing power and successfully deliver additional growth investments. Our remarkable journey to meaningfully scale Pursuit is ongoing, and our successful refresh build by strategy remains unchanged. We have a strong pipeline of organic and inorganic investment opportunities to help accelerate our growth in 2025 and beyond. And everything we do is in support of our vision for what Pursuit is becoming. Our vision is to be the world's leading provider of iconic bucket list attractions and vertically integrated hospitality experiences. So just as I conclude my remarks, most importantly, I just want to say a big thank you to our Pursuit team members who have been working hard to get us ready for a kickoff to the season and to create extraordinary experiences and lasting memories for our guests and staff in '24. Steve, back to you.\n\nSteven Moster: Thanks, David. Now let's switch over to GES, starting with GES Exhibition trends on Page 17. Same-show revenue and same-show event sizes are key revenue drivers for the GES Exhibition business. I'm very happy to see that both metrics continue to improve year-over-year versus pre-pandemic levels. As I've discussed on past calls, our same-show revenue metric has returned to pre-pandemic levels as our exhibition team has done an incredible job delivering great service and growing revenue per square foot of event space through smart pricing and compelling service offerings. However, the size of event as measured by same-show square footage remains about 10% below pre-pandemic levels. We see this as a meaningful opportunity for further revenue and margin growth as event sizes continue to recover, which we believe will continue through 2025. And given GES' flexible cost structure, each incremental same show dollar flows to EBITDA at a high rate. We're encouraged by the favorable trends we're seeing and strong demand within the event industry. Our well-established leadership position in key trade show markets, long-standing client relationships and multiyear contracts with high renewal rates put us in a strong position to retain and grow events. Entering this year, GES Exhibitions' revenue was already over 90% sold and under contract. We are well positioned for a solid year of performance from exhibitions. Now let's talk about Spiro on Page 18. Spiro is built for strong revenue growth of high single to low double digits from new and existing clients in the large fragmented growing experiential marketing market. As one of the few experiential marketing agencies with end-to-end capabilities and global reach, we are well positioned for growth. Our winning growth strategy is focused on retaining, growing and expanding our clients. Starting with retain, it is important that we maintain our marquee client base and use it as a foundation for future growth. Spiro already has strong positions with leading companies in targeted industries. We represent over 1,500 corporate clients and the best of the best. Moving to grow. We are focused on accelerating our existing client revenue with new products and services beyond the trade show floor to pursue untapped revenue opportunities. Next, expand. We're utilizing our competitive differentiators, including unmatched global capabilities to penetrate new markets and acquire new clients. I'm very pleased to share that we have now reached a total of 60 new client wins since launching Spiro as a discrete experiential marketing agency within GES in early 2022. This is a testament to the strength of the Spiro team and capabilities as well as the importance of experiential marketing as a means for brands to connect with customers in a powerful way. On Page 19, you can see GES' overall revenue growth trajectory. GES is experiencing improved industry dynamics and steady underlying growth. When adjusting to remove the impact of major non-annual events, GES' consolidated revenue grew by 6% in the first quarter. For GES Exhibitions, that growth rate was about 5%, driven by same-show revenue growth. Notably, U.S. exhibition same-show revenue grew about 6% and event sizes grew about 2% compared to the prior year first quarter. For Spiro, the adjusted growth rate was about 7%, driven by our success winning new clients and growing revenue from existing clients. Corporate marketing budgets are exceeding 2019 levels as corporate marketers are finding new ways to engage with their target audiences through experiential marketing. Additionally, participation at trade shows and conferences continues to improve, and the demand for trade show services is approaching 2019 levels. These favorable trends, along with a strong major non-annual show schedule, give us confidence in our outlook for the full year. As Ellen mentioned earlier, we continue to expect GES to deliver full year revenue growth in the low double-digit range. The GES team is laser-focused on executing our client experiences in front of us. The second and third quarters of this year will be particularly strong for GES. The second quarter will benefit from a high volume of new business wins, and the third quarter will see incremental revenue of about $85 million to $90 million from major non-annual shows. The most significant new event for the second quarter is the McDonald's 2024 Worldwide Convention, which is one of the largest client projects Spiro will deliver this year. And it's a terrific example of the power of the GES collective where Spiro provides the sizzle and GES Exhibitions provides the infrastructure. During April, team members across Spiro and GES Exhibitions came together to transform the Fira de Barcelona into a temporary center for McDonald's megabrand. Led by Spiro's strategy, creative and production talent, and supported by GES' logistical capabilities, we partnered with McDonald's to create a high-impact community experience for 14,000 internal and supply chain stakeholders from across the globe. Now let's take a look at Page 20 and discuss our adjusted EBITDA margin expansion. I'm very happy with the results that we're seeing from our efforts to drive margin improvement at GES. We achieved an 8% adjusted EBITDA margin for the first quarter, which is up 70 basis points year-over-year. Our transformed cost structure is paying dividends. With our strong major non-annual shows scheduled this year and our ongoing focus on efficiency gains, we expect to deliver an adjusted EBITDA margin of about 8.5% for the full year. Now let's talk about our exciting future beyond 2024 with continued profitable growth. GES is focused on maintaining revenue levels in 2025 despite the unfavorable impact of major non-annual shows. GES Exhibitions is already selling and winning events in 2025 and beyond. And Spiro continues to add to its client roster and work with existing clients to support them across a wider spectrum of experiential marketing activities. Additionally, we have a robust multiyear road map of lean initiatives to enhance our margin each year. We expect to hold at or above our 8% adjusted EBITDA margin target beyond 2024 with and without the benefit of our major non-annual shows. The fundamental changes we made to reduce GES Exhibitions' cost structure and build Spiro growth capabilities have transformed GES' margin profile. Now in closing, we're thrilled with our performance and the strength we are seeing across our businesses as well as the bright future we see ahead of us. We remain committed to our strategy to create extraordinary experiences and strong returns for our shareholders. I want to thank our hardworking and dedicated employees and our shareholders for your continued support in Viad. And with that, we'll open up the call for questions.\n\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] The first question is from the line of Bryan Maher with B. Riley Securities. Your line is now open.\n\nBryan Maher: Great. Thank you, and good afternoon. My questions mainly are on the Pursuit side. Maybe starting with Iceland. Is there - maybe you can update us as to what the current situation is with the volcanic activity in Blue Lagoon. Is Blue Lagoon still shut down? Maybe just a little bit more color there would be helpful.\n\nDavid Barry: Sure, Bryan. So a couple of things. One is visitation to Iceland overall is up. It was up in February, it was up in March. And so both airlift and visitation into the country is strong. There are periodic closures at that part of - in that part of the country where the Blue Lagoon is located. They may be closed for several days and then reopening. Overall, what it's done is on the days when there has been volcanic activity, it drives visitation into the center of Reykjavik because people have perhaps planned to go in one direction and because of road closures, are heading in a different direction back into the center. So definitely, it's been beneficial for Sky Lagoon in terms of visitation. Overall, though Iceland's on its way to have a really, really strong summer. It's increased airlift from across Western Europe and North America. So no red lights there at all. All green lights.\n\nBryan Maher: And maybe moving on to Chicago FlyOver, can you draw any correlation or lessons learned from opening Las Vegas and how that possibly helped with the opening of FlyOver Chicago? Or are they just such different markets that the dynamics between the two don't correlate?\n\nDavid Barry: Yes. I mean I think we're seeing very strong response in Chicago, really strong visitation out of the gate in our first month, definitely tracking well and positive EBITDA in the first month. So we're happy with that. I think our presence at Navy Pier the fact that we're working together with the other attractions there. It's a much less competitive market than in Las Vegas. And I think it's a very compelling story. So while we see continued improvement in Las Vegas, we see an incredibly strong start in Chicago, and that's going quite well.\n\nBryan Maher: And then just last for me. On Pursuit RevPAR for this upcoming year, putting the first quarter aside for a minute, I think when we look at lodging names that we cover, it's generally kind of low to mid-single digit RevPAR expectations in the U.S. I know that with what you've done in Canada, you expect kind of some stronger activity there. But do you have any general thoughts on RevPAR numbers as you look at bookings for this upcoming season?\n\nDavid Barry: Yes. Good question, Bryan. I think first, I would look more globally at how we're pacing for the summer. So there's a few factors that really drive our performance and our sense of confidence for the coming year. Number one, consumer confidence overall is higher year-over-year. Secondly, we're on trend in terms of experiences over things, and that's a very positive momentum behind us. We have a strong U.S. dollar, which corresponds to a weak Canadian dollar, which drives tourism into Canada. We have an increase in airlift into each of our destination gateways. Canadian lodging, you'll see that on Slide 13, pacing up 24%, ADR at 14% in the U.S., up 3%, ADR up 9%. We're deliberately managing inventory in the U.S., which is really a positive. Our iconic locations also benefit from compression. So unlike city hotels or hotels on the side of the highway and select service and a variety of other comparables, the compare set is quite different. So for us, we see this - all of this momentum driving a strong season. Things early indicators like our Pursuit Pass, which is up double digits. Compression end markets drives yield, which correspondingly will drive RevPAR. And we're being quite selective, especially in our U.S. properties where we've learned that it's not beneficial to sell everything in March and April. In fact, we are holding on to inventory and as we get closer to-date, releasing that at much higher yields. So, we feel quite confident and we are benefiting also from bundling attraction product with our lodging products. So, we have a real strong feeling of momentum heading into the season.\n\nBryan Maher: And then just last for me on the GES side. I mean it's only been not two months since you just reported fourth quarter numbers. But it doesn't appear on the surface and we hadn't been able to drill down since you have released the information about an hour ago. But it doesn't seem like there is a whole lot of difference in the new GES kind of outlook versus where we were six weeks, seven weeks ago. Is that the proper way to think about it?\n\nSteven Moster: Yes, absolutely, Bryan. I mean I think the trend has been consistent for several quarters now as on the exhibition side, the revenue on a same-show basis and the square footage on a same-show basis continue to improve year-over-year, and that's a trend that we think will continue throughout the year. And on the Spiro side of the business, we continue to have a very compelling offering and being able to win new clients and bring them onboard. So, yes, we continue to kind of deliver on the same path that we have been on for the last couple of quarters.\n\nOperator: Thank you for your question. Next question is from the line of Tyler Batory with Oppenheimer. Your line is now open.\n\nUnidentified Analyst: Hi. Good afternoon. This is Jonathan on for Tyler. Thanks for taking my questions. First one for me on GES, a two-part question. Steve, we have talked about this in the past, but can you just give us an update on the bridge to recovering the same-show square footage back to 2019 levels? Is that still a 2025 story, or how are you thinking about that? And then secondly, can you speak on the sustainability of pricing power? And should we expect that 8% gap between the same-show revenue and the same-show square footage to stay consistent as square footage presumably recovers next year?\n\nSteven Moster: Yes. So, I would refer back to kind of Page 17 within our investor presentation. I think it's important to look at the growth year-over-year. You want to compare a quarter year-over-year because sometimes the mix of shows and the type of shows within the quarter will vary from quarter-to-quarter. So, I think what we saw in the first quarter was a continuation of really strong growth, both in the revenue on a show basis, but also in the square footage going up, getting very close to the flat with 2019 in terms of revenue and still being down about 10%. I think this trend will continue going through - probably through '25 until we have a full recovery. And then it will grow beyond 25%. So, this is kind of in line with kind of our expectations for the business, and it has been for the last couple of quarters. So, we feel very good about that. Additionally, you asked about the pricing power within the business. We have done a very good job over the last 1.5 years or so of garnering significant price increases that helped drive the business forward. I see our ability to continue doing that going forward kind of in the mid-single digit range, and you will continue to see a gap between the revenue on a same-show basis versus the square footage on a same-show basis. So, we are going to continue to drive everything we can to drive revenue on these individual shows. And pricing is one major component of it.\n\nUnidentified Analyst: Okay. Excellent. Thank you for all the color on that. And then switching gears to the Pursuit side of things, you gave some pacing statistics in terms of bookings. And I am just interested if you can give a little more detail kind of what you are seeing more real time in bookings, etcetera. When we start to look at the peak summer season, is there any sense of weakness or slowing starting to emerge in the consumer traveler that you guys are seeing?\n\nDavid Barry: None. Yes, it's pacing strongly behavior in terms of spending, guest spend per visit, advanced demand for things like restaurant bookings and specific sites seeing tours. I would say that all of the channels are experiencing strong demand. We are not seeing any weakening at all in terms of spend and actually are being judicious in terms of selling out on a variety of things because we are - we know the demand is coming, and we are just really managing inventory effectively and being attentive to maximizing price and managing availability.\n\nUnidentified Analyst: Okay. Great. Appreciate the color. And then maybe last one for me. Helpful commentary on FlyOver Chicago, was that bill completed? Any early color on markets that might make sense for further expansion of FlyOver and maybe an update on Toronto, if there is any or if you can provide on?\n\nDavid Barry: I will start with Toronto. So, ongoing progress with Canada lands in the City of Toronto, and we will have an update on that, I think in the coming months, but that continues. Really no speculation as to further locations, we are working on improving the performance in Las Vegas and really managing the very successful launch of Chicago. And we are focused also on looking into the future, we have got a great pipeline of both organic and inorganic opportunities within. And so very focused on our iconic locations, very focused on things that no integration risk, no new market risk, things where we can invest within our specific business and improve. And so we have a long list of great refresh projects. We have a long list of other opportunities in each geography, and that would be our focus going forward.\n\nUnidentified Analyst: Okay. Perfect. Thank you for all the color. That's all for me.\n\nDavid Barry: Thank you.\n\nOperator: Thank you for your question. The next question is from the line of Alex Fuhrman with Craig-Hallum. Your line is now open. Alex, please check if you are on mute.\n\nAlex Fuhrman: Hi guys. Sorry about that. Thank you very much for taking my question here. I wanted to ask, if I could, about what you are seeing on the Pursuit side in terms of group travel. It seems like over the past year or so, pretty much everything has been working really well for you guys. Probably the one thing that has not materialized as we would all hope has been travel from China to North America has been really disappointing and remains well below pre-COVID level. So, I am wondering what you are expecting for this year in terms of the group travel business? And are you seeing other countries kind of stepping in here and replacing the volume that's presumably not being made back from Chinese group tours?\n\nDavid Barry: Thanks Alex. That's a great question. With China, I think you always have to consider Asia in its entirety. So, while the Chinese market has not fully recovered and is beginning to travel, there is a few really interesting things that are happening. So, airlift, as an example, out of Japan into North America, so both Canada and the U.S. Canada specifically is about 111% greater than what it was pre-pandemic, which is quite interesting when you look at lift from Tokyo. And then if you think about Asian travel, WestJet, which is the Canadian version of Southwest has launched direct flights from Vancouver to Seoul. And so those flights have been added. And then Air Canada is increasing flights to Hong Kong, larger aircraft to Shanghai. They have extended seasonal service to Bangkok and they launched new direct routes from Vancouver to Singapore. So, the airlift out of Asia, excluding China for a second, the airlift out of Asia is increasing, which is driving visitation and growth from those particular markets. What's quite interesting is China recovering and it is happening more slowly, but that's giving room and inventory to other countries that are taking on that inventory. So, specifically Korea, specifically some growth coming out of India and then strong growth coming out of Japan. As China does return, what's interesting is that will drive compression and then in turn driving yield because we set aside a finite number of rooms that we allocate into the group market. So, attractions are performing well. We have got the Icefield's returning to its levels, and that's taking a little bit longer than we would have hoped, given its history and dependence on Chinese tourism travel. But the other channels coming out of Asia are performing well. One interesting fact is China has worked hard to eliminate these requirements. And one of the growing segments now, the third biggest segment going into Iceland, is actually Chinese travel. So, quite interesting to see that growth accelerate. And so I expect that things will normalize. This year, we have, I think really good demand from our various tour and travel partners. Team has done a good job of reallocating inventory where China perhaps might be a little bit behind allocating more space to other tour and travel partners. On a forward look for '25 because we are actively contracted for '25, our demand from Asian partners increasing, and that's happening also now as we are in the contracting process for '26 because we operate two seasons generally ahead in those categories. So, not a complete return from China, but definitely growing and then strong performance from across Asia, so things are looking positive for the summer.\n\nAlex Fuhrman: Great. That's really helpful. Appreciate that data. And then you mentioned the Columbia Icefield. I am curious that the groups that are coming from elsewhere in Asia are showing the same proclivity to do the Icefield Adventure and the Skywalk and stay at the Glacier new lodge. I believe those properties really catered a lot more to that Chinese market, or are you seeing the productivity of those assets start to recover alongside the rest of your assets?\n\nDavid Barry: We are. And I think that it's also something to remember that the Chinese group travel primarily was very, very early season and later on in the season. So, there is still white space to fill there. So, we are working to fill that. If you recall, last year we talked a lot about the Pursuit path, and you were able to see a little bit of those different attractions when you visit it. The Pursuit path is tracking quite well. We are double digits ahead of where we were at this time last year. So, that's encouraging because that bolsters all of the attractions through the Banff Jasper Collection. And so we are pleased with that. And that pre-commitment is important because folks are betting, they are going to do all the activities, and that's why they are buying the frequency product, and they are pre-paying for it. So, that's also helpful.\n\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] The next question is from the line of Kartik Mehta with Northcoast Research. Your line is now open.\n\nKartik Mehta: Hey. Good afternoon. Just looking at the GES business and with all the commentary, you obviously sounds very positive and your results positive. I am wondering as you are talking to the company, are they - is there any hesitation for forward spending? You are seeing cuts in maybe travel and companies making cuts elsewhere. So, I am wondering, as you look at some leading indicators, if there is any indicators that would say if there is any slowdown, or is it business as usual that companies are continuing to spend?\n\nSteven Moster: Good question, Kartik. We continue to see strong demand for the services. As you know, we start working on an event about a year in advance of that event taking place and working directly with the corporations that will be attending those trade shows. And so we get a window into their spending probably six months - three months to six months before the event actually takes place. And right now, we continue to see the strength that we saw all the way through 2023. So, yes, it's, we continue to be on the same trend. And so there has been no change to that. And on the Spiro side, we also continue to see corporate marketing budgets being very healthy and spending at all types of branding activities. Whether it's trade show or any kind of corporate event or a brand activation event, we see pretty strong corporate spending.\n\nKartik Mehta: And then just on the Pursuit side, I think you talked about potential inorganic growth. And I am wondering if there has been any change in valuation or maybe how the owners are looking at it, or is this a situation where these are iconic properties and economic times really don't change much of the valuation?\n\nDavid Barry: I am happy to answer that one. I can't really comment on perspectives on valuations of things that we might be looking at. But I can tell you that there is lots of opportunity both within the business as we look at where we can improve, and if you think about investments in our own business where we see opportunities. And if you look over the track record, I mean tripling revenue and EBITDA since 2015, one of the ways we have done that is to reinvest into the business in the right places. So, that process is ongoing, and we look every day at different organic opportunities that we can perhaps accelerate. Some of those things you are seeing coming to light this year with the expansion of the ritual at Sky Lagoon, an additional boat of Maligne Lake, where we know we have significant demand, all of those types of investments really help grow the business. In terms of things outside the company, again, there is lots of opportunity. And as we strengthen our position and balance sheet is stronger, opportunities are there, and we will be ready to take advantage of them when the timing is right.\n\nKartik Mehta: And then just the last one on Pursuit side, last year, there was a - labor was hard to get and wage growth was very significant. I am wondering, as you are gearing up for the season this year, the summer travel season this year, maybe where that stands and how it might be different than in previous places?\n\nDavid Barry: Yes. And I think if you go down memory lane, I mean '23 was a much, much easier year to hire and to onboard than it was in '21 and '22. '21, in particular, was very tough during the pandemic. But thank goodness, all of that's behind us. We are fully staffed up. We have a great team of folks from around the world, whether it's J-1 visa holders and working in our U.S. properties or young people from across Canada and across the world joining us in the Banff Jasper Collection. And so we are really fully hired up. Team has done a great job recruiting. We are in the middle of onboarding and opening now. I would say spirits are high, and they are ready to welcome guests from all around the world.\n\nOperator: Thank you for your question. There are no further questions at this time. Steven Moster, I will turn the call back over to you.\n\nSteven Moster: Thank you very much and thanks to everybody. Thanks to our employees across the globe and to our investors for their support in Viad. And we look forward to giving you another update at the end of the quarter. Thanks very much.\n\nOperator: This concludes today's conference call.

(NASDAQ:SGHT) Q1 2024 Earnings Call Transcript", "body": "Sight Sciences, Inc. isn't one of the 30 most popular stocks among hedge funds at the end of the third quarter (see the details here).\n\nOperator: Good day, and thank you for standing by. Welcome to the Sight Sciences First Quarter 2024 Earnings Results Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speakers' presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. I would now like to hand the conference over to your first speaker today, Trip Taylor, Investor Relations and Financial. Please go ahead.\n\nPhilip Trip Taylor: Thank you for participating in today's call. Presenting today are Sight Sciences Co-Founder and Chief Executive Officer, Paul Badawi; and Chief Financial Officer, Ali Bauerlein. Also in attendance is Sight Sciences' Chief Commercial Officer, Matt Link. Earlier today, Sight Sciences released its financial results for the three months ended March 31, 2024, and reaffirmed revenue and adjusted operating expense guidance for full-year 2024. A copy of the press release is available on the company's website at investors.sightsciences.com. I'd like to remind everyone that comments made by management today and answers to questions will include forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws.\n\nThese forward-looking statements include statements related to the company's anticipated financial performance, operating results and liquidity position, current and long-term strategic objectives, market opportunity, business and commercial strategy, ongoing litigation, product reimbursement, coverage and strategy, efficacy of our products, expectations regarding regaining commercial momentum, account utilization and engagement and clinical trial strategy and results. Forward-looking statements are based on estimates and assumptions as of today are neither promises nor guarantees and are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by these statements. A description of some of the risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated by the forward-looking statements on this call can be found in its public filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including in the Risk Factors section of the company's annual report on Form 10-K and quarterly reports on Form 10-Q.\n\nThe company undertakes no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements, except as required by law. On this call, management may refer to financial measures that were not prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States, including adjusted operating expenses. The company believes these non-GAAP financial measures are important indicators of its operating performance because they exclude items that are unrelated to and may not be indicative of its core operating results. See the company's earnings release for a reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures as well as additional information about the company's reliance on non-GAAP financial measures.\n\nI will now turn the call over to Paul.\n\nPaul Badawi: Thanks, Trip. We continue to advance our mission of developing transformative, interventional technologies that allow eye care providers to procedurally elevate the standards of care, empowering people to keep seeing. In the first quarter, we saw an increase in the utilization of our Surgical Glaucoma technologies as compared to the previous quarter and the first quarter of 2023 and continue to demonstrate operational excellence with our strong gross margins and disciplined expense management. We are executing on our strategic initiatives to facilitate appropriate and equitable market access and expand our clinical evidence portfolio in both segments. Our first quarter performance only increases our excitement about 2024 and the long-term opportunities in front of us.\n\nWe believe that our compelling commercial strategies into multibillion-dollar market opportunities, robust clinical efficacy supporting our differentiated interventional portfolio and experienced management team have created a tremendous opportunity to drive durable and profitable growth over the coming years. We generated total revenue of $19.3 million in the first quarter, representing a record for our first quarter period. Growth was 3% sequentially from the fourth quarter of 2023 and 2% compared to the first quarter of 2023. At the same time, we significantly decreased our cash usage to $10.8 million in the first quarter of 2024, compared to $17.7 million in the first quarter of 2023, while still investing in our commercial and R&D value drivers and after taking into account our debt restructuring payments and typical first quarter bonus payments.\n\nI will now turn to a more detailed discussion of our business segments, starting with our Surgical Glaucoma segment. We are pleased with our quarterly performance with Surgical Glaucoma revenue of $18.3 million, representing sequential growth of 6% compared to the fourth quarter of 2023 and growth of 5% compared to the same period in the prior year. OMNI is positioned as an important MIGS technology that surgeons rely on to treat their glaucoma patients and our recovery trajectory attracting to our expectations. We remain confident in our ability to continue expanding our position in the Surgical Glaucoma market for both combination cataract uses and stand-alone uses. We have strategically focused on a few critical drivers to build long-term success within our Surgical Glaucoma segment.\n\nOur main priorities are to increase surgeon utilization across all accounts and reengage accounts who ceased or decreased their orders during the LCD uncertainty period. We also continue to focus our efforts on increasing the pipeline of new surgeons to be trained on OMNI and SION. Growth in the first quarter of 2024 was driven primarily by increased utilization from existing accounts of OMNI and SION, which had both sequential growth and growth when compared to the same period in the prior year. This is a testament in large part to the leading clinical profile of OMNI, which demonstrates the efficacy of OMNI at lowering both IOP and IOP-reducing medications, for a broad set of primary open-angle glaucoma patients. In parallel, we are actively reengaging with accounts that have ceased or decreased their orders during the LCD uncertainty period, during the second half of 2023, before the LCDs were withdrawn in late December 2023.\n\nAs a reminder, we experienced net account attrition of approximately 6% during that period, which we believe was primarily due to the uncertainty caused by the LCDs in the same period. We expect returning accounts to contribute toward further regaining momentum in the second quarter to help drive low double-digit sequential growth from the first quarter of 2024 and toward double-digit growth in the second half of the year versus the comparable period in the prior year. Another core aspect of our strategy is building our funnel of surgeons to be trained on procedures enabled by our OMNI technology. We are pleased to see that our funnel has increased over the past few months and we expect this funnel to continue to strengthen throughout the remainder of 2024.\n\nProducing robust clinical data also remains a critical piece of our strategy to drive increased adoption and utilization of OMNI. The compelling results from the prospective multicenter GEMINI 2 study demonstrated sustained and clinically significant IOP reduction of 29% at three years and clinically significant reduction of IOP-lowering medication use, as 74% of study patients were medication-free at three years. Most recently, we announced the publication of a large-scale real-world clinical outcome study of patients treated by the three most common MIGS technologies in AJO International. The results further demonstrated OMNI's strong efficacy profile. Using the American Academy of Ophthalmology's IRIS Registry, the largest specialty society clinical data registry in all of medicine, and the first comprehensive eye disease clinical registry in the United States, this large-scale MIGS study evaluated long-term two-year, postsurgical outcomes among patients with primary open-angle glaucoma treated with the three most commonly used FDA approved or cleared ab interno MIGS devices in the U.S., OMNI, Hydrus Microstent and iStent inject combined with cataract surgery, as well as for cataract surgery alone.\n\nThe results from this study reported that the comprehensive outflow procedure performed with the OMNI Surgical System technology was effective at lowering both IOP and IOP-reducing medication use at two years. The results were further evidence of the OMNI procedure durable efficacy at two years and were consistent with our many prior published studies. We are excited to see that large-scale real-world studies of MIGS standards of care provide further evidence of the robust IOP reduction and medication reduction, associated with the comprehensive outflow procedure enabled by OMNI. The body of evidence supporting OMNI's clinical efficacy continues to expand, continuing to strengthen our belief that the comprehensive outflow procedure enabled by OMNI is a critical procedure in the field of glaucoma that is elevating the standard of care.\n\nWe will continue prioritizing the production of powerful long-term clinical data, and we anticipate delivering additional compelling results in the future. We are very proud of our published high-quality, long-term data, including the GEMINI 2 and IRIS studies. Should new proposed LCDs emerge, we believe these data along with our existing body of clinical evidence will continue to support coverage of the procedure enabled by OMNI for the appropriate patient population. I want to emphasize our belief that the reimbursement profile for OMNI today is sufficient to drive high growth. At the same time, when we look at the clinical profile of the procedure enabled by our technology, we believe there are opportunities to better align OMNI''s coding coverage and payment profiles with the clinical value OMNI actually delivers.\n\nWe look forward to continued engagement with the MACs, CMS, commercial payers and other stakeholders, as part of our ongoing efforts to maintain and improve appropriate and equitable market access for glaucoma patients and their surgeons to the procedures enabled by our OMNI technology. To close our Surgical Glaucoma discussion, I want to comment on the recent results from the patent trial that concluded last week in Delaware. As we noted in our press release earlier this week, the Jury found that Sight Sciences' three asserted patents were willfully infringed and awarded monetary damages for past infringement. The monetary damages included $5.5 million in lost profits and $28.5 million in royalty damages for sales of the Hydrus Microstent from its commercial launch through trial.\n\nAs far as next steps, the District Court will entertain post-trial briefings by both parties, including with respect to potential enhancements to the damages and other remedies. And the court's final judgment will be subject to appeal. We have invested considerable capital in research and development to create new and innovative technologies, striving to pioneer novel treatments for chronic eye disease. Our commitment to these investments underscores our mission to expand patient access to transformative and interventional technologies that enhance patient outcomes. Given the substantial investments we have made in our surgical innovations, on behalf of our surgeon customers in glaucoma patients, we have a duty to our stakeholders to safeguard our intellectual property portfolio, and we are pleased with the Jury's verdict.\n\nOur attention remains steadfast on equipping eye care providers with efficacious technologies and executing on our long-term growth strategy in Surgical Glaucoma and Dry Eye disease. Now I will turn to our Dry Eye business. We believe the TearCare System represents a transformative technology that will elevate the standard of care for evaporative Dry Eye disease treatment. Our long-term strategy has been to pioneer the field of interventional Dry Eye. The interventional dry eye procedure performed with TearCare is designed to address the root cause of evaporative Dry Eye disease, and the growing body of TearCare clinical results strongly support our belief in its safety and efficacy. Clinical trial data has evidenced that TearCare provided patients with a comprehensive, consistent, fast-acting and durable treatment and the SAHARA RCT showed superiority on our primary objective endpoint, tear breakup time, versus the market-leading prescription eye drop RESTASIS.\n\nThere are over 11 million diagnosed patients, who we think could benefit from the procedure, which we believe creates an approximate $2.5 billion core addressable U.S. market opportunity. Over the last five years, we have sold over 55,000 TearCare SmartLids, developed meaningful relationships with important Dry Eye key opinion leaders and achieved the successful six and 12-month results of our landmark SAHARA RCT. These developments were critical to build a foundation prior to seeking equitable market access. As part of our original long-term strategy, we are now focused on driving equitable market access for patients that can benefit from the procedures enabled by the TearCare technology. We shifted our resources away from cash pay commercialization efforts toward market access, while reducing our overall commercial spend and infrastructure in the Dry Eye segment, until we have some coverage wins.\n\nThis year, we have begun discussions with payers with the goal of receiving coverage decisions starting in 2025. Our strategy for these payer discussions is based on articulating the value of TearCare from both clinical and health economic perspectives. We believe the combination of the strong clinical data from our SAHARA RCT and the findings of our budget impact analysis to be discussed in more detail shortly, create a compelling case for payers to cover treatments performed with TearCare at an appropriate reimbursement level. We recently presented at the ASCRS Conference in April, the 12-month results of the SAHARA RCT, demonstrating improved signs and symptoms of dry eye disease for TearCare patients crossed over from RESTASIS. The Phase 2 crossover of the SAHARA RCT showed subjects who were previously treated with RESTASIS for six months and then subsequently taken off of RESTASIS and received a single TearCare treatment, experienced further statistically significant improvements in the signs and symptoms of dry eye disease.\n\nThe first two phases of the SAHARA RCT month six and month 12 endpoints suggest that the effectiveness of TearCare appeared to be the same, whether or not a study patient had prior treatment with RESTASIS, and that similar results could be expected when TearCare is used as a primary or secondary treatment for dry eye disease. We are extremely pleased that Phase 2 of the RCT, again demonstrates the strong clinical efficacy of the TearCare procedure. In the final phase of the SAHARA RCT, patients from the TearCare cohort will be followed for a total period of 24 months from baseline with repeat TearCare treatments as needed according to protocol-specified treatment with the goal of understanding treatment frequency. We expect results from this final phase of the SAHARA RCT to be published in 2025.\n\nIn addition, we believe there are benefits associated with the dry eye treatment technology like TearCare that is not reliant on patient adherence. The ability to avoid the risk of patient noncompliance with a drop regimen further supports the case for prioritizing an interventional in-office treatment over a prescription-based approach. In addition to clinical data, our conversations with payers include our budget impact analysis, which will be presented this month at ISPOR, the International Society for Pharmacoeconomics and Outcomes Research, a leading health economics conference. We anticipate that the compelling model showcasing the health economic impact and savings for TearCare versus prescription drops, will be a powerful tool as we work to establish broad coverage for TearCare.\n\nAnother part of our strategy to achieve positive coverage decisions is for our customers to properly submit claims for TearCare treatments to payers in a manner that appropriately reflects the value of the procedure. We are happy to report that we are seeing early positive traction with our customers' efforts, and we expect this momentum to continue. Again, our goal is to begin receiving positive coverage decisions from payers starting in 2025. And until then, we will continue working diligently to articulate the clinical and economic benefits of TearCare technology. Looking ahead to the rest of 2024, we believe we are in a position to continue to execute on our strategic priorities and capitalize on our upcoming catalysts as we scale our business with the intent to return to double-digit growth in the second half of 2024 and into 2025.\n\nIn our Surgical Glaucoma segment, we expect OMNI to capture market share in combo cataract procedures and lead the development of the stand-alone MIGS market. We also remain committed to producing long-term clinical evidence for OMNI. In our Dry Eye segment, we will continue to lay the foundation for market access to interventional eyelid procedures with TearCare. We believe we have an incredible opportunity ahead of us, along with the right strategy and the right team to execute and deliver value for our patients and stakeholders. I will now turn the call over to Ali to discuss our financials.\n\nAlison Bauerlein: Thanks, Paul. Before I turn to the first quarter financial results, I want to reiterate that we feel we are well positioned to support our financial and strategic goals for the future and are pleased with both our commercial and operational execution throughout the quarter. We plan on achieving cash flow breakeven without the need to raise additional equity capital and are excited about our long-term growth opportunity. Moving back to the first quarter. Total revenue for the first quarter was $19.3 million. This reflects an increase of 2% compared to the first quarter of 2023, primarily driven by increased utilization of OMNI and SION, and partially offset by the expected decline in Dry Eye revenue. Surgical Glaucoma revenue for the first quarter was $18.3 million, up 5% versus the comparable period in the prior year and 6% compared to the fourth quarter of 2023.\n\n1,073 customers ordered Surgical Glaucoma products in the first quarter, up 1% from the fourth quarter of 2023 and up 5% from the first quarter of 2023. Utilization of ordering accounts was up about 10% from the fourth quarter of 2023 and up about 5% from the first quarter of 2023. We believe this improved utilization is a testament to the unique benefits of OMNI and SION and their importance to surgeons and patients. Our Dry Eye revenue for the first quarter was $1 million, down 32% compared to the first quarter of 2023. This expected decline was primarily due to fewer new accounts and related SmartHub sales, as a result of the reduced sales infrastructure after our restructuring in October of 2023, and the focus on the next phase of our commercial strategy for our Dry Eye segment towards achieving market access.\n\nFor the first quarter of 2024, we had 288 active Dry Eye customers, a 9% increase versus the first quarter of 2023. We also sold about 4,000 Dry Eye treatment lids in the first quarter, a 7% decrease versus the comparable period in the prior year. Gross margins for the first quarter was 86% compared to 84% in the same period in the prior year. The increase in gross margin was primarily driven by higher Surgical Glaucoma gross margin, which was partially offset by lower Dry Eye gross margin. Surgical Glaucoma gross margin in the first quarter of 2024 increased to 88% compared to 86% in the same period in the prior year, primarily driven by a onetime prior year inventory scrap expense. Dry Eye gross margin in the first quarter of 2024 declined to 42% compared to 54% in the same period in the prior year, primarily due to higher overhead costs per unit in the current period primarily due to lower production volumes.\n\nTotal operating expenses for the first quarter were $31.2 million, a decrease of 7% compared to $33.3 million in the first quarter of 2023, which reflects reduced selling, general and administrative operating expenses and improved operating expense leverage in the first quarter of 2024, as compared to the same period in the prior year. The decrease was primarily due to lower personnel-related expenses, partially offset by the expected increased legal expenses and stock-based compensation expenses. Adjusted operating expenses were $26.6 million for the first quarter, a decrease of 11% compared to $29.7 million in the same period in the prior year. Our loss from operations for the first quarter was $14.7 million compared to a loss of $17.6 million in the first quarter of 2023.\n\nOur net loss was $16.2 million or $0.33 per share in the first quarter compared to a net loss of $17.1 million or $0.35 per share for the first quarter of 2023. We ended the quarter with $127.3 million of cash and cash equivalents and $35 million of debt, excluding debt discounts and amortized debt issuance costs. We had $10.8 million of cash used in the first quarter, reflecting continued operating discipline, which included a payment of $3.2 million associated with our debt refinancing, annual bonus payments and higher legal expenses. This was a substantial improvement from $17.7 million cash used in the first quarter of 2023. Moving to our outlook for the full-year 2024. We are reiterating our revenue guidance of $81 million to $85 million, representing growth of approximately 0% to 5% compared to 2023.\n\nWe expect second quarter 2024 revenue to be lower than the comparable period in the prior year, following the impact of the LCDs in the second half of 2023. However, we do expect low double-digit sequential revenue growth in the second quarter of 2024 versus the first quarter of 2024, primarily driven by increased OMNI utilization. We expect this will be followed by double-digit growth in the second half of the year versus the comparative period in the prior year as we regained commercial momentum and expand utilization and our customer base. We expect typical seasonality in 2024 where the second and fourth quarters tend to have stronger utilization than the first and third quarters. We still expect Dry Eye revenue to decline significantly in full-year 2024 compared to full-year 2023 due to the evolution of our commercial strategy towards market access activities and the restructuring of our Dry Eye team.\n\nWe expect Dry Eye revenue to have accelerated growth in 2025, with reimbursement coverage and an expanded commercial presence. In terms of gross margin, we continue to expect overall gross margin to be in the mid-80s. However, we anticipate incurring increased overhead cost per unit due to lower production builds planned in 2024 for both segments, the larger impact in the Dry Eye segment. We are reiterating our full-year 2024 adjusted operating expense guidance of $107 million to $110 million, representing a decrease of approximately 0% to 3% compared to 2023.

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. It's now my pleasure to introduce your host, Harold Tamayo, Vice President of Finance and Investor Relations. Thank you, Harold. You may begin.\n\nHarold Tamayo: Thank you, Keith. Good morning, everyone. Joining me on today's call is Karen Zaderej, AxoGen's Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and President; and Nir Naor, Chief Financial Officer. Karen will discuss the first quarter of 2024 financial results, and Nir will provide an analysis of our financial performance and guidance and discuss our outlook for the year, followed by a question-and-answer session. Today's call is being broadcast live via webcast, which is available on the Investors section of the AxoGen's website. Following the end of the live call, a replay will be available in the Investors section of the company's website at www.axogeninc.com. Before we get started, I'd like to remind you that during this conference call, the company will make projections and forward-looking statements, including our financial guidance, our expectations regarding our ability to expand our footprint and expand revenue from core accounts, anticipated growth for revenue categories, marketing opportunities with nerve applications associated with breast, OMF protection and surgical treatment of pain and new products; our expectations regarding the timing of the launch of Avive+; our statement regarding the timing of the complete biologics license application submission for Avance nerve graft as well as a statement regarding the timing for approval of the BLA.\n\nOur expectation is that assuming approval of the BLA, Avance nerve graft will be designated as a reference product and the expected market exclusivity of such designation and our expectations around cash flow, including that we will continue trending towards cash flow breakeven and profitability. Forward-looking statements are based on current beliefs and assumptions and are not guarantees of future performance and are subject to risks and uncertainties, including, not without limitation, the risks and uncertainties reflected in the company's annual and periodic reports such as hospital staffing issues, regulatory processes and approvals, surgeon and product adoption and market awareness of our products. The forward-looking statements are representative only as of the date they are made and except as required by applicable law.\n\nWe assume no responsibility to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements. In addition for a reconciliation of non-GAAP measures, please reference today's press release in our corporate presentation on the Investors section of the company's website. Now I would like to turn the call over to Karen. Karen?\n\nKaren Zaderej: Thank you, Harold, and thank you all for joining us today as we discuss our 2024 first quarter financial results. We had a solid first quarter, and we are pleased with both the positive trends in revenue and bottom line. Our performance underscores the progress we continue to make towards profitability and generating positive cash flow. During today's call, I'm going to highlight the progress we've made across our business as well as some changes we've made on the disclosure and reporting side, which both Nir and I will discuss later on in the call. Revenue for the quarter increased by 12.9% to $41.4 million compared to last year. We are pleased with this quarter's top line performance, which was at a run rate above the midpoint of our annual guidance.\n\nLooking closely at the quarter, growth was broad-based across our products and applications. We saw a strong January and February, and our typical step up in volume occurred in April rather than March this year. We remain confident that we will achieve our 2024 top line guidance. As part of the disclosure and reporting changes I alluded to in my opening comments, we've made the strategic decision to remove our revenue breakdown between scheduled and emergent trauma applications. Our growth strategy continues to be focused on going deeper and high potential accounts and to build the nerve repair business in these accounts across all of our targeted nerve repair applications. We believe the performance and key metrics pertaining to sales productivity and our progress in our core accounts provide the most clarity on the business model versus estimates of revenue by application.\n\nWe will continue to talk qualitatively about the applications for nerve repair and our growth to give you color on both the opportunities in front of us and the progress we are making. As I said earlier, our growth strategy continues to be focused on going deeper in our existing core accounts where we see significant opportunity to expand our footprint in multiple clinical applications as well as increasing the number of core accounts. Most of our core accounts have the opportunity for significant expansion across surgeon users and applications, resulting in upside in total revenue. As a reminder, core accounts are defined as those generating more than $100,000 in revenue over the trailing 12 months and represent approximately 65% of our total revenue.\n\nToday, our largest core accounts are over $1 million annualized, and we look to continue to grow our core accounts towards their full potential. We ended the first quarter with 115 direct sales representatives, down one sequentially and compared to a year ago. We believe our revenue growth can continue to be driven primarily by increased productivity of our sales force, and we will evaluate and add additional sales reps as their territories approach targeted levels. Our direct sales force is supplemented by independent sales agencies that represent approximately 10% of our total revenue. As the leader in the nerve repair market, driving innovation to provide advanced solutions for surgeons and their patients is a key pillar of our growth. We previously announced three innovations to our portfolio, which included two new products to the protection space and the Resensation technique for implant-based breast neurotization.\n\nWe saw strong surgeon and patient interest in implant-based breast neurotization and grew the number of surgical teams trained in this new technique. We are on track to expand our education efforts with three national Resensation surgeon training programs in 2024. Nerve protection continues to represent a significant growth opportunity for AxoGen. As previously mentioned, we saw a need for multiple product solutions to address the diverse types of non-transected nerve injuries. Our first portfolio expansion with the launch of AxoGuard HA+ Nerve Protector, and we have been pleased with the surgeon acceptance of the product and the progress of the launch, including the positive impact we are seeing on surgeon activation and new use cases in targeted applications.\n\nWe are continuing to expand our offering for nerve protection with a Avive+ Soft Tissue Matrix, which broadens our nerve protection portfolio and targets acutely traumatized nerves. Avive+ Soft Tissue Matrix is a resorbable nerve protection implant that functions as the barrier, providing temporary protection and tissue separation during the critical phase of healing. We are pleased with the initial surgeon feedback we've received in our limited market release and on track for a full launch in June. With these additions, we believe we offer the broadest portfolio -- a protection portfolio for nerve repair, and this will continue to drive growth in the nerve protection market. Moving on to updates to our growing body of clinical evidence. Over the years, we've made significant investments to develop quality clinical evidence to demonstrate the safety, performance, health care economics and utility of our nerve repair solutions.\n\nOur active clinical programs are progressing as expected. As of the end of the quarter, we had 258 peer-reviewed publications, including applications in trauma, breast, OMF and pain. This January, we announced positive top line results from the REPOSE clinical study comparing standard of care and neurectomy of symptomatic neuromas to neurectomy and protection of the terminated nerve and with our AxoGuard Nerve Cap. This post marketing study met its primary endpoint for reduction in pain as measured by the visual analog scale. In addition, the study investigators found that over the full 12-month course of follow-up, AxoGuard Nerve Cap demonstrated statistical superiority for reduction in the total pain reported by the subjects compared to the standard of care neurectomy.\n\nWe believe that these findings will play an important role in surgeon clinical decision-making. Turning now to the BLA for Avance nerve grafts. We completed a productive pre-BLA meeting with FDA. We are encouraged by the positive interactions and have aligned with FDA on a rolling submission process and the content of the modules for submission. We believe we are on track for the BLA filing to be completed in the third quarter of 2024, and the submission time line will allow for a potential approval in mid 2025. In addition, as required under the Pediatric Research Equity Act, we've submitted and reached agreement with the FDA of an initial pediatric study plan proposal. A final decision of the proposed plan is made by the review division at the time of approval of the biologics marketing application.\n\nAnother component of our transition to a biologic was the construction and validation of our new AxoGen processing center. At the end of 2023, we fully transitioned all advanced processing to our new center. We believe the advancements of our processing facility will provide the appropriate biologic processing environment as well as expand our processing capacity. As a reminder, a BLA approval will complete the regulatory transition of Avance nerve graft from a 361 tissue product to a 351 biological product. Importantly, we believe Avance will be designated as the reference product for potential biosimilars, providing 12 years of market exclusivity from the approval. In conclusion, we are pleased with our results from the first quarter, which reflects the execution of our growth strategy.\n\nThe exceptional performance of AxoGen's talented team has been pivotal in achieving these outcomes. Looking ahead, we are focused on delivering and furthering our mission to revolutionize the science of nerve repair. I'll now hand the call over to Nir, who will provide further details on our reporting changes, review our financial highlights and provide guidance. Nir?\n\nNir Naor: Thank you, Karen. It's been very exciting 5 months since I joined the AxoGen team. I've been listening carefully to the various teams and quickly learning the vast details behind this robust and innovative business. As part of my diligence, I have seen several different opportunities and changes to enhance our reporting. All of these changes were strictly voluntary. And although our previous practices are acceptable alternatives, I believe that the new practices are more widely used in the industry and provide investors improved comparability of the company's financial statements to peers. In addition, these changes will provide better transparency and facilitate better resource allocation as we continue our journey to profitability.\n\nOur auditors have reviewed these changes and agree that they are acceptable. One of these changes involve our accounting policy for shipping and handling costs. As of the first quarter of 2024, our shipping and handling costs directly related to bringing our products to their final destination, including facility and warehousing overhead, are now included in cost of goods sold, whereas previously they were included in sales and marketing expenses. Additionally, as of the first quarter of 2024, we ceased allocating certain costs to and from certain departments. Previously, such costs had been allocated based on the company's estimate of the proportionate share of total expense to each line item. It is important to recognize that all of these changes, which were completely voluntary, had no impact on net revenue, loss from operations, net loss per common share or cash flows.\n\nWe've made available our 2023 reclassified condensed consolidated statements of operations by quarter in our earnings release this morning to provide full transparency of these changes. Correspondingly, all the 2023 financial results that we refer to include all of these changes. In addition, we will no longer be disclosing the breakout on emerging versus scheduled procedure revenue. This disclosure was based on estimates and provided qualitative information about the applications where our products are used. After looking into this disclosure and speaking with investors and advisers, I came to the conclusion that this disclosure does not provide the best insights into our business model and successful execution of our commercial strategy. Our strategy is focused on increasing our sales productivity and penetration into high potential accounts across multiple surgeon specialties and procedural applications.\n\nAs a result, we've decided to align our reporting more closely with our strategy. And now turning to our financial results. For this quarter, our revenue was $41.4 million, representing 12.9% growth from the first quarter of 2023. This growth is attributed to a 4.9% increase in unit volume added with a 5.3% mix favorability and a 2.6% increase in price. Our gross profit for the quarter was $32.6 million, an increase from the $28.5 million recorded in the first quarter of 2023. This represents gross margin of 78.8%, up from 77.7% in the same period last year. Our total operating expenses for the quarter increased by 3.8% to $37.2 million, up from $35.8 million in Q1 of 2023. Our sales and marketing expenses for the first quarter grew by 1.9% to $19.8 million.\n\nSales and marketing expenses as a percentage of total revenue decreased to 47.9% from 53% in the first quarter of 2023 as we saw improved sales productivity as well as the termination of royalty payments on Avance. Research and development expenses increased by 17.1% to $7.4 million from $6.3 million in 2023, driven by costs related to the BLA. As a percentage of total revenue, total R&D expenses increased to 17.9%, up from 17.3% in the last quarter of the previous year. General and administrative expenses remained almost flat at $9.9 million in Q1 of 2024 compared to $10.1 million in the first quarter of 2023. The quarter ended with a net loss of $6.6 million or $0.15 per share compared to a net loss of $7.1 million or $0.17 per share in the first quarter of 2023.\n\nHowever, we recorded an adjusted net loss of $2.7 million for the quarter or $0.06 per share, a shift from adjusted net loss of $4.1 million or $0.10 per share in the same period last year. Adjusted first quarter EBITDA was $1 million compared to an adjusted EBITDA loss of $3.8 million in the previous year. This change stands as a testament to our focused execution and improvement in operational efficiency and underscores our commitment to optimizing our cost structure. As of March 31, our balance of cash, cash equivalents and investments was $23.6 million compared to $37 million at the end of the fourth quarter of 2023. Turning now to our guidance. As outlined in today's press release, we are maintaining our full year guidance for 2024. We expect revenue to be in the range of $177 million to $181 million, which represents an annual growth rate of approximately 11% to 14%.\n\nWe also reiterate our gross margin guidance for the full year to be in the range of 76% to 79%. Additionally, we expect to be net cash flow positive cumulatively for the period from April 1 through year-end. In summary, we are pleased with our performance in the first quarter. We will continue to execute our strategies, invest in innovation, drive revenue growth and optimize resource allocation and profitability.

The company's subsidiary, Pursuit, contributed significantly with a 14% increase in revenue during what is typically a slower season and the successful launch of FlyOver Chicago.\n\nViad is confident about the upcoming year, forecasting a substantial growth in adjusted EBITDA of 16% to 30% for the full year. The company's liquidity remains strong at $137.2 million, and they have reduced annual interest costs by over $2.5 million through a successful repricing of their Term Loan B.

I am happy to report that our first quarter results were in line with our expectations, and we're off to a strong start for 2024. GES' strong first quarter performance drove margin expansion with healthy revenue growth and Pursuit delivered 14% revenue growth during the seasonally slower period and successfully launched its new FlyOver Chicago attraction. We are optimistic about the year ahead and are maintaining our favorable outlook for strong growth as positive trends continue for both businesses. We're in a position of strength with accelerating business activity on the horizon and expect to deliver approximately 16% to 30% year-over-year growth in our full year consolidated adjusted EBITDA. At Pursuit, we have an exciting peak summer season ahead and are on track to continue setting new records for both revenue and EBITDA this year. We're seeing signs of robust demand for our destinations and experiences, including FlyOver Chicago. At GES, we expect to continue delivering impressive profitable growth this year from healthy industry demand, our strong non-annual show schedule and our transformed margin profile. Now let's get into the details, starting with Ellen, who will review our financial performance and guidance.\n\nEllen Ingersoll: Thanks, Steve. I'll start on Page 6 with our consolidated first quarter results. Revenue increased $12.7 million or 4.9% year-over-year with healthy growth at both Pursuit and GES. Consolidated adjusted EBITDA increased $0.9 million, and our first quarter adjusted net loss improved by $0.3 million. Our GAAP basis net loss attributable to Viad was $4.2 million higher than the 2023 first quarter, primarily reflecting increased non-operational items and income tax expense. As a reminder, our 2023 first quarter GAAP net loss included a $2.1 million favorable tax matter. As shown on Page 7, Pursuit's first quarter revenue grew $4.6 million or 14% year-over-year, and adjusted EBITDA decreased by $0.8 million during the seasonally slow period. Pursuit's revenue growth was led by attraction ticket revenue, which increased 25% due to higher effective ticket prices and a 10% increase in visitors. We saw a particularly strong demand for our Sky Lagoon attraction in Iceland and our new FlyOver Chicago attraction that opened in March. Pursuit's adjusted EBITDA decline primarily reflects increased operating cost to support higher business volume. And as we move into the next 2 quarters of higher activity, revenue growth will more than offset our wider seasonal loss. As shown on Page 8, GES delivered consolidated revenue growth of $8.1 million or 3.6% and adjusted EBITDA growth of $2.2 million during the first quarter. When adjusting to exclude the unfavorable impact of major non-annual shows, GES' first quarter year-over-year revenue growth was about 6%. Spiro delivered revenue growth of $0.9 million or 1.5%. Excluding the impact of major non-annual events, Spiro's revenue growth rate was about 7% versus the 2020 first quarter, driven by strong spending from existing and new clients. GES Exhibitions delivered revenue growth of $6.3 million or 3.7%. Excluding the impact of major non-annual events, GES Exhibitions revenue growth rate was about 5% versus the 2023 first quarter as show sizes continued to improve. We ended the 2024 first quarter with total liquidity of $137.2 million, comprising $48.8 million in cash and $88.4 million of available capacity on our revolving credit facility. Our first quarter cash flow from operations was an outflow of $7.5 million, which was lower than expected due to working capital timing. Our capital expenditures totaled $20.7 million, including approximately $8 million of growth CapEx at Pursuit. We ended the quarter with $488.4 million of debt, and our net leverage ratio was 2.7x, which is near the low end of our target ratio range of 2.5x to 3.5x. While we are comfortable with our level of debt and strong liquidity position, we've been focused on lowering the cost of our debt. On April 26, we successfully repriced our Term Loan B, which had a remaining outstanding balance of $320 million at the end of the quarter. I'm very pleased to say that we reduced our borrowing rate by 75 basis points to SOFR plus 4.25% and remove the additional silver credit spread adjustment. This repricing will reduce our annual interest cost by more than $2.5 million. Next, I'll cover our 2024 outlook on Page 9 before turning the call over to David for additional color on Pursuit. We continue to expect very strong growth in full year consolidated adjusted EBITDA and are reaffirming our guidance range of $171 million to $191 million. For Pursuit, we continue to expect full year adjusted EBITDA to be in the range of $105 million to $115 million on mid-single-digit revenue growth with a full year adjusted EBITDA margin of about 30% as compared to 26.4% in 2023. For Pursuit's second quarter, we expect adjusted EBITDA to be in the range of $20 million to $24 million as compared to $19.5 million in the 2023 second quarter. For GES, we continue to expect full year adjusted EBITDA to be in the range of $80 million to $90 million as compared to $68.2 million in 2023, with a full year adjusted EBITDA margin of about 8.5% as compared to 7.7% in 2023. We expect CES to deliver low double-digit revenue growth, including about $65 million of net incremental revenue from major non-annual shows. We expect GES' second quarter adjusted EBITDA to be in the range of $34.5 million to $38.5 million versus $26.8 million in the 2023 second quarter. We expect new wins and continued underlying growth to more than offset the impact of major non-annual shows which are expected to negatively impact revenue by about $10 million during the second quarter. With the meaningful full year EBITDA growth we are anticipating, we also expect very strong operating cash flow, particularly in the third quarter with Pursuit's seasonal contribution and GES' two largest non-annual shows taking place. For the full year, we continue to anticipate an operating cash inflow in the range of $120 million to $140 million, and we are planning for full year capital expenditures of $65 million to $70 million, including growth CapEx of about $20 million at Pursuit. We are committed to being good stewards of shareholder capital and will balance value-enhancing growth investments with maintaining a strong balance sheet and ample liquidity. I also want to quickly comment on our expectations for tax expense, which absent guidance from us is very challenging to model given our jurisdictional tax positions. For the full year, we anticipate an effective tax rate of 27% to 28%. And during the second quarter, we expect an effective tax rate of 15% to 16%. Now David and Steve will provide further insight into our business performance and the exciting growth coming our way at Pursuit and GES. David, over to you.\n\nDavid Barry: Thanks, Ellen. All right. Let's dive into Pursuit. We've had an encouraging start to what should be another year of record-setting revenue and EBITDA and continued margin expansion. I'll start by discussing our attractions performance on Page 11. Pursuit's year-round bucket list attraction started 2024 with strong momentum. Our ticket revenue grew approximately 25% to $18 million, and this was driven by the powerful delivery of our guest experiences, an impressive increase in visitation, which was up about 10%, and continued focus on our revenue maximization and pricing initiatives. Our same-store ticket revenue grew by 18% year-over-year, with substantially higher effective ticket prices. Sky Lagoon was a big contributor to our success with robust demand for the geothermal attraction experience in Iceland. We continue to benefit from the increase in volcanic activity that has affected certain parts of the country, bringing more visitors into the center of Reykjavik. Iceland has been experiencing higher visitation and our team has done a terrific job growing the business and increasing awareness at Sky Lagoon. Additionally, on March 1st, we successfully opened our new world-class attraction, FlyOver Chicago. It is a phenomenal experience with an exhilarating flight ride that captures the story and spirit of Chicago. We have an ideal location at Navy Pier, which sees about 9 million visitors each year. In our first month of operation, we have strong visitation, received really favorable reviews, and delivered positive adjusted EBITDA. We're well positioned for a solid first year for our newest build growth investment. So next, on Page 12 for hospitality. Our one-of-a-kind lodges delivered solid room revenue performance of about $8 million during the seasonally slower period. We experienced some softness early in the year from unfavorable weather and ski conditions within our destinations. But as conditions normalize later in the quarter, results rebounded quickly with about 7% year-over-year room revenue growth in March, and our team did an incredible job maximizing revenue, and hustled to offset the weaker early season. The Forest Park Alpine Hotel that we opened in 2022 continues to be a solid build to growth investment in addition to our portfolio. This elevated forest-inspired property in the heart of the mountain town of Jasper realized strong year-over-year room revenue and RevPAR increases during the quarter. Additionally, the new Founder's Cabins that we added to Pyramid Lake Lodge last summer contributed incremental room revenue and available rooms during the quarter. These new accommodations are a great example of a recent successful refresh growth investment that enhance the guest experience and expanded capacity within our existing well-performing business. We continue to expect growth in full year room revenue in RevPAR as our seasonal properties ramp open in the coming months. Our hospitality businesses are in iconic destinations with strong perennial demand. And as this demand builds into the season, it creates compression in the market. Iconic destinations with strong perennial demand, a finite bed base and high occupancy, when you combine it together with pricing power, it's a great recipe for success. As shown on Page 13, our room revenue on the books for 2024 is ahead of this time last year with strong improvements in ADRs for both our Canadian and U.S. lodging properties. This early booking pacing trend is encouraging, and I'm optimistic about the peak season ahead. Lodging pacing is a leading indicator of destination demand and the strength we're seeing in advanced booking supports our favorable outlook for both our lodging and our attractions. We continue to expect favorable leisure travel trends and the prioritization of discretionary spend on experiences. And we provide the iconic, unforgettable and inspiring bucket list experiences that global travelers are looking for. So overall revenue growth, you can see on Page 14, our overall revenue growth trajectory. For the first 3 months of the year, our revenue increased about 14% and set a new record for the first quarter. We continue to expect full year revenue to grow mid-single digits from strong guest demand, pricing power and increased visitation from both home and abroad. We're gearing up for a busy peak summer season, and we're in great shape from a seasonal staffing perspective. Next let's look at Page 15 and discuss our adjusted EBITDA margin expansion. For the full year, we expect to drive further margin improvement and achieve our target adjusted EBITDA margin of about 30% through higher attraction visitation with strong throughput, revenue management, and careful focus on labor and expense management. We're ready to deliver another year of record-breaking results with our full year adjusted EBITDA expected to be in the range of $105 million to $115 million, and this is about triple the amount of EBITDA we produced in 2015 and reflects the strength of our powerful refresh build by growth strategy. Our results will benefit from our newest build investment, FlyOver Chicago, as well as other smaller refresh investments at our well instrumented and high-performing existing experiences. These refresh investments include expanding the wellness ritual at Sky Lagoon in Iceland, launching a new tour experience at the Columbia Icefield Adventure in Jasper, expanding our guest capacity with a new boat at Maligne Lake and opening a new food and beverage experience at the West Glacier Village in Montana. So now let's talk about our exciting future beyond 2024 with continued profitable growth. Looking ahead, we expect continued multiyear margin expansion with a goal of reaching an adjusted EBITDA margin of 33%. We remain very focused on boosting our profitability and believe that 33% is the optimal level for our business, while still having appropriate resources to continue to deliver great staff and guest experiences, maintain our assets, maximize our pricing power and successfully deliver additional growth investments. Our remarkable journey to meaningfully scale Pursuit is ongoing, and our successful refresh build by strategy remains unchanged. We have a strong pipeline of organic and inorganic investment opportunities to help accelerate our growth in 2025 and beyond. And everything we do is in support of our vision for what Pursuit is becoming. Our vision is to be the world's leading provider of iconic bucket list attractions and vertically integrated hospitality experiences. So just as I conclude my remarks, most importantly, I just want to say a big thank you to our Pursuit team members who have been working hard to get us ready for a kickoff to the season and to create extraordinary experiences and lasting memories for our guests and staff in '24. Steve, back to you.\n\nSteven Moster: Thanks, David. Now let's switch over to GES, starting with GES Exhibition trends on Page 17. Same-show revenue and same-show event sizes are key revenue drivers for the GES Exhibition business. I'm very happy to see that both metrics continue to improve year-over-year versus pre-pandemic levels. As I've discussed on past calls, our same-show revenue metric has returned to pre-pandemic levels as our exhibition team has done an incredible job delivering great service and growing revenue per square foot of event space through smart pricing and compelling service offerings. However, the size of event as measured by same-show square footage remains about 10% below pre-pandemic levels. We see this as a meaningful opportunity for further revenue and margin growth as event sizes continue to recover, which we believe will continue through 2025. And given GES' flexible cost structure, each incremental same show dollar flows to EBITDA at a high rate. We're encouraged by the favorable trends we're seeing and strong demand within the event industry. Our well-established leadership position in key trade show markets, long-standing client relationships and multiyear contracts with high renewal rates put us in a strong position to retain and grow events. Entering this year, GES Exhibitions' revenue was already over 90% sold and under contract. We are well positioned for a solid year of performance from exhibitions. Now let's talk about Spiro on Page 18. Spiro is built for strong revenue growth of high single to low double digits from new and existing clients in the large fragmented growing experiential marketing market. As one of the few experiential marketing agencies with end-to-end capabilities and global reach, we are well positioned for growth. Our winning growth strategy is focused on retaining, growing and expanding our clients. Starting with retain, it is important that we maintain our marquee client base and use it as a foundation for future growth. Spiro already has strong positions with leading companies in targeted industries. We represent over 1,500 corporate clients and the best of the best. Moving to grow. We are focused on accelerating our existing client revenue with new products and services beyond the trade show floor to pursue untapped revenue opportunities. Next, expand. We're utilizing our competitive differentiators, including unmatched global capabilities to penetrate new markets and acquire new clients. I'm very pleased to share that we have now reached a total of 60 new client wins since launching Spiro as a discrete experiential marketing agency within GES in early 2022. This is a testament to the strength of the Spiro team and capabilities as well as the importance of experiential marketing as a means for brands to connect with customers in a powerful way. On Page 19, you can see GES' overall revenue growth trajectory. GES is experiencing improved industry dynamics and steady underlying growth. When adjusting to remove the impact of major non-annual events, GES' consolidated revenue grew by 6% in the first quarter. For GES Exhibitions, that growth rate was about 5%, driven by same-show revenue growth. Notably, U.S. exhibition same-show revenue grew about 6% and event sizes grew about 2% compared to the prior year first quarter. For Spiro, the adjusted growth rate was about 7%, driven by our success winning new clients and growing revenue from existing clients. Corporate marketing budgets are exceeding 2019 levels as corporate marketers are finding new ways to engage with their target audiences through experiential marketing. Additionally, participation at trade shows and conferences continues to improve, and the demand for trade show services is approaching 2019 levels. These favorable trends, along with a strong major non-annual show schedule, give us confidence in our outlook for the full year. As Ellen mentioned earlier, we continue to expect GES to deliver full year revenue growth in the low double-digit range. The GES team is laser-focused on executing our client experiences in front of us. The second and third quarters of this year will be particularly strong for GES. The second quarter will benefit from a high volume of new business wins, and the third quarter will see incremental revenue of about $85 million to $90 million from major non-annual shows. The most significant new event for the second quarter is the McDonald's 2024 Worldwide Convention, which is one of the largest client projects Spiro will deliver this year. And it's a terrific example of the power of the GES collective where Spiro provides the sizzle and GES Exhibitions provides the infrastructure. During April, team members across Spiro and GES Exhibitions came together to transform the Fira de Barcelona into a temporary center for McDonald's megabrand. Led by Spiro's strategy, creative and production talent, and supported by GES' logistical capabilities, we partnered with McDonald's to create a high-impact community experience for 14,000 internal and supply chain stakeholders from across the globe. Now let's take a look at Page 20 and discuss our adjusted EBITDA margin expansion. I'm very happy with the results that we're seeing from our efforts to drive margin improvement at GES. We achieved an 8% adjusted EBITDA margin for the first quarter, which is up 70 basis points year-over-year. Our transformed cost structure is paying dividends. With our strong major non-annual shows scheduled this year and our ongoing focus on efficiency gains, we expect to deliver an adjusted EBITDA margin of about 8.5% for the full year. Now let's talk about our exciting future beyond 2024 with continued profitable growth. GES is focused on maintaining revenue levels in 2025 despite the unfavorable impact of major non-annual shows. GES Exhibitions is already selling and winning events in 2025 and beyond. And Spiro continues to add to its client roster and work with existing clients to support them across a wider spectrum of experiential marketing activities. Additionally, we have a robust multiyear road map of lean initiatives to enhance our margin each year. We expect to hold at or above our 8% adjusted EBITDA margin target beyond 2024 with and without the benefit of our major non-annual shows. The fundamental changes we made to reduce GES Exhibitions' cost structure and build Spiro growth capabilities have transformed GES' margin profile. Now in closing, we're thrilled with our performance and the strength we are seeing across our businesses as well as the bright future we see ahead of us. We remain committed to our strategy to create extraordinary experiences and strong returns for our shareholders. I want to thank our hardworking and dedicated employees and our shareholders for your continued support in Viad. And with that, we'll open up the call for questions.\n\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] The first question is from the line of Bryan Maher with B. Riley Securities. Your line is now open.\n\nBryan Maher: Great. Thank you, and good afternoon. My questions mainly are on the Pursuit side. Maybe starting with Iceland. Is there - maybe you can update us as to what the current situation is with the volcanic activity in Blue Lagoon. Is Blue Lagoon still shut down? Maybe just a little bit more color there would be helpful.\n\nDavid Barry: Sure, Bryan. So a couple of things. One is visitation to Iceland overall is up. It was up in February, it was up in March. And so both airlift and visitation into the country is strong. There are periodic closures at that part of - in that part of the country where the Blue Lagoon is located. They may be closed for several days and then reopening. Overall, what it's done is on the days when there has been volcanic activity, it drives visitation into the center of Reykjavik because people have perhaps planned to go in one direction and because of road closures, are heading in a different direction back into the center. So definitely, it's been beneficial for Sky Lagoon in terms of visitation. Overall, though Iceland's on its way to have a really, really strong summer. It's increased airlift from across Western Europe and North America. So no red lights there at all. All green lights.\n\nBryan Maher: And maybe moving on to Chicago FlyOver, can you draw any correlation or lessons learned from opening Las Vegas and how that possibly helped with the opening of FlyOver Chicago? Or are they just such different markets that the dynamics between the two don't correlate?\n\nDavid Barry: Yes. I mean I think we're seeing very strong response in Chicago, really strong visitation out of the gate in our first month, definitely tracking well and positive EBITDA in the first month. So we're happy with that. I think our presence at Navy Pier the fact that we're working together with the other attractions there. It's a much less competitive market than in Las Vegas. And I think it's a very compelling story. So while we see continued improvement in Las Vegas, we see an incredibly strong start in Chicago, and that's going quite well.\n\nBryan Maher: And then just last for me. On Pursuit RevPAR for this upcoming year, putting the first quarter aside for a minute, I think when we look at lodging names that we cover, it's generally kind of low to mid-single digit RevPAR expectations in the U.S. I know that with what you've done in Canada, you expect kind of some stronger activity there. But do you have any general thoughts on RevPAR numbers as you look at bookings for this upcoming season?\n\nDavid Barry: Yes. Good question, Bryan. I think first, I would look more globally at how we're pacing for the summer. So there's a few factors that really drive our performance and our sense of confidence for the coming year. Number one, consumer confidence overall is higher year-over-year. Secondly, we're on trend in terms of experiences over things, and that's a very positive momentum behind us. We have a strong U.S. dollar, which corresponds to a weak Canadian dollar, which drives tourism into Canada. We have an increase in airlift into each of our destination gateways. Canadian lodging, you'll see that on Slide 13, pacing up 24%, ADR at 14% in the U.S., up 3%, ADR up 9%. We're deliberately managing inventory in the U.S., which is really a positive. Our iconic locations also benefit from compression. So unlike city hotels or hotels on the side of the highway and select service and a variety of other comparables, the compare set is quite different. So for us, we see this - all of this momentum driving a strong season. Things early indicators like our Pursuit Pass, which is up double digits. Compression end markets drives yield, which correspondingly will drive RevPAR. And we're being quite selective, especially in our U.S. properties where we've learned that it's not beneficial to sell everything in March and April. In fact, we are holding on to inventory and as we get closer to-date, releasing that at much higher yields. So, we feel quite confident and we are benefiting also from bundling attraction product with our lodging products. So, we have a real strong feeling of momentum heading into the season.\n\nBryan Maher: And then just last for me on the GES side. I mean it's only been not two months since you just reported fourth quarter numbers. But it doesn't appear on the surface and we hadn't been able to drill down since you have released the information about an hour ago. But it doesn't seem like there is a whole lot of difference in the new GES kind of outlook versus where we were six weeks, seven weeks ago. Is that the proper way to think about it?\n\nSteven Moster: Yes, absolutely, Bryan. I mean I think the trend has been consistent for several quarters now as on the exhibition side, the revenue on a same-show basis and the square footage on a same-show basis continue to improve year-over-year, and that's a trend that we think will continue throughout the year. And on the Spiro side of the business, we continue to have a very compelling offering and being able to win new clients and bring them onboard. So, yes, we continue to kind of deliver on the same path that we have been on for the last couple of quarters.\n\nOperator: Thank you for your question. Next question is from the line of Tyler Batory with Oppenheimer. Your line is now open.\n\nUnidentified Analyst: Hi. Good afternoon. This is Jonathan on for Tyler. Thanks for taking my questions. First one for me on GES, a two-part question. Steve, we have talked about this in the past, but can you just give us an update on the bridge to recovering the same-show square footage back to 2019 levels? Is that still a 2025 story, or how are you thinking about that? And then secondly, can you speak on the sustainability of pricing power? And should we expect that 8% gap between the same-show revenue and the same-show square footage to stay consistent as square footage presumably recovers next year?\n\nSteven Moster: Yes. So, I would refer back to kind of Page 17 within our investor presentation. I think it's important to look at the growth year-over-year. You want to compare a quarter year-over-year because sometimes the mix of shows and the type of shows within the quarter will vary from quarter-to-quarter. So, I think what we saw in the first quarter was a continuation of really strong growth, both in the revenue on a show basis, but also in the square footage going up, getting very close to the flat with 2019 in terms of revenue and still being down about 10%. I think this trend will continue going through - probably through '25 until we have a full recovery. And then it will grow beyond 25%. So, this is kind of in line with kind of our expectations for the business, and it has been for the last couple of quarters. So, we feel very good about that. Additionally, you asked about the pricing power within the business. We have done a very good job over the last 1.5 years or so of garnering significant price increases that helped drive the business forward. I see our ability to continue doing that going forward kind of in the mid-single digit range, and you will continue to see a gap between the revenue on a same-show basis versus the square footage on a same-show basis. So, we are going to continue to drive everything we can to drive revenue on these individual shows. And pricing is one major component of it.\n\nUnidentified Analyst: Okay. Excellent. Thank you for all the color on that. And then switching gears to the Pursuit side of things, you gave some pacing statistics in terms of bookings. And I am just interested if you can give a little more detail kind of what you are seeing more real time in bookings, etcetera. When we start to look at the peak summer season, is there any sense of weakness or slowing starting to emerge in the consumer traveler that you guys are seeing?\n\nDavid Barry: None. Yes, it's pacing strongly behavior in terms of spending, guest spend per visit, advanced demand for things like restaurant bookings and specific sites seeing tours. I would say that all of the channels are experiencing strong demand. We are not seeing any weakening at all in terms of spend and actually are being judicious in terms of selling out on a variety of things because we are - we know the demand is coming, and we are just really managing inventory effectively and being attentive to maximizing price and managing availability.\n\nUnidentified Analyst: Okay. Great. Appreciate the color. And then maybe last one for me. Helpful commentary on FlyOver Chicago, was that bill completed? Any early color on markets that might make sense for further expansion of FlyOver and maybe an update on Toronto, if there is any or if you can provide on?\n\nDavid Barry: I will start with Toronto. So, ongoing progress with Canada lands in the City of Toronto, and we will have an update on that, I think in the coming months, but that continues. Really no speculation as to further locations, we are working on improving the performance in Las Vegas and really managing the very successful launch of Chicago. And we are focused also on looking into the future, we have got a great pipeline of both organic and inorganic opportunities within. And so very focused on our iconic locations, very focused on things that no integration risk, no new market risk, things where we can invest within our specific business and improve. And so we have a long list of great refresh projects. We have a long list of other opportunities in each geography, and that would be our focus going forward.\n\nUnidentified Analyst: Okay. Perfect. Thank you for all the color. That's all for me.\n\nDavid Barry: Thank you.\n\nOperator: Thank you for your question. The next question is from the line of Alex Fuhrman with Craig-Hallum. Your line is now open. Alex, please check if you are on mute.\n\nAlex Fuhrman: Hi guys. Sorry about that. Thank you very much for taking my question here. I wanted to ask, if I could, about what you are seeing on the Pursuit side in terms of group travel. It seems like over the past year or so, pretty much everything has been working really well for you guys. Probably the one thing that has not materialized as we would all hope has been travel from China to North America has been really disappointing and remains well below pre-COVID level. So, I am wondering what you are expecting for this year in terms of the group travel business? And are you seeing other countries kind of stepping in here and replacing the volume that's presumably not being made back from Chinese group tours?\n\nDavid Barry: Thanks Alex. That's a great question. With China, I think you always have to consider Asia in its entirety. So, while the Chinese market has not fully recovered and is beginning to travel, there is a few really interesting things that are happening. So, airlift, as an example, out of Japan into North America, so both Canada and the U.S. Canada specifically is about 111% greater than what it was pre-pandemic, which is quite interesting when you look at lift from Tokyo. And then if you think about Asian travel, WestJet, which is the Canadian version of Southwest has launched direct flights from Vancouver to Seoul. And so those flights have been added. And then Air Canada is increasing flights to Hong Kong, larger aircraft to Shanghai. They have extended seasonal service to Bangkok and they launched new direct routes from Vancouver to Singapore. So, the airlift out of Asia, excluding China for a second, the airlift out of Asia is increasing, which is driving visitation and growth from those particular markets. What's quite interesting is China recovering and it is happening more slowly, but that's giving room and inventory to other countries that are taking on that inventory. So, specifically Korea, specifically some growth coming out of India and then strong growth coming out of Japan. As China does return, what's interesting is that will drive compression and then in turn driving yield because we set aside a finite number of rooms that we allocate into the group market. So, attractions are performing well. We have got the Icefield's returning to its levels, and that's taking a little bit longer than we would have hoped, given its history and dependence on Chinese tourism travel. But the other channels coming out of Asia are performing well. One interesting fact is China has worked hard to eliminate these requirements. And one of the growing segments now, the third biggest segment going into Iceland, is actually Chinese travel. So, quite interesting to see that growth accelerate. And so I expect that things will normalize. This year, we have, I think really good demand from our various tour and travel partners. Team has done a good job of reallocating inventory where China perhaps might be a little bit behind allocating more space to other tour and travel partners. On a forward look for '25 because we are actively contracted for '25, our demand from Asian partners increasing, and that's happening also now as we are in the contracting process for '26 because we operate two seasons generally ahead in those categories. So, not a complete return from China, but definitely growing and then strong performance from across Asia, so things are looking positive for the summer.\n\nAlex Fuhrman: Great. That's really helpful. Appreciate that data. And then you mentioned the Columbia Icefield. I am curious that the groups that are coming from elsewhere in Asia are showing the same proclivity to do the Icefield Adventure and the Skywalk and stay at the Glacier new lodge. I believe those properties really catered a lot more to that Chinese market, or are you seeing the productivity of those assets start to recover alongside the rest of your assets?\n\nDavid Barry: We are. And I think that it's also something to remember that the Chinese group travel primarily was very, very early season and later on in the season. So, there is still white space to fill there. So, we are working to fill that. If you recall, last year we talked a lot about the Pursuit path, and you were able to see a little bit of those different attractions when you visit it. The Pursuit path is tracking quite well. We are double digits ahead of where we were at this time last year. So, that's encouraging because that bolsters all of the attractions through the Banff Jasper Collection. And so we are pleased with that. And that pre-commitment is important because folks are betting, they are going to do all the activities, and that's why they are buying the frequency product, and they are pre-paying for it. So, that's also helpful.\n\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] The next question is from the line of Kartik Mehta with Northcoast Research. Your line is now open.\n\nKartik Mehta: Hey. Good afternoon. Just looking at the GES business and with all the commentary, you obviously sounds very positive and your results positive. I am wondering as you are talking to the company, are they - is there any hesitation for forward spending? You are seeing cuts in maybe travel and companies making cuts elsewhere. So, I am wondering, as you look at some leading indicators, if there is any indicators that would say if there is any slowdown, or is it business as usual that companies are continuing to spend?\n\nSteven Moster: Good question, Kartik. We continue to see strong demand for the services. As you know, we start working on an event about a year in advance of that event taking place and working directly with the corporations that will be attending those trade shows. And so we get a window into their spending probably six months - three months to six months before the event actually takes place. And right now, we continue to see the strength that we saw all the way through 2023. So, yes, it's, we continue to be on the same trend. And so there has been no change to that. And on the Spiro side, we also continue to see corporate marketing budgets being very healthy and spending at all types of branding activities. Whether it's trade show or any kind of corporate event or a brand activation event, we see pretty strong corporate spending.\n\nKartik Mehta: And then just on the Pursuit side, I think you talked about potential inorganic growth. And I am wondering if there has been any change in valuation or maybe how the owners are looking at it, or is this a situation where these are iconic properties and economic times really don't change much of the valuation?\n\nDavid Barry: I am happy to answer that one. I can't really comment on perspectives on valuations of things that we might be looking at. But I can tell you that there is lots of opportunity both within the business as we look at where we can improve, and if you think about investments in our own business where we see opportunities. And if you look over the track record, I mean tripling revenue and EBITDA since 2015, one of the ways we have done that is to reinvest into the business in the right places. So, that process is ongoing, and we look every day at different organic opportunities that we can perhaps accelerate. Some of those things you are seeing coming to light this year with the expansion of the ritual at Sky Lagoon, an additional boat of Maligne Lake, where we know we have significant demand, all of those types of investments really help grow the business. In terms of things outside the company, again, there is lots of opportunity. And as we strengthen our position and balance sheet is stronger, opportunities are there, and we will be ready to take advantage of them when the timing is right.\n\nKartik Mehta: And then just the last one on Pursuit side, last year, there was a - labor was hard to get and wage growth was very significant. I am wondering, as you are gearing up for the season this year, the summer travel season this year, maybe where that stands and how it might be different than in previous places?\n\nDavid Barry: Yes. And I think if you go down memory lane, I mean '23 was a much, much easier year to hire and to onboard than it was in '21 and '22. '21, in particular, was very tough during the pandemic. But thank goodness, all of that's behind us. We are fully staffed up. We have a great team of folks from around the world, whether it's J-1 visa holders and working in our U.S. properties or young people from across Canada and across the world joining us in the Banff Jasper Collection. And so we are really fully hired up. Team has done a great job recruiting. We are in the middle of onboarding and opening now. I would say spirits are high, and they are ready to welcome guests from all around the world.\n\nOperator: Thank you for your question. There are no further questions at this time. Steven Moster, I will turn the call back over to you.\n\nSteven Moster: Thank you very much and thanks to everybody. Thanks to our employees across the globe and to our investors for their support in Viad. And we look forward to giving you another update at the end of the quarter. Thanks very much.\n\nOperator: This concludes today's conference call.

(NASDAQ:EEFT) Q1 2024 Earnings Call Transcript", "body": "Euronet Worldwide, Inc. isn't one of the 30 most popular stocks among hedge funds at the end of the third quarter (see the details here).\n\nOperator: Greetings and welcome to the Euronet Worldwide First Quarter 2024 Earnings Call. [Operator Instructions]. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Mr. Scott Claassen, General Counsel for Euronet Worldwide. Thank you. Mr. Claassen, you may begin.\n\nScott Claassen: Thank you. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to Euronet's First Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call. On the call today, we have Mike Brown, our Chairman and CEO; and Rick Weller, our CFO. Before we begin, I need to call your attention to the forward-looking statements disclaimer on the second slide of the PowerPoint presentation we will be making today. Statements made on this call that concern Euronet's or its management's intentions, expectations or predictions of future performance are forward-looking statements. Euronet's actual results may vary materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of a number of factors that are listed on the second slide of our presentation. In addition, the PowerPoint presentation includes a reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures we'll be using during the call to their most comparable GAAP measures. Now I'll turn the call over to our CFO, Rick Weller.\n\nRick Weller: Thank you, Scott. Good morning, and thank you to everyone joining us today. I will begin my comments on Slide 5. For the first quarter, we delivered revenue of $857 million, adjusted operating income of $63 million, adjusted EBITDA of $109 million, a record first quarter across all 3 metrics. These results were made possible by contributions from each of the segments, but with a particularly strong earnings contribution from the EEFT segment due to an increase in the international transactions, growth of our merchant services business and strategic investments in new markets that delivered double-digit growth over the prior year. We are very pleased that the business delivered a record-breaking first quarter adjusted EPS of $1.28, a 47% increase over the prior year of $0.87.\n\nWe were able to deliver this strong earnings growth due to our continued focus on expanding the business in new and existing markets, adding more products, and continued investments in our industry-leading technology across all 3 segments. Moreover, we are pleased that we were able to deliver results, which exceeded analyst expectations, consensus expectations for both revenue and adjusted EPS in the first quarter following our change from quarterly to annual adjusted EPS guidance. And before someone says the favorable earnings all came from taxes, I would like to point out that approximately $4.5 million or approximately $0.10 per share benefit was realized from the resolution of tax matters, and $3 million or approximately $0.05 per share from the recovery of a duty fee paid last year.\n\nExcluding these benefits from the $1.28 per share, pro forma adjusted EPS of $1.13 nicely exceeded consensus estimates. The pro forma $1.13 per share represents a 30% growth over the first quarter last year. This favorable pro forma $1.13 per share compared to Bloomberg's posting of consensus adjusted EPS of approximately $1.04 was the result of more revenue and stronger margins. Needless to say, this strong start to the first part of the year strengthens our confidence in the 10% to 15% annual adjusted EPS growth guidance range we provided for 2024. Nothing like starting the year with the wind at your back. Slide 6 presents a summary of our balance sheet compared to the prior quarter. As you can see, we ended the quarter with a relatively small increase in net debt, which was the combined result of the generation of cash from operations, the use of cash for the Infinitium acquisition and more cash placed in the ATMs to meet seasonal demand.\n\nAnd overall, our net debt leverage remains relatively conservative at about 1x EBITDA. Turning to the next slide, Slide 7. Our results -- we present our results on an as-reported basis. On a comparative basis, FX translation didn't produce a lot of net differences year-over-year. But let's go to Slide 8 and talk about our results on a constant currency basis. I'm on Slide 8 now. Building on the momentum from last year, we are pleased to start 2024 with good consolidated revenue and strong earnings results. All segments played a role in the quarter. Starting with our EFT segment, revenue grew 12%, adjusted operating income grew 220% and adjusted EBITDA grew 54% when compared to prior year. This notable growth was fueled by the rise in both domestic and international cash withdrawal transactions, double-digit growth in our Merchant Services business and further expansion into new markets.\n\nOperating margins expanded nicely due to revenue growth, complemented by effective cost management and the deinstallation of loss-making ATMs in the fourth and first quarters. Epay continued its constant currency revenue growth at 8% with consistent revenue and profit per transaction, driven by continued growth in both digital media and mobile sectors together with its push to expand in new markets. To that end, investments in product and geographical expansion have had a tempering effect on earnings growth where we can see EBITDA and adjusted and operating income come down by about 2% to 3%. The epay team is investing resources to develop and promote new products and solutions to supplement the core epay business for sustainable growth in the future.\n\nGiven epay's past success in achieving growth while transforming the product mix from a predominantly mobile-only business to a mix of branded payment content, I expect epay's strategy of introducing its own products and solutions while also expanding geographically and growing the core business to restore epay's business to the earnings growth trajectory it has historically delivered. Money Transfer's revenue, operating income and adjusted EBITDA grew by 7%, 17% and 10%, respectively. The 7% growth in revenue was primarily driven by nearly double-digit growth in cross-border transactions, offset by a decrease in intra U.S. transactions. Direct-to-consumer digital transactions increased by 23%, reflecting strong consumer demand for digital product.\n\nMoney Transfer's revenue and gross profit per transaction were very stable and consistent with the prior year. In addition to the good revenue growth, the Money Transfer team further improved its operating margins by approximately 60 bps over last year through scale and effective cost management. In summary, these meet and beat first quarter results further strengthen our confidence in the 10% to 15% earnings growth expectation we have for 2024. You might say, with a strong first quarter, why not increase your 10% to 15% range. As we previously said, we want the investment community to be confident in our long-term earnings growth. Remember, we found that the S&P 500 was getting twice the valuation as Euronet, yet delivering half the earnings.\n\nWe will consistently be aiming for earnings in excess of the range, but we want you to have confidence in the consistency of our long-range growth expectations, similar to our historical growth performance. So by retaining our growth range of 10% to 15%, it doesn't mean that we're expecting deceleration. It means we want you to be confident in our delivery of long-term earnings growth. With that said, I'll turn it over to Mike.\n\nMichael Brown: Thank you, Rick, and thank you, everyone, for joining us today. I'll begin my comments on Slide #10. Before I discuss the quarter, I wanted to talk about the state of our business. As you can see from the slide at the left, our revenue and earnings trends reflect double-digit adjusted EBITDA growth over the past 3 years, not much different than our 10- to 20-year compounded annual growth rate. Both you and I struggled through the past COVID years. COVID is behind us. Let's leave it there and focus on the future. And what about the future? We shared with you our confidence in growing our earnings 10% to 15% per year, similar to our trailing 10- and 20-year results. And with such a strong start to the year, I can't help but be more and more confident with our expectations about our growth.\n\nAlso note the directional movement of the red portions of the lines in the chart. The trend of the past 3 years looks a lot like the trends for the 3 years prior to COVID. I believe these trends speak directly to the consistency of our year-over-year results. We are focused on growth powered by our best-in-class Ren technology platform, supporting innovative product development and our world-leading cross-border Dandelion payments network. We are busy entering into new markets, expanding our merchant services business, expanding our digital offerings and growing our network. And as you can see, this strategy is working. As we have continued to grow, we are very excited about the future. Business is good. So let's dig into those first quarter results.\n\nI'm excited that we delivered a record first quarter across all consolidated financial metrics, highlighted by adjusted EPS of $1.28, a 47% increase compared to $0.87 last year. As Rick mentioned, we had some nonrecurring items that benefited our results, but no matter how you analyze it, we delivered a record first quarter with or without them. What a great start to a new year. How do we continue to grow year-over-year. We grow by following a proven model with our focus on number one, continuing to grow one of our greatest assets, our network, our Dandelion network. Number two, utilizing our best-in-class technology platform powered by Ren to deliver products and solutions that our customers trust. Three, by continuing to turn our internally developed technologies into products, which include the Ren platform in the EFT segment, the Dandelion Network and the Money Transfer segment and the Conductor and Skylight products in the epay segment.\n\nNumber four, by expanding our geographic reach, which we've been doing for a long, long time. And number five, identifying strategic acquisitions and managing our costs. You will see several examples of these as we go through the first quarter highlights. Let's go on to Slide #11, and I will update you on the status of the market conditions that impact our business. Slide 11, as we move further into 2024, I see encouraging trends towards the earnings outlook for the EFT segment. You might remember that in the summer of 2023, we saw inflation in Europe taking a bite out of the spend for holiday travel. 2023's reduced spend per tourist was a surprise to us just as it was to the credit and debit card acquirers throughout Europe. What you can see by this graph is the easing of inflation and wage growth this year and projected forward.\n\nThe fact is, none of us know exactly what this summer will bring, so we have to temper our enthusiasm a bit, but the data points are all pointing north. You can see that wages continue to grow, while inflation has continued to decline, coupled with more money in holiday travelers' pockets, we anticipate an optimistic outlook for travel and travel spend. Along with this trend in wage growth and easing of inflation, we have seen several positive travel reports predicting growth in international travel in the spring and summer travel season. Let me share with you some of the key market indicators recently published. Delta and United and most airlines around the world confirm that they expect a record second quarter revenue, thanks to demand for spring and summer travel.\n\nHeathrow, Europe's busiest airport, reported a record first quarter with passengers up 9.5% compared to the prior year, and, in fact, updated its outlook for the summer holiday season, expecting the busiest passenger count ever. Finally, according to the World Tourism Organization, international tourism is expected to fully recover to pre-pandemic levels or higher in 2024 with initial estimates pointing to 2% growth above 2019 levels. In summary, key indicators now point to the easing of inflation, continued wage growth and an anticipated increase in travel during the summer holiday season. Finally, in an update to the consumer behavior survey we shared with you during our fourth quarter call, 75% of Europeans now surveyed said that they would increase or maintain their travel budgets in 2024, an increase from 71% in the same survey a few months ago.\n\nAll the data points look good, and we're encouraged. We're cautiously optimistic, but let's not overshoot. We're focused on execution and leveraging our diverse and significant opportunities. With this great start to the year, we feel good about the direction. So let's move on to Slide #12, and we'll talk to you about the EFT highlights. Slide 12, before we discuss the quarterly highlights of EFT, I'd like to highlight the driving factors behind our growth in this segment. First and foremost, the continued growth of our Merchant Services business. Since the acquisition of this business in March of 2022, we have more than doubled the operating income and continued to grow. Additionally, with our ATM optimization initiative, as discussed in the previous quarter, it has resulted in improved margins, and we expect to see margin improvement for the remainder of the year.\n\nLastly, our ongoing expansion into new countries contributed to our growth. We have realized success in several new markets around the globe. Investments we made during the pandemic and over the last few years are paying off very well in 2024. Now a few examples of what contributed to the quarterly results. We discussed the Merchant Services business as the key strategic acquisition. So how did it perform in the first quarter 2024? Well, let me tell you, EBITDA grew nearly 40% compared to the prior year first quarter, and this is a great example of how our management team continues to capitalize on strategic growth opportunities. We are adding new ATMs in new markets outside of Europe over the last few years. Our largest of these is in the Philippines.\n\nWe opened the Philippines in late 2019, and we saw very impressive results until COVID hit. We didn't believe that COVID would last forever. So we grew our ATM estate even with weak travel numbers through 2023. Now that travel has seen a significant recovery there, our first quarter 2024 EBITDA grew 151% compared to the first quarter of 2023. This is another example of a strategic investment that is paying off in 2024. Beyond the Philippines, there have been 4 other countries that we have opened outside of Europe in the last 2 years. Getting away from the tourist-focused ATMs. During the quarter, we also signed and launched some exciting new agreements. In Poland, we secured a network participation agreement with Pekao Bank in Poland. Pekao Bank is the second largest bank in Poland with 3.2 million active customers.\n\nThis agreement enables the bank's customers to deposit cash at our network. Taking a page from Poland's successful cash deposit network, in Romania, our agreement with Raiffeisen Bank was launched this quarter, providing additional flexibility for cash deposits for merchants and consumers alike. In Greece, our Merchant Services business, aided by certain government stipulations, experienced significant growth with the signing of contracts with 19,000 merchants with POS terminals and another 16,000 merchants with softPOS solutions. Additionally, we are excited to announce the partnership agreement with SoftOne Technologies to provide integrated merchant acquiring solutions in Greece. SoftOne, one of the largest business software companies in Southeastern Europe, will integrate its leading brands and products with Euronet's merchant acquiring platform.\n\nThe combined customer base exceeds 280,000 businesses, and we expect that to increase. Where are we with our ATM expansion this year? We remain on track to deploy between 3,000 and 3,500 new ATMs in 2024. Moreover, we're making progress in extracting maximum value from our existing network and strategically relocating ATMs to new locations. This effort contributed to our improved margins in the first quarter, and we expect it will continue through the year. This quarter reaffirms our global expansion strategy, including strengthening our presence in existing markets, and I'm excited about what the rest of the year holds for us. Towards the beginning of today's presentation, I gave a lot of credit for Euronet's financial success to our technology platform.\n\nWe built the most versatile real-time POS and ATM switching system to allow us to expand rapidly. Much like what Amazon did with AWS, which was originally developed to drive their own business worldwide, and it's now sold as a separate product, our technology platform, that we now call Ren, was built to allow our ATM segment to expand even faster. Ren is the first modern platform that is database independent, platform independent and micro services architected. And just like Amazon did with AWS, we now have productized our own platform for sale around the world. So with that, let's move on to the next slide for an update on our Ren payments platform. Slide 13. During the first quarter, we continued to execute our go-to-market strategy for Ren.\n\nRen is a proven product. We trust to run our payment processing businesses and a product with many different use cases that we sell into the market. Our customers include banks, fintechs and central bank infrastructures, providing them with a product that is adaptable to future technology changes and challenges. To complement the Ren product offering, we acquired Infinitum Holdings in Singapore in the first quarter. Infinitum is a market leader in providing risk management and payment authentication services such as 3-D Secure to prevent fraud in e-commerce or card-not-present transactions. In addition to this service, this acquisition also expands the addressable market of Ren to include online inquirers and merchants that require a modern cloud-native online payment gateway by integrating the Infinitum Gateway into the Ren acquiring host, which allows us to offer an end-to-end service.\n\nWe are working on the technical integration and are excited about the expanded capabilities of these products for our customers and prospects. Now let's discuss our market wins during the first quarter. As mentioned in the previous quarter, our go-to-market strategy has been focused on Asia, Africa and South America. In the first quarter, we signed a deal with Bank Raya, which is a digital bank subsidiary of BRI, the largest state-owned bank in Indonesia. And to remind you, these digital banks are setting up their payment stacks from scratch, and they are unencumbered with legacy technology. Accordingly, their preference is a modern technology like Ren over legacy payment applications. With this win, we added another digital bank in Asia. We launched and went live with 2 new customer relationships in the first quarter.\n\nFirst, we launched Solfin in Costa Rica, a program manager that issues cards to corporates and businesses for use cases like payroll and expense management. Second, we launched a debit card program in Ecuador for our first credit card union customer as both sponsor and issuer. We are excited about the future of Ren, and we will continue to enhance the product offering through continued development and possibly successful acquisitions like Infinitium. Ren allows us to help fintechs and banks modernize and adapt to the changes in the payment marketplace. Let's recap our EFT segment. What a quarter for EFT. What has driven our growth this quarter? First, it's the strength of our EFT segment. The strength is our Ren technology platform, as I've said before, Ren not only powers our EFT businesses, but it's a product that we are successfully selling in the market.\n\nSecond, we continue to grow our Merchant Services business by nearly 40% compared to prior year. Third, we have expanded our ATMs into new countries. And lastly, we continue to optimize our ATM network, which improves our margins. As we conclude our discussions of EFT, let me remind you, we achieved record first quarter results. While we must wait and see what the tourism looks like for the summer, it's hard not to get excited about these results together with the positive travel data. Now let's discuss our epay segment activity for the quarter. Next slide, please. From our early beginnings of converting prepaid mobile scratch cards to digital pins to our diversification from prepaid mobile airtime distribution to processing a third-party branded content, epay has always been a pioneer in the rapidly changing payments landscape.\n\nOur success is made possible because epay is built on a modern technology platform. This platform allows us to remain nimble to changes in the payments environment, thereby allowing us to help our partners deliver their product in more meaningful and unique ways in new and existing markets around the world. This quarter, you can see our continued geographic expansion into 2 new exciting markets. First, we launched Google Play credits into Vietnam, a country where Android-based phones composed 65% of the market. With nearly 100 million people, Vietnam ranks in the top 3 of gaming revenue in Southeast Asia, and we believe it is significantly underserved. We also expanded our Google Play distribution into Japan, the third largest gaming market in the world.\n\nMost distribution in Japan is currently done through physical retail. We have identified a large digital partner to deliver Google Play credits electronically. These developments squarely establish us in 2 significant Asian markets this quarter. Also in the first quarter, we signed an agreement with SumUp, a global financial technology company headquartered in the U.K. that offers payment solutions to over 3.5 million merchants across 30 markets worldwide. SumUp will leverage epay's Conductor platform to provide closed-loop issuing and processing to their merchant base. Additionally, we launched Hediye Kart, epay's proprietary 2-step gift card that provides more consumer choice across our retail network in Turkey. Both of these agreements were won because of epay's flexible and scalable technology platforms.\n\nSimilar to how we productized our Ren platform, we have done the same with our state-of-the-art compliance solution, Skylight. This quarter, we launched Skylight for World Banknote Exchange, a full-service international currency exchange provider based in California. Skylight modernizes the often cumbersome process of monitoring and investigation of financial transactions for money services businesses. And finally, as many of you know, Paytm in India ran into a regulatory issue that impacted its ability to onboard new customers and operate its stored value wallet. Epay leveraged its regulatory licenses, network connections and infrastructure to help Paytm resolve this issue in a timely fashion, thereby minimizing customer interruption. Epay's traditional business with Paytm involves only the distribution of Google Play credit.\n\nSo as I'm sure you can appreciate, we are pleased that Paytm decided to expand our partnership to include prepaid mobile airtime, satellite TV recharges and bill payments in addition to Google Play credit. This was a terrific job done by the epay team and reflects our commitment to helping a partner resolve a difficult situation by leveraging the extensive collection of assets that we've built over the last 20 years. As you can see, epay is more than just a content distribution business. It is a diverse dynamic business with growth opportunities in several new and existing markets, and we will continue to develop and promote new products and solutions that supplement our core offering while providing opportunities for continued growth into the future.\n\nWhile the results from the cutting edge investments can take some time to make an impact on the overall segment results, I remain confident in our ability to introduce new products and solutions into new and existing markets that will help epay continue to produce strong growth into the future. Now let's move on to Slide 15, and we'll talk about Money Transfer for a bit. As I begin my discussion on Money Transfer, I want to emphasize the importance of our network Dandelion as a key driver of growth in the Money Transfer segment. With access to 4.1 billion bank accounts and over 2 billion wallet accounts and over 580,000 physical locations to send or receive money, Dandelion is the most strategic cross-border network in the world to move money.\n\nBut let me put the opportunity for our Money Transfer business in perspective. Despite our position as the second largest multichannel money transfer company, our share in the $800 billion remittance market remains modest, only about 7%. We have historically outpaced the market growth by about 3x, but with licenses in send markets that compose only about 60% of where that $800 billion originates. So we see opportunities to grow market share by entering new send markets that represent another 20% to 25% of the addressable market. The market is big, and we have our eyes on additional share gains in both our existing markets and new markets, but it's also shifting, and we believe we are positioned to benefit from that shift. We have consistently been able to outpace the market as a function of our strong value proposition and our ability to expand our product to the different channels that reach our customers.\n\nOne market shift that I mentioned earlier is consumer preference for account deposits. We were able to grow our account deposit transactions 31% this quarter, in part, because our network can deliver real-time account deposit service in 98% of the markets where our customers have an account deposit needs. In the independent channel, where most of the total addressable markets still live, we are the global leader. And our superior value proposition enables us to consolidate its fragmentation. We have a thriving digital offering live in 24 countries, which continues to accelerate its growth while refining our customer experience. So as the market evolves, whether going to digital for sending, whether to bank accounts, wallets or cards for receiving money, whether for other use cases or in terms of population or migration shifts, we believe our Money Transfer segment is already well positioned to benefit from and actually lead into these market dynamics.\n\nNow let's talk about some of our marketplace wins for the quarter. During the quarter, we signed 22 new correspondent agreements across 19 countries and launched 16 new correspondents in 15 countries. Our team continues to win market share and execute our plan. In Bangladesh, we've launched an exciting partnership with Nagad Wallet recognized as the world's fastest-growing mobile financial service provider. Nagad has revolutionized cashless transactions, integrating them into the daily lives of many Bangladeshis with a solid user base of 85 million registered customers. In Malaysia, we launched a prepaid Ria MasterCard. This card demonstrates our commitment to localize our product to the needs of our customers. This innovative card seamlessly integrates with the Ria Wallet, offering new payroll channels for customers, employers.\n\nIt facilitates direct payments into our wallet and opens up countless merchants for their spending needs. Our direct-to-consumer digital channel continues to grow nicely, expanding 23% and is becoming a larger share of our overall business, reaching 11% this quarter. As we concluded 2023 with momentum and optimism, the first quarter results for Money Transfer reinforced our excitement with double-digit growth in operating income and adjusted EBITDA. I am more optimistic than ever about our Money Transfer segment's potential to continue to outpace the market rate of growth and accumulate market share as we've done in the past, a trend that's been consistent since our acquisition of Ria in 2007. Now let's turn to the next slide, and we'll discuss our Dandelion network.\n\nAs we told you, our network, which is also known as Dandelion, is at the core of the different value propositions we offer in the Money Transfer segment, along with Ria and Xe. Under the Dandelion brand, we offer our network and core payments capabilities through a Payment-as-a-Service model. By connecting with Dandelion via a single API, banks, fintechs, financial institutions, payment service providers and tech platforms can immediately offer real-time cross-border payments to consumers and businesses globally. This is a compelling value proposition that is being very well received in the market. Through our Dandelion sending partners, we reached different customer segments than our traditional family remittance consumer. As we told you, we still have tons of room to grow in the remittance segment.\n\nBut with Dandelion, we are also stepping into adjacent markets in the payment space that service those use cases that require cross-border settlement as part of their value proposition. From a market sizing perspective, we see Dandelion opening access to about a $15 trillion TAM or nearly 20x the size of the remittance market. So clearly, the opportunity is enormous, and with our competitive DNA and superior product, I'm confident that we'll take market share as customers realize the benefits of our attractive value proposition. During the quarter, we signed an agreement with Wallex, a Singapore-based international payment service provider that serves SMEs, corporates, fintechs and e-commerce companies offering cross-border payments, collections, virtual multicurrency accounts and FX services.\n\nFurther, several agreements we signed in 2023 launched and went live in this first quarter. One of the more significance was Ping Pong, one of the largest China-based cross-border digital payment providers. Ping Pong has relationships with more than 1 million sellers who have processed more than $90 billion in transaction volume. In addition, we launched an agreement with Sendwave/WorldRemit, one of the largest digital money transfer companies in the world with a customer base of more than 11 million customers. We are busy implementing all the deals that we've been telling you about. And as we continue to move into 2024, I see a very robust pipeline that I look forward to updating you on as we close these deals. To wrap up our Money Transfer segment, hopefully, you will see what I see.\n\nWe are surrounded by growth opportunities and very well equipped and positioned to continue to go after. So finally, let's go on to Slide 17. As I conclude my remarks, I can't emphasize enough my excitement about the growth our management team continues to deliver. No matter how you analyze the results, this was a record first quarter for Euronet. And to recap, compared to the prior year first quarter, our Euronet team delivered adjusted EPS of $1.28, 47% over prior year, a record. Revenue of $855 million and 9% growth over the prior year, another record. Operating income of $65.8 million, up 44% over the prior year, another record for the first quarter. And adjusted EBITDA of $110 million, 19% growth over the prior year. You see where this is going, another record for the first quarter.\n\nNow let's recap how we delivered these results, and how we will continue to grow. We delivered these results by focusing on our strengths that we have discussed today. We will continue making strategic acquisitions like Infinitium that strengthens our go-to-market strategy for Ren. We're going to expand into new strategic markets, growing those markets like the Philippines, Morocco, Mexico, just to name a few. We will optimize our ATM estate to improve profit margins. We're going to grow and expand our existing businesses like our Merchant Services businesses, which delivered nearly 40% growth in EBITDA compared to the prior first year first quarter. Then we're going to continue to develop product offerings like Skylight and Conductor and epay and we're going to grow our best-in-class Dandelion network of over 4 billion bank accounts and 2 billion global wallets.\n\nAs we have referenced, the positive travel outlook from the major airlines, the airports and notably the World Travel Organization; the outlook from these resources all seems to say the same thing. The spring and summer travel season in Europe is predicted to exceed the prior year. And as I conclude my remarks, I just want to repeat, what a quarter. We have maintained the momentum from the fourth quarter, and we continue to be optimistic about the remainder of the year. For 2024, we firm our -- and we expect to see our earnings growth rate in the 10% to 15% range, but you can bet we are driving this business to produce even better results. With that, we'll be happy to take questions. Operator, will you please assist.", "source": {"uri": "ca.finance.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo!

Welcome to Frontdoor's First Quarter 2024 Earnings Call. Today's call is being recorded and broadcast on the Internet.

Bill?\n\nWilliam Cobb: Thank you very much, Matt Davis and hello again, everybody, Frontdoor Inc. continues to operate extremely well, and we are off to a great start in 2024 as we delivered another quarter of record results. As you can see on slide 4, revenue grew 3% to $378 million. Gross margin increased 510 basis points to 51%. Adjusted EBITDA rose 33% to an all-time first quarter high of $71 million. And as a result of our strong first quarter financial performance, we are increasing our full year 2024 adjusted EBITDA outlook. So while we continue to exceed expectations on the margin side, our top priority remains growing our customer base. Let's be clear, right upfront. Demand for home warranties has been down due to some challenging market conditions, but we view this as a temporary cyclical issue.\n\nThe main cause of lower demand has been real estate. As I've said before, we sell our products as part of the real estate process and as the number of existing homes has declined from 6 million in 2022 to just over 4 million homes today, we have had significantly fewer opportunities to sell our products. This was due in part to rising mortgage rates, which recently reached a one year high. At the same time, existing home inventory has been extremely tight. This is not only limited existing home sales, but it has also resisted in a significant power shift to the seller over the last several years. As a result, our real estate channel sales are less than half of what they were five years ago. And this continues to impact our customer count, revenue growth, profitability and cash flows.\n\nAnd from everything that we see. This is true for the rest of the home warranty category. So while we are still optimistic that the real estate channel will eventually come back, we are waiting to see more tangible proof of the turnaround. Now turning to the direct-to-consumer channel, where we have also seen lower demand. For those of you new to our story, home warranties have historically been sold primarily through the real estate channel. It was only about 25 years ago when we started marketing and selling directly to homeowners. This was a powerful growth engine for us as we saw a strong correlation between marketing spend and our sales. However, about a year after COVID, and we began seeing a decline in consumer demand as the recent indicator of this Google searches for the short term, Home Warranty were down 7% this past March.\n\nWe have known that something needed to change and here's some of the things we learned from really digging into consumer research. First, consumers have a hard time understanding home warranties, they easily confuse it with homeowners insurance or other products. Second, consumers want to feel like they've got someone in their corner. What really resonated with our focus groups is when we grounded them in the higher level benefits of a home warranty like peace of mind, freedom and happiness. Third, we have not done enough to stand out from our competition. The category has been defined by what we call a sea of sameness among providers, and we realize we needed to take action to break out from the competition. Additionally, consumer behavior has been impacted by the larger macroenvironment as a result of rising inflation and higher costs.\n\nThis has been echoed by several of the other companies as recently as this morning was mentioned, consumers are pulling back on spending. We view this as a temporary reset of consumer spending. As consumers have not been prioritizing the budget protection and convenience of home warranties. I will go into how we are addressing this shortly. Now turning to renewals, which continues to be a bright spot for us. For the first quarter 2024, our retention rate grew to 76.3%. While this includes a lower mix of real estate customers. Retention continues to perform very well. Our team has done a great job of implementing a wide range of initiatives to improve retention, such as better engaging our consumers, specifically during the onboarding process, expanding dynamic pricing to minimize churn, continuing to improve the customer experience with a large part of that effort coming from increasing utilization of our preferred contractors.\n\nThis is a dual benefit of lowering costs while delivering a better experience. And finally, we have increased the number of customers on AutoPay, which remained at a record 86% in the first quarter, which makes them much more likely to renew their home warranty. We know there is more we can do to improve our customer service and we are diligently working on those initiatives, but I am super proud of our team's accomplishments in this area. We've also been very proud of our new HVAC sales program, which delivered over $50 million of revenue in 2023. As you would imagine, much of this came in the second and third quarter, and we are expecting a similar pattern this year as we head into our peak summer season. In fact, we recently enhanced the Frontdoor app so that all users can now buy a new HVAC system.\n\nWe are also continuing to grow into alternative revenue streams by building out our technology capabilities for additional on-demand services. Our vision is to provide a consolidated ecosystem where customers have access to video chats with an expert which might then turn into purchasing a-la-carte repair and maintenance services or even new systems and appliances all through our app, more to come here, but we know that the market opportunity is significant, and we will continue to work to find ways to monetize that demand. Let's now turn to slide 6 and our opportunity. As I said on our last call, there are about 5 million homes in the US that have a warranty. We believe that figure could be approximately three times higher if consumers better understood the value of a home warranty, which brings us to the American Home Shield brand relaunch, which is a primary component of our strategy to increase demand.\n\nAnd I'm very excited that we successfully kicked off the relaunch in early April, we took a holistic approach to the relaunch, which has the following components. At the highest level we wanted to break out from that sea of sameness in the home warranty category. And that starts with a new strategy that truly brings a refreshed and high energy look to our brand. We also wanted to connect to new and larger audiences. So we came up with an innovative ad campaign with a new voice and a new brand visual identity. We wanted to have a catchy recognizable tag line. And that's why we came up with Don't Worry. Be Warranty. This tag line captures that feeling. We want homeowners to take away peace of mind, freedom and happiness. It's proactive and goes right at the main word that defines our services.\n\nWe also needed a new logo so that consumers can better distinguish us from our competition. So we refreshed with brighter, bolder colors and a more modern look, we wanted to use comedy and a strong well-known personality to do something different to break through to consumers. That's why we are extremely excited about our new celebrity spokesperson for 'Warrantina, starring Rachel dredge, which we believe will drive greater interest in our products. And finally, we wanted a comprehensive media campaign with new marketing partners, as shown on Slide 8. This is now a true omnichannel campaign that is highly visible. We are we develop great new partnerships that are better reflected our customer base for example, we launched a campaign on WrestleMania.\n\nWe were also on CNN's coverage of the solar eclipse in a big way with our website traffic hitting new highs that day. Speaking of the website, I encourage all of you to visit ahs.com and hope you notice it not only has an updated look, but it also has a more intuitive interface and navigation tools that will improve conversion. In summary, we are truly bringing a refreshed and high energy look to our brand. However, we know we have relaunched our brand in the face of a challenging macroenvironment for home warranties. But that is the point as the leader in our category is our job to turn demand around and we are optimistic this relaunch will improve the growth trajectory for home warranties for years to come. With this much change, it would be premature to talk results thus far.\n\nHowever, we are excited about what we are seeing in web traffic and in other areas and look forward to providing you more details on our next call. Before I turn the call over to Jessica, I want to reiterate that we are off to a great start in 2024. And our first quarter performance continues to show that Frontdoor Inc. is operating extremely well. Jessica?\n\nJessica Ross: Thanks Bill, and good morning, everyone. Before I get into the details, I wanted to first build on Bill's remarks with a few high-level thoughts about a quarter and outlook. First, we want to celebrate that we had another record quarter, which was primarily driven by better than expected margins as the team continues to drive operational excellence across the business through our margin expansion initiatives. Second, in response to our strong first quarter performance, I'm pleased to share that we are raising our full year outlook for gross margin and adjusted EBITDA. Now let's turn to Slide 9, where I'll review our first quarter 2024 financial summary. First quarter revenue increased 3% versus the prior year period to $378 million.\n\nNet income increased 56% to $34 million and adjusted EBITDA increased 33% to $71 million, which both represent records for first quarter performance. Now moving to Slide 10, where gross profit for the quarter increased 14% versus the prior year period to $195 million and gross margin improved 510 basis points to 51%. The gross profit improvement was primarily driven by higher realized price, a transition to higher service fees and continued process improvement initiatives and was partially offset by inflationary cost pressures. Let's now move to the adjusted EBITDA bridge on Slide 11, where I'll provide more context for the year-over-year improvement in first quarter adjusted EBITDA, starting at the top, we had $14 million of favorable revenue conversion, driven by an 11% increase in price over the prior year period.\n\nThis was partially offset by an 8% decline in volume primarily driven by lower sales in our first year channels. This also includes a $6 million increase in other revenue due to higher on-demand home services, primarily from the new HVAC program. Contract claims costs decreased $10 million, which was better than expected. This includes a transition to higher service fees that had two impacts. Third, higher service fees resulted in a lower number of service requests per customer as we typically see a temporary change in customer behavior until they become accustomed to the new fee amounts. Second, higher service fees also resulted in a lower net cost per service request, and these fees are a contra cost to claims expense on our income statement.\n\nAdditionally, our contract claims costs improved over the prior year period in part due to our ongoing process improvement initiative. This includes improving our planning processes, moving more of our service requests to our preferred contractors. Our new high cost claims review program and leveraging our bulk purchasing power. These improvements were partially offset by ongoing inflation as well as a $5 million unfavorable change in claims cost development year over year. Now moving to sales and marketing costs, which increased $7 million over the prior year period, primarily due to better pacing of our marketing investments to drive growth in our direct to consumer channel. And finally, general and administrative costs increased $3 million, primarily due to increased personnel costs.\n\nTo some of our bridge, all of this resulted in adjusted EBITDA increasing $18 million to $71 million. With these results, we exceeded the midpoint of our outlook by approximately $25 million. And I want to take a moment to provide some context here. First, remember, when we provided our outlook, we were working with the late February data and assumed normal weather from March, but then March came in much more favorable than anticipated which was the primary driver of lower incidence or about a $10 million favorable impact compared to our guide. As a result, our net cost per service request came in much lower than anticipated in the first quarter. With a better than expected incidence rate, we were able to allocate more jobs to our preferred contractor network which handled 84% of our service requests in the first quarter.\n\nAdditionally, we continue to benefit from our process improvements and rigorous cost management by our contractor relations team. We also benefited from some favorable timing around our marketing. Let's now turn to slide 12 for a review of our statement of cash flow. Net cash provided from operating activities was $84 million for the three months ended March 31st as a result of our exceptionally strong earnings and was comprised of $51 million in earnings adjusted for noncash charges and $34 million in cash provided from working capital that was primarily driven by seasonality. Net cash used for investing activities was $10 million and was primarily comprised of capital expenditures related to investments in technology. Net cash used for financing activities was $21 million and was comprised of $13 million of share repurchases as well as $4 million of scheduled debt payments.\n\nWe ended the quarter with $378 million. This was comprised of $165 million of restricted cash and $213 million of unrestricted cash. We were also extremely pleased with our free cash flow conversion of $73 million for the three months ended March 31st. The majority of the increase over the prior year period was driven by higher earnings, and I believe this number speaks to the cash generating power of our business. Now turning to Slide 13, where I'll provide an update on our current capital structure. We continue to have an extremely strong financial position and a consistent capital allocation framework. Our number one priority remains to focus on growth, and we continue to prioritize investments that expand units as well as grow revenue and adjusted EBITDA, both organically and through opportunistic M&A.\n\nOur second objective is to ensure we have a solid financial profile, which includes maintaining appropriate levels of liquidity to run the business and a prudent long-term debt structure. We currently have a very modest level of debt, and we have a low net leverage ratio of 1.1x. And finally, our third objective is to return cash to shareholders. Through the end of April, we repurchased $33 million worth of shares, which brings our total to $314 million since we initiated our share repurchase program in 2021. Let me conclude this section by saying that I recognize that our unrestricted cash of over $200 million is above our targeted range of between $100 million to $150 million required to run the business. This higher cash balance was driven by our better results, coupled with timing and seasonality.\n\nThis in turn drove our net leverage ratio down to 1.1x, which is below our targeted net leverage ratio of around 2x to 2.5x. We are coming off of some very volatile earnings, and it was not that long ago that our net leverage ratio was closer to 3x, I want to ensure that investors know, we do not plan on keeping our unrestricted cash or leverage ratio at the current level. We have a significant amount of financial flexibility and we will continue to follow the capital allocation strategy I just walk through when making decisions about utilizing our cash which is focused on growth and share repurchase. And now turning to slide 14, where I will walk through our second quarter and full year 2024 outlook. We expect our second quarter revenue to be between $530 million and $540 million, which reflects a mid-single digit increase in our renewal channel, a decline in our real estate channel of approximately 15% to 20% and roughly 16% decline in our DTC channel, which reflects an expected improvement from our first quarter results and a $10 million increase in other revenue to $34 million.\n\nSecond quarter adjusted EBITDA is expected to range between $130 million and $140 million, a 12% increase over the prior year period. Now turning to our full year 2024 outlook, starting with revenue, where we are maintaining our range of $1.81 billion to $1.84 billion. This assumes a mid-single digit increase in the renewals channel, a 10% decline in the DTC channel and a 15% to 20% decline in the real estate channel. As a reminder, there is a timing difference between the time of sale occurs and reported revenue, which we recognize over 12 months. It also assumes other revenue will increase approximately 30% to a $100 million, primarily driven by higher on-demand revenue mainly sales from our new HVAC program. We continue to expect a mid-single digit increase in realized price, which will be offset by a mid-single digit decline in realized volume from lower member count.\n\nAs a reminder, our 2023 home warranty count was down 6%, and we expect this to decline 1% to 3% in 2024 to approximately $1.95 million. We are raising our full year gross profit margin outlook to be approximately 50% as we continue to stabilize margins in our core business. This outlook assumes normal weather as we enter into our peak season. When our system is typically more strict. We are also saying that inflation will be in the low to mid-single digits on a net cost per service request basis and the number of service requests will decline 5% to approximately $3.7 million. We are maintaining our full year SG&A range to be between $580 million and $595 million as our 2024 plan includes a previously announced transition of marketing investments from the Frontdoor brand to the American Home Shield brand to support the relaunch.\n\nAs Bill mentioned earlier, we are very excited about the brand relaunch as we anticipate it will play a critical role in increasing demand and growing revenue for the long term. Based on these updated inputs, we are increasing our full year adjusted EBITDA range to be between $360 million and $370 million. Our full year outlook also includes $13 million of interest income and this led to stock compensation expense of approximately $30 million. And finally, we expect our full year capital expenditures to range between $35 million and $45 million and the annual effective tax rate to be approximately 25%. In conclusion, we are very pleased with our first quarter financial results. We continue to deliver better than expected adjusted EBITDA as a result of the rigorous work the team has done to execute on our margin expansion initiatives, and we remain committed to finding new and innovative ways to continuously improve our business.\n\nI will now turn the call back over to Bill for a few closing remarks before we open up the line for questions. Bill?\n\nWilliam Cobb: Thanks Jessica. One final note before we go to your questions, you've heard me on the last call, talk about how we think our stock is undervalued. I still firmly believe that. Our first quarter performance demonstrates the exceptionally strong earnings power of our platform. We generate a lot of cash that we will use to grow or to buy back stock. And finally, I am confident that we are on the right path to increasing the growth trajectory of our customer base. There are so many upsides to this category in our company that we have decided to hold another Investor Day to share our vision and strategy with investors and analysts. The date we have chosen is November 7th in New York City. I think it will be well worth your time to attend and we will share more information as we get closer to November. Operator, let's now please open up for those who are on the line for questions.\n\nSee also\n\n20 Countries with the Highest Annual GDP Growth in the World and", "source": {"uri": "ca.finance.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo!

During this call, we'll make forward-looking statements based on current expectations, estimates, and projections that are subject to risk. Statements about current and future financial performance, growth strategy, customers, business opportunities, market acceptance of our products and services, and potential acquisitions are forward-looking statements. Listeners should not place undue reliance on these statements as there are many factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from our forward-looking statements.\n\nWe encourage you to review our publicly filed documents as well as our news releases and website for more information. Today, we'll also discuss adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP financial measure provided to complement the GAAP results. Please refer to today's earnings release for important disclosures regarding non-GAAP measures. I'll now turn the call over to John Saunders.\n\nA filled shopping cart with popular food and beverage items.\n\nJohn Saunders: Good morning and thanks for joining the call today. This morning, we released our first quarter financial results and we're pleased to report that the renewed momentum we generated in the fourth quarter has carried into 2024. Once again, our core verification services revenue more than offset lower product sales resulting for persistent headwinds in our beef business due to cyclical cattle trends, lingering drought effects, and smaller herd sizes. As we've said before, these headwinds are likely to persist to some extent throughout 2024, but we're hopeful to see improvements starting early next year. The solid growth and verification services coupled with careful management of our cost structure also led to improved profitability year-over-year.\n\nOur ability to continue delivering profitable growth in spite of ongoing challenges in our beef business reflects the strength and advantages of our unique business model. We are far and away the most diversified provider of food claims certifications in the United States. We provide thousands of producers, customers with best-in-class solutions to differentiate and add value to their products. These customers range from small family farms and ranches to large multinational CPGs. In turn, they respond to increasing consumer demand for products that are certified to any number of standards ranging from non-GMO, organic, and gluten-free to a growing number of sustainable-related certifications. Drilling down on our numbers for the quarter, verification and certification services revenue grew 17% to 4.4 million from 3.8 million.", "source": {"uri": "finance.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo!

Welcome to the Quaker Houghton First Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call. A brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the call over to Jeffrey Schnell, Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. Schnell, you may now begin.\n\nJeffrey Schnell: Thank you. Good morning. And welcome to our first quarter 2024 earnings conference call. On the call today are Andy Tometich, our President and Chief Executive Officer; Shane Hostetter, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Robert Traub, our General Counsel. Our comments relate to the financial information released after the close of U.S. markets yesterday, May 2, 2024. Our press release and accompanying slides can be found on our Investor Relations website. Both the prepared commentary and discussion during the call may contain forward-looking statements reflecting the company's current view of future events and their potential effect on Quaker Houghton's operating and financial performance.\n\nThese statements involve uncertainties and risks, which may cause actual results to differ. The company is under no obligation to provide subsequent updates to these forward-looking statements. This presentation also contains certain non-GAAP financial measures and the company has provided reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures in the appendix of the presentation materials, which are available on our website. For additional information, please refer to our filings with the SEC. Now, it's my pleasure to hand the call over to Andy.\n\nAndy Tometich: Thank you, Jeff, and good morning, everyone. Quaker Houghton delivered a strong performance again in the first quarter of 2024. We advanced our enterprise strategy, further expanded our margins, grew earnings and delivered another quarter of solid operating cash flow. I am proud of these results, which highlight our ongoing execution, as well as the resilience of our people and our business, as we continue to successfully navigate the persistent and dynamic end-market conditions. Our disciplined approach to managing our business is working to better position the company to perform well in any environment for years to come. First quarter net sales were $470 million, 6% below the prior year's record result and 1% higher than the fourth quarter of 2023.\n\nTotal reported volumes were once again stable on a year-over-year basis and were 2% higher sequentially. This is a result of us earning new business with our valued customers through our differentiated customer intimate model, as we and our customers endure through the sustained soft macroeconomic conditions. Gross margins in the first quarter were 38.7%, 400 basis points higher than the prior year and 200 basis points higher compared to the prior period. We have benefited from the active execution on our margin improvement initiatives, including driving efficiencies in areas like supply chain and procurement, as well as taking appropriate steps to enhance our overall operational performance. We also benefited from a modest decline in raw material costs from their peak levels, which have since stabilized and we maintain a disciplined approach with our customer driven total cost of ownership model.\n\nWe generated adjusted EBITDA of $83 million in the first quarter, a 6% increase year-over-year and $2.09 of non-GAAP diluted earnings per share, an 11% increase compared to the prior year. These strong financial results underscore the progress on our profitable growth initiatives and our commitment to driving success for and with our customers, while continuing to invest in our people, our growth pillars and our enablers. In the first quarter, we generated approximately $27 million of operating cash flow, continuing our momentum from 2023. This was primarily driven by our improved operating performance, despite a modest working capital bill. We expect to build on these levels of cash flow in the coming quarters. Quaker Houghton's balance sheet is strong, supported by our cash generation capabilities and our disciplined capital allocation strategy.\n\nOur net leverage ratio remains at 1.8 times our adjusted EBITDA and provides significant optionality to invest in opportunities to accelerate our growth and support our framework for long-term value creation. I'm excited by the opportunities ahead to continue to unlock our growth potential. Turning to our segments, we once again delivered improved earnings and margin performance in all of our segments on a year-over-year basis. I am proud of the team's execution driving these results, especially considering the mixed end-market conditions we have encountered. Volumes in the Asia-Pacific segment increased by a mid-teens percentage compared to the prior year. This is primarily the result of an improvement in China in both metals and metal working that began to materialize in the back half of 2023 and has continued into 2024.\n\nWe've also been encouraged by our growth in Greater Asia. New business wins are a key driver to the improvements in our Asia-Pacific segment, complemented by the increase in underlying demand in the region. Volumes in the EMEA segment were consistent with the prior quarter, but declined compared to the prior year. This reflects a continuation of the volatile end-market activity in the region across both metals and metal working, which was partially offset by our new business wins. Volumes in the EMEA segment remain well below normalized levels and we expect industrial activity will likely remain constrained in the region through at least the first half of 2024. That said, we continue to improve the profitability of the EMEA segment and our execution on price-cost management drove more than 300 basis points of improvement in segment margins on both a year-over-year and sequential basis in the first quarter.\n\nVolumes in the America segment declined compared to the prior year, but improved sequentially. Demand in metals has continued to improve, whereas end-market activity in metal working has been more restrained, especially in industrial applications and packaging containers. New business wins were positive in the quarter in the America segment, despite the underlying soft market conditions, reflecting the value we provide to our customers with our services and solutions. Segment earnings in the Americas increased on both a year-over-year and a sequential basis, driven by a further improvement in this segment's margins. Our volume growth continues to be in-line or better than our underlying markets in the respective regions we operate. We expect to build on our foundation and believe that we will further demonstrate the value embedded in our model as we progress through 2024 and as market rates improve from these low levels.\n\nSwitching to the outlook, beginning with the second quarter, we expect a modest seasonal improvement in demand across all of our regional segments but at varying degrees. We expect the positive momentum in metals to continue and while we expect growth in metal working, it will likely remain more tepid and mixed by end market. We expect these seasonal improvements and underlying market growth rates will continue to be complemented by our new business wins across all regions. Gross margins are expected to be in a similar range to that of the first quarter, as we balance our customer relationships and our value pricing with our total cost to serve. Taken together, we expect to deliver another quarter of year-over-year and sequential growth in adjusted EBITDA in the second quarter of 2024.\n\nSwitching to the full year, our expectations for 2024 remain unchanged from our fourth quarter earnings call. The current end market environment remains uncertain and we expect the limited visibility and dynamic market conditions will persist at least through the first half of 2024. However, we are cautiously optimistic that underlying conditions will improve as we progress through the year. Our diversified portfolio and customer intimate model are core features driving the strength of our customer relationships and the resilience of our business. We have and continue to take action to effectively manage the factors within our control, while positioning the company for profitable growth. To that end, we are further advancing our growth pillars as part of our enterprise strategy, investing in our foundational enablers as we can temporize the organization.\n\nThese enablers will support Quaker Houghton's ability to continue to outpace our underlying market, leading to volume growth in 2024 and beyond. Through all of this, the team continues to be hyper-focused on executing on our objectives, including our expectation of delivering another year of earnings growth in 2024. We also anticipate another strong year of cash generation, building on the momentum of 2023, supporting our disciplined capital allocation priorities of, investing in our organic growth, paying dividends, advancing our bolt-on M&A strategy, strengthening our balance sheet through debt repayment and being opportunistic with share repurchases, consistent with our commitment to enhancing shareholder value. Quaker Houghton remains fully committed to our enterprise growth strategy, which is centered on enhancing value for our customers.\n\nThe initiatives underway are gaining traction both internally and externally. We continue to be prudent with our growth-related investments, supporting initiatives that will deliver volume gains going forward. A benefit for us in the first quarter was our growth in Asia-Pacific. While China improved from low levels in 2023, we also benefited in growth in Greater Asia, capitalizing on the benefits of deploying, reinforcing and expanding the full capabilities of our technology portfolio in that region. Our teams are also focused on simplifying the organization to deliver customer-valued solutions effectively and efficiently. This includes strengthening the cross-functional capabilities between our global functions to work together to reduce complexity, for example, through product rationalization, which drives efficiency for our company and our customers as we continue to leverage our global scale and accelerate our growth by generating new business wins.\n\nWe're also making additional progress to advance and optimize the intimacy of our model, including with digital capabilities for our direct and indirect channel strategy. We are now also expanding our refined channel strategies into Europe, which will further tailor the value of our differentiated customer intimate business model to the specific needs of our customers. We're also pleased with the initial contributions from the acquisition of IKB, which has been performing in line with our expectations and will help accelerate our growth in our advanced and operating solutions in Europe and globally. Sustainability is another enabler of our enterprise strategy. We recently published the latest iteration of our sustainability report, which details the progress made leading our industry towards a better future.\n\nI am proud to note that we have achieved all of our 2023 interim milestones ahead of schedule and have launched new 2025 milestones, while we also continue to prioritize the foundational investment necessary to enable us to deliver on our 2030 goals. Additionally, we believe a more sustainable future presents challenges that we are uniquely positioned to help our customers pursue. For instance, a growth pillar for Quaker Houghton is capitalizing on the shift to e-mobility. The new opportunities in this space have tremendous challenges and we are working diligently to develop and drive leadership with value-adding solutions in these areas with and for our customers. All of our initiatives underway are natural extensions, building upon the strong foundations that Quaker Houghton has developed over time.\n\nThey are aimed at driving a more productive, responsive and innovative organization, growing the company to deliver on the long-term needs of our customers and our industry, and ultimately, continue to enhance value for shareholders. Stepping back, we remain committed to our financial and operational priorities and have made meaningful progress towards our goals. In the first quarter, we delivered our fifth quarter of stable volumes in a very dynamic market, highlighting our new business generation and delivered our seventh consecutive quarter of year-over-year gross margin expansion. We are dedicated to furthering our leading position in this attractive industry, which is supported by long-term secular growth drivers, earning the partnership of our customers by providing the best services and solutions tailored to their specific needs.\n\nWe do this by capitalizing on the positive momentum we have built with our enterprise strategy to further unlock our potential. We will continue to prudently invest to advance our growth initiatives. We will enhance our customer intimate model and cost position to ensure Quaker Houghton is the partner of choice for our customers, enabling us to achieve above-market growth in 2024 and beyond. Our balance sheet is strong, supported by the cash generation capabilities of the organization, and supports our balanced capital allocation strategy, which remains focused on maximizing shareholder value. On behalf of the management team, I want to thank our 4,400 colleagues around the globe for their dedication to our customers and our company, and for living our core values.\n\nWith that, I'd like to pass it over to Shane to discuss the financials.\n\nShane Hostetter: Thank you, Andy, and good morning, everyone. Quaker Houghton once again performed well in the first quarter. Our net sales declined approximately 6% from the prior year to $470 million. The primary drivers of the year-over-year change were a lower selling price and product mix of approximately 5%, which primarily reflects the impact of our index-based contracts and lower sales volumes of approximately 1%. Our sales volumes, which have remained largely consistent sequentially for the fifth consecutive quarter, reflected softer industrial activity, primarily in the Americas and EMEA segments. These impacts were partially offset by an improvement in our Asia-Pacific segment, as well as new business wins, which were a net benefit across all segments.\n\nSequentially, our net sales increased approximately 1%. This was driven by an increase in volumes of 2%, reflecting a seasonal improvement in demand, which was partially offset by a decline of approximately 1% in selling price and product mix. Gross margins in the first quarter were 38.7%, which represents an increase of 400 basis points, compared to 34.7% in the prior year, and an improvement of approximately 200 basis points sequentially, compared to 36.6% in the fourth quarter. Our execution, capturing the value for our services and solutions, coupled with some modest raw material cost reduction and efficiency actions, have been the primary drivers of restoring our gross margins back within our targeted range. Excluding one-time items, SG&A increased $5 million or 4%, compared to the prior year and $2 million or 2%, sequentially.\n\nThe increase compared to the prior year and prior quarter reflects inflationary impacts on our labor and related costs. We delivered $83 million of adjusted EBITDA in the first quarter, which represents an increase of $4 million or 6%, compared to the prior year and an increase of $6 million, or 8%, compared to the prior quarter. Our adjusted EBITDA margin was 17.7% in the first quarter, an increase compared to both the first quarter of 2023 of 15.8% and 16.5% in the prior quarter. These improvements primarily reflect the progress we've made advancing our profitable growth initiatives, while also balancing our near-term financial and operational priorities. Switching to our segments, net sales in the Americas declined 9% year-over-year due to lower sales volumes and selling price improvements.\n\nVolumes in the Americas primarily reflect lower industrial activity in the region, primarily impacting our metalworking business. Our selling price largely reflects the impact of our index-based contracts. On a sequential basis, America's net sales and volumes increased, reflecting normal seasonal patterns, as well as new business wins across both metals and metalworking. America's segment earnings increased approximately 1% compared to the prior year, primarily reflecting our margin improvement initiatives, which led to an increase of approximately 280 basis points year-over-year. Segment earnings and margins also increased on a sequential basis, reflecting higher volumes and an improvement in price and cost dynamics. Net sales in the EMEA were 9% lower year-over-year due to a decline in both sales volumes and selling price improvements.\n\nOverall market conditions remained challenged in this segment across most product categories. EMEA sales volumes did increase on a sequential basis and while volume trends were uneven for most of 2023, we believe they largely stabilized. EMEA segment earnings increased approximately 6% in the first quarter, compared to the prior year. This increase reflects our margin improvement and cost savings initiatives, which showed a 330 basis point improvement. Similarly, EMEA segment earnings and margins both increased compared to the prior quarter. Net sales in Asia-Pacific increased 6% compared to the prior year, driven by a double-digit increase in sales volumes, which was partially offset by lower selling price and product mix. The volume increase reflects a broad improvement in underlying demand compared to the softer economic conditions in China in the prior year.\n\nIt also reflects the improvement in Greater Asia, as well as overall new business wins. Segment earnings in Asia-Pacific increased 10% compared to the prior year, driven by an improvement in gross margin. Margins in Asia-Pacific have been very resilient and we will continue to balance our customer relationships with the value we provide compared to the costs served. Overall, we have made considerable progress improving our financial profile in all our segments and we are well positioned to benefit from an improvement in underlying market conditions. Along the line, our interest expense was approximately $2 million lower in the first quarter compared to the prior year and $1 million lower compared to the fourth quarter of 2023, which reflects a significant reduction in our variable cost debt in 2023.\n\nOur cost of debt in the first quarter was approximately 6.4%, which is in line with where we exited the prior quarter. Our effective tax rate, excluding non-recurring and non-core items, was approximately 27% in the first quarter. We continue to expect our effective tax rate in 2024 to be approximately 29%. Our GAAP diluted earnings per share were $1.95 and our non-GAAP diluted earnings per share were $2.09. This strong result represents an 11% year-over-year increase in earnings per share, which was driven by an improvement in operating earnings and lower interest costs. Switching to liquidity, we generated $27 million of cash from operations in the first quarter, which has historically been our lowest quarter for cash generation. We expect to continue to improve our working capital efficiency as we progress through 2024 and expect another strong year of operating cash flow.\n\nCapital expenditures in the first quarter were approximately $4 million and we also paid approximately $8 million in dividends in the first quarter. We continue to expect our capital expenditures will be between 1.5% and 2.5% of sales in 2024. Our balance sheet and liquidity remain strong. Our net debt at the end of the first quarter was $574 million and our net leverage ratio remains at 1.8 times our adjusted yield. Our financial position and cash flow generation capabilities continue to enable us to execute on our disciplined capital allocation strategy aimed at value creation. We have started 2024 with another solid quarter for Quaker Houghton. We continue to demonstrate the earnings power of the organization despite a persistent and challenging end market environment.\n\nWe remain focused on delivering our long-term targets while investing in our growth enablers as part of our enterprise strategy, which are expected to support and accelerate our profitable growth initiatives. This, combined with our disciplined capital allocation strategy, positions us well to deliver significant value creation. With that, I'll turn it back over to Andy.\n\nAndy Tometich: Thank you, Shane. Our team has executed well and I'm excited by the opportunities ahead for Quaker Houghton. With that, we'll be glad to address your questions.", "source": {"uri": "finance.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo!

My name is Matt and I'll be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to Viad Corp's First Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Carrie Long, you may begin your conference.\n\nCarrie Long: Good afternoon and thank you for joining us for Viad's 2024 first quarter earnings conference call. We issued our earnings press release after the market closed today, along with an earnings presentation, which are both available on our website at viad.com. We will be referring to specific pages from the presentation during the call as we discuss their business performance and outlook. And I'd like to point out that our earnings press release and presentation contain important disclosures regarding non-GAAP measures that we'll be referring to during the call, including adjusted EBITDA and adjusted net loss. During the call, you'll hear from Steven Moster, our President and CEO and President of GES; Ellen Ingersoll, our Chief Financial Officer; and David Barry, President of Pursuit.\n\nBefore turning the call over to Steve, I'd like to remind everyone that certain statements made during the call, which are not historical facts, may constitute forward-looking statements. Information concerning business and other risk factors that could cause actual results to materially differ from those in the forward-looking statements can be found in our annual, quarterly and other current reports filed with the SEC. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Steve, who will start on Page 4 of our earnings presentation.\n\nSteven Moster: Thanks, Carrie, and thanks to all of you for joining our call. I am happy to report that our first quarter results were in line with our expectations, and we're off to a strong start for 2024. GES' strong first quarter performance drove margin expansion with healthy revenue growth and Pursuit delivered 14% revenue growth during the seasonally slower period and successfully launched its new FlyOver Chicago attraction. We are optimistic about the year ahead and are maintaining our favorable outlook for strong growth as positive trends continue for both businesses. We're in a position of strength with accelerating business activity on the horizon and expect to deliver approximately 16% to 30% year-over-year growth in our full year consolidated adjusted EBITDA.\n\nAt Pursuit, we have an exciting peak summer season ahead and are on track to continue setting new records for both revenue and EBITDA this year. We're seeing signs of robust demand for our destinations and experiences, including FlyOver Chicago. At GES, we expect to continue delivering impressive profitable growth this year from healthy industry demand, our strong non-annual show schedule and our transformed margin profile. Now let's get into the details, starting with Ellen, who will review our financial performance and guidance.\n\nEllen Ingersoll: Thanks, Steve. I'll start on Page 6 with our consolidated first quarter results. Revenue increased $12.7 million or 4.9% year-over-year with healthy growth at both Pursuit and GES. Consolidated adjusted EBITDA increased $0.9 million, and our first quarter adjusted net loss improved by $0.3 million. Our GAAP basis net loss attributable to Viad was $4.2 million higher than the 2023 first quarter, primarily reflecting increased non-operational items and income tax expense. As a reminder, our 2023 first quarter GAAP net loss included a $2.1 million favorable tax matter. As shown on Page 7, Pursuit's first quarter revenue grew $4.6 million or 14% year-over-year, and adjusted EBITDA decreased by $0.8 million during the seasonally slow period.\n\nPursuit's revenue growth was led by attraction ticket revenue, which increased 25% due to higher effective ticket prices and a 10% increase in visitors. We saw a particularly strong demand for our Sky Lagoon attraction in Iceland and our new FlyOver Chicago attraction that opened in March. Pursuit's adjusted EBITDA decline primarily reflects increased operating cost to support higher business volume. And as we move into the next 2 quarters of higher activity, revenue growth will more than offset our wider seasonal loss. As shown on Page 8, GES delivered consolidated revenue growth of $8.1 million or 3.6% and adjusted EBITDA growth of $2.2 million during the first quarter. When adjusting to exclude the unfavorable impact of major non-annual shows, GES' first quarter year-over-year revenue growth was about 6%.\n\nSpiro delivered revenue growth of $0.9 million or 1.5%. Excluding the impact of major non-annual events, Spiro's revenue growth rate was about 7% versus the 2020 first quarter, driven by strong spending from existing and new clients. GES Exhibitions delivered revenue growth of $6.3 million or 3.7%. Excluding the impact of major non-annual events, GES Exhibitions revenue growth rate was about 5% versus the 2023 first quarter as show sizes continued to improve. We ended the 2024 first quarter with total liquidity of $137.2 million, comprising $48.8 million in cash and $88.4 million of available capacity on our revolving credit facility. Our first quarter cash flow from operations was an outflow of $7.5 million, which was lower than expected due to working capital timing.\n\nOur capital expenditures totaled $20.7 million, including approximately $8 million of growth CapEx at Pursuit. We ended the quarter with $488.4 million of debt, and our net leverage ratio was 2.7x, which is near the low end of our target ratio range of 2.5x to 3.5x. While we are comfortable with our level of debt and strong liquidity position, we've been focused on lowering the cost of our debt. On April 26, we successfully repriced our Term Loan B, which had a remaining outstanding balance of $320 million at the end of the quarter. I'm very pleased to say that we reduced our borrowing rate by 75 basis points to SOFR plus 4.25% and remove the additional silver credit spread adjustment. This repricing will reduce our annual interest cost by more than $2.5 million.\n\nNext, I'll cover our 2024 outlook on Page 9 before turning the call over to David for additional color on Pursuit. We continue to expect very strong growth in full year consolidated adjusted EBITDA and are reaffirming our guidance range of $171 million to $191 million. For Pursuit, we continue to expect full year adjusted EBITDA to be in the range of $105 million to $115 million on mid-single-digit revenue growth with a full year adjusted EBITDA margin of about 30% as compared to 26.4% in 2023. For Pursuit's second quarter, we expect adjusted EBITDA to be in the range of $20 million to $24 million as compared to $19.5 million in the 2023 second quarter. For GES, we continue to expect full year adjusted EBITDA to be in the range of $80 million to $90 million as compared to $68.2 million in 2023, with a full year adjusted EBITDA margin of about 8.5% as compared to 7.7% in 2023.\n\nWe expect CES to deliver low double-digit revenue growth, including about $65 million of net incremental revenue from major non-annual shows. We expect GES' second quarter adjusted EBITDA to be in the range of $34.5 million to $38.5 million versus $26.8 million in the 2023 second quarter. We expect new wins and continued underlying growth to more than offset the impact of major non-annual shows which are expected to negatively impact revenue by about $10 million during the second quarter. With the meaningful full year EBITDA growth we are anticipating, we also expect very strong operating cash flow, particularly in the third quarter with Pursuit's seasonal contribution and GES' two largest non-annual shows taking place. For the full year, we continue to anticipate an operating cash inflow in the range of $120 million to $140 million, and we are planning for full year capital expenditures of $65 million to $70 million, including growth CapEx of about $20 million at Pursuit.\n\nWe are committed to being good stewards of shareholder capital and will balance value-enhancing growth investments with maintaining a strong balance sheet and ample liquidity. I also want to quickly comment on our expectations for tax expense, which absent guidance from us is very challenging to model given our jurisdictional tax positions. For the full year, we anticipate an effective tax rate of 27% to 28%. And during the second quarter, we expect an effective tax rate of 15% to 16%. Now David and Steve will provide further insight into our business performance and the exciting growth coming our way at Pursuit and GES. David, over to you.\n\nDavid Barry: Thanks, Ellen. All right. Let's dive into Pursuit. We've had an encouraging start to what should be another year of record-setting revenue and EBITDA and continued margin expansion. I'll start by discussing our attractions performance on Page 11. Pursuit's year-round bucket list attraction started 2024 with strong momentum. Our ticket revenue grew approximately 25% to $18 million, and this was driven by the powerful delivery of our guest experiences, an impressive increase in visitation, which was up about 10%, and continued focus on our revenue maximization and pricing initiatives. Our same-store ticket revenue grew by 18% year-over-year, with substantially higher effective ticket prices. Sky Lagoon was a big contributor to our success with robust demand for the geothermal attraction experience in Iceland.\n\nWe continue to benefit from the increase in volcanic activity that has affected certain parts of the country, bringing more visitors into the center of Reykjavik. Iceland has been experiencing higher visitation and our team has done a terrific job growing the business and increasing awareness at Sky Lagoon. Additionally, on March 1st, we successfully opened our new world-class attraction, FlyOver Chicago. It is a phenomenal experience with an exhilarating flight ride that captures the story and spirit of Chicago. We have an ideal location at Navy Pier, which sees about 9 million visitors each year. In our first month of operation, we have strong visitation, received really favorable reviews, and delivered positive adjusted EBITDA. We're well positioned for a solid first year for our newest build growth investment.\n\nSo next, on Page 12 for hospitality. Our one-of-a-kind lodges delivered solid room revenue performance of about $8 million during the seasonally slower period. We experienced some softness early in the year from unfavorable weather and ski conditions within our destinations. But as conditions normalize later in the quarter, results rebounded quickly with about 7% year-over-year room revenue growth in March, and our team did an incredible job maximizing revenue, and hustled to offset the weaker early season. The Forest Park Alpine Hotel that we opened in 2022 continues to be a solid build to growth investment in addition to our portfolio. This elevated forest-inspired property in the heart of the mountain town of Jasper realized strong year-over-year room revenue and RevPAR increases during the quarter.\n\nAdditionally, the new Founder's Cabins that we added to Pyramid Lake Lodge last summer contributed incremental room revenue and available rooms during the quarter. These new accommodations are a great example of a recent successful refresh growth investment that enhance the guest experience and expanded capacity within our existing well-performing business. We continue to expect growth in full year room revenue in RevPAR as our seasonal properties ramp open in the coming months. Our hospitality businesses are in iconic destinations with strong perennial demand. And as this demand builds into the season, it creates compression in the market. Iconic destinations with strong perennial demand, a finite bed base and high occupancy, when you combine it together with pricing power, it's a great recipe for success.\n\nAs shown on Page 13, our room revenue on the books for 2024 is ahead of this time last year with strong improvements in ADRs for both our Canadian and U.S. lodging properties. This early booking pacing trend is encouraging, and I'm optimistic about the peak season ahead. Lodging pacing is a leading indicator of destination demand and the strength we're seeing in advanced booking supports our favorable outlook for both our lodging and our attractions. We continue to expect favorable leisure travel trends and the prioritization of discretionary spend on experiences. And we provide the iconic, unforgettable and inspiring bucket list experiences that global travelers are looking for. So overall revenue growth, you can see on Page 14, our overall revenue growth trajectory.\n\nFor the first 3 months of the year, our revenue increased about 14% and set a new record for the first quarter. We continue to expect full year revenue to grow mid-single digits from strong guest demand, pricing power and increased visitation from both home and abroad. We're gearing up for a busy peak summer season, and we're in great shape from a seasonal staffing perspective. Next let's look at Page 15 and discuss our adjusted EBITDA margin expansion. For the full year, we expect to drive further margin improvement and achieve our target adjusted EBITDA margin of about 30% through higher attraction visitation with strong throughput, revenue management, and careful focus on labor and expense management. We're ready to deliver another year of record-breaking results with our full year adjusted EBITDA expected to be in the range of $105 million to $115 million, and this is about triple the amount of EBITDA we produced in 2015 and reflects the strength of our powerful refresh build by growth strategy.\n\nOur results will benefit from our newest build investment, FlyOver Chicago, as well as other smaller refresh investments at our well instrumented and high-performing existing experiences. These refresh investments include expanding the wellness ritual at Sky Lagoon in Iceland, launching a new tour experience at the Columbia Icefield Adventure in Jasper, expanding our guest capacity with a new boat at Maligne Lake and opening a new food and beverage experience at the West Glacier Village in Montana. So now let's talk about our exciting future beyond 2024 with continued profitable growth. Looking ahead, we expect continued multiyear margin expansion with a goal of reaching an adjusted EBITDA margin of 33%. We remain very focused on boosting our profitability and believe that 33% is the optimal level for our business, while still having appropriate resources to continue to deliver great staff and guest experiences, maintain our assets, maximize our pricing power and successfully deliver additional growth investments.\n\nOur remarkable journey to meaningfully scale Pursuit is ongoing, and our successful refresh build by strategy remains unchanged. We have a strong pipeline of organic and inorganic investment opportunities to help accelerate our growth in 2025 and beyond. And everything we do is in support of our vision for what Pursuit is becoming. Our vision is to be the world's leading provider of iconic bucket list attractions and vertically integrated hospitality experiences. So just as I conclude my remarks, most importantly, I just want to say a big thank you to our Pursuit team members who have been working hard to get us ready for a kickoff to the season and to create extraordinary experiences and lasting memories for our guests and staff in '24.\n\nSteve, back to you.\n\nSteven Moster: Thanks, David. Now let's switch over to GES, starting with GES Exhibition trends on Page 17. Same-show revenue and same-show event sizes are key revenue drivers for the GES Exhibition business. I'm very happy to see that both metrics continue to improve year-over-year versus pre-pandemic levels. As I've discussed on past calls, our same-show revenue metric has returned to pre-pandemic levels as our exhibition team has done an incredible job delivering great service and growing revenue per square foot of event space through smart pricing and compelling service offerings. However, the size of event as measured by same-show square footage remains about 10% below pre-pandemic levels. We see this as a meaningful opportunity for further revenue and margin growth as event sizes continue to recover, which we believe will continue through 2025.\n\nAnd given GES' flexible cost structure, each incremental same show dollar flows to EBITDA at a high rate. We're encouraged by the favorable trends we're seeing and strong demand within the event industry. Our well-established leadership position in key trade show markets, long-standing client relationships and multiyear contracts with high renewal rates put us in a strong position to retain and grow events. Entering this year, GES Exhibitions' revenue was already over 90% sold and under contract. We are well positioned for a solid year of performance from exhibitions. Now let's talk about Spiro on Page 18. Spiro is built for strong revenue growth of high single to low double digits from new and existing clients in the large fragmented growing experiential marketing market.\n\nAs one of the few experiential marketing agencies with end-to-end capabilities and global reach, we are well positioned for growth. Our winning growth strategy is focused on retaining, growing and expanding our clients. Starting with retain, it is important that we maintain our marquee client base and use it as a foundation for future growth. Spiro already has strong positions with leading companies in targeted industries. We represent over 1,500 corporate clients and the best of the best. Moving to grow. We are focused on accelerating our existing client revenue with new products and services beyond the trade show floor to pursue untapped revenue opportunities. Next, expand. We're utilizing our competitive differentiators, including unmatched global capabilities to penetrate new markets and acquire new clients.\n\nI'm very pleased to share that we have now reached a total of 60 new client wins since launching Spiro as a discrete experiential marketing agency within GES in early 2022. This is a testament to the strength of the Spiro team and capabilities as well as the importance of experiential marketing as a means for brands to connect with customers in a powerful way. On Page 19, you can see GES' overall revenue growth trajectory. GES is experiencing improved industry dynamics and steady underlying growth. When adjusting to remove the impact of major non-annual events, GES' consolidated revenue grew by 6% in the first quarter. For GES Exhibitions, that growth rate was about 5%, driven by same-show revenue growth. Notably, U.S. exhibition same-show revenue grew about 6% and event sizes grew about 2% compared to the prior year first quarter.\n\nFor Spiro, the adjusted growth rate was about 7%, driven by our success winning new clients and growing revenue from existing clients. Corporate marketing budgets are exceeding 2019 levels as corporate marketers are finding new ways to engage with their target audiences through experiential marketing. Additionally, participation at trade shows and conferences continues to improve, and the demand for trade show services is approaching 2019 levels. These favorable trends, along with a strong major non-annual show schedule, give us confidence in our outlook for the full year. As Ellen mentioned earlier, we continue to expect GES to deliver full year revenue growth in the low double-digit range. The GES team is laser-focused on executing our client experiences in front of us.\n\nThe second and third quarters of this year will be particularly strong for GES. The second quarter will benefit from a high volume of new business wins, and the third quarter will see incremental revenue of about $85 million to $90 million from major non-annual shows. The most significant new event for the second quarter is the McDonald's 2024 Worldwide Convention, which is one of the largest client projects Spiro will deliver this year. And it's a terrific example of the power of the GES collective where Spiro provides the sizzle and GES Exhibitions provides the infrastructure. During April, team members across Spiro and GES Exhibitions came together to transform the Fira de Barcelona into a temporary center for McDonald's megabrand.\n\nLed by Spiro's strategy, creative and production talent, and supported by GES' logistical capabilities, we partnered with McDonald's to create a high-impact community experience for 14,000 internal and supply chain stakeholders from across the globe. Now let's take a look at Page 20 and discuss our adjusted EBITDA margin expansion. I'm very happy with the results that we're seeing from our efforts to drive margin improvement at GES. We achieved an 8% adjusted EBITDA margin for the first quarter, which is up 70 basis points year-over-year. Our transformed cost structure is paying dividends. With our strong major non-annual shows scheduled this year and our ongoing focus on efficiency gains, we expect to deliver an adjusted EBITDA margin of about 8.5% for the full year.\n\nNow let's talk about our exciting future beyond 2024 with continued profitable growth. GES is focused on maintaining revenue levels in 2025 despite the unfavorable impact of major non-annual shows. GES Exhibitions is already selling and winning events in 2025 and beyond. And Spiro continues to add to its client roster and work with existing clients to support them across a wider spectrum of experiential marketing activities. Additionally, we have a robust multiyear road map of lean initiatives to enhance our margin each year. We expect to hold at or above our 8% adjusted EBITDA margin target beyond 2024 with and without the benefit of our major non-annual shows. The fundamental changes we made to reduce GES Exhibitions' cost structure and build Spiro growth capabilities have transformed GES' margin profile.\n\nNow in closing, we're thrilled with our performance and the strength we are seeing across our businesses as well as the bright future we see ahead of us. We remain committed to our strategy to create extraordinary experiences and strong returns for our shareholders. I want to thank our hardworking and dedicated employees and our shareholders for your continued support in Viad.

Reports First Quarter 2024 Financial Results", "body": "The company increased its 2024 full-year revenue, gross margin and operating expense guidance.\n\n\"We are pleased with a strong start to the year, fueled by the continued adoption of our Light Adjustable Lens technology,\" said Ron Kurtz, Chief Executive Officer and President of RxSight. \"With the growing number of doctors and practices offering the LAL as well as increasing interest among patients, we believe we are establishing a new standard for premium IOL offerings in the U.S.\"\n\nFirst Quarter Financial Results\n\nIn the first quarter of 2024, total revenue was $29.5 million, an increase of 69% compared to $17.5 million in the first quarter of 2023. Revenue growth was driven by a 92% increase in LAL revenue and a 35% increase in LDD revenue, compared to the first quarter of 2023.\n\nGross profit for the first quarter of 2024 was $20.7 million or 70% of revenue, an increase of $10.3 million or 100% compared to gross profit of $10.4 million or 59% of revenue for the first quarter of 2023. The favorable shift in product mix toward LAL sales drove the increase in gross profit in the quarter, along with reduced costs to produce LALs, primarily due to higher production volumes and increased margin on the LDD due to lower material costs.\n\nTotal operating expenses for the first quarter of 2024 were $31.4 million, a 34% increase from $23.5 million in the first quarter of 2023, reflecting the company's ongoing investments to grow its LDD installed base and support increased LAL sales volume.\n\nIn the first quarter of 2024, the company reported a net loss of $(9.1) million, or $(0.25) per basic and diluted share, compared to a net loss of $(13.2) million, or $(0.42) per basic and diluted share in the first quarter of 2023. Adjusted net loss in the first quarter of 2024 was $(4.4) million, or $(0.12) per basic and diluted share, compared to an adjusted net loss of $(9.9) million, or $(0.31) per basic and diluted share in the first quarter of 2023.\n\nCash, cash equivalents and short-term investments as of March 31, 2024, were $125.4 million compared to $127.2 million at December 31, 2023.\n\n2024 Guidance\n\nThe company increased its 2024 full-year revenue, gross margin and operating expense guidance as follows:\n\nConference Call\n\nOn Monday, May 6, 2024, at 1:30 p.m. Pacific Time, the company will host a conference call to discuss its first quarter 2024 financial results. Participants may register for the call and listen through a live and archived webcast of the event available for one year at https://investors.rxsight.com/.\n\nAbout RxSight, Inc.\n\nRxSight, Inc. is an ophthalmic medical device company dedicated to providing high-quality customized vision to patients following cataract surgery. The RxSight Light Adjustable Lens system, comprised of the RxSight Light Adjustable Lens (LAL/LAL+, collectively the \"LAL\"), RxSight Light Delivery Device (LDD) and accessories, is the first and only commercially available intraocular lens (IOL) technology that can be adjusted after surgery, enabling doctors to customize and deliver high-quality vision to patients after cataract surgery. Additional information about RxSight can be found at www.rxsight.com.\n\nForward-Looking Statements\n\nThis press release contains forward-looking statements, including with respect to the increasing adoption and utilization of Light Adjustable Lens system; the growing number of doctors and practices offering the LAL and increasing interest among patients; RxSight's belief that it is establishing a new standard for premium IOL offerings in the U.S.; and RxSight's projected revenue, gross margin, and operating expenses for 2024. Such statements relate to future events or our future financial performance and involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause our or our industry's actual results, levels of activity, performance or achievements to be materially different from any future results, levels of activity, performance or achievements expressed, implied or inferred by these forward-looking statements, and among other things, our ability to maintain cash balances and successfully commercialize or partner our product candidates currently under development. In some cases, you can identify forward-looking statements by terminology such as \"may,\" \"will,\" \"should,\" \"could,\" \"would,\" \"expects,\" \"plans,\" \"intends,\" \"anticipates,\" \"believes,\" \"estimates,\" \"predicts,\" \"projects,\" \"potential,\" or \"continue\" or the negative of such terms and other same terminology. These statements are only predictions based on our current expectations and projections about future events. You should not place undue reliance on these statements. Actual events or results may differ materially. In evaluating these statements, you should specifically consider various factors, including the risk factors that may be found in the section entitled Part II, Item 1A (Risk Factors) in the Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the three months ended March 31, 2024, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on or about the date hereof, and the other documents that RxSight may file from time to time with the SEC. These and other factors may cause our actual results to differ materially from any forward-looking statement. We undertake no obligation to update any of the forward-looking statements after the date of this press release to conform those statements to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events, except as required by applicable law.\n\nTo supplement our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements presented under generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (\"GAAP\"), we believe certain non-GAAP measures, including adjusted net loss, and adjusted net loss per share, basic and diluted, provide useful information to investors and are useful in evaluating our operating performance. For example, we exclude stock-based compensation expense because this expense is non-cash in nature and we believe excluding this item provides meaningful supplemental information regarding our operational performance and allows investors the ability to make more meaningful comparisons between our operating results and those of other companies.\n\nWe believe that non-GAAP financial information, when taken collectively, may be helpful to investors because it provides consistency and comparability with past financial performance. However, non-GAAP financial information is presented for supplemental informational purposes only, has limitations as an analytical tool and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for financial information presented in accordance with GAAP. In addition, other companies, including companies in our industry, may calculate similarly titled non-GAAP measures differently or may use other measures to evaluate their performance. A reconciliation is provided below for each non-GAAP financial measure to the most directly comparable financial measure stated in accordance with GAAP. Investors are encouraged to review the related GAAP financial measures and the reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures, and not to rely on any single financial measure to evaluate our business.\n\nAdjusted Net Loss and Adjusted Net Loss Per Share\n\nAdjusted net loss is a non-GAAP financial measure that we define as net loss adjusted for stock-based compensation. We believe adjusted net loss provides investors with useful information on period-to-period performance as evaluated by management and comparison with our past financial performance and is useful in evaluating our operating performance compared to that of other companies in our industry, as this metric generally eliminates the effects of certain items that may vary from company to company for reasons unrelated to overall operating performance.\n\nReconciliations of net loss to adjusted net loss and the presentation of adjusted net loss per share, basic and diluted, are as follows:", "source": {"uri": "wallstreet-online.de", "dataType": "news", "title": "wallstreet:online"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libertair,_Direct,_Democratisch", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Libertair, Direct, Democratisch"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intraocular_lens", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Intraocular lens"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gross_income", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gross income"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operating_expense", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Operating expense"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gross_margin", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gross margin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Lakers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Lakers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cataract_surgery", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cataract surgery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revenue", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Revenue"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accounting_standard", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Accounting standard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ophthalmology", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ophthalmology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_device", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Medical device"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._Securities_and_Exchange_Commission", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Surgery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metric_system", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Metric system"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_statement", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Financial statement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities/Opposing_Views", "label": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities/Opposing Views", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 96}], "image": "https://assets.wallstreet-online.de/_media/6/source1280/size_645/globenewswire-1280.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9542931", "eventUri": "eng-9542931", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.4509803921568627, "wgt": 115, "relevance": 1}

As a reminder, today's call is being recorded. Today's Thursday, May 2, 2024, and at this time, for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Global Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Mr. Jay Hennick. Please go ahead, sir.\n\nJay Hennick: Thank you, operator. Good morning, and thanks for joining us on our first quarter conference call. As the operator mentioned, I'm Jay Hennick, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of the company. And with me today is Chris McLernon, Chief Executive Officer of our Real Estate Services business; and Christian Mayer, our Chief Financial Officer. As always, this call is being webcast and is available in the Investor Relations section of our Web site, along with a presentation slide deck. During the quarter, revenue, EBITDA, outsourcing and advisory, investment management and leasing all demonstrated improvement over the prior year. Despite ongoing interest rate uncertainty and geopolitical tensions that are affecting everyone, it also affected our capital markets. Our strategic focus, however, being on expanding high-value, recurring service lines that continue to yield positive results for us, positioning us extremely well for the future. We remain committed to the Colliers way, emphasizing solid internal growth and strategic acquisitions that enhance our business and create value for our shareholders. In the most recent quarter, we successfully added $300 million in new equity to support our further expansion. Furthermore, our acquisition of Colliers Philadelphia has expanded our presence in the Mid-Atlantic region, solidifying our position as a key player in the United States. Over the years, Colliers has established a highly respected global brand and growth platform with broad diversification across revenue sources, service lines and geography. With more than 70% of our earnings generated from recurring revenue streams, we have a very robust business model with 3 distinct growth engines that can continue to allow us to capitalize on growth opportunities while maintaining resilience in the face of economic fluctuations. Most importantly, Colliers has a seasoned leadership team with a substantial equity stake in our company and an impressive 29-year record of delivering nearly 20% compound annual returns for shareholders. And now let me ask Chris McLernon to discuss some highlights from our service business and once he's completed, Christian will provide his usual financial report. Then, we'll open things up for questions. Chris?\n\nChris McLernon: Thank you, Jay, and good morning, everyone. Colliers first quarter 2024 results reflect the strength of our resilient and highly diversified professional services platform. Our Outsourcing & Advisory business delivered robust revenue growth with broad-based increases across all services, led by engineering and project management. We expect this momentum to continue through the remainder of the year, providing growth, balance and stability to our platform. This growth helped offset expected soft transaction volumes in capital markets, which, although down were above market activity levels. We remain cautiously optimistic about improving transaction velocity in the late second half of 2024, contingent on softening interest rates, the narrowing of the price gap between buyers and sellers and improved lending availability. Leasing globally achieved modest growth year-over-year with several markets increasing activity in the office sector as occupiers make longer-term lease commitments, coupled with the return to office continuing the trend upwards. Shortly after the quarter end, we completed the acquisition of our affiliate in Philadelphia. From its five offices, the company's 130 professionals provide leasing and sales brokerage and property management services. As a vibrant and influential market, our ownership now allows us to significantly increase our presence in the Mid-Atlantic and expand our capabilities in the eighth largest metropolitan area in the US. Among our many accolades in February, we were named to the IAOPs list of top 100 global professional services firms. A testament to our track record of success in delivering exceptional results for our clients wherever they do business. We have also been recognized as one of the best workplaces in Canada this year out of more than 900 companies competing for a spot. The steps we are taking to strategically invest in our people and business, fill gaps and take market share will continue to strengthen our platform and drive long-term shareholder value. Now I'll turn things over to Christian who will provide more details on our financials.\n\nChristian Mayer: Thank you, Chris, and good morning. As usual, I'll provide some additional commentary on our consolidated results, our financial outlook and our balance sheet. Note that all references to revenue growth made on this call are expressed in local currency, and that the non-GAAP measures discussed here today are as defined in the materials accompanying this call. For the seasonally slow first quarter, revenues were $1 billion, up 4% relative to Q1 2023. Internal growth was 2% with strength in our diversified recurring services outpacing a decline in capital markets activity. Our Outsourcing & Advisory service line generated strong 9% revenue growth, mostly from internal sources. Investment Management excluding pass-through period interest was essentially flat with the prior year. Leasing revenues were up 2% for the quarter, led by modest growth in office leasing. First quarter consolidated adjusted EBITDA was $109 million, up 4% relative to the prior year with margins holding flat at 10.8%. We continue to closely manage our cost to match the expected pace of revenues, especially in our Capital Markets business. We also remain focused on improving productivity and on selective strategic recruiting. In our Investment Management segment, AUM declined modestly during the quarter, mostly attributable to unrealized market value adjustments and our alternative and traditional real estate funds despite growing net operating income at the asset level. These adjustments totaled 1.5%, which outperformed the benchmark Odyssey Index. In addition, some funds disposed of long-held assets during the quarter, realizing gains and recycling the proceeds back to investors. This positions us well for future fundraising. Our first quarter fundraising totaled $450 million. We continue to see strong interest in our alternative, infrastructure and credit strategies and we anticipate an acceleration in fundraising momentum as we progress through the year. We are maintaining our financial outlook for 2024. While interest rate volatility and geopolitical tensions continue to weigh on transaction volumes, we expect a rebound in activity in the third and fourth quarters. Although there is a risk that this could be delayed to later in the year or to early 2025. In our recurring service lines, both outsourcing and advisory and investment management, we continue to expect mid- to high single-digit revenue growth for the balance of the year. Turning to our balance sheet. Our financial leverage ratio, defined as net debt to pro forma adjusted EBITDA was 2 times at March 31. We expect leverage to rise modestly in Q2 due to seasonal working capital usage then to decline to approximately 1.5 times by the end of the year, assuming no significant acquisitions. With the $300 million equity offering we completed during the first quarter we are well positioned with more than $1 billion in available liquidity to execute on acquisition opportunities as the year unfolds. This concludes my prepared remarks. I'd now like to open the call for questions. Operator, can you please open the line?\n\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] First question comes from Stephen MacLeod at BMO Capital Markets.\n\nStephen MacLeod: I just wanted to just dial in on the outlook for 2024. I just wanted to confirm or just kind of get your thoughts on the components specifically around -- I mean you mentioned Outsourcing & Advisory up mid-single digits to high single digit. Just thinking about capital markets and leasing. Are you still expecting things to be sort of flattish in the first half with some growth in the back half? And then on Investment Management, do you still kind of expect the same level of fund raising in 2024 in that. I think it was $5 billion to $8 billion range as you expected with Q4?\n\nChristian Mayer: Steve, let me start with that one. I think you've laid out some of the component pieces here. I think the growth will come from each of those components, about one third from our Outsourcing & Advisory business, which we have a high degree of visibility on, as Chris mentioned, with backlogs of work in process and to be completed, one third of the growth will come from investment management, and that's going to roll out through the year. We think it will be weighted more towards the back half of the year, but we have strong activity levels, and we expect hopefully, to secure new capital comments from investors as the year progresses. And finally, one third of the growth expected in capital markets. This is going to be weighed as I mentioned to the third and fourth quarters. So not expecting anything really in terms of growth in the second quarter in capital markets, but a modest rebound in the third and more likely the fourth quarters.\n\nJay Hennick: Steve, let me add something to what Christian is saying. From my perspective, the outlook is really quite straightforward. All of our businesses are doing extremely well with the exception of capital markets, which everybody knows and that's very interest rate driven. So your guess is as good as mine as to when that's going to change. But when it does, it has a material positive impact not only on Colliers, but any other like business in the industry. It really will have a significant impact. The balance of our businesses, as I said, are doing extremely well. Fundraising is a touch soft, getting stronger in investment management. So we think we're going to do nicely as the year progresses. But the forecast is really quite simple, at least from my perspective and I think we're all managing -- the key is to manage the business as closely as possible. And as you know, we've done this for many years, and we think we've got our eye on the price. But it really is going to come down to capital markets when it changes. When investor -- and Chris said this just a minute ago, and I'm going on a little bit too long here, but there's also decisioning at the -- on the part of sellers. When are they going to sell those assets and there's a lot of pressure on a lot of sellers right now from a financing standpoint to take action. So interest rates will impact it, of course, but there's also other factors that could accelerate capital markets a little bit quicker than just interest rates alone. I offer that only as a means of trying to get a sense of what the balance of the year looks like to us.\n\nChris McLernon: Just a couple of more comments from the field. There was a bright spot this quarter in Asia Pacific. In capital markets, we were up 19% year-over-year. And so we've got some good activity in Japan, Hong Kong, Taiwan, a little bit of Australia. So that's a bright spot. We are starting to see, over the last 18 months, there's obviously low transaction volumes and really below the $50 million. But as Jay was saying, the pressure is starting to build. And the market is starting to test some bigger ticket items, so 200 plus level. In Q1, Colliers brokered three deals, I can give you examples of more than 200, one in Oslo, Norway; one in Korea and one in Australia. So we're starting to see more activity, more pitches and mandates, but I think it will be incremental activity. And as Christian said, towards the back half of the year, but we'll start to accelerate it.\n\nStephen MacLeod: That's great color from all three of you. I just wanted to just shift gears a little bit and just talk a little bit about the acquisition pipeline. Just sort of what you're seeing out there. You have lots of strong liquidity right now, strong leverage. And so just wondering kind of what you're seeing there and where your interests lie currently.\n\nJay Hennick: We have a very interesting pipeline of acquisitions, some larger and several smaller virtually across the board. But having three growth engines gives us lots of places to grow and having a global platform with strong management teams that have been around a long time and have operated the Colliers way for a long time, gives us the confidence that we can execute wherever the opportunities are. So we're quite excited. Obviously, we've got to take one step at a time, but the pipeline is solid, I would say.\n\nOperator: The next question comes from Daryl Young at Stifel.\n\nDaryl Young: First question is just around the investment management business and maybe a little bit of color -- you can provide a little bit of color on some of the costs you're adding for fundraising, and you called it distribution capabilities in the Middle East, just put my interest there.\n\nChristian Mayer: Daryl, we've been building our fundraising capabilities and in particular, the Middle East, and that's an area that we have and Asia. But in the Middle East, our share of LPs is quite low. So the opportunity set for us in the Middle East is big. Asia is an area we've been active in for longer, and we have more LPs there, but still room for growth as well in terms of attracting new investors and new sources of capital for our fundraising. The other part that we're focusing effort on which is taking some -- adding some expense is building out our capabilities to launch new strategies and new funds. We've got a few things in the works that are going to launch this year, and we've had to staff up and incur some costs to make that come to reality.\n\nDaryl Young: And then it sounds like you're targeting sort of net new LPs, but what kind of receptivity have you seen from existing LPs re-upping on funds? And then also cross-sell of LPs between the various boutiques that you acquired across the last couple of years?\n\nJay Hennick: In terms of re-ups, we're seeing the same percentages as prior years or prior fund re-ups. What we are seeing is we're seeing adjustments in the allocation. So some of them, if they're tight or they're not balanced properly, will increase or reduce the amount of commitment to the next fund, but virtually 92% or 93% of re-ups has been sort of a consistent theme for us for many years and then introducing -- and that's one of the great things about this business. It's so recurring as long as your investors are happy with the results and the way in which their investments are being managed and then we're introducing new investors, especially during these times and especially to the types of assets that we focus on, which are alternative asset classes, which are very much in demand. And so I would say there's a softness in fundraising generally. It's changing but it's changing for the better. But in terms of re-ups, we're where we need to be. The other thing that we've invested in is the RIA channel through one of our platforms that has a very significant presence. We've doubled our investment around raising capital up through the RIA channel. And -- so we're quite excited about the asset management component of our business and think that all these investments, particularly in times like this, will pay dividends down the line. And it's not just going to be this year, it's going to be next year and beyond. So new products in the marketplace, more investment in distribution capabilities. All of those types of things are the things that you do to build a great platform, which we're doing. We're also investing in -- I should say -- I should have said this at the outset, topgrading our people. We've got some exceptional people, but there's opportunities to add different asset classes, which means you need to bring in different expertise around data centers and a variety of other things that we're working on that just make our platform that much better.\n\nOperator: The next question comes from Stephen Sheldon at William Blair.\n\nStephen Sheldon: I want to start with Chris. Curious what you're seeing in terms of industrial leasing activity. It sounds like the 2% overall leasing growth in the quarter was driven by pickup in office. So it would just be great to get some color on what you're seeing on the industrial side and whether things are weakening there? Just kind of how the trajectory is looking on the industrial side for leasing?\n\nChristian Mayer: So I think in the industrial leasing, there's been a natural cooling after the record-breaking run up after the COVID boom in e-commerce in '21 to '23. Occupiers today are generally concerned about economic conditions and the geopolitical concerns and they're also focused on looking at efficiencies and looking at their existing locations and what can automation do to their facilities. There's also been an increase in vacancy in a number of markets, and so there's more options for occupiers to look at. And so they're taking some more time to analyze what their footprint should look like going forward. So I think it's a natural pause in the cycle. The market is still a good market. But I guess the level of velocity of leasing transaction in industrial is not the same as it was in the record-breaking times just after COVID. The one outlier is that in Canada, we had considerable leasing growth in industrial up 41% year-over-year. So that was the one bright spot. Most of the places around the world, industrial leasing was down. In talking to our operators in the field, I think there's also a little bit of a delay from quarter-to-quarter, so some slippage. I've heard of some larger deals in Australia, Poland and the U.S., notably that could show up in Q2.\n\nStephen Sheldon: And maybe just thinking about the US, how are you thinking about your producer capacity and positioning for when capital markets activity picks up? I think you talked last quarter about record recruiting in the US during 2023. You now also have some more scale with the Philadelphia acquisition. So are you getting closer to the scale that you'd like in the US? And how important is it to continue how do you scale, I guess, through acquisitions, specifically in the US.\n\nChristian Mayer: So I think we continue to recruit top talent, and we've got lots of white space in the US. Our market share is still quite low compared to our major competitors. So this is a priority focus of management to continue to bolster our teams, and we'll do that through either acquisitions like our affiliate in Philadelphia or teams or individuals. So it is still very much a priority. In addition, we're looking at productivity, how do we get more production out of our existing talent and making sure that if there's any nonperformers that -- we're moving them out and then our high potentials, we're investing in those people to make sure that they can perform when the market comes back. So this is still a major initiative of ours to continue to push into capital markets in the US.\n\nStephen Sheldon: And then just one last one for Christian. As we think about our models, tax rates were a little elevated relative to at least what we had modeled for the quarter. So just curious if you have any framework for how we should think about the tax rate over the rest of the year and what you've assumed in the guidance.\n\nChristian Mayer: Yes, Stephen, there was a onetime item in Q1 for a couple of million dollars. So absent that, the rate would have been 30% in the quarter, and we expect the rate to be 30% on a full year basis as well.\n\nOperator: The next question comes from Himanshu Gupta at Scotiabank.\n\nHimanshu Gupta: So just on the 2024 guidance, just clarifying, do you have M&A built into in this guidance? I mean, I know you have done the equity offering now, which was previously not there at the time of original guidance.\n\nChristian Mayer: Himanshu, I think you're asking about acquisitions in the guidance? The answer is no. There's no acquisitions built into the guidance. And the guidance does include the impact of the recent equity offering.\n\nHimanshu Gupta: And then, I mean, given that the guidance is unchanged, has the outlook changed within the segments? I mean are you -- were you still expecting one third of the growth from IM and one third of the growth from capital markets business last quarter as well?\n\nChristian Mayer: Himanshu, I think the components of that outlook are the same, one third from outsourcing and advisory, one third from investment management and one third from the transactional business. That's consistent with what we thought back in February.\n\nHimanshu Gupta: And any incremental weakness baked into the capital markets business? I mean, it looks like the leasing looks to be performing better than expectation and maybe capital markets given the interest rate could be a bit softer. So within two segments, any change in direction?\n\nChristian Mayer: I mean not meaningfully, Himanshu. I mean this is -- I think we do the best we can, and we look at our various components. Every time we update our and look at our forecast, but there's nothing meaningful to call out at this time.\n\nHimanshu Gupta: Then just looking at the valuation on IM, investment management, the valuation adjustment in Q1, was it mostly related to office? I mean can you elaborate a bit there?\n\nChristian Mayer: Himanshu, it was primarily related to our alternative portfolio, and that is not related to the actual portfolio performance itself. I mean the income coming off these assets is the same or better than it was previously. What's happened is the cap rates have gapped out and have driven reduction in the sort of the values that the outside appraisers attach to these assets. As it relates to our office portfolio, it's quite small. It's one third or one fourth of our traditional portfolio, which is a small piece overall. And we've taken cumulatively over the last one and half years, 27%, I believe, mark-to-market adjustment on that office portfolio already. So that is not a driver in the quarter, but certainly, it's been something that's been weighing on AUM over the past one and half years.\n\nHimanshu Gupta: Maybe just a last question on M&A outlook or opportunities. So how close are you on the capital deployment, and anything you want to elaborate on that?\n\nChristian Mayer: So Jay the question is how close are we on capital deployment in terms of acquisitions or other opportunities?\n\nJay Hennick: I'm not -- that's not something that we would normally talk about, number one. Number two, we're actively involved in many transactions right now and they close when they close. And I can't really give you any further color than that. They're all opportunistic and they happen when they happen, but we have a track record of completing multiple transactions over many years.\n\nOperator: The next question comes from Jimmy Shan at RBC.\n\nJimmy Shan: Maybe just a follow-up on the M&A. I know not so much you could share, but can you give us a sense of the deal sizes that you may be looking at across? You mentioned looking at small and big deals. And also, I think we talked about pricing last quarter. Has that -- has there been any change in that given the change in continuously changing rate environment? Have you seen any change in sort of pricing expectations?\n\nJay Hennick: As I mentioned earlier, there are large transactions and there are smaller transactions. I would say that the large transaction pricing is high and it's just the nature of the beast. And what's also happening is, especially in the large transaction environment, these are businesses that are extremely well managed and have great long-term prospects, and that's getting reflected in valuation. When it comes to smaller deals, and of course, smaller is always relative, the pricing is materially lower than it is on the larger transactions. And it also depends on what segment you're talking about, whether it's our more traditional service lines. Right now, you can buy more traditional real estate service businesses at relatively low valuations for obvious reasons, capital markets as an example. But in the other two areas, the valuations, I think, are fair valuations, give or take, on the smaller transactions. And the beauty that we have is that we can integrate those acquisitions in different parts of the world in different segments of the country. That add different capabilities -- service capabilities to us. For example, in engineering, we might want to augment one or two components of our business in a particular region. So there's a nice opportunity for us to just strengthen our business and widen our capabilities. I'm probably giving you too much detail here. But having 3 distinct growth engines being able to execute on a global basis having a strong balance sheet, having a management team that's done this for a number of years, all -- it puts us in an excellent position to capitalize. And in markets like this, there are pockets of areas to capitalize on. So we're very excited about some of the opportunities we have, if we can bring them home. I think that it just takes us to an entirely new level as a company.\n\nJimmy Shan: And then maybe just Christian, a quick follow-up or a clarification. The AUM growth on the investment management business, $5 billion to $8 billion. I think I heard you correctly, you -- in Q1, you had $450 million of fundraising. And so if I just look at the annual number for 2024, simple math, 1% on 5% to 8%, the thinking is that the additional revenue on an annualized basis would be $50 million to $80 million, but weighted towards second half of the year. Is that how we should be thinking about that?\n\nChristian Mayer: Yes, I think that's right, generally. I mean there's a few strategies like credit where the capital does not generate fees until it gets put to work. But generally, in the traditional alternative infrastructure categories, when that capital is raised, there's a fee, clock just starts running immediately.\n\nJimmy Shan: And then some of the new capabilities that you talked about fundraising new capabilities in the Middle East in the RIA channel. Those expenses are already running through in the current quarter?\n\nChristian Mayer: There are charges against EBITDA in the first quarter and some costs were incurred late last year as well on these additional mostly staffing cost.\n\nOperator: The next question comes from Frederic Bastien at Raymond (NS: RYMD ) James.\n\nFrederic Bastien: You just added the Colliers affiliate in Philadelphia, but I was wondering if there are other non-owned affiliates or regions that are of interest to you, whether that's in the US or globally?\n\nChris McLernon: To answer your question, there's a couple potentials in the future. So Houston, Denver, South Carolina, those are kind of -- and Columbus maybe. So just a couple. And internationally, there's not really any affiliates. The markets aren't really big enough.\n\nFrederic Bastien: And maybe switching gears, still on M&A. But on the engineering side, you've been up to now pretty much active in the US and started -- established a footprint in Australia. Are these sort of the regions you're going to continue to focus on in the short term?\n\nJay Hennick: We're open to other regions as well, Fred. There are several markets that are western-type markets that are conducive for growth. You know this better than most other analysts on this call. So yes, there's a number of opportunities and number of different areas that we're pursuing.\n\nOperator: Next question is the follow-up from Daryl Young at Stifel.\n\nDaryl Young: Just on the engineering and the project management. Can you remind us the high-level mix of public versus private? And the context of the question just being some of the slowdowns we've seen in construction activity and the commercial real estate end markets, multifamily, industrial, all those areas. And just anything we should be aware of or considering on that front?\n\nChristian Mayer: Across our business, the mix is roughly 50-50 public sector and private sector and we target that for precisely the reason that you're mentioning because the public sector stuff is extremely stable. It tends to be longer term in nature. The private sector stuff is great work, has long-term contracts, but can be a bit more sensitive to economic conditions. So we try to balance it on that basis.\n\nJay Hennick: Genuinely, a little more profitable.\n\nChristian Mayer: And more profitable, yes. So we like it -- we like that balance, and that's what we try to work towards across the business and to keep those backlogs of work at sort of levels that give us great confidence in terms of our next 12 to 18 months out.\n\nDaryl Young: So things are still sort of motoring along and you're not seeing sort of any major impacts from some of these headlines we're reading?\n\nJay Hennick: No. But if you have any business, you'd like to refer our way, please give us the name, phone number, and we will be all over it.\n\nOperator: There are no further questions. You may proceed with closing comments.\n\nJay Hennick: Thanks, everyone, for participating in the first quarter conference call. Very interesting year, great opportunities we have in front of us. But as always, we'll have to continue to deliver one step at a time. So we look forward to speaking to you again during the second quarter conference call, and thanks for participating.\n\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes the conference call.

I would like to turn the call over to Roger Susi, President and Chief Executive Officer of IRADIMED CORPORATION. Mr. Susi?\n\nRoger Susi: Good morning. Thank you all for joining us on today's call. As recently reported, I'm once again very pleased to announce yet another consecutive quarter of record IRADIMED net revenue generated in our recent Q1 2024 quarter. This is our 11th revenue increase in a row. As this morning's press release announced, in the first quarter of 2024, revenue came in at $17.6 million, representing a 13.7% increase over the first quarter of '23. GAAP diluted earnings per share for the first quarter were $0.32. While non-GAAP diluted earnings were $0.36 per share, a 20% increase over Q1 of '23. All product lines performed well with our inside and outside teams executing exceptionally well. From the revenue standpoint in Q1, the MR patient monitor bested the IV pump and increased by 38%, compared to Q1 of '23. However, this doesn't show the strength of one product line over the other as bookings for the MR IV pump product in Q1, greatly exceeded expectations. So we actually expect that in Q2, the table may turn in favor of pump revenue. As I previously discussed, we notified customers with pumps seven years and older that our extended maintenance would no longer be offered for such older devices. This, as expected, has prompted the uptick in pump orders we've seen in Q1, which we hope to continue to see in the upcoming quarters as well. To be sure, our major products remain viable and fitting for their markets, while we continue to make inroads with our newer FMD product. Previously, I had spoken about reducing our delivery time for disposables and the associated reduction of backlog, though as seen in financial disclosures, the disposable business remains strong and growing, we have managed to reduce the lead time of these products and continue to work to improve these lead times, though orders continue growing, production is not outpaced. Along those lines, we recently began construction on our new 61,000 square foot manufacturing facility here in Orlando, Florida, to consolidate operations, improve efficiencies and prepare for the continued and expanding growth we foresee. We anticipate spending approximately $13 million on its development over the next 12 months. And we will keep you posted in these coming quarters as construction progresses towards a moving date. Now regarding the progress of our 510(k) submission for the new 3870 MRI IV pump. The team is focused and pushing very hard, yet we are still not quite there due primarily to some expanded testing. As previously reported, we have engaged a third-party consultant with two very recent ex-FDA reviewers on their staff, from whom we are getting excellent input. Their feedback has, however, driven us to repeat some of the previous tests, mainly because of devices under test for many months ago, and they have undergone some changes. Our ex-FDA consultants sleeve, the FDA would be much more comfortable with all testing done on the absolute final configuration of the device. Therefore, the aim is to have the test reports referenced, the very latest version of the device, thus removing any questions, is anticipated that these steps should impact the delivery of the 510(k) by approximately 9 to 10 weeks. Still remain on plan with expected clearance in Q1 2025 and plan to show the revenue from the new device in the back half of 2025. Now I'd like to present our expected financial performance guidance for the coming quarter and the balance of the year. For the second quarter of 2024 financial guidance, we expect revenues of $17.6 million to $17.8 million. GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.33 to $0.36 and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.36 to $0.39. We reiterate our guidance for the full year of 2024. We expect to report revenues of $72 million to $74 million, with GAAP diluted earnings per share of $1.37 to $1.47 and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $1.52 to $1.62. Lastly, I'm pleased to report that our Board of Directors has declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.15, payable on May 30, 2024. And we expect to pay the quarterly cash dividend going forward, to reward our loyal shareholders. Now I'd like to turn the call over to Jack Glenn, our CFO, to review the quarter's financial results.\n\nJack Glenn: Thank you, Roger, and good morning, everyone. As in the past, our results have been reported on both a GAAP and non-GAAP basis. You can find a description of our non-GAAP operating measures in this morning's earnings release and a reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to the GAAP measure on the last page of today's release. As we reported earlier this morning, revenue in the first quarter of 2024 was $17.6 million, an increase of 14% compared to the first quarter of 2023. Domestic sales increased 12% to $13.4 million and International sales increased 20% to $4.2 million. Overall, Domestic revenue accounted for 76% of total revenue for Q1 2024 compared to 77% for Q1 2023. Device revenue increased 13% to $11.9 million, driven by a 38% increase in Monitor revenue. Revenue from Disposables and Services increased 17% to a record $5.2 million for the first quarter of 2024, while our maintenance contracts remained stable at $487,000. The gross margin was 76.1% for the first 2024 quarter compared to 75.7% for the 2023 quarter. The increase in gross margin is primarily due to increased revenue, decreased raw material costs and direct labor efficiencies offset by overhead spending. Operating expenses were $8.6 million or 49% of revenue compared to $7.7 million or 50% of revenue for the first quarter of 2023. On a dollar basis, this increase is primarily due to higher sales and marketing expenses for higher sales commissions, sales activity expenses and payroll and benefit expenses. As a result, income from operations grew 18.5% to $4.7 million for the 2024 first quarter. We recognized a tax expense of approximately $1.1 million during the first quarter of 2024, resulting in an effective tax rate of 21.1% for the quarter, which was in line with the effective tax rate of 20.9% in 2023. On a GAAP basis, net income was $0.32 per diluted share compared to $0.27 for the 2023 quarter. On a non-GAAP basis, adjusted net income was $0.36 per diluted share for the 2024 first quarter, compared to $0.30 for the first quarter of 2023. Cash from operations was $3.9 million for the three months ending March 31, 2024, down from $4.6 million for the same period in 2023. For the three months ended March 31, 2024, our free cash flow, a non-GAAP measure, was $3.4 million. This compares to a negative free cash flow figure of $1.9 million in the first quarter of 2023, when we purchased the land for our future facility for $6.2 million. Our cash and cash equivalents totaled $45.1 million as of March 31, 2024. And with that, I will now turn the call over to the operator for questions.\n\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Jason Wittes of ROTH Capital Partners.\n\nJason Wittes: In terms of the Monitor business, yes, it did look quite strong, obviously. Have you sent any communications to the field about your Monitors and about the competition that may have spurred on some growth in this quarter?\n\nRoger Susi: Jason, good to hear from you. I'm not quite sure I understand the question, though. How about -- give it to me again?\n\nJason Wittes: I mean I know that you basically sounded a directive to the field or to your customers that you're no longer going to service the pumps after seven years. Have you done anything similar with Monitors that might have spurred on growth? Or how would you -- the growth was surprising this quarter. So I'm just curious if there were any -- what's behind it or what your thoughts are in terms of what's behind it?\n\nRoger Susi: No, it's -- maybe it was buried a little bit in my comments when I said it doesn't really show so much strength of one product line pump or monitor over the other. It's a matter of timing more than anything else. So -- but no, we absolutely -- the Monitor, actually, we've come out with the competitive nature of the Monitor is that it's quite advanced, and it's state-of-the-art as is. So we wouldn't be absolutely not putting out any sort of a letter obsoleting any facet of it, including support. There's -- we haven't even been selling them for five years. So yes, that's just -- I just have to say, it's just simply the strength of the team going out and selling monitors.\n\nJason Wittes: Sounds good. Yes, it's impressive. It was a strong number, much stronger than I was anticipating. And then in terms of what you said about the submission for the 510(k) for the new pump, I guess that would put it I think originally, it was last communication, it was sort of expected second quarter. And now I guess you're saying 9 to 10 weeks, I guess that would put it into the third quarter in terms of when you would submit that 510(k) ?\n\nRoger Susi: Yes, to put months on it, we'd anticipated getting it out of here by the end of this month. That's what we've been focusing on. But with this curve ball here, it's an abundance of caution to redo some of these tests. And of course, then getting them scheduled has been a delay because we rely on third parties and all of that. So, yes, we think it's going to add about 9, 10 weeks to that. So that puts us somewhere very end of July or early August. We think of it more monthly rather than something that's tied to a quarter.\n\nJason Wittes: I appreciate that precision. It's good to hear that. And then maybe a final question. I mean the communicate you put out, definitely seems to be spurring on growth in pumps. If you look at -- I don't know if you can give any color in terms of if you look at who's been upgrading or who's been replacing. Has it been many of those -- I mean I don't know if you can give us any parameters that can kind of show how many of those pumps that are getting replaced now are the ones that got to communicated that they're no longer to be service after seven years?\n\nRoger Susi: We were anticipating that very question just before the call. So we didn't -- we don't have some definitive metric to give you, but we will shortly. We'll pass that along. But generally, it's a substantial part of the bookings that I mentioned, this big -- a rather large booking uptick in in Q1. And it's pretty substantially from that. But like I say, we'll get some -- we'll have some numbers to share with you very shortly.\n\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Frank Takkinen of Lake Street Capital.\n\nFrank Takkinen: Roger, Jack, congrats on a good start to the year. I was hoping to ask one on the guidance. Obviously, you had a nice outperformance versus your Q1 expectations, and then you kind of hinted at the expectation for pumps to be strong next quarter from some of the Q1 ordering. I was curious kind of the thought process you went through when thinking about slightly increasing the guidance versus reiterating it? Was it just a function of conservatism? Or was there anything else baked into that thought process?\n\nJack Glenn: Well, I think, Chris, that yes, I think if you -- from our past experience here, I think we've tried to be somewhat conservative in the guidance we give. And I think that still is -- the second half of the year is certainly some much bigger numbers in order to hit that. So -- but we feel confident. And certainly, as we progressed throughout the year, we'll certainly maybe provide updates that. But for right now, we think that's the best position for us to reiterate our guidance for the year as is.\n\nFrank Takkinen: Perfect. Perfect. So then on the -- maybe just a follow-up on backlog, generally speaking. Obviously, a little plus/minus here. So I think if I heard correctly, you burned down some of the disposable backlog, but perhaps the pump commentary resulted in pump backlog increasing. Can you just net out total backlog, how much visibility you have and how that gives you confidence going through the rest of the year?\n\nJack Glenn: Well, of course, we don't give the exact numbers, as you know. But again, it's probably very much in line with where the backlog was as we came into the end of the year. So remains strong, gives us good visibility, for at least a quarter out for sure, but very strong and stable backlog. And especially, again, a lot of that, too, due to the pump backlog going into this Q2.\n\nRoger Susi: Yes. Maybe to add a little more color, Frank, to topic, though we are trying to shave that lead time and associated backlog with the with the disposable side, which we're making progress, as I said. Yes, due to the orders on the hardware side, what Jack saying is that the backlog remains pretty consistent as it's been in the last half a dozen quarters.\n\nFrank Takkinen: Got it. That's helpful. And then maybe just one more for me on the Monitor side. I think, Roger, we've talked about in the past, the day-to-day business or quarter-to-quarter business, you talk about the active systems being replaced on the Monitor side and your share of that market and then the broader 10,000 or so pieces of equipment install. Maybe just give us an update how you feel you're penetrated into those? How you feel about the low-hanging fruit opportunity still existing within those? And just anything else you could talk about in those monitoring markets.\n\nRoger Susi: Yes. Well, good question. So we still don't have the lion's share of the market. We're still the underdog. So that means there's still quite a bit to go. We estimate we're just nudging close to 30-ish percent of this business, right? So there's still plenty more for us to go. Having said that, of course, with every incremental percentage gains still against a well-entrenched competitor. The low-hanging fruit is a little higher on the tree. It's life. That's the way it works. So the team is jumping getting, getting their ladders and trying to reach up to a little bit more than they had to do the quarter before and the quarter before that, certainly. But we still are scratching away at that existing open share of what's the Monitor business, which is, by and large, one-to-one with magnets. And that's still where we're operating at. We have had a little luck. We're starting to -- the real upside, as we've mentioned and presented in the past is to have this multiplier effect for the transport strategy, like we developed with the pumps happen with the monitor. And we need to put maybe one or two more little features onto the pump to really make that very smooth, but we're already starting to get some nibbles there. And a few of these monitors each quarter that we bring in are related to let's say, more than one per magnet, an extra one. And there's leaning storage starting to adopt this transport theory. That's yet to be rolled out over the coming quarters, as I said, we still got our hands full just nipping away at the existing placements of monitors. So we'll eat pretty well for still a number of quarters doing what we've been doing. And then we hope to roll out this transport strategy and really get the multiplier effect on top of these monitors, so where they're not just one monitor per each MRI.\n\nOperator: This concludes the question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn it back to Roger Susi for closing remarks.\n\nRoger Susi: Well, thank you, operator. Good. Again, we are pleased with our Q1 2024 results, as stated.

My name is Benjamin and I'll be your operator for today's call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, the conference is being recorded. I'll now turn the call over to Sara Horvath, General Counsel.

With me today, I have Omar Asali, our Chairman and CEO; and Bill Drew, our CFO. Omar will summarize our first quarter results and provide commentary on the operating landscape and Bill will provide additional detail on the financial results, before we open up the call for questions. With that, I'll turn the call over to Omar.\n\nOmar Asali: Thank you, Sara. Good morning, everyone. I appreciate you all joining us today. Our first quarter financial results were largely in line with our expectations as we experienced 4.4% top line growth and meaningfully improved profitability to start the year. We are pleased to report that we experienced our third consecutive quarter of volume growth in PPS as activity levels continue to improve. While the overall operating landscape remains uneven, we are pleased to see continued moderate general improvement. Our gross margins on a constant currency basis improved by 400 basis points year-over-year and adjusted EBITDA margins improved 500 bps on a constant currency due to the favorable paper pricing environment compared to a year ago and higher volumes flowing through the complex.\n\nOverall, we are happy with the start of the year and believe it sets us on a path to achieve our targeted results for 2024. Consistent with much of our recent operating history, we expect the first half of the year will be a lower contributor to 2024 top line performance compared to the back half as we expect more large account activity to ramp up as the year progresses and traditional seasonality to drive higher volumes in the second half of the year. North American sales were up 2.6% in the quarter versus last year, driven by improved void-fill and automation sales year-over-year. At a more macro level, box shipments were flat to slightly up for the quarter, while freight and trucking data remains mixed. The industrial and manufacturing sector remains sluggish, while we are seeing some improvement in e-commerce activity.\n\nThe impacts of higher rates constraining housing activity and all of the spend that goes with it as well as inflationary pressures impacting consumer discretionary spend remain present. This has led to activity levels in North America being okay but inconsistent from month to month. On a positive note, more recently we've seen improvements in consumer confidence, so hopefully that will inspire additional demand for goods. While that is the macro picture, we try to focus on driving outcomes that are within our control at Ranpak such as executing on our strategic account plan. We are pleased with our progress and optimistic that the ramp-up in the plastic to paper shift provides us with solid volume momentum for the remainder of the year while the macro hopefully stabilizes and improves.\n\nWe said in our first quarter call last year that the plastic-to-paper shift was a longer sales cycle given the complexity of some of the organizations involved but that we believed it was only a matter of time before the volumes start to reflect the shift in thinking. I'm pleased to say that in April, we're seeing a pickup in activity from our strategic account initiative and many accounts are beginning the transition away from plastic. Europe, APAC activity levels in the first quarter were solid, with sales up 5.4% versus the prior year, driven by higher volumes in void-fill and wrapping. Activity levels in the region continue to improve slowly, although manufacturing and industrial activity remains subdued, impacting cushioning utilization.\n\nConsumer confidence in the region has been improving since the end of the third quarter but is still well below pre-COVID levels. Geographically speaking, we've seen strength in Southern Europe in countries like Spain and Italy as well as improvement in the U.K. While the central part of Europe that is more manufacturing heavy like Poland, Belgium and Germany are weaker. In APAC, Japan and Australia continue to be bright spots. The input cost environment provides us with a benefit for the first half of the year as paper pricing moved lower throughout the year before reaching a trough in Q4. We expect paper pricing in the first half of the year to be in line with Q4 as pricing flattened out to start the year. We are, however, seeing some producers in North America and Europe making a push to increase pricing as we get deeper into the year.\n\nOverall, we are targeting to maintain a gross margin in 2024 that is in line with our finish in 2023. So we're working closely with our vendors to plan accordingly and determine if we need to make pricing adjustments based on the commodity environment. The freight market has been roughly flat to start the year and in the U.S. has remained favorable given the freight recession that has been present for the past 2 years. Freight market participants have struck a more optimistic tone recently. So we're monitoring that closely to see how potential improvement in freight level activity, along with rising tensions in the Middle East, driving oil higher may impact pricing and availability. Inventory levels at our distributors and end users remain tight, with many in our value chain in North America and Europe keeping tight lids on the amount of product on hand given the increased cost of capital and uneven environment.\n\nDestocking is no longer an issue but we continue to watch inventories at our customers across the globe. Now with that, let me turn it over to Bill for some financial detail.\n\nBill Drew: Thank you, Omar. In the deck, you'll see a summary of some of our key performance indicators. We'll also be filing our 10-Q which provides further information on Ranpak's operating results. Machine placement increased 0.9% year-over-year to approximately 140,800 machines globally. Cushioning systems declined 0.9%, while void-fill installed systems increased 1.3% and wrapping systems increased 1.8% year-over-year. Growth in the machine field population had been lower this year due to a combination of lower activity levels generally, particularly related to industrial and manufacturing sectors in Europe as well as our efforts to optimize our fleet. To maximize capital efficiency, we are focused on getting underutilized converters back and redeploying them to more productive areas.\n\nOverall, net revenue for the company in the first quarter was up 4.4% year-over-year on a constant currency basis, driven by increased volumes and contribution from automation, offset by slightly lower price. In North America, net revenue increased 2.6% year-over-year, with void-fill and automation up versus the prior year, offset by decreases in cushioning and wrapping. Volumes were lower versus prior year driven by a softer March but we expect those to pick up in the region as the year progresses driven by our strategic account activity. In Europe and APAC, net revenue on a constant currency basis was up 5.4% year-over-year, driven by void-fill, wrapping and automation, offset by lower cushioning revenue as the industrial sector in Europe remains pressured.\n\nWe are pleased to see the general continued recovery in this reporting unit as volumes increased 10% year-over-year and businesses begin to recover. We believe a part of the recovery we are seeing is due to the increased confidence stemming from the continued favorable natural gas pricing in Europe with Dutch Nat gas hovering around \u20ac30 per megawatt. There has been some volatility recently due to rising geopolitical tensions but we believe the amount of expected LNG capacity coming online and becoming available to Europe beginning in 2025 should help to keep a lid on pricing. Our gross profit increased 16.7% on a constant currency basis, implying a margin of 38% compared to 34% in the prior year. This is in line with our expectations as we expected gross margin to be roughly in line with Q4 throughout the year.\n\nAs Omar mentioned, we are monitoring the commodity environment closely and are extremely focused on maintaining the gross margin profile we sought to regain after 2022. Adjusted EBITDA increased 33.8% year-over-year to $20.2 million, implying a 22.8% margin driven by a higher gross profit flow-through and controlled G&A spend. We are pleased with the continued overall improvement in the financial profile and are optimistic as more volumes flow through the complex and automation grows, we will continue to work our way back towards an attractive high-margin and cash-generative profile. Capital expenditures for the quarter were $9.8 million, driven by converter placement and investments related to our Malaysia production facility. We are keeping tight controls on capital expenditures this year as we are moving beyond our infrastructure investment cycle that brought us a world-class technology platform and fully invested and funded physical infrastructure assets across the globe.\n\nMoving briefly to the balance sheet and liquidity. We completed Q1 with a strong liquidity position, including a cash balance of $55 million to end the quarter and no drawings on our revolving credit facility. We continue to make steady progress on our goal of deleveraging and reached 4.4 turns at the end of the quarter, down from 4.6x at 2023 year-end and 5.7x as of Q2 2023. We expect to build cash in the back half of the year as we enter the traditionally stronger holiday season and volumes pick up. The Malaysia production facility go live this summer marks the end of our multiyear infrastructure investment initiative and enables us to focus on getting a return on our investments as we scale our PPS and automation businesses. Our capital expenditure plans in 2024 are much more modest compared to recent prior years at less than $35 million which we expect will enable us to generate cash in 2024 and help us deleverage further.\n\nFollowing quarter end, in April we settled the litigation matter and sold 2 patents which resulted in total cash proceeds of \u20ac20 million, bolstering our cash position and implying a pro forma leverage ratio of 4.1x on a constant currency basis, including the additional cash proceeds. Based on our adjusted EBITDA guide and expected cash generation, we expect leverage to be below 4 turns on a constant currency basis by year-end, with an ultimate goal to getting to 3 turns or below. We believe our recent commercial and financial progress along with a focus on deleveraging and cash generation positions us well to address our term loan maturities well before their maturities in June of 2026. Ranpak has a long history in the credit markets from years of private equity ownership and I think would be well received by credit investors.\n\nFor those of you who have spent time with us over the past few years, you know our goal is to have the cap structure not be a topic of conversation. This means a simple structure and a conservative leverage profile that addresses needs well in advance. With that, I'll turn it back to Omar before we move on to questions.\n\nOmar Asali: Thank you, Bill. In closing, I'm pleased with the continued progress and third quarter in a row of volume growth. While the macro remains unclear, I believe our company-specific drivers such as our strategic account activity and momentum in automation will enable us to continue to drive the top line and improve profitability. Driving volumes in PPS, scaling automation and generating cash are the top priorities at Ranpak in 2024 and going into 2025. Automation continues to get the traction that we are seeking with large accounts as our systems are in facilities this year as the first step to larger follow-through opportunities. We continue to anticipate revenue growth of more than 50% in automation this year and I continue to strongly believe the investments we have made in this area will be a critical growth driver and differentiator for Ranpak in the upcoming years.\n\nOur long-term objective remains to have a business that is steadily growing revenue in the high single to low double-digit area, the gross margins in the high 30% to 40% area and adjusted EBITDA margins in the high 20s to low 30s area, with substantial cash being generated along the way. We have a strong platform in place supported by our state-of-the-art digital infrastructure and facilities that can support our growth ambitions. With these multiyear projects behind us, the focus can be solely on execution of our strategic initiatives and gaining efficiencies. I'm energized by what I see happening within Ranpak and across the world. The team is invigorated by the narrower scope of objectives and what we all read about seemingly every day regarding the tailwinds related to the shift from plastic to paper and warehouse automation needs.\n\nThis year's Earth Day theme is Planet versus Plastics and has a goal of raising awareness to drive a 60% plastic reduction by 2040. There has been a plethora of great yet alarming content created this year that aims to promote widespread public awareness of the damage done by plastic to human, animal and all biodiversities' health. Earthday.org is also trying to achieve a phase-out of all single-use plastics by 2030 and achieving that commitment at the United Nations treaty on plastic pollution in 2024. At Ranpak, we are extremely proud to be at the forefront of this movement and we are doing our part to deliver a better world. With that, let's open the call up for some questions.

In addition, other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially are discussed in the Company's filings with the SEC. Investors and security holders are urged to read these documents free of charge on the SEC's website at http://www.sec.gov. The Company undertakes no obligation to publicly update or revise its forward-looking statements as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.\n\nUse of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\n\nThis press release includes the non-GAAP financial measures of Adjusted EBITDA, non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP gross margin, non-GAAP operating income (loss), and non-GAAP net income (loss), which differ from financial measures calculated in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (\"GAAP\").\n\nAdjusted EBITDA in this release represents net income or loss, plus interest expense, net, or less interest income, net, less income tax benefit or plus income tax expense, plus depreciation and amortization, plus stock-based compensation expense, plus or minus the change in fair value of earn-out and plus executive transition costs. Non-GAAP gross profit in this release represents gross profit plus non-cash intangible amortization expense. Non-GAAP gross margin in this release represents non-GAAP gross profit divided by revenue. Non-GAAP operating income (loss) in this release represents operating income (loss) adjusted for non-cash intangible amortization expense, change in fair value of earn-out and executive transition expenses. Non-GAAP net income (loss) represents net income (loss) adjusted for non-cash intangible amortization expense, change in fair value of earn-out and executive transition expenses, and adjusted for the income tax effect on reconciling items. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable GAAP measures are included in this press release.\n\nThese non-GAAP financial measures are presented because the Company believes they are useful indicators of its operating performance. Management uses these measures principally as measures of the Company's operating performance and for planning purposes, including the preparation of the Company's annual operating plan and financial projections. The Company believes these measures are useful to investors as supplemental information and because they are frequently used by analysts, investors and other interested parties to evaluate companies in its industry. The Company also believes these non-GAAP financial measures are useful to its management and investors as a measure of comparative operating performance from period to period. In addition, Adjusted EBITDA is used as a performance metric in the Company's compensation program.\n\nThe non-GAAP financial measures presented in this release should not be considered as an alternative to, or superior to, their respective GAAP financial measures, as measures of financial performance or cash flows from operations as a measure of liquidity, or any other performance measure derived in accordance with GAAP, and they should not be construed to imply that the Company's future results will be unaffected by unusual or non-recurring items. In addition, Adjusted EBITDA is not intended to be a measure of free cash flow for management's discretionary use, as it does not reflect certain cash requirements such as tax payments, debt service requirements, capital expenditures and certain other cash costs that may recur in the future. Adjusted EBITDA contains certain other limitations, including the failure to reflect our cash expenditures, cash requirements for working capital needs and cash costs to replace assets being depreciated and amortized. In evaluating non-GAAP financial measures, you should be aware that in the future the Company may incur expenses that are the same as or similar to some of the adjustments in this presentation. The Company's presentation of non-GAAP financial measures should not be construed to imply that its future results will be unaffected by any such adjustments. Management compensates for these limitations by primarily relying on the Company's GAAP results in addition to using non-GAAP financial measures on a supplemental basis. The Company's definition of these non-GAAP financial measures is not necessarily comparable to other similarly titled captions of other companies due to different methods of calculation.\n\nThe following table summarizes revenue by product line for the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023:\n\nThe following table contains a reconciliation of GAAP gross profit and margin to non-GAAP gross profit and margin:\n\nThe following table contains a reconciliation of GAAP operating loss to non-GAAP operating loss:\n\nThe following table contains a reconciliation of GAAP net loss to non-GAAP net loss:\n\nThe following table contains a reconciliation of net loss to Adjusted EBITDA for the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023, as well as the dollar and percentage change between the comparable periods:", "source": {"uri": "wallstreet-online.de", "dataType": "news", "title": "wallstreet:online"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymphedema", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lymphedema"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gross_margin", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gross margin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gross_income", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Gross income"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cash_and_cash_equivalents", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Cash and cash equivalents"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Income_tax", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Income tax"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earnings_before_interest,_taxes,_depreciation,_and_amortization", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amortization_(accounting)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Amortization (accounting)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operating_expense", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Operating expense"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Net_income", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Net income"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liquidity", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Liquidity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_venous_insufficiency", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chronic venous insufficiency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence-based_medicine", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Evidence-based medicine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trade_name", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Trade name"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generally_Accepted_Accounting_Principles_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fair_value", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fair value"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earnings_before_interest_and_taxes", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Earnings before interest and taxes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Respiratory_disease", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Respiratory disease"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_government", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Local government"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Funds", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Funds", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/Cash_Flow", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/Cash Flow", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Guides", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Guides", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://assets.wallstreet-online.de/_media/6/source1280/size_645/globenewswire-1280.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9542931", "eventUri": "eng-9542931", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.4274509803921569, "wgt": 114, "relevance": 1}

Bryan?\n\nBryan King: Thanks, Steven, and thank you all for joining us to review first quarter 2024. I'll be starting on Slide 4 to review overall financial results. Our 2024 first quarter sales totaled $416 million, up 19.5% on strategic inorganic growth compared to the first quarter a year ago. As we signaled on our Q4 2023 call, DSG was up against double-digit comps in the first quarter of 2023 of nearly 14% and faced continued softness in certain end markets, which we will highlight later in the call. Despite those continued pockets of softness, we maintained a positive organic trajectory on a 2-year organic basis of 4.7%, which we acknowledge is below our expectation for organic growth that we require from our investment initiatives into the business when we use a longer time horizon lens.\n\nConsolidated EBITDA margins enjoyed a sequential improvement from 8.4% in the fourth quarter of 2023 to an adjusted EBITDA margin of 8.7% in the first quarter of 2024, but we are below where we expect them to be, partially because of the pockets of end market softness, but also significantly influenced by the internal initiatives that we are executing, where there are near-term costs, but where real expense optimization and profitability and efficiency is getting unlocked. We continue to enjoy strong visibility into how those initiatives are reworking significant elements of our cost structure while visibly improving our value-added offering for our customers and customer-facing colleagues and refining the profitability discipline on that revenue across each of our three DSG verticals.\n\nToday, I will reemphasize DSG's overarching goals and longer-term performance milestone objectives, reinforcing our confidence in the huge opportunity in front of us and the material progress we're making, even in the face of some marketplace softness and the accountability and engagement our collective team embraces. During our 2023 Investor Day last September, we shared that DSG's long-term value creation plans and programs were based on specific commercial growth initiatives and process and structural optimization work streams. These initiatives were and continue to be a bridge for us to grow into structurally higher margins while enjoying stronger organic growth and accelerating returns on invested capital over the next several years. As stated, our 5-year goal is to increase total sales to over $3.3 billion, which our plan indicates will be driven about equally from organic and inorganic growth initiatives.\n\nAnd we expect that level of revenue will generate adjusted EBITDA in excess of $450 million and will significantly drive the returns on invested capital profile and earnings per share and free cash flow per share profile of this highly value-added specialty distribution business. All three of our verticals have a clear path with the assets we own today to deliver EBITDA margins consistent with our corporate objective. Although we acknowledge that each of the three verticals currently enjoy a very different fully optimized structural EBITDA margin opportunity, we believe that the two acquisitions we have closed this year to consolidate with Lawson improves EBITDA margins and our return on invested capital. As we shared our detailed initiatives with investors last fall, I think it is important to hold ourselves accountable with our shareholder partners on our progression, acknowledging the pockets of end-market headwinds we have faced, while offering discrete data points on the numerous initiatives that are confirming the foundation today for the exciting progression we expect will continue to unfold as we move DSG towards our defined future state.\n\nIn January, we acquired Emergent Safety Supply, or ESS, under the Lawson Products banner. ESS is an example consistent with our inorganic investment objective of adding a commercial growth initiative, in this case, bolstering our safety offering to our MRO and OEM customers and expanding our existing VMI capabilities inside their facilities to offer a logical product category expansion requested by our customers and sales force. We believe it is one that is ubiquitous across our customer base, allowing for an increase in wallet share of existing customers, and more earning opportunity and productivity for our sales force, allowing us to add some upgrades and talent depth in key areas of growth, while augmenting and driving more opportunities for cross-selling, not only across our MRO offering, but for our OEM relationships, where we recognized it would enhance our proposed MRO solution when introducing our MRO capabilities in categories to our OEM customer relationships.\n\nSafety is a key category where our leadership team strongly believes that investing in an improved offering was an important organic growth accelerating opportunity through our existing relationships and service delivery models. We also announced S&S Automotive acquisition yesterday, which I will discuss in a moment. These two highly deliberate inorganic growth acquisitions highlight how we have identified opportunities within our DSG and specialty distribution relationships to engage businesses with product and service capabilities and deep customer relationships and marketplace presence. When combined with our existing network of offerings, this creates an enhanced DSG specialty offering, improving and deepening our value proposition to our customers and allowing for improved sales optimization and cross-sell expansions focusing on our committed lens to driving higher structural returns across DSG, the vertical the acquisition is being acquired into and higher structural returns on the acquisition itself.\n\nReflecting on our capital allocation around acquisitions over the last 24 months, we are excited about how they significantly enhance each of our verticals' ability to accomplish our profitability objectives and customer engagement vision, as well as drawing together the three verticals into a solutions focused DSG value proposition. Looking across each of our specialty distribution verticals, we continue to progress dialogues with targeted acquisitions that add product or value added capabilities, driving more scale to transform certain categories or lines of business to accelerate our efforts towards improved marketplace leadership and to generate meaningfully higher levels of free cash flow and returns on invested capital. ESS and S&S Automotive are great examples of strategic acquisitions that benefits our customers, sales teams and shareholders.\n\nThe downstream impact of both acquisitions creates more customer engagement, more expertise in targeted product categories and more solutions and services catered to our combined customers throughout expanded cross-selling opportunities and better sales density. The outcome is positive with higher productivity and compensation opportunity across each sales force, while driving structurally higher EBITDA margins and returns on our invested capital. These downstream effects can be large and wide, and we believe they work toward creating durable and repeatable results and accelerate the organic growth rate of DSG. Turning to Slide 5, let's walk through key initiatives and end-market trends in each of our business verticals. Our MRO focused business, Lawson Products, launched an important sales force transformation in 2023 with a foundation built on a structure of approximately 900 high producing and highly motivated field sales reps.\n\nWe also expanded our inside sales team last fall to approximately 40 individuals from only a few and added 14 technical product specialists. We are in the early innings of this sales optimization program, which includes fine tuning our investments in working capital and technology tools to help our sales force's effectiveness and productivity, as well as deliberate lens around designing and optimizing new sales territories as we refocus our attention around driving opportunity for existing field sales reps and recruiting additional reps into a role with enhanced tools and opportunity. We are very pleased with early results as our productivity measured as sales reps per day increased 8% in quarter one over a year ago on top of 18% and 15% improvements in the last two quarters of 2023.\n\nWe continue to analyze and leverage data to optimize our overall sales force network, including going live with our CRM tool in the first quarter as well as an enhanced order entry tablet for our field sales reps to drive ease and productivity around placing customer orders and offering more insights to our salesperson about additional revenue opportunities to grow that customer. This full implementation of Lawson CRM connects our entire sales force into the order management system, greatly improving our visibility into the sales organization and accelerating the ROI of our sales force transformation, addressing our stated goal to improve both the initial and structural earnings available to our sales force and enhance our service levels with our engaged customers, while additionally driving a productivity lift that should improve our selling expense across our total revenue base and elevate our EBITDA margin structurally higher.\n\nAs I mentioned, we are in the early stages of our progression with defined milestones that should unfold this year and the next two, and we will continue to hold ourselves accountable, reporting consistently on this key initiative. In addition, Lawson continues to concentrate on product expansion and resources that customers truly value as part of our MRO service delivery intensive VMI offering. We believe this is critical as we refine our product mix and increase our customer density, expertise, value-added tools and capabilities to engage with new and existing customers. Our process and structure optimization efforts are improving how we go to market at Lawson and effectively utilize people, processes and products. Lawson had a good first quarter, especially considering we were up against organic comp growth of over 19% reported in prior year quarter.\n\nThe 2-year stack organic growth in the first quarter for Lawson Products was nearly 12%, plus we added a few million dollars of acquired sales from ESS for most of the first quarter. The biggest headwind to sustaining organic revenue growth this quarter was overwhelmingly government, where we have seen a delay in purchase orders, although we remain confident the dollars are there to be spent later this year. Yesterday, we announced another acquisition under the Lawson banner, S&S Automotive Group. S&S and our existing Kent Automotive business, which has enjoyed sustained leadership in our organic growth in the last few years, operate in large and growing markets in North America, such as auto collision repair and dealership aftermarket businesses.\n\nAccording to the National Automobile Dealers Association, there are 16,835 light vehicle dealerships in the United States. Those dealers wrote 264 million repair orders in 2023, with total part sales of $142 billion. Additionally, only 34% of dealers have auto body shop capabilities. By adding S&S to the Kent offering, we can improve our customer value proposition with more SKUs and services tailored to this large market. Kent focuses primarily on collision repair centers in the U.S. and Canada, where S&S focuses more on auto dealerships in the Midwest, where they have strong density and market share. These business go-to-market models are similar, with both organizations offering value added high-touch customer engagement. They each have complementary product leadership that allows each company to credibly expand their product offering with their existing customers, significantly enhancing the organic growth opportunity.\n\nWe believe increasing our market density, especially in the Midwest geographies, and leveraging facilities and exceptional localized human capital will immediately increase our sales force productivity and improve our margin for our total automotive division. We are confident that combining Kent with S&S will allow us to drive our EBITDA margins for this business above our target margins for DSG and to drive our Kent and S&S returns on invested capital to specialty distribution market leadership levels. Our deliberate structural lift in the return profile and market leadership presence with this acquisition of our automotive repair line of business inside of Lawson is an exceptional example of what we have and expect to continue to accomplish with targeted strategic acquisitions at DSG.\n\nAs expected, the first quarter returned to double-digit EBITDA margins for Gexpro Services. Although the core business was down slightly compared to the prior year on tough comps, sales grew sequentially by 4.2% compared to the fourth quarter on comparable days. We also experienced strong double-digit sequential and quarter-over-quarter improvements in the sales in the aerospace and defense vertical. Also in the A&D end markets, we are excited about the lift in the number of new projects and services, including new kitting awards and VMI plant production services. We are winning and implementing new program awards faster-than-expected, which builds our backlog and positions us well for the remainder of 2024 and onto the future. It also offers us confidence about the enhanced value Gexpro Services brings to its customers as part of DSG and with the value added capabilities we invested in with our last couple of years of tuck-in acquisitions.\n\nAnd no one is more excited about the Hisco acquisition and its expanded capabilities, product lines and strong geographic presence in Mexico than the Gexpro Services team, except perhaps Cesar and the Lawson team. Our technology end markets, which were such a drag during 2023 to profitability in the Gexpro Services division especially in the last half of last year, in the first quarter of 2024, continued to be down compared to a year ago, dragging on EBITDA and EBITDA margin for the division, partly due to the tougher comps in the first part of 2023. However, we are encouraged to see that first quarter sales to our technology customers improve sequentially compared to the third and fourth quarters of 2023, citing an increase in new orders and hopefully, messaging, we are past the trough of the semiconductor cycle.\n\nRegarding the semiconductor industry as it was an important element of the profitability that we missed out on for most of last year and some of this first quarter, we hear that most companies are signaling trough level sales in the first quarter with auto chip sales reporting better-than-expected results and core industrial sales improving. It's also worth noting that our renewables business has slowly ramped upward with recent sequential improvements between the fourth quarter of '23 and the first quarter of '24, and our customers are reflecting confidence in the progression. Our overall confidence in the OEM business is supported by an increase in gross margins for year-over-year results and sequential margin improvements. On a sales comparison basis, we are past our toughest quarter comparisons of the year and are excited that our project services backlog is growing.\n\nWe are also excited to see a ramp in our new VMI program wins, market share growth and wallet share expansion with many long-standing customers. On a sequential basis, all of our end markets are either stabilized or growing, which gives us more confidence year-over-year, and we expect sequential improvement as 2024 develops. Also starting last year, our project-based businesses from the Frontier, Resolux and SIS 2022 acquisitions started positioning us as strategic suppliers instead of competitors with those three now business units of Gexpro Services, which with our expanded capabilities and touch points brought by coming together, especially in a market like renewables, that is seeing activity from customers precedent to a real revenue recovery from a tough year last year is allowing us to expand our market share.\n\nThose complementary tuck-in acquisitions enhance the expanded capabilities we now enjoy and will continue to benefit us in 2024 and on. As a refresher, adding those key channel partners offers us a more comprehensive and differentiated solution to a broader customer base, which supports our stated objective around Gexpro Services margin expansion plan by doing more of the value added work around the source product versus leaning more on being the leading OEM partner for specking, sourcing and managing Class C parts already in the form of a finished good product. The Gexpro Services business unit also benefits from an expanded investment in e-commerce capabilities, adding several million dollars of incremental revenue from e-commerce orders from established aerospace and defense accounts.\n\nAs we mentioned last year, Gexpro Services started the year with a healthy book-to-bill pipeline, growing it as it progressed into 2024. Turning to TestEquity Group. The electronic and specialty production supplies categories remained soft in the first quarter and were impacted by difficult sales comparisons from this time last year, weighing on the OEM as well as the MRO parts of the TestEquity Group. Weakness in sales into wireless communications and semiconductor production also weighed on the OEM and MRO parts of the group. The biggest drag on revenue and profitability, though, for the TestEquity Group continues to be the test and measurement in markets, which became more challenged in late September by what appeared to be an anxiousness around continued spending on capital equipment as the extended interest rate tightening cycle started weighing on business confidence and on capital spending on R&D towards the end of last year.\n\nThe revenue pressure and marketplace impacts were exacerbated by the product surplus in the channel by some of our suppliers and competitors. After a period of supply chain disruption coming out of COVID, the delayed delivery on customers' orders and perhaps over message to manufacturers and suppliers about where demand was playing out. A shift in customer behavior caught the channel with too much product on hand. As some try to push excess product, profitability for most was doubly impacted by weakness in sales and a natural discounting and temporary pricing activity, which only further stimulates unnatural demand and customer behavior and prolongs the disruptive period in the channel. We thought much of the dynamic was done by the end of the year, but then saw some of this behavior lingering in the first quarter.\n\nWe certainly believe there was a better backdrop around inventory, pricing and demand by the end of the quarter than existed throughout the fourth quarter. We believe trends will continue to normalize as the year progresses against weaker comparisons and less rebalancing of inventory in the channel, but it's taken longer than expected. While we don't have enough conviction to call an inflection around a reacceleration, there appears to be some stability returning in the customer demand, which with cleaner inventories, we expect will help profitability. Since the fourth quarter of 2023, we've identified more synergy opportunities bringing Hisco into the TestEquity Group as we now believe approximately $15 million of cost synergies will be realized during 2024 as we work through integrating Hisco and TestEquity, up from the $10 million that we indicated was our estimate at the end of 2023.\n\nReal progress is being made, although expenses associated with integration efforts are still flowing through, masking some of the underlying progress to structural margins. Hisco Mexico TestEquity Mexico, for instance, have been integrated and four facilities have been closed as well as some duplicative warehouse headcount has been relieved. In the U.S. and Canada, another five consolidations have been completed and two more are in process. This footprint rationalization saves over $1.2 million annually. One of the facilities allows us to exit a less optimized own building that we believe will also release $4.95 million of cash back to the balance sheet as we sell it. Additionally, given the softness of sales in the T&M business, we are actively identifying and accelerating further opportunities for cost rationalization.\n\nAdjusted EBITDA for the TestEquity Group improved, but is down versus a year ago. However, gross margins have stabilized despite sales headwinds over the last two quarters, and gross margin initiatives identified during our underwriting across our recent acquisitions are starting to yield a meaningful impact at levels ahead of where we underwrote at this point, masked some by the noisiness of the soft end markets and the continued inventory channel messiness and softness in the test and measurement marketplace. We realize it will take several quarters to see the real run rate benefits of our structural changes to improve overall margins. But as an example, by building the first layer of strategic pricing discipline in the pricing model at Hisco for their small customers, differentiating pricing from their largest customers, we saw gross margins increase by almost 150 basis points across all of Hisco just in the first quarter.\n\nTestEquity Group is a big ship to turn, and we are very pleased with the Hisco acquisition, both in how this complementary and strategic acquisition improves the mix shift towards a more reoccurring OEM and MRO offering as well as enhances the profitability and scale of this industrial technologies business unit with more consumables and lower price points that serve the electronics assembly and lab equipment customers. With Hisco's addition, the steep engagement this business unit now has with Gexpro Services and Lawson is remarkably different as they work together with real added benefits on working to expand their collective engagements with their longstanding customers and new ones that have requested us to bid on contracts with a lens towards a broader DSG set of capabilities.\n\nWith the Hisco addition, there is now a combined revenue growth initiative populated with a very capable team of sales leadership from each of the three verticals and some of the specialty business unit leaders. There's also significant enthusiasm at Lawson an Gexpro Services leadership teams around the added footprint that Hisco brings with significant scale throughout North America, most specifically offering a platform for our customers requesting Gexpro Services in Lawson to expand their engagements into Mexico. Distribution Solutions Group serves a broad diverse set of end markets with over 180,000 customers. We deliver and ship from strategically located distribution and service centers to customers throughout North America and Europe, Asia, South America and the Middle East.\n\nOur decentralized operations that maintain brand identity and integrity, coupled with an integrated growth platform, offer DSG's customers access to unique, differentiated, high touch products and solutions, sourcing advantage and expertise through businesses that leverage best practices to deliver world-class service to our customers every day. With that, I'd like to turn the call to Ron to walk through the financials.\n\nRon Knutson: Thank you, Bryan, and good morning, everyone. Turning to Slide 5, I will first summarize our business, which includes our acquisitions for the trailing 12 months. Lawson represents 31% of total DSG revenue, Gexpro Services 23%, and the TestEquity Group represents 46% of revenues. Our run rate adjusted revenue is now approximately $1.73 billion. And as Bryan mentioned, we serve over 180,000 customers across more than 500,000 SKUs. Now turning to Slide 6, I will summarize the reported results for the first quarter, and then I will break out each reporting segment. Consolidated revenue for the quarter was $416.1 million. This represents an increase of $67.8 million or 19.5%, primarily driven by the 2023 and 2024 acquisitions.\n\nExcluding the acquisitions, organic sales declined by 8.6% on a comparable day basis, however, grew 4.7% on a 2-year stacked basis. The organic decline versus a year ago was driven primarily within the Test & Measurement business and very strong comps from a year ago in all verticals. On a sequential basis versus the fourth quarter of 2023, organic sales grew by 2.1% as we saw several end markets such as technology, strengthen sequentially and also realize continued strong sales in aerospace and defense. Q1 of 2024 reflected growth in net margin dollars of $2.2 million versus the fourth quarter of 2023. As indicated on the Q4 2023 earnings call, we expected margin pressure in the first half of 2024. While the quarter ended with softer sales, our margin profile came in line with our near-term expectations.\n\nFor the quarter, we generated adjusted EBITDA of $36.1 million or 8.7% of sales, a sequential improvement over 8.4% in Q4, and I'll expand further at the segment level here in a minute. We reported operating income of $2.8 million for the quarter, net of $10.7 million of acquisition-related intangible amortization and $16.2 million of aggregate costs from stock-based compensation, acquisition, severance and retention related expenses, merger and acquisition costs and other nonrecurring items. Adjusted operating income was $29.8 million as compared to $32.8 million a year ago quarter and $28 million in the fourth quarter of 2023. We reported GAAP diluted loss per share of $0.11 for the quarter, inclusive of higher depreciation and amortization and a valuation allowance on certain deferred tax assets, compared to earnings per share of $0.14 in the year ago.\n\nAdjusted diluted EPS was $0.25 for the quarter on 4.2 million more shares outstanding than a year ago. Turning to Slide 7, let me now comment briefly on each of the segments. Starting with Lawson Products. Sales were $118.2 million, down 4.2% on comparable days, primarily from very strong comps a year ago of nearly 20%. As compared to the fourth quarter, sales increased 7.6% or 4.2% on a same-day basis. This growth was driven by the acquisition of Emergent Safety Supply in January, which contributed approximately $2.3 million in sales in the first quarter, plus organic daily growth of 2.2%. Growth continues both over a year ago and sequentially within our strategic and Kent Automotive customers, offset by softening sales to the Lawson core customers.\n\nAs Bryan highlighted, Lawson is coming off of a really strong 2023, all while continuing to invest in its business to strategic position itself for long-term success. We are still in the early innings of implementing initiatives to help our sales team become more productive while fine-tuning our sales investments to grow sales. We are very pleased with the initial improvement in our sales rep productivity, resulting in an 8% lift this quarter on top of 18% and 15% realized in the last two quarters of 2023. We have open field sales rep positions that we are actively recruiting for in the right territories that should help drive sequential sales growth in future quarters. For the quarter, Lawson realized adjusted EBITDA of $13.4 million or 11.4% of sales.\n\nWhile this is down versus a year ago quarter on lower sales in our 2023 investments, sequentially, adjusted EBITDA grew by $1 million with a slight margin expansion. Turning to Gexpro Services on Slide 8. Total sales for the quarter decreased 2.3% to $98.7 million, however, increased 4.2% on comparable days from the fourth quarter of 2023. As discussed in the past, comps against the prior year are tough given the flattening of sales in the technology end market in 2023. That vertical was down nearly 26% from a year ago quarter. However, we are seeing signs of improvement as Q1 2024 sales within that end market exceeded sales in both Q3 and Q4 2023 on a standalone basis. 2023 saw global semiconductor spending decline roughly 10% as consumer electronics and automobile production drove softness in supply chains adjusted, which certainly is impacting our year-over-year comparisons.\n\nTwo acquired businesses, which sell into the renewables space also put pressure on year-over-year comps. Excluding the technology and renewables end markets, sales grew 3% over a year ago quarter and 4.2% over Q4, giving us additional confidence for the remainder of 2024. Gexpro Services has continued to see strong demand in the aerospace and defense vertical being up 24% over a year ago and 15% over Q4. We continue to invest in the business, attracting new customers and new opportunities within existing customers. However, we are cautious about certain weaker markets and those more sensitive to current macroeconomic issues. As expected, through some modest recovery in sales, along with a focus on gross margin improvements and cost controls, we returned to double-digit margins for this quarter.\n\nGexpro Services EBITDA was $10.8 million or 11% of sales despite margin pressure of approximately $1.7 million from the technology vertical and the acquired businesses supporting renewables. Lastly, I will turn to TestEquity Group on Slide 9. Q1 sales grew 74.3% to $187.1 million, an increase of $79.8 million driven by the 2023 acquisition of Hisco. Excluding Hisco, TestEquity sales were down 14.6% in Q1 and 6.5% on a comparable day basis versus Q4, primarily driven by continued weakness in the Test & Measurement business. As we've discussed on previous calls, the decline in this piece of our business is primarily related to delays in customers' capital project spending associated with continued higher interest rates and an imbalance of demand against the improved supply chain disruptions from a year ago.\n\nExcluding the Test & Measurement market, sales grew nearly 1% over Q4 on three additional selling days. TestEquity's adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was $11.6 million or 6.2% of sales. With the expected pressure on sales, the business has stabilized from a margin perspective. We are actively taking actions to protect our margins within the TestEquity Group and also realizing savings from the integration of Hisco. As we think about the remainder of 2024 for TestEquity, we will continue to focus on the integration of Hisco in TestEquity. We remain committed to sequentially improving our margin profile as 2024 develops through higher sales, synergies to be realized on the combined company and proactively rebalancing our cost structure. Between the merger savings and other cost normalization, we are focused on delivering approximately $15 million of cost savings in 2024.\n\nWe anticipate a stronger second half of 2024 for the TestEquity Group as we continue to integrate Hisco and some additional pickup of capital project type spending. Moving on to Slide 10. We ended the quarter with approximately $284 million of liquidity, including $85.6 million of cash and $198.3 million under our existing credit facility. A portion of that availability has now been utilized to fund the purchase of S&S Automotive. We continued to focus on strengthening our balance sheet and ended the first quarter at a leverage rate of 3.0x. The acquisition of S&S Automotive subsequent to the quarter does not significantly change our leverage profile given the strong double-digit acquired EBITDA of that business. Although we continue to support a robust working capital investment, we are carefully managing inventories, accounts receivables and accounts payable.\n\nOur cash conversion ratio defined as adjusted EBITDA, less the change in working capital and less CapEx divided by adjusted EBITDA was nearly 110% on a trailing 12-month basis and approximately 75% for the first quarter. Net capital expenditures, including rental equipment, were $2.9 million for the first quarter. We expect full year CapEx to be in the range of $16 million to $20 million or approximately 1% of revenue in 2024. Before I turn it back to Bryan, I'd like to make some comments on how we see the remainder of 2024 developing. As we've discussed over the past two quarters, we were up against very tough organic sales comps with Q1 of 2023 having been up nearly 14%. Q2 2023 organic sales were up nearly 5%. Given some of the sales pressures that we continue to see, in particular in the Test & Measurement business, offset by some strengthening in other end markets, we expect Q2 organic sales to be flat to down low single digits as compared to a year ago, however, up sequentially from Q1 of this year.\n\nAs we make traction on many of our initiatives in 2024 and as comps against the prior year soften, we would expect organic sales growth to turn positive starting in the second half. To achieve our internal sales plans, we will need some normalization of various end markets and some recovery of customer capital related project spending. While we realized Q1 margin expansion over Q4, our focus continues to be on improving margin profiles within all of our segments on a sequential quarterly basis. I'll now turn the call back over to Bryan.\n\nBryan King: Thank you, Ron. The first quarter met our near-term targets, especially given the continued softness in the several end markets highlighted, and we are pleased to see positive trends in many verticals that have been under pressure for several quarters. Turning to Slide 11, DSG's capital allocation framework remains disciplined and flexible, encouraging healthy competition for capital across our businesses. At the core, we believe in the compounding effect of cash flow reinvestment in the business on a per share basis. With a focus on bridging to higher structural margins, we believe that inorganic growth provides strategic opportunities for bolt-on acquisitions that provide us scale, geographic density, new customer channels, cross-sell opportunities and product or service level category expansion, all with an objective to enjoy sustained and structurally higher returns on invested capital, more driven by organic growth than inorganic growth as the platform matures.\n\nFinally, the capital allocation equation will not be complete without focusing on prudent debt paydowns and opportunistic share repurchases. These allow us to rebalance the company's weighted average cost of capital and return capital to the shareholders, especially as the platform matures. Combining our asset light model and increasing working capital efficiencies improves our overall liquidity position, allowing us to reduce our net borrowings. Let me wrap up my comments on Slide 12. The first quarter showed sequential top line and bottom line progress against challenging prior year sales comparisons and some very real pockets of soft demand. Lawson had solid margins as we continue to dial in a number of the key initiatives and acquisitions for our longer term opportunity to take this unique VMI offering to structurally higher margins.\n\nGexpro Services returned to double-digit margins as expected and enjoyed seeing its collection of end market verticals firm up confidence in their OEM schedules for the back half of the year based on communication with us, building backlog, and excitedly, we saw new programs indicate that organic revenue growth based on market share wins is happening enhanced by our DSG platform capabilities and the acquisitions that we have added to the platform to improve our value propositions. And the TestEquity Group's margin stabilized despite continued end market challenges, while the heavy lifting integration is progressing as scheduled, while yielding more synergy cost wins and the commercial confidence in what Hisco brings to DSG continues to build across all the verticals.\n\nAll three leadership teams on these verticals have been challenged with the environment we are in and the number of value unlocking initiatives we are working with them on. I want to personally thank them and their colleagues for their consistent effort and value-creating accomplishments they are delivering for us, the shareholders and how accountable the collective team is holding each other too. We are very pleased with the hard work and progress coming out of our corporate development team on acquisitions that provide DSG with product and solution expansion and extensions in our business units and with their collaboration with the business unit leadership teams as they work to facilitate an acquisition all the way through its integration.\n\nOur M&A playbook is active, and we are excited about our current pipeline to continue to deliver largely directly sourced, extremely commercially enhancing high return invested capital, accretive acquisitions that fit our objective to build a best-in-class, high value, high touch specialty distribution business for our shareholder partners, our customers and importantly, our DSG colleagues. Additionally, as I highlighted, because of the continued evidence we see and customers acknowledge for expanded opportunities for cross-selling, spanning our premier specialty distribution company, with great enthusiasm, we've expanded and dedicated more resources to a cross business unit commercial initiative to grow cross-selling revenue and also to leverage value added capabilities to improve the success of each vertical in their own marketplaces.\n\nAs DSG's Chairman, CEO and largest affiliate shareholder, we fully align with our public investor partners to drive long-term value creation for our shareholders. Investor outreach continues to be our focus. We will attend the Barrington and KeyBanc conferences in May and the East Coast IDEAS Conference in New York in June. With that, operator, we'd like to open the call for questions.", "source": {"uri": "ca.finance.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo!

(NASDAQ:VIA) Q1 2024 Earnings Call Transcript", "body": "Via Renewables, Inc. isn't one of the 30 most popular stocks among hedge funds at the end of the third quarter (see the details here).\n\nStephen Rabalais: Good morning, and welcome to Via Renewables' First Quarter 2024 Earnings Call. This call is also being broadcast via webcast, which can be located in the Investor Relations section of our website at viarenewables.com. With us today from management is our CEO, Keith Maxwell; and our CFO, Mike Barajas. Please note that today's discussion may contain forward-looking statements, which are based on assumptions that we believe to be reasonable as of this date. Actual results may differ materially. We urge everyone to review the safe harbor statement in yesterday's earnings release as well as the risk factors in our SEC filings. We undertake no obligation to update these statements as a result of future events, except as required by law.\n\nIn addition, we will refer to both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. For information regarding our non-GAAP financial measures and reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP measures, please refer to yesterday's earnings release. With that, I'll turn the call over to Keith Maxwell, our CEO.\n\nKeith Maxwell: Thank you, Stephen. I want to welcome everyone to today's call. I'll begin by providing a summary of results for the first quarter. And then our CFO, Mike Barajas will provide more details on the financials. In the first quarter, we reported adjusted EBITDA of $15.1 million which is a $3.7 million decrease from the prior year of $18.8 million, due to lower unit margins compounded by mild weather, which resulted in lower gas volumes. On a positive note, we grew our customer book to 338,000 RCEs compared to 335,000 RCEs at the start of the year. We also increased the percentage of our customer-based POR markets, which compared to the first quarter of 2023, which lowers our credit risk and bad debt exposure. Looking forward to our second quarter, we're happy to announce that we entered into an agreement to acquire approximately 12,500 RCEs in our existing markets.\n\nThis acquisition will be accretive to our bottom line beginning in the second quarter of this year. This marks our first customer [indiscernible] acquisition since the end of 2022, and we will continue to be open to any potential future tuck-in acquisitions, and we are committed to growing our customer base in line with long-term growth strategies. That concludes my prepared remarks. And now I'll turn the call over to Mike for his financial review. Mike?\n\nMike Barajas: Thanks, Keith. Good morning. In the first quarter, we achieved $15.1 million in adjusted EBITDA compared to last year's first quarter of $18.8 million. Retail gross margin for the quarter was $35.7 million compared with $40.3 million last year. In our retail electricity segment, gross margin was $18.9 million compared to $20.5 million in the first quarter last year. The decrease due to lower unit margins, partially offset by higher volumes due to a higher RCE count. In our retail natural gas segment, gross margin was $16.2 million compared to $19.9 million in the first quarter last year. This was due to both lower unit margins and volumes year-over-year. G&A expenses were $17.3 million compared to $17.2 million in the first quarter last year, primarily due to increased sales and marketing expenses and legal fees.\n\nSee also", "source": {"uri": "ca.finance.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo!

Legal counsel requires us to advise that the discussion scheduled to take place today may contain forward-looking statements that involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties. Actual results may be materially different from any future results, performance or achievements contemplated in the forward-looking statements.

As a reminder, today's call is being recorded. Today's Thursday, May 2, 2024, and at this time, for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Global Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Mr. Jay Hennick. Please go ahead, sir.\n\nJay Hennick: Thank you, operator. Good morning, and thanks for joining us on our first quarter conference call. As the operator mentioned, I'm Jay Hennick, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of the company. And with me today is Chris McLernon, Chief Executive Officer of our Real Estate Services business; and Christian Mayer, our Chief Financial Officer. As always, this call is being webcast and is available in the Investor Relations section of our Web site, along with a presentation slide deck. During the quarter, revenue, EBITDA, outsourcing and advisory, investment management and leasing all demonstrated improvement over the prior year. Despite ongoing interest rate uncertainty and geopolitical tensions that are affecting everyone, it also affected our capital markets. Our strategic focus, however, being on expanding high-value, recurring service lines that continue to yield positive results for us, positioning us extremely well for the future. We remain committed to the Colliers way, emphasizing solid internal growth and strategic acquisitions that enhance our business and create value for our shareholders. In the most recent quarter, we successfully added $300 million in new equity to support our further expansion. Furthermore, our acquisition of Colliers Philadelphia has expanded our presence in the Mid-Atlantic region, solidifying our position as a key player in the United States. Over the years, Colliers has established a highly respected global brand and growth platform with broad diversification across revenue sources, service lines and geography. With more than 70% of our earnings generated from recurring revenue streams, we have a very robust business model with 3 distinct growth engines that can continue to allow us to capitalize on growth opportunities while maintaining resilience in the face of economic fluctuations. Most importantly, Colliers has a seasoned leadership team with a substantial equity stake in our company and an impressive 29-year record of delivering nearly 20% compound annual returns for shareholders. And now let me ask Chris McLernon to discuss some highlights from our service business and once he's completed, Christian will provide his usual financial report. Then, we'll open things up for questions. Chris?\n\nChris McLernon: Thank you, Jay, and good morning, everyone. Colliers first quarter 2024 results reflect the strength of our resilient and highly diversified professional services platform. Our Outsourcing & Advisory business delivered robust revenue growth with broad-based increases across all services, led by engineering and project management. We expect this momentum to continue through the remainder of the year, providing growth, balance and stability to our platform. This growth helped offset expected soft transaction volumes in capital markets, which, although down were above market activity levels. We remain cautiously optimistic about improving transaction velocity in the late second half of 2024, contingent on softening interest rates, the narrowing of the price gap between buyers and sellers and improved lending availability. Leasing globally achieved modest growth year-over-year with several markets increasing activity in the office sector as occupiers make longer-term lease commitments, coupled with the return to office continuing the trend upwards. Shortly after the quarter end, we completed the acquisition of our affiliate in Philadelphia. From its five offices, the company's 130 professionals provide leasing and sales brokerage and property management services. As a vibrant and influential market, our ownership now allows us to significantly increase our presence in the Mid-Atlantic and expand our capabilities in the eighth largest metropolitan area in the US. Among our many accolades in February, we were named to the IAOPs list of top 100 global professional services firms. A testament to our track record of success in delivering exceptional results for our clients wherever they do business. We have also been recognized as one of the best workplaces in Canada this year out of more than 900 companies competing for a spot. The steps we are taking to strategically invest in our people and business, fill gaps and take market share will continue to strengthen our platform and drive long-term shareholder value. Now I'll turn things over to Christian who will provide more details on our financials.\n\nChristian Mayer: Thank you, Chris, and good morning. As usual, I'll provide some additional commentary on our consolidated results, our financial outlook and our balance sheet. Note that all references to revenue growth made on this call are expressed in local currency, and that the non-GAAP measures discussed here today are as defined in the materials accompanying this call. For the seasonally slow first quarter, revenues were $1 billion, up 4% relative to Q1 2023. Internal growth was 2% with strength in our diversified recurring services outpacing a decline in capital markets activity. Our Outsourcing & Advisory service line generated strong 9% revenue growth, mostly from internal sources. Investment Management excluding pass-through period interest was essentially flat with the prior year. Leasing revenues were up 2% for the quarter, led by modest growth in office leasing. First quarter consolidated adjusted EBITDA was $109 million, up 4% relative to the prior year with margins holding flat at 10.8%. We continue to closely manage our cost to match the expected pace of revenues, especially in our Capital Markets business. We also remain focused on improving productivity and on selective strategic recruiting. In our Investment Management segment, AUM declined modestly during the quarter, mostly attributable to unrealized market value adjustments and our alternative and traditional real estate funds despite growing net operating income at the asset level. These adjustments totaled 1.5%, which outperformed the benchmark Odyssey Index. In addition, some funds disposed of long-held assets during the quarter, realizing gains and recycling the proceeds back to investors. This positions us well for future fundraising. Our first quarter fundraising totaled $450 million. We continue to see strong interest in our alternative, infrastructure and credit strategies and we anticipate an acceleration in fundraising momentum as we progress through the year. We are maintaining our financial outlook for 2024. While interest rate volatility and geopolitical tensions continue to weigh on transaction volumes, we expect a rebound in activity in the third and fourth quarters. Although there is a risk that this could be delayed to later in the year or to early 2025. In our recurring service lines, both outsourcing and advisory and investment management, we continue to expect mid- to high single-digit revenue growth for the balance of the year. Turning to our balance sheet. Our financial leverage ratio, defined as net debt to pro forma adjusted EBITDA was 2 times at March 31. We expect leverage to rise modestly in Q2 due to seasonal working capital usage then to decline to approximately 1.5 times by the end of the year, assuming no significant acquisitions. With the $300 million equity offering we completed during the first quarter we are well positioned with more than $1 billion in available liquidity to execute on acquisition opportunities as the year unfolds. This concludes my prepared remarks. I'd now like to open the call for questions. Operator, can you please open the line?\n\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] First question comes from Stephen MacLeod at BMO Capital Markets.\n\nStephen MacLeod: I just wanted to just dial in on the outlook for 2024. I just wanted to confirm or just kind of get your thoughts on the components specifically around -- I mean you mentioned Outsourcing & Advisory up mid-single digits to high single digit. Just thinking about capital markets and leasing. Are you still expecting things to be sort of flattish in the first half with some growth in the back half? And then on Investment Management, do you still kind of expect the same level of fund raising in 2024 in that. I think it was $5 billion to $8 billion range as you expected with Q4?\n\nChristian Mayer: Steve, let me start with that one. I think you've laid out some of the component pieces here. I think the growth will come from each of those components, about one third from our Outsourcing & Advisory business, which we have a high degree of visibility on, as Chris mentioned, with backlogs of work in process and to be completed, one third of the growth will come from investment management, and that's going to roll out through the year. We think it will be weighted more towards the back half of the year, but we have strong activity levels, and we expect hopefully, to secure new capital comments from investors as the year progresses. And finally, one third of the growth expected in capital markets. This is going to be weighed as I mentioned to the third and fourth quarters. So not expecting anything really in terms of growth in the second quarter in capital markets, but a modest rebound in the third and more likely the fourth quarters.\n\nJay Hennick: Steve, let me add something to what Christian is saying. From my perspective, the outlook is really quite straightforward. All of our businesses are doing extremely well with the exception of capital markets, which everybody knows and that's very interest rate driven. So your guess is as good as mine as to when that's going to change. But when it does, it has a material positive impact not only on Colliers, but any other like business in the industry. It really will have a significant impact. The balance of our businesses, as I said, are doing extremely well. Fundraising is a touch soft, getting stronger in investment management. So we think we're going to do nicely as the year progresses. But the forecast is really quite simple, at least from my perspective and I think we're all managing -- the key is to manage the business as closely as possible. And as you know, we've done this for many years, and we think we've got our eye on the price. But it really is going to come down to capital markets when it changes. When investor -- and Chris said this just a minute ago, and I'm going on a little bit too long here, but there's also decisioning at the -- on the part of sellers. When are they going to sell those assets and there's a lot of pressure on a lot of sellers right now from a financing standpoint to take action. So interest rates will impact it, of course, but there's also other factors that could accelerate capital markets a little bit quicker than just interest rates alone. I offer that only as a means of trying to get a sense of what the balance of the year looks like to us.\n\nChris McLernon: Just a couple of more comments from the field. There was a bright spot this quarter in Asia Pacific. In capital markets, we were up 19% year-over-year. And so we've got some good activity in Japan, Hong Kong, Taiwan, a little bit of Australia. So that's a bright spot. We are starting to see, over the last 18 months, there's obviously low transaction volumes and really below the $50 million. But as Jay was saying, the pressure is starting to build. And the market is starting to test some bigger ticket items, so 200 plus level. In Q1, Colliers brokered three deals, I can give you examples of more than 200, one in Oslo, Norway; one in Korea and one in Australia. So we're starting to see more activity, more pitches and mandates, but I think it will be incremental activity. And as Christian said, towards the back half of the year, but we'll start to accelerate it.\n\nStephen MacLeod: That's great color from all three of you. I just wanted to just shift gears a little bit and just talk a little bit about the acquisition pipeline. Just sort of what you're seeing out there. You have lots of strong liquidity right now, strong leverage. And so just wondering kind of what you're seeing there and where your interests lie currently.\n\nJay Hennick: We have a very interesting pipeline of acquisitions, some larger and several smaller virtually across the board. But having three growth engines gives us lots of places to grow and having a global platform with strong management teams that have been around a long time and have operated the Colliers way for a long time, gives us the confidence that we can execute wherever the opportunities are. So we're quite excited. Obviously, we've got to take one step at a time, but the pipeline is solid, I would say.\n\nOperator: The next question comes from Daryl Young at Stifel.\n\nDaryl Young: First question is just around the investment management business and maybe a little bit of color -- you can provide a little bit of color on some of the costs you're adding for fundraising, and you called it distribution capabilities in the Middle East, just put my interest there.\n\nChristian Mayer: Daryl, we've been building our fundraising capabilities and in particular, the Middle East, and that's an area that we have and Asia. But in the Middle East, our share of LPs is quite low. So the opportunity set for us in the Middle East is big. Asia is an area we've been active in for longer, and we have more LPs there, but still room for growth as well in terms of attracting new investors and new sources of capital for our fundraising. The other part that we're focusing effort on which is taking some -- adding some expense is building out our capabilities to launch new strategies and new funds. We've got a few things in the works that are going to launch this year, and we've had to staff up and incur some costs to make that come to reality.\n\nDaryl Young: And then it sounds like you're targeting sort of net new LPs, but what kind of receptivity have you seen from existing LPs re-upping on funds? And then also cross-sell of LPs between the various boutiques that you acquired across the last couple of years?\n\nJay Hennick: In terms of re-ups, we're seeing the same percentages as prior years or prior fund re-ups. What we are seeing is we're seeing adjustments in the allocation. So some of them, if they're tight or they're not balanced properly, will increase or reduce the amount of commitment to the next fund, but virtually 92% or 93% of re-ups has been sort of a consistent theme for us for many years and then introducing -- and that's one of the great things about this business. It's so recurring as long as your investors are happy with the results and the way in which their investments are being managed and then we're introducing new investors, especially during these times and especially to the types of assets that we focus on, which are alternative asset classes, which are very much in demand. And so I would say there's a softness in fundraising generally. It's changing but it's changing for the better. But in terms of re-ups, we're where we need to be. The other thing that we've invested in is the RIA channel through one of our platforms that has a very significant presence. We've doubled our investment around raising capital up through the RIA channel. And -- so we're quite excited about the asset management component of our business and think that all these investments, particularly in times like this, will pay dividends down the line. And it's not just going to be this year, it's going to be next year and beyond. So new products in the marketplace, more investment in distribution capabilities. All of those types of things are the things that you do to build a great platform, which we're doing. We're also investing in -- I should say -- I should have said this at the outset, topgrading our people. We've got some exceptional people, but there's opportunities to add different asset classes, which means you need to bring in different expertise around data centers and a variety of other things that we're working on that just make our platform that much better.\n\nOperator: The next question comes from Stephen Sheldon at William Blair.\n\nStephen Sheldon: I want to start with Chris. Curious what you're seeing in terms of industrial leasing activity. It sounds like the 2% overall leasing growth in the quarter was driven by pickup in office. So it would just be great to get some color on what you're seeing on the industrial side and whether things are weakening there? Just kind of how the trajectory is looking on the industrial side for leasing?\n\nChristian Mayer: So I think in the industrial leasing, there's been a natural cooling after the record-breaking run up after the COVID boom in e-commerce in '21 to '23. Occupiers today are generally concerned about economic conditions and the geopolitical concerns and they're also focused on looking at efficiencies and looking at their existing locations and what can automation do to their facilities. There's also been an increase in vacancy in a number of markets, and so there's more options for occupiers to look at. And so they're taking some more time to analyze what their footprint should look like going forward. So I think it's a natural pause in the cycle. The market is still a good market. But I guess the level of velocity of leasing transaction in industrial is not the same as it was in the record-breaking times just after COVID. The one outlier is that in Canada, we had considerable leasing growth in industrial up 41% year-over-year. So that was the one bright spot. Most of the places around the world, industrial leasing was down. In talking to our operators in the field, I think there's also a little bit of a delay from quarter-to-quarter, so some slippage. I've heard of some larger deals in Australia, Poland and the U.S., notably that could show up in Q2.\n\nStephen Sheldon: And maybe just thinking about the US, how are you thinking about your producer capacity and positioning for when capital markets activity picks up? I think you talked last quarter about record recruiting in the US during 2023. You now also have some more scale with the Philadelphia acquisition. So are you getting closer to the scale that you'd like in the US? And how important is it to continue how do you scale, I guess, through acquisitions, specifically in the US.\n\nChristian Mayer: So I think we continue to recruit top talent, and we've got lots of white space in the US. Our market share is still quite low compared to our major competitors. So this is a priority focus of management to continue to bolster our teams, and we'll do that through either acquisitions like our affiliate in Philadelphia or teams or individuals. So it is still very much a priority. In addition, we're looking at productivity, how do we get more production out of our existing talent and making sure that if there's any nonperformers that -- we're moving them out and then our high potentials, we're investing in those people to make sure that they can perform when the market comes back. So this is still a major initiative of ours to continue to push into capital markets in the US.\n\nStephen Sheldon: And then just one last one for Christian. As we think about our models, tax rates were a little elevated relative to at least what we had modeled for the quarter. So just curious if you have any framework for how we should think about the tax rate over the rest of the year and what you've assumed in the guidance.\n\nChristian Mayer: Yes, Stephen, there was a onetime item in Q1 for a couple of million dollars. So absent that, the rate would have been 30% in the quarter, and we expect the rate to be 30% on a full year basis as well.\n\nOperator: The next question comes from Himanshu Gupta at Scotiabank.\n\nHimanshu Gupta: So just on the 2024 guidance, just clarifying, do you have M&A built into in this guidance? I mean, I know you have done the equity offering now, which was previously not there at the time of original guidance.\n\nChristian Mayer: Himanshu, I think you're asking about acquisitions in the guidance? The answer is no. There's no acquisitions built into the guidance. And the guidance does include the impact of the recent equity offering.\n\nHimanshu Gupta: And then, I mean, given that the guidance is unchanged, has the outlook changed within the segments? I mean are you -- were you still expecting one third of the growth from IM and one third of the growth from capital markets business last quarter as well?\n\nChristian Mayer: Himanshu, I think the components of that outlook are the same, one third from outsourcing and advisory, one third from investment management and one third from the transactional business. That's consistent with what we thought back in February.\n\nHimanshu Gupta: And any incremental weakness baked into the capital markets business? I mean, it looks like the leasing looks to be performing better than expectation and maybe capital markets given the interest rate could be a bit softer. So within two segments, any change in direction?\n\nChristian Mayer: I mean not meaningfully, Himanshu. I mean this is -- I think we do the best we can, and we look at our various components. Every time we update our and look at our forecast, but there's nothing meaningful to call out at this time.\n\nHimanshu Gupta: Then just looking at the valuation on IM, investment management, the valuation adjustment in Q1, was it mostly related to office? I mean can you elaborate a bit there?\n\nChristian Mayer: Himanshu, it was primarily related to our alternative portfolio, and that is not related to the actual portfolio performance itself. I mean the income coming off these assets is the same or better than it was previously. What's happened is the cap rates have gapped out and have driven reduction in the sort of the values that the outside appraisers attach to these assets. As it relates to our office portfolio, it's quite small. It's one third or one fourth of our traditional portfolio, which is a small piece overall. And we've taken cumulatively over the last one and half years, 27%, I believe, mark-to-market adjustment on that office portfolio already. So that is not a driver in the quarter, but certainly, it's been something that's been weighing on AUM over the past one and half years.\n\nHimanshu Gupta: Maybe just a last question on M&A outlook or opportunities. So how close are you on the capital deployment, and anything you want to elaborate on that?\n\nChristian Mayer: So Jay the question is how close are we on capital deployment in terms of acquisitions or other opportunities?\n\nJay Hennick: I'm not -- that's not something that we would normally talk about, number one. Number two, we're actively involved in many transactions right now and they close when they close. And I can't really give you any further color than that. They're all opportunistic and they happen when they happen, but we have a track record of completing multiple transactions over many years.\n\nOperator: The next question comes from Jimmy Shan at RBC.\n\nJimmy Shan: Maybe just a follow-up on the M&A. I know not so much you could share, but can you give us a sense of the deal sizes that you may be looking at across? You mentioned looking at small and big deals. And also, I think we talked about pricing last quarter. Has that -- has there been any change in that given the change in continuously changing rate environment? Have you seen any change in sort of pricing expectations?\n\nJay Hennick: As I mentioned earlier, there are large transactions and there are smaller transactions. I would say that the large transaction pricing is high and it's just the nature of the beast. And what's also happening is, especially in the large transaction environment, these are businesses that are extremely well managed and have great long-term prospects, and that's getting reflected in valuation. When it comes to smaller deals, and of course, smaller is always relative, the pricing is materially lower than it is on the larger transactions. And it also depends on what segment you're talking about, whether it's our more traditional service lines. Right now, you can buy more traditional real estate service businesses at relatively low valuations for obvious reasons, capital markets as an example. But in the other two areas, the valuations, I think, are fair valuations, give or take, on the smaller transactions. And the beauty that we have is that we can integrate those acquisitions in different parts of the world in different segments of the country. That add different capabilities -- service capabilities to us. For example, in engineering, we might want to augment one or two components of our business in a particular region. So there's a nice opportunity for us to just strengthen our business and widen our capabilities. I'm probably giving you too much detail here. But having 3 distinct growth engines being able to execute on a global basis having a strong balance sheet, having a management team that's done this for a number of years, all -- it puts us in an excellent position to capitalize. And in markets like this, there are pockets of areas to capitalize on. So we're very excited about some of the opportunities we have, if we can bring them home. I think that it just takes us to an entirely new level as a company.\n\nJimmy Shan: And then maybe just Christian, a quick follow-up or a clarification. The AUM growth on the investment management business, $5 billion to $8 billion. I think I heard you correctly, you -- in Q1, you had $450 million of fundraising. And so if I just look at the annual number for 2024, simple math, 1% on 5% to 8%, the thinking is that the additional revenue on an annualized basis would be $50 million to $80 million, but weighted towards second half of the year. Is that how we should be thinking about that?\n\nChristian Mayer: Yes, I think that's right, generally. I mean there's a few strategies like credit where the capital does not generate fees until it gets put to work. But generally, in the traditional alternative infrastructure categories, when that capital is raised, there's a fee, clock just starts running immediately.\n\nJimmy Shan: And then some of the new capabilities that you talked about fundraising new capabilities in the Middle East in the RIA channel. Those expenses are already running through in the current quarter?\n\nChristian Mayer: There are charges against EBITDA in the first quarter and some costs were incurred late last year as well on these additional mostly staffing cost.\n\nOperator: The next question comes from Frederic Bastien at Raymond James.\n\nFrederic Bastien: You just added the Colliers affiliate in Philadelphia, but I was wondering if there are other non-owned affiliates or regions that are of interest to you, whether that's in the US or globally?\n\nChris McLernon: To answer your question, there's a couple potentials in the future. So Houston, Denver, South Carolina, those are kind of -- and Columbus maybe. So just a couple. And internationally, there's not really any affiliates. The markets aren't really big enough.\n\nFrederic Bastien: And maybe switching gears, still on M&A. But on the engineering side, you've been up to now pretty much active in the US and started -- established a footprint in Australia. Are these sort of the regions you're going to continue to focus on in the short term?\n\nJay Hennick: We're open to other regions as well, Fred. There are several markets that are western-type markets that are conducive for growth. You know this better than most other analysts on this call. So yes, there's a number of opportunities and number of different areas that we're pursuing.\n\nOperator: Next question is the follow-up from Daryl Young at Stifel.\n\nDaryl Young: Just on the engineering and the project management. Can you remind us the high-level mix of public versus private? And the context of the question just being some of the slowdowns we've seen in construction activity and the commercial real estate end markets, multifamily, industrial, all those areas. And just anything we should be aware of or considering on that front?\n\nChristian Mayer: Across our business, the mix is roughly 50-50 public sector and private sector and we target that for precisely the reason that you're mentioning because the public sector stuff is extremely stable. It tends to be longer term in nature. The private sector stuff is great work, has long-term contracts, but can be a bit more sensitive to economic conditions. So we try to balance it on that basis.\n\nJay Hennick: Genuinely, a little more profitable.\n\nChristian Mayer: And more profitable, yes. So we like it -- we like that balance, and that's what we try to work towards across the business and to keep those backlogs of work at sort of levels that give us great confidence in terms of our next 12 to 18 months out.\n\nDaryl Young: So things are still sort of motoring along and you're not seeing sort of any major impacts from some of these headlines we're reading?\n\nJay Hennick: No. But if you have any business, you'd like to refer our way, please give us the name, phone number, and we will be all over it.\n\nOperator: There are no further questions. You may proceed with closing comments.\n\nJay Hennick: Thanks, everyone, for participating in the first quarter conference call. Very interesting year, great opportunities we have in front of us. But as always, we'll have to continue to deliver one step at a time. So we look forward to speaking to you again during the second quarter conference call, and thanks for participating.\n\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes the conference call. Thank you for your participation, and have a nice day.", "source": {"uri": "investing.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Investing.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

(NASDAQ:CIGI) Q1 2024 Earnings Call Transcript", "body": "Colliers International Group Inc. isn't one of the 30 most popular stocks among hedge funds at the end of the third quarter (see the details here).\n\nOperator: Welcome to the Colliers International First Quarter Investors Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded. Legal counsel requires us to advise that the discussion scheduled to take place today may contain forward-looking statements that involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties. Actual results may be materially different from any future results, performance or achievements contemplated in the forward-looking statements. Additional information concerning factors that could cause actual results to materially differ from those in the forward-looking statements is contained in the company's annual information form as filed with the Canadian Securities Administrators and in the company's annual report on Form 40-F as filed with the US Securities and Exchange Commission.\n\nAs a reminder, today's call is being recorded. Today's Thursday, May 2, 2024, and at this time, for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Global Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Mr. Jay Hennick. Please go ahead, sir.\n\nJay Hennick: Thank you, operator. Good morning, and thanks for joining us on our first quarter conference call. As the operator mentioned, I'm Jay Hennick, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of the company. And with me today is Chris McLernon, Chief Executive Officer of our Real Estate Services business; and Christian Mayer, our Chief Financial Officer. As always, this call is being webcast and is available in the Investor Relations section of our Web site, along with a presentation slide deck. During the quarter, revenue, EBITDA, outsourcing and advisory, investment management and leasing all demonstrated improvement over the prior year. Despite ongoing interest rate uncertainty and geopolitical tensions that are affecting everyone, it also affected our capital markets.\n\nOur strategic focus, however, being on expanding high-value, recurring service lines that continue to yield positive results for us, positioning us extremely well for the future. We remain committed to the Colliers way, emphasizing solid internal growth and strategic acquisitions that enhance our business and create value for our shareholders. In the most recent quarter, we successfully added $300 million in new equity to support our further expansion. Furthermore, our acquisition of Colliers Philadelphia has expanded our presence in the Mid-Atlantic region, solidifying our position as a key player in the United States. Over the years, Colliers has established a highly respected global brand and growth platform with broad diversification across revenue sources, service lines and geography.\n\nWith more than 70% of our earnings generated from recurring revenue streams, we have a very robust business model with 3 distinct growth engines that can continue to allow us to capitalize on growth opportunities while maintaining resilience in the face of economic fluctuations. Most importantly, Colliers has a seasoned leadership team with a substantial equity stake in our company and an impressive 29-year record of delivering nearly 20% compound annual returns for shareholders. And now let me ask Chris McLernon to discuss some highlights from our service business and once he's completed, Christian will provide his usual financial report. Then, we'll open things up for questions. Chris?\n\nChris McLernon: Thank you, Jay, and good morning, everyone. Colliers first quarter 2024 results reflect the strength of our resilient and highly diversified professional services platform. Our Outsourcing & Advisory business delivered robust revenue growth with broad-based increases across all services, led by engineering and project management. We expect this momentum to continue through the remainder of the year, providing growth, balance and stability to our platform. This growth helped offset expected soft transaction volumes in capital markets, which, although down were above market activity levels. We remain cautiously optimistic about improving transaction velocity in the late second half of 2024, contingent on softening interest rates, the narrowing of the price gap between buyers and sellers and improved lending availability.\n\nLeasing globally achieved modest growth year-over-year with several markets increasing activity in the office sector as occupiers make longer-term lease commitments, coupled with the return to office continuing the trend upwards. Shortly after the quarter end, we completed the acquisition of our affiliate in Philadelphia. From its five offices, the company's 130 professionals provide leasing and sales brokerage and property management services. As a vibrant and influential market, our ownership now allows us to significantly increase our presence in the Mid-Atlantic and expand our capabilities in the eighth largest metropolitan area in the US. Among our many accolades in February, we were named to the IAOPs list of top 100 global professional services firms.\n\nA testament to our track record of success in delivering exceptional results for our clients wherever they do business. We have also been recognized as one of the best workplaces in Canada this year out of more than 900 companies competing for a spot. The steps we are taking to strategically invest in our people and business, fill gaps and take market share will continue to strengthen our platform and drive long-term shareholder value. Now I'll turn things over to Christian who will provide more details on our financials.\n\nChristian Mayer: Thank you, Chris, and good morning. As usual, I'll provide some additional commentary on our consolidated results, our financial outlook and our balance sheet. Note that all references to revenue growth made on this call are expressed in local currency, and that the non-GAAP measures discussed here today are as defined in the materials accompanying this call. For the seasonally slow first quarter, revenues were $1 billion, up 4% relative to Q1 2023. Internal growth was 2% with strength in our diversified recurring services outpacing a decline in capital markets activity. Our Outsourcing & Advisory service line generated strong 9% revenue growth, mostly from internal sources. Investment Management excluding pass-through period interest was essentially flat with the prior year.\n\nLeasing revenues were up 2% for the quarter, led by modest growth in office leasing. First quarter consolidated adjusted EBITDA was $109 million, up 4% relative to the prior year with margins holding flat at 10.8%. We continue to closely manage our cost to match the expected pace of revenues, especially in our Capital Markets business. We also remain focused on improving productivity and on selective strategic recruiting. In our Investment Management segment, AUM declined modestly during the quarter, mostly attributable to unrealized market value adjustments and our alternative and traditional real estate funds despite growing net operating income at the asset level. These adjustments totaled 1.5%, which outperformed the benchmark Odyssey Index.\n\nIn addition, some funds disposed of long-held assets during the quarter, realizing gains and recycling the proceeds back to investors. This positions us well for future fundraising. Our first quarter fundraising totaled $450 million. We continue to see strong interest in our alternative, infrastructure and credit strategies and we anticipate an acceleration in fundraising momentum as we progress through the year. We are maintaining our financial outlook for 2024. While interest rate volatility and geopolitical tensions continue to weigh on transaction volumes, we expect a rebound in activity in the third and fourth quarters. Although there is a risk that this could be delayed to later in the year or to early 2025. In our recurring service lines, both outsourcing and advisory and investment management, we continue to expect mid- to high single-digit revenue growth for the balance of the year.\n\nTurning to our balance sheet. Our financial leverage ratio, defined as net debt to pro forma adjusted EBITDA was 2 times at March 31. We expect leverage to rise modestly in Q2 due to seasonal working capital usage then to decline to approximately 1.5 times by the end of the year, assuming no significant acquisitions. With the $300 million equity offering we completed during the first quarter we are well positioned with more than $1 billion in available liquidity to execute on acquisition opportunities as the year unfolds. This concludes my prepared remarks. I'd now like to open the call for questions. Operator, can you please open the line?", "source": {"uri": "finance.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo!

This top-line growth will also allow us to make significant progress towards our adjusted EBITDA breakeven goal.\"\n\nFirst Quarter 2024 Financial Results\n\nWorldwide revenue was $37.9 million in the first quarter 2024, a ~16% increase from $32.7 million in the corresponding period in 2023.

Gross margin in the first quarter 2024 was impacted by procedure and product mix.\n\nOperating expenses increased ~10% to $41.9 million in the first quarter 2024, as compared to $38.1 million in the corresponding period in 2023. The change in operating expenses was primarily driven by increases in commission related to revenue growth, research and development investments, as well as higher stock based compensation. Operating expenses were also impacted by the timing of our global sales meeting, which was held in the first quarter of 2024 compared to in the second quarter of 2023.\n\nOperating loss increased by ~7% to $12.0 million in the first quarter 2024, as compared to an operating loss of $11.3 million in the corresponding period in 2023.\n\nNet loss improved by ~2%, to $10.9 million, or $0.27 per diluted share for the first quarter 2024, as compared to a net loss of $11.1 million, or $0.32 per diluted share in the corresponding period in 2023.\n\nAdjusted EBITDA loss in the first quarter of 2024 was nearly flat compared to the corresponding period in 2023 at $4.0 million.\n\nCash and marketable securities were $157.8 million and borrowings were $36.1 million as of March 31, 2024.\n\n2024 Updated Financial Guidance\n\nSI-BONE is updating 2024 worldwide revenue guidance to be in the range of $164 million to $166 million, an increase from the previous guidance of $162 million to $165 million. Compared to 2023, the updated guidance translates to growth of ~18% to ~20%, versus growth of ~17% to ~19% implied in the earlier guidance.\n\nWebcast Information\n\nSI-BONE will host a conference call to discuss the first quarter 2024 financial results after market close on Monday, November 6, 2023 at 4:30 P.M.

These risks include SI-BONE's ability to introduce and commercialize new products and indications, SI-BONE's ability to maintain favorable reimbursement for procedures using its products, the impact of any future economic weakness on the ability and desire of patients to undergo elective procedures including those using SI-BONE's devices, SI-BONE's ability to manage risks to its supply chain, future capital requirements driven by new surgical systems requiring instrument tray and implant inventory investment, and the pace of the re-normalization of the healthcare operating environment including the ability and desire of patients and physicians to undergo and perform procedures using SI-BONE's devices. Actual results and the timing of events could differ materially from those anticipated in such forward-looking statements as a result of these and other risks and uncertainties, many of which are described in the company's most recent filing on Form 10-K, and the company's other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) available at the SEC's Internet site (www.sec.gov), especially under the caption \"Risk Factors.\" SI-BONE does not undertake any obligation to update forward-looking statements and expressly disclaims any obligations or undertaking to release publicly any updates or revisions to any forward-looking statements contained herein, except as required by law.\n\nUse of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\n\nSI-BONE uses adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP financial measures that excludes from net loss the effects of interest income, interest expense, depreciation and amortization and stock-based compensation. SI-BONE believes the presentation of adjusted EBITDA is useful to management because it allows management to more consistently analyze period-to-period financial performance and provides meaningful supplemental information with respect to core operational activities used to evaluate management's performance. SI-BONE also believes the presentation of adjusted EBITDA is useful to investors and other interested persons as it enables these persons to use this additional information to assess the company's performance in using this additional metric that management uses to assess the company's performance.\n\nAdjusted EBITDA should be considered supplemental to, and not a substitute for, financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. Because adjusted EBITDA excludes the effect of items that increase or decrease SI-BONE's reported results of operations, management strongly encourages investors to review, when they become available, the company's consolidated financial statements and publicly filed reports in their entirety. The company's definition of adjusted EBITDA may differ from similarly titled measures used by others.", "source": {"uri": "wallstreet-online.de", "dataType": "news", "title": "wallstreet:online"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operating_expense", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Operating expense"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Webcast", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Webcast"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gross_margin", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Gross margin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Granite", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Granite"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pelvis", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Pelvis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earnings_before_interest,_taxes,_depreciation,_and_amortization", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sacroiliac_joint", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sacroiliac joint"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3D_computer_graphics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "3D computer graphics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasive_species", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Invasive species"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acceleration", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Acceleration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Implant_(medicine)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Implant (medicine)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conference_call", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Conference call"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research_and_development", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Research and development"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nasdaq", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nasdaq"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musculoskeletal_disorder", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Musculoskeletal disorder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence-based_medicine", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Evidence-based medicine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Anatomy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_fusion", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nuclear fusion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peer_review", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Peer review"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities/Opposing_Views", "label": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities/Opposing Views", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://assets.wallstreet-online.de/_media/6/source1280/size_645/globenewswire-1280.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9542931", "eventUri": "eng-9542931", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3176470588235294, "wgt": 452724715, "relevance": 2}], "totalResults": 81, "page": 1, "count": 1, "pages": 81}}}

Investor outreach is very important to Napco, and I'd like to thank all those folks that assist us in these types of events.

Our recurring revenue subscription service continues to exhibit robust growth, with an annual prospective run rate reaching $81 million based on April 2024 recurring revenues. The balance sheet remains strong with cash balances reaching $87.5 million, a 31% increase over the level recorded on June 30, 2023. We have no debt. Our strategic focus continues to capitalize on key industry trends, including wireless fire and intrusion alarms, driving recurring revenue services, school security solutions, enterprise access control systems, and architectural locking products. At Napco, our management team remains committed to prioritizing growth, profitability, and returns on equity while effectively managing costs.

Now I'd like to hand the call over to our newly appointed President, Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer Kevin Buchel, who will provide an overview of our fiscal third quarter results. Following Kevin's remarks, I will return to delve deeper into our strategies and market outlook. Kevin?\n\nKevin S. Buchel: Thank you, Dick, and good morning, everybody. Net sales for the three months ended March 31, 2024, increased 13% to a quarterly record $49.2 million, and that compares to $43.5 million for the same period a year ago. And net sales for the nine months ended March 31, 2024, increased 10% to a nine month record $138.5 million, as compared to $125.3 million for the same period a year ago. Recurring monthly service revenue continued its strong growth, increasing 29% in Q3 to $19.5 million as compared to $15.1 million for the same period last year. And recurring monthly service revenue for the nine months ended March 31, 2024, increased 26% to $55.4 million as compared to $43.8 million last year. And our recurring service revenues now have a prospective annual run rate of approximately $81 million based on April 2024 recurring revenues. And that compares to $76.5 million, which is based on January 2024 recurring service revenues, which we've reported back in February. Equipment sales for the quarter increased 5% to $29.7 million, as compared to $28 million last year. Equipment sales for the nine months increased 2% to $83.1 million, as compared to $81.5 million for the same period last year. These increases were primarily due to revenue increases in Alarm (NASDAQ:ALRM) Lock brand door locking products and Marks brand door locking products, as partially offset by a decrease in intrusion and access to long products. Of note is StarLink radio sales sequentially increased overall sales in Q2 by 2% and were 66% higher than such sales in Q1. Gross profit for the three months ended March 31, 2024, increased 24% to $26.5 million, with a gross margin of 54%. And that compares to $21.3 million, with a gross margin of 49% for the same period last year. Gross profit for the nine months increased by 47% to $73.9 million with a gross margin of 53% as compared to $50.2 million with a gross margin of 40% a year ago. Gross profit for recurring service revenue for the quarter increased 31% to $17.9 million with a gross margin of 92% that compares to $13.7 million with a gross margin of 90% last year. Gross profit for recurring service revenues for the nine months increased 28% to $50.1 million with a gross margin of 91%. And that compares to $39 million with a gross margin of 89% last year. Gross profit for equipment revenues in Q3 increased by 12% to $8.6 million with a gross margin of 29% as compared to $7.6 million with a gross margin of 27% last year. Gross profit for equipment revenues for the nine months increased by 113% to $23.8 million with a gross margin of 29%. And that compares to $11.2 million with a gross margin of 14% for the same period last year. The increase in both gross profit dollars and gross margin for recurring revenue for the three months and the nine months ended March 31, 2024, was primarily the result of the previously mentioned increase in recurring revenues, as well as a greater proportion of those revenues being generated by our StarLink Fire radios, which generate higher monthly service charges than the other StarLink radios. The increase in both gross profit dollars and gross margin for equipment revenues for both the three months and the nine months ended March 31, 2024, primarily resulted from the aforementioned increase in equipment revenues, as well as a favorable shift in product mix to locking products, which typically have higher gross margins than intrusion products. And another factor in the increased gross profit and gross margin for equipment revenue is there were lower costs of certain components this year as compared to last year when we were still feeling the effects of the global supply chain crisis. Research and development costs for the quarter increased 19% to $2.8 million or 6% of sales as compared to $2.3 million or 5% of sales for the same period a year ago. Research and development costs for the nine months ended March 31, 2024, increased 11% to $7.7 million or 6% of sales as compared to $7 million or 6% of sales for the same period a year ago. The increase for the three months and the nine months primarily resulted from compensation increases and additional staff. Selling general and administrative expenses for the quarter increased 10% to $9.2 million or 19% of net sales as compared to $8.4 million or 19% of net sales for the same period last year. Selling general and administrative expenses for the 9 months ended March 31, 2024, increased 6% to $26.3 million or 19% of net sales, as compared to $24.7 million, or 20% of sales for the same period last year. The increases in SG&A for the three months was primarily due to increases in legal expenses, as well as additional expenses relating to the enhancing of our internal control systems, and that was offset by decreases in advertising expenses. The increase for the nine months was primarily due to legal and accounting fees, as well as costs associated with enhancing our internal control systems. The decrease in SG&A as a percentage of net sales for the nine months was due to the increase in net sales being proportionately larger than the increase in SG&A expenses. Operating income for the quarter increased 38% to $14.5 million as compared to $10.5 million for the same period last year. Operating income for the nine months ended March 31, 2024 increased 115% to $39.9 million as compared to $18.5 million for the same period last year. Interest and other income for the three months increased 46% to $637,000 as compared to $437,000 last year. And for the nine months, interest and other income increased by [247%] (ph) to $1.8 million compared to $521,000 last year. The increases for both the three months and the nine months ended March 31, 2024, was due to increased interest income from certificates of deposits. The provision for income taxes for the three months increased by $507,000 to $1.9 million with an effective tax rate of 13%, and that compares to $1.4 million with an effective tax rate of 13% last year. And for the nine months, the provision for income tax has increased by $2.9 million to $5.4 million with an effective tax rate of 13%, and that compares to $2.5 million with an effective tax rate of 13% last year. The increase in the provision for both the three months and the nine months ended March 31, 2024 was due to increases in taxable income. Net income for the quarter increased 38% to a quarterly record $13.2 million, or $0.36 per diluted share, and that compares to $9.5 million, or $0.26 per diluted share for the same period last year, and that represents 27% of net sales. Net income for the nine months ended March 31, 2024 increased 119% to a nine-month record of $36.3 million, or $0.98 per diluted share and that compares to $16.6 million or $0.45 per diluted share for the same period last year and represents 26% of net sales. Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter increased 37% to a quarterly record $15.6 million, or $0.42 per diluted share, and that compares to $11.3 million, or $0.31 per diluted share for the same period a year ago, and equates to an adjusted EBITDA margin of 32%. Adjusted EBITDA for the nine-month ended March 31, 2024, increased 105% to a nine-month record $43.5 million, or $1.18 per diluted share. And that compares to $21.3 million, or $0.57 per diluted share for the same period last year, and it equates to an adjusted EBITDA margin of 31%. Now moving on to the balance sheet. As of March 31, 2024, the company had $87.5 million in cash and cash equivalents, other investments, and marketable securities, and that compared to $66.7 million as of June 30, 2023, and that's a 31% increase. The company had no debt as of March 31, 2024. Cash provided by operating activities for the nine months ended March 31, 2024, was $31 million. That compared to $12.4 million for the same period last year. And working capital as defined as current assets less current liabilities was $138.3 million on March 31, 2024, and that compared with working capital of $111.7 million at June 30, 2023. Current ratio, defined as current assets divided by current liabilities, was 7.9 to 1 at March 31, 2024, and 6.7 to 1 at June 30, 2023. And CapEx for the quarter was $361,000, and that compared to $1.7 million for the prior year period. That concludes my formal remarks, and I would now like to return the call back to Dick.\n\nRichard L. Soloway: Kevin, thank you. Our fiscal year 2024 is going exceptionally well, with fiscal Q1, Q2, and now Q3 achieving record-breaking results fueled by recurring revenues enabled by our hardware innovations. It's also worth noting all our growth is organically driven. Recurring revenue continued its strong growth, increasing by 29% to Q3 and representing 40% of total company revenues and our net income of $13.2 million and adjusted EBITDA of $15.6 million. [We're] (ph) all quarterly record breakers. Equipment revenue improved, growing 5% over last year for the quarter, with gross margins on such sales increasing to 29% from 27% last year. Radio sales in Q3 improved over Q2, increasing by approximately 2% and 66% over the Q1 level. While such sales were still below the radio sales for Q3 last year, when the 3G Verizon (NYSE:VZ) Sunset was upon us, the increase over the last two quarters is a good sign. We expect radio sales to continue to be a key contributor to our hardware sales and continue to lead to the strong growth of our highly profitable recurring revenues. Gross margin for recurring revenues continue to get better, now at 92%. So 40% of our revenue generated a gross margin of 92%. That's an amazing stat and we are very proud of it. We are also very pleased with the increase in the recurring revenue annual run rate, which increased to $81 million based on April 2024 recurring revenues, compared to an annual run rate of $76.5 million based on January 2024 recurring revenues. Our Alarm Lock and Marks locking hardware lines continue to see growth in schools and classroom security, healthcare and retail loss prevention, as well as multi-family dwellings, commercial and residential applications, growing approximately 16% compared to last year and approximately 10% compared to Q2. Locking sales once again represented over 60% of hardware sales in Q3. We continue to remain focused on further penetrating each of these markets. Net income of $13.2 million, besides being a Q3 record breaker, represents 27% of net sales. Adjusted EBITDA of $15.6 million, also a Q3 record, represents an adjusted EBITDA margin of 32%. We believe we are well on our way to achieving our adjusted EBITDA margin target of approximately 45% on or about the end of fiscal 2026, as our targeted equipment sales reached $150 million and our recurring revenue service level reaches $150 million. Our balance sheet continues to get stronger with cash and cash equivalents, other investments, and marketable securities increasing 31% to $87.5 million as compared to $66.7 million at June 30, 2023. We have no debt, and the net cash provided by operating activities for the nine months ending March 31, 2024 was also strong, amounting to $31 million. There are millions of commercial buildings of all types, such as offices, hospitals, schools, coffee shops, restaurants, as well as residences that still require upgrades from legacy copper phone lines. Our StarLink line of radios have the widest coverage range of both AT&T and Verizon with rich feature sets, which our dealers really love. As we have previously stated, the constraints of the supply chain have abated, and we believe in the coming months and quarters that combined with new distribution sources we have developed will begin to invigorate our equipment sales and association margins to even higher levels than any time before. As we have stated previously, the higher -- the hardware sales, the more overhead absorption occurs in our Dominican Republic factory, and this expands our gross margins. And as indicated in this morning's earnings release, the company will be issuing a quarterly dividend of $0.10 per share to be paid on June 24, 2024, to shareholders of record on June 3, 2024. We are proud of this program as the Napco team has created such tremendous shareholder value over the years that this is another way for us to distribute profitable growth to our investors. Now some comments about the recent ISC West trade show we attended last month in Las Vegas, which attracted over 30,000 security professionals. These are dealers and installers and integrators to buy security products. Napco made a significant impact with our prominently positioned new booth designed and shown at the show entrance. The event was attended by key distributors, dealers, integrators, and competitors alike. Napco's management, sales leadership, and tech team left the conference with a positive outlook on our competitive position in the domestic security space. Our favorable impression was reinforced by Napco's innovative culture, ongoing new product development, strong brand identity, and the industry's steady growth trajectory. Customer interest levels peaked and Napco received a record number of sales leads, driven in part by the successful launch of several highly distinctive products, including Napco's popular Marks USA Panic Exit Hardware line, expanded to include lockdown models, the brand new NFC solution, i.e., our [locks] (ph) built-in access control readers for use with secure mobile credentials stored in the wallet, utility of users, smartphones, and one that got the most attention, the StarLink Fire Max 2, the next generation of our RMR, recurring monthly revenue, producing 5G commercial fire series alarm communicators. This solution addresses the transition away from vanishing POTS lines for millions of commercial fire alarm panels. The Fire Max 2 with its dual SIM technology, leveraging Verizon or AT&T signal strengths, allows dealers to streamline their inventory. The Max 2 boasts a true end-to-end UL864 listed solution featuring a UL864 listed triple protected network operating center headquartered in the US, for optimal response times. Also, Napco's Prima all-in-one system, launched late last year, continues to gain traction and excitement, extending beyond the traditional Napco dealer base. Prima now features more emergency condition detection and all weather cameras at a competitively priced price point enhancing both equipment capabilities and RMR potential. In the last nine months of fiscal 2024, we have generated strong sales and profitability. We believe we can continue this growth well into the future as we work toward our fiscal 2026 goals and beyond. I'd like to thank everyone for their support and for joining us in this exciting future we have. Our formal remarks are now concluded, and we'd like to open the call for the Q&A session. Operator, please proceed.\n\nOperator: Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Matt Somerville from D.A. Davidson. Your line is open.\n\nMatt Somerville: Thanks, good morning. Maybe first if we can talk about hardware gross margins. Nice improvement year-on-year, no doubt about it. They've been kind of flattish for the last three quarters. Can you maybe talk about what the catalysts are as we look ahead outside of just overhead absorption to get that margin kind of marching more prominently towards your longer-term projection there and then I have a follow-up.\n\nKevin S. Buchel: Okay, Matt, well the overhead absorption is a big factor. I don't want to diminish it, because in the past, it has led to our margins going from low to mid-30s to high-30s, low-40s. So it's significant when we put good numbers, strong hardware numbers on the board. But absent of that, the locking products, which now 66% of the hardware sales, that brings better margins than some of the intrusion products, like the radio products. Now granted the radio products lead to the recurring revenue, which is the best of them all, but on a pure hardware basis, the locking does better. And so we expect the locking products to continue to get stronger. Dick mentioned in his remarks some of the reasons why locking is strong. School security, airport infrastructure upgrades, projects that are going on in buildings, in hotel renovations. There's a lot of things going on that are contributing to locking. We have two locking companies. They're both operating really well, hitting on all cylinders, both of them at the same time. And so locking, which has been good, we expect it to get even stronger, and that should help margins even further. Those are probably the main reasons. The mix, more [locking] (ph), but don't diminish the overhead absorption. It's a big factor.\n\nMatt Somerville: Got it. That's helpful, Kevin. Thank you. Can you maybe talk a little bit more quantitatively, or even just qualitatively, around the excitement or initial uptake you expect on Fire Max 2. I don't know if you can sort of talk about maybe how this product launch is faring versus the prior gen product launch and then similarly if you can talk about maybe some initial feedback you've had now that Prima's been in the market for the last couple of quarters, how you're feeling about uptake there. And when maybe we start to see some of the non -- some of the other businesses outside of fire really starting to drive that recurring revenue. Thank you.\n\nRichard L. Soloway: The Max-2 is a product, when a fire alarm is installed in a building, the fire marshals in the commercial buildings want dual functionality of communications. So the way the radios that have been out there working is the dealer will select the AT&T or Verizon signal and also run a wire to connect to the internet for the second communications link. The Max 2 is very, very different because in a lot of cases it's harder for the dealers to run a wire and get into the Internet because these alarm systems could be in a basement area which is -- where there's no Internet close by. But we have this new UL dual AT&T and Verizon And one doesn't require any wire. Once whichever signal is stronger, that's the way the system will transmit the fire emergency or the check into the central station and uses only radio. So it's going to be a faster install for dealers. It's really unique and special. And we want to have the one and only radio that the dealers will use for all applications, and the MAX 2 will be it. They don't have to have any other models. They can use that. And that's a very, very profitable model, great recurring revenue to it. So we expect that -- that will continue making us the leader at 92% margins. You can see the deal is like our product line. So we expect to try to keep the margins as high as possible with that product line and sell more and more of them. When it comes to the Prima product, more and more adoption is going on, and it's starting to contribute. It is a unique product. It's a different type of product for us, because our typical alarm products are for more customization of residential and commercial. This product is for mass. It's a product that goes in very quickly. A salesman that sells the alarm job, both commercially, small commercially, or residentially, can actually install it himself. He doesn't need a crew. So he can sell the alarm system to the end user customer and put it in right away and start getting recurring revenue from it. And we get our recurring revenue from that installation. So it's a conversion process where there are thousands and thousands of companies that are using this type of mass alarm system. And we're picking up more share. And we saw a lot of interest. You were at the show. You saw it was right up front. You saw that there were many times during the day, I couldn't even see the carpet. There were so many people standing on it, looking at this alarm system that's been out now for a little while. But it takes time for dealers to get used to it, to talk amongst themselves, and start converting over to it. And it looks very, very good that this is the ongoing process.\n\nMatt Somerville: Perfect. Thanks, Doug. Your next question comes from the line of Jim Ricchiuti from Needham & Company. Your line is open.\n\nJim Ricchiuti: Hi. Thank you. Good morning. I wonder if you would talk to us a little bit about how much of a contribution you saw from the new distributor in the quarter and maybe how you've seen this business scale over the next couple of quarters. And I have a follow-up.\n\nKevin S. Buchel: So ADI, the new distributor, is doing well with us. ADI has the potential to be doing a lot more. They're the largest distributor of security products in the industry. There are companies that have more volume, but nobody has more security sales than them. So the potential is big. We've seen nice growth, we're only dealing with them a few quarters, each quarter better than the preceding one. And they've made introductions. This is a very important point. They've made introductions to several large dealers that exclusively deal with them, who we've been trying to have a relationship with. And [other than] (ph) is Securitas, the big name, maybe the second largest dealer out there. Thanks to ADI, we have a relationship now with Securitas. So not only does ADI help us with pure sales numbers, but making intros to dealers is a key part. And we expect the business to keep going up. It's just the beginning. It's not a situation where we loaded up all 115 branches, make a big splash, did it systematically, slowly. We expect it to keep growing as each quarter progresses.\n\nJim Ricchiuti: Kevin, on some of this new potential business that you're seeing out there, can you talk to us about the type of business this is? Is this more in some of the areas that you guys are historically very strong in, for instance in the fire radio business, maybe just some sense as to where you see inroads with some of these new dealers, potentially large ones.\n\nKevin S. Buchel: Yeah, so the large, we've talked before about some of the large dealers that we've picked up over the last several quarters. And Fire radios, is the biggest one that they're all interested in. We actually took one of our top sales guys and made him the head of national accounts because we're picking up more and more of these large dealers. And this gentleman's mission with us is to nurture these relationships. We want to sell not only more fire radios, we have a whole line of products. We want to sell them all of our products. So it's starting out with fire radios, the expectation it's going to expand to other things, and we've actually added another salesperson to assist this guy. So now there's two of them whose job and whose mission is manage and nurture and expand these very large dealers that we now have a relationship with. Thanks for that.\n\nJim Ricchiuti: And Kevin or Dick, just wanted to follow up with the organizational changes that were announced last week. And I guess the question is, do you foresee the need at some point to add additional resources to senior management with Kevin, the fact that you're now assuming dual roles as president, CEO, and your ongoing CFO role.\n\nRichard L. Soloway: What's going to happen with us is that, as we said, we keep looking for additional people to help grow our business. Kevin and I have been working together for 30 years and we make a great team and we have additional people in the senior management with our company that have been with the company for 25 years. That know the business inside [of Napco] (ph). And we have a bench, a lot of bench strength. We have [10 years] (ph) that have been with the company. People like working at Napco. We have very little turnover. We get the right type of person. That person stays with us for his career. We like to promote from within rather than going to the outside. Just like when we grow our business, we like to grow our business through organic means. We find it's the most efficient way. And when we bring people up within the organization, it's the most efficient way. They know the culture. They know the other players in the company. So we have a nice bench strength of at least eight managers that know all of the different divisions products, all work together in a team. We do meetings on a regular basis every single week. So we have a very, very strong structure for growth. The way we're moving along now, you can tell that the numbers compared to the competition are doing much better in growth and ratio of profitability. So I think we got the right combination of doing things.\n\nJim Ricchiuti: Well, Kevin, congratulations on the appointment and to the team on the quarter.\n\nKevin S. Buchel: Thanks, Jim.\n\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Jaeson Schmidt from Lake Street Capital Markets. Your line is open.\n\nJaeson Schmidt: Hey guys, thanks for your time and questions. Kevin, just curious if you could share with us some of the sell-through metrics at the distributors. And I guess relatedly, sort of that high-cost inventory issue that impacted previous quarters, do you think that's completely worked through now?\n\nKevin S. Buchel: I'll start with the second part first. So the high cost inventory at the distributors, because it's twofold, it's at the distributors. And also we have some with Napco. At the distributors, it's mostly solved. We have talked about how there are two distributors with too much radio inventory, one completely solved, the other mostly solved but not 100%. Probably a few hundred thousand dollars left of what they consider excess radio inventory. We'll keep trying to help them work through it and it'll be gone probably by the end of the fiscal year, is our belief. Then you have the situation where we have some excess radio inventory. Remember we built a lot of inventory in anticipation of the sunset. Sunset came and went. We had some extra. We're working through a lot of that, too. The Radio demand is big, especially on fire radios. So we expect that to be a non-issue over the next, I'm going to say six months. We want to -- our inventory, we haven't talked a lot about it, our inventory has been coming down. Our cash flow is great, but we still want to [ring-out] (ph) probably another $10 million from our inventory. And it will come from different areas, but radios is one of them. We expect to sell a lot more radios in the next six months. We've been doing great. We expect to sell even more. Demand is huge. We have all these big accounts now that have become customers. That's part of why we think we are going to move a lot of the radio inventory and that's going to lead to the continuation of the recurring, grew by 29% which was nice, it's been growing by 25%, now it grew by 29%, and a lot of it is Fire. And Fire has the great margins and that's why it was up to 92%. On sell through stats, we don't really disclose a lot of that, but I can share with you that on a sequential basis, the intrusion sell-through stats showed an increase of 13%. And that's very important. So that's the division that sells, among other things, the radios. And having a sequential increase of 13% seems to me that that'll bode well for that division as we head into our best quarter, historically, our fourth quarter. You know, typically, our fourth quarter has always been the best. So if that pattern continues, the one that we're in now would be the best. And it's important that we're seeing not only the locking, which we've talked a lot about how great it's doing, but I like seeing a sequential increase on the intrusion side of 13%.\n\nJaeson Schmidt: Okay, great. Appreciate that, color. I'll jump back into queue. Thanks a lot, guys.\n\nKevin S. Buchel: Thanks, Jaeson.\n\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Lance Vitanza from TD Cowen. Your line is open.\n\nLance Vitanza: Thanks, guys, for taking the questions. Congratulations on a nice quarter. Most of my questions have been answered, but I guess on the balance sheet, this clean balance sheet that you have, it looks a little bit like an underutilized asset, provides a lot of optionality. I'm not sure investors are giving you much credit for that. The question is, are there opportunities to perhaps add a little leverage, maybe $50 million or so, for some sort of strategic transaction? Or is that [anathema] (ph) to sort of your sort of strategy for maintaining the operational flexibility going forward? Thanks.\n\nKevin S. Buchel: There are possibilities that an acquisition of a product that could be tucked into our product line, of which it has to have a nice volume to it that our dealers use all the time. We don't want to do anything that's outside of our wheelhouse. So there is some possibility of that. It's not a front burner situation, but it is a possibility. We continue to build cash because we like to have enough cash. You never know what the opportunities are going to be like. We like to also issue the dividends as payback to the investors that have been supporting us. So that's basically the way we're going right now. But it's a high-class problem that we are addressing.\n\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Raj Sharma from B. Riley. Your line is open.\n\nRaj Sharma: Hi. Thank you for taking my questions. Congratulations on the excellent continued growth and also on the recurring side. On the equipment side, I had a question for Kevin or Dick. The alarms picked up sequentially 2%, and the year-on-year was down 12% for the intrusion access alarms. It's great to hear that the sell through the dealers is up sequentially 13%. I just wanted to understand going forward you're saying you see growth pick up from the Fire Max 2 and from picking up share with the new dealers. When should we see this pick up? In the first half of fiscal '25 or second half or...\n\nKevin S. Buchel: Well, our hope and expectation, Raj, is we can start seeing it potentially in this Q4 that we're in now. The fact, there's two factors. One, the comps are much easier. Q4 last year was in a difficult comp. That combined with the sell-through stats that I referred to earlier, it bode well for an increase in the intrusion segment, as we enter next fiscal year, more things should kick in. You should have contributions from the large dealers. You should have contributions from MAX, MAX 2. You should have contributions from Prima. These are all things that we expect is going to help that division to much better than it's been doing. And it's been doing well. It's like the unsung hero because the radio that it's contributing, while not at the same level as what they were in the height of the sunset, they are bringing -- those are the radios that are giving us this phenomenal recurring and the 92% margin. So it's doing great. It's going to do even better.\n\nRichard L. Soloway: At the show, what we saw was a lot of activity around our fire panels because we also make a fire alarm system, a couple of them for commercial jobs, so the radio has built in. A lot of interest in that - so fire business is very important. And as we've been talking about the fire business is a legislative business. It's a very stable growing business. The fire marshal makes sure that all the commercial buildings in their territories all around the United States, have working fire alarm systems that communicate regularly to the central station, the [TeleCentral] (ph) that they're working. So it's a legislated in business no matter what's going on in the economy, the business, if the building is open, you have to have a working fire alarm system. And we have millions of these buildings that either need to have an upgrade to their communications, which is away from copper or new construction, and there are lots of cranes all over the USA, putting up new buildings and they need fire alarm systems from complete. That's the panel and the smoke detector, the carbon oxide detector, and we have a fantastic, fantastic offerings for the dealers to do new work. So it's all the replacement work for copper and the new work, and it's very exciting. Also our goal long term over the next few years is to get recurring revenue Raj from all of our other hardware products. because we want the locksmiths and door specialty companies to be in the same mode as alarm dealers where they get recurring revenue accounts. Locksmith just do a job and they move on. But there are ways that we are working on products with them, so that they get recurring revenue. And because we're a technology company compared to other hardware manufacturers, there's a lot of -- there are other hardware guys that have been there this for 100 years, but they don't know about recurring revenue and network operating centers and UL864 approvals, we know all that. So that's going to be very important for the future. It's going to continue our growth. We've now had -- Kevin, was it 13 consecutive quarters of growth?\n\nKevin S. Buchel: I was track, I know we're on our way to (inaudible) that I had to remember.\n\nRichard L. Soloway: 23.\n\nKevin S. Buchel: 23. So our goal is to keep the streak up, hit that 2026 numbers and have that EBITDA of 45%. And that's it. We love to grow this business organically. But as I said, if an acquisition came around, which would be something that dealers would use regularly every day, like they put in our other products. That would be a nice tuck-in. We bring it in to our Dominican Republic, which has capacity to do $300 million, $100 million per shift, and we have room for another building alongside of it to do another $300 million -- it's a great place to manufacture. And we're very, very integrated, as you know, where we do all our engineering in-house. We don't farm it out, our own manufacturing in-house and have capacity. So the future is very bright for us.\n\nOperator: [Operator's Instructions] There are no further questions at this time. I will turn the call over back to Mr. Soloway.\n\nRichard L. Soloway: Thank you, everyone, for participating in today's conference call. As always, should you have any further questions, please feel free to call Fran, Kevin or myself for further information. We thank you for your interest and support, and we look forward to speaking to you all again in a few months to discuss Napco's fiscal Q4 and full year results. Have a wonderful day. Bye-bye.\n\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference.

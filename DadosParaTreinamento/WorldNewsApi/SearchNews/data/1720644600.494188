{"id": 231227438, "title": "\"This is another level\": WWE's Drew McIntyre talks Scottish homecoming and being a bad guy ahead of Clash At The Castle", "text": "This is an exciting time to be a wrestling fan. While Dwayne \u201cThe Rock\u201d Johnson may be claiming to have made wrestling cool again with his recent blockbuster return at Wrestlemania XL, the truth is that this has been building for a few years now. WWE is drawing some of the biggest crowds \u2013 and biggest paydays \u2013 in its storied history, with recently annointed Chief Content Officer Paul \u201cTriple H\u201d Levesque leading the charge with renewed focus, fresh ideas and a roster absolutely packed with incredible athletes and performers. Part of this growth has seen WWE taking their Premium Live Events (PLEs) international. This year alone there have been major events in Australia, Saudi Arabia and France \u2013 where an absolutely insane crowd made an already solid show into an absolute classic. The next stop on WWE\u2019s world tour will be the first ever WWE PLE in Scotland and the first big UK show since they packed Cardiff\u2019s Principality Stadium in 2022 for the first Clash At The Castle. The headliner then was larger-than-life Scotsman Drew McIntyre, who was hailed as a more-or-less hometown hero as one of - if not the - biggest wrestling stars to come out of the British Isles. McIntyre is once again the face of Clash At The Castle \u2013 only this time he really is the hometown hero, having grown up only a few miles from Glasgow, in Ayreshire. \u201cI've wrestled a couple of times in Glasgow since I returned to WWE, but this is another level,\u201d says Drew, speaking to Irish Mirror the week before Clash At The Castle. \u201cIt's always fun to go back to Scotland and see friends and family and just the passion of the Scottish fans. \u201cBut now to have a PLE? In Scotland? That\u2019s beyond any dreams I had as a kid because it didn't exist. Like it wasn\u2019t even an option. \u201cMy goal was to main event Wrestlemania and I've been lucky, I've been able to do that - even won the World Title at WrestleMania a couple of times - but it wasn't even on the radar to go, I can't wait to do that home, in Scotland.\u201d In addition to Clash At The Castle, Glasgow will be hosting a special edition of WWE\u2019s weekly show Smackdown, on Friday, June 14. This will be of special interest to Irish fans, as it features a double main event of Drew McIntyre vs Dubliner Sheamus, and Sami Zayn vs Wicklow\u2019s Finn Balor. To see so many Irish and Scottish superstars at the top of an incredible roster of international performers is impressive, given how small the two nations are. In addition to Drew, Sheamus and Finn, there are also the likes of Becky Lynch and Lyra Valkyria from Ireland and Scottish stars Piper Niven, Nikki Cross, Isla Dawn and Alba Fyre. \u201cWe\u2019re just better than North Americans,\u201d the 6'5\" Scotsman laughs. \u201cBut it's mad, honestly, to think about how when Seamus and I got signed in 2007 there were a few English people, Fit Finlay from Northern Ireland \u2013 but there was nobody from Scotland. \u201cThen we fast forward all these years and to look at the representation from so many different countries all across the world is very cool. When you look specifically at the amount of Scottish guys - and maybe more girls than guys - and a mix of guys and girls from Ireland... That is just absolutely wild because we're such small countries. \u201cI guess it's down to a number of things, but the main thing that I\u2019d pinpoint would really be the life. It's the dream, but it is very physically and mentally taxing. You have to be tough, physically and mentally. \u201cCeltic people are just built different. We don't just live in it, we thrive in that environment. I think that's why so many of us are thriving in WWE. It takes a special kind of person.\u201d The last Clash At The Castle saw the Scottish Warrior come up short against Roman Reigns after interference from members of Reigns\u2019s family. While that turn of events was absolutely devastating for McIntyre \u2013 and pretty much everyone who saw what happened in Cardiff \u2013 the opportunity to lift a title at home is likely to make up for it. \u201cI guess sometimes everything happens for a reason, although it was frustrating to me at the time,\u201d he says. \u201cSometimes it's part of a bigger story and there\u2019s delayed gratification, but I was going crazy with a couple of things that happened - especially in the last Clash. \u201cBut then again, it's led to this moment where we have a re-do, if you will, but this time it's literally in Scotland, so it was worth the wait for this moment.\u201d The Scotsman is a heavy favourite going into Saturday\u2019s main event against Damien Priest \u2013 who took the title in controversial circumstances at Wrestlemania in April. That night Drew beat Seth Rollins for the World Heavyweight Championship, but only held the strap for five minutes and 46 seconds before Priest was able to wrestle it from him. Wrestling fans and commentators alike have been praising McIntyre\u2019s recent work as some of the best of his career. Having been the face of WWE during the difficult, and crowdless, pandemic period, where he was playing the role of smiling, honourable babyface, the last couple of years have seen a slow turn to the dark side for Drew. This has led to some inspired social media posts - including a tweet sent live during his Wrestlemania match - and absolutely blistering promo battles with the likes of CM Punk \u2013 some of which has felt less like the scripted back and forth fans have become used to and more off the cuff. Laughing, Drew says, \u201cMy hands are black and blue from all the wrist-slapping I\u2019ve taken for some of the stuff I\u2019ve said!\u201d He describes being told he\u2019s now doing the best work of his 20+ year career as \u201ca backhanded compliment\u201d, but he understands why people say it. \u201cThere's a certain line you can't cross as a \u2018good guy\u2019, so I understand where people are coming from,\u201d he says. \u201cI think the biggest thing for me is just the point where I said to myself, I've been holding back I need to go all the way. There was a moment about nine months ago where I said I'm not gonna hold back anymore. I\u2019ve just gotta go 100%.\u201d Come Clash At The Castle: Glasgow, there\u2019ll be over 15,000 fans cheering him on to do just that. Drew Mcintyre will face Sheamus on Friday June 14 at Smackdown: Glasgow. Tune in on TNT Sports.

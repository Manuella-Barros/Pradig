The United States and its Western allies clashed with Russia and North Korea at the meeting, saying both countries violated a U.N. embargo on arms exports from the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea, the country\u2019s official name. Russia dismissed the \u201cbaseless accusations,\u201d and the DPRK dismissed the meeting as \u201can extremely brazen act\u201d to discuss \u201csomeone\u2019s alleged \u2018weapon transfers.\u2019\u201d Jonah Leff, executive director of Conflict Armament Research, gave the council a detailed analysis of the remnants of the missile that struck Ukraine\u2019s second-largest city, Kharkiv, on Jan. 2. He said the organization documented the missile\u2019s rocket motor, its tail section and almost 300 components manufactured by 26 companies from eight countries and territories, and it determined the missile was either a KN-23 or KN-24 manufactured in 2023 in the DPRK. The organization reached its conclusion based on the missile\u2019s unique characteristics \u2014 its diameter, distinct jet vane actuators that direct the missile\u2019s thrust and trajectory, the pattern around the igniter, the presence of Korean characters on some rocket components, and other marks and components dating back to 2023, he said. \u201cFollowing the initial documentation, our teams inspected three additional identical DPRK missiles that struck Kyiv and Zaporizhzhia earlier this year,\u201d Leff said. They also observed additional conventional weapons, including an artillery rocket produced in 1977, \u201cthat had been seized on the front lines and had not been observed on the battlefield previously in Ukraine\u201d that were manufactured by the DPRK, and might have been part of a recent larger consignment of rockers. The council discussed illegal arms transfers from North Korea at the request of France, Japan, South Korea, the United Kingdom and the United States. The meeting followed Russia\u2019s March 28 veto that ended the monitoring of sanctions against North Korea over its expanding nuclear program by a U.N. panel of experts. The U.S. and its European and Asian allies accused Moscow of seeking to avoid scrutiny as it allegedly violates sanctions to buy weapons from Pyongyang for its war in Ukraine. U.N. disarmament chief Izumi Nakamitsu told the council Friday that before its mandate expired, the panel of experts was reviewing a report from Ukraine on missile debris it recovered \u201cfollowing information about short-range ballistic missiles manufactured in the DPRK and used by Russian armed forces in Ukraine.\u201d While the mandate of the experts, which had been extended since 2009 with Russia\u2019s support, was terminated, Nakamitsu said \u201cit is important to note\u201d that the Security Council committee responsible for monitoring the implementation of sanctions against the DPRK \u201ccontinues its work and will oversee the implementation of the sanctions regime.\u201d U.S. Ambassador Robert Wood called Leff\u2019s presentation with its many technical details \u201cquite compelling,\u201d and told the council that while Russia may have ended the panel\u2019s monitoring with China\u2019s \u201ctacit support,\u201d the briefing showed that Moscow and Beijing \u201ccannot prevent the public from learning about the unlawful arms transfers occurring between the DPRK and Russia.\u201d He said the independent findings by Leff\u2019s research organization corroborate open-source reports and analyses. And he said that, in addition to the dozens of missiles Russia has transferred from the DPRK, it has also unlawfully transferred over 11,000 containers of munitions. \u201cAs a permanent member of the Security Council, Russia has a responsibility to uphold and strengthen international peace and security,\u201d Wood said. \u201cYet, Russia is launching ballistic missiles, which it unlawfully procured from the DPRK, against the Ukrainian people.\u201d Russia\u2019s U.N. Ambassador Vassily Nebenzia accused the meeting\u2019s Western sponsors of attempting to use the Security Council \u201cto trot out an anti-Russian and anti-North Korean narrative and to disseminate baseless accusations in order to detract attention from their own destructive actions which foment escalation in the region.\u201d He called the claims that Russia is using DPRK missiles in Ukraine \u201cabsolutely false,\u201d questioning the professionalism and expertise of those who examined the wreckage in Ukraine. Nebenzia accused the United States of constantly stepping up the militarization of the Asia-Pacific region and said Washington\u2019s policy of \u201cextended deterrence\u201d on Russia\u2019s eastern border \u201cposes a real threat not just for the DPRK but also for our country.\u201d He said the purpose of the June 19 strategic partnership agreement signed by Russian President Vladimir Putin and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un \u201cis to play a stabilizing role in northeast Asia amidst an unprecedented escalation of tensions.\u201d As for Article 4 of the agreement, providing for the delivery of mutual military assistance if either country is subject to an armed attack, he said this should not arouse \u201cnational security-related concerns\u201d for countries that don\u2019t plan to attack the DPRK. North Korea\u2019s U.N. Ambassador Kim Song called the United States \u201cthe world\u2019s biggest arms exporter,\u201d and accused the Western countries that called the council meeting of being \u201cthe main culprits\u201d of disturbing global peace. They have caused \u201ctragic bloodshed by extensive shipment of weapons \u201d and have cast \u201ca cloud of war in every corner of the world.\u201d Song detailed U.S. arms shipments to South Korea and Japan and accused the U.S. and its followers of trying to obstruct the development of DPRK-Russia relations. He defended those relations as \u201ccompletely of a peace-loving and defensive nature.\u201d China Deputy U.N. Ambassador Geng Shuang warned that peace and security in all of northeast Asia will be affected if there is \u201cmore chaos\u201d on the Korean peninsula. He called on all parties to be \u201crational and pragmatic\u201d and \u201cwork together to cool down the situation.\u201d China will play \u201ca constructive role\u201d to realize long-term peace and stability on the Korean peninsula, Geng said, and he called on the United States to end its pressure campaign against the DPRK and \u201cthe myth of deterrence,\u201d and demonstrate its sincerity in holding an unconditional dialogue \u201cthrough concrete action.\u201d U.S. envoy Wood retorted: \u201cIf, indeed, China is so concerned about the security situation on the Korean peninsula, then it needs to use its influence with the DPRK to persuade it from undermining regional and global security.\u201d \u201cIt should also use its influence that it has with Russia through its new \u2018No Limits\u2019 partnership to end this increasingly dangerous military cooperation between DPRK and Russia,\u201d he said.

He transferred from Lake Brantley to Lake Mary in January. He acclimated himself to his new football team this spring with the Rams and head coach Scott Perry. On Friday, he committed to play football for Northwestern University. It\u2019s been a whirlwind six months for Jumpp, who finds himself in what he said was somewhat of an unpredictable position. \u201cYes, definitely surprising, because if my freshman-year self was looking at me right now, I wouldn\u2019t be thinking that I would be in this position,\u201d Jumpp said. \u201cEspecially coming from a school that ran the triple-option offense. I\u2019m very blessed to be here and very ecstatic and surprised that I can be here.\u201d Perry is happy to have Jumpp, the No. 38 player in the Sentinel\u2019s 2025 Central Florida Super60, and he will use the 6-foot-3, 255-pound lineman on both offense and defense. He played predominantly offensive line at Brantley. \u201cGreat kid, hard worker and I\u2019m looking forward to having him on the field for us this fall,\u201d said Perry via text Saturday. Jumpp committed to the Big Ten Wildcats during an official visit to the suburban Chicago school and he said he immediately fell in love with the school, the environment and the coaching staff in the short period of time. \u201cAbsolutely. It\u2019s a lovely place here. The coaching staff is great and they have just made a great impression on me,\u201d Jumpp said in a phone interview from Evanston, Ill. \u201cI just wanted to seize the opportunity.\u201d He said he was a bit uneasy at first, but the feeling that he wanted to commit was too strong to wait any longer. \u201cIt was a bit of nervous excitement, but I just felt like it was home,\u201d Jumpp said. \u201cGetting up here and meeting with the coaches and talking with coach [Christian] Smith and coach [David] Braun \u2026 they just felt like the right people to develop me and turn me into a great player. When I kinda felt like it was right, I just made the decision.\u201d Braun is the head coach and Smith is the defensive line coach, who is expected to use Jumpp in the 3-techinique or noseguard position. Players do not just waltz into Northwestern because they play football. It takes a certain type of student to qualify for admission, but Northwestern coaches are obviously confident Jumpp will qualify by offering him a scholarship. Jumpp has done his part, carrying a 4.0 weighted GPA. \u201cGrades are very important to me and I definitely pride myself on keeping my grades up and having As and Bs in my classes and making sure everything is according to what I want and not slacking,\u201d Jump said. He is excited to get going at Lake Mary and has handled this transitional year quite well. \u201cIt feels good and I\u2019m very confident in what me and my new team is going to be able to do,\u201d said Jumpp, who goes from a Brantley team that was 1-9 to a Lake Mary squad that lost in the state quarterfinals a year ago. \u201cWe moved closer to Lake Mary and I made the decision to go play for the school that was closest, that I was zoned for. We\u2019re gonna have a great year.\u201d He\u2019s picked up quite a bit of attention since joining the Lake Mary squad and he has enjoyed what he has experienced so far. He picked Northwestern over Navy and Army, as well as Troy. He\u2019s looking forward to improving on his pass blocking at Lake Mary and creating a protective circle around stellar junior quarterback Noah Grubbs, who threw for more than 4,000 yards last season. \u201cI have a lot of areas that I will be improving on. I do have a lot of work to do, but nothing I\u2019m scared to do,\u201d said Jump, whose father also played at Lake Mary. Northwestern coaches are not concerned with his pass blocking since they will be sending him to get the quarterback. \u201cThey definitely see that I have a lot of potential,\u201d Jump said. \u201cThey\u2019re looking to develop me as a great player and they are excited just to have me on board.\u201d Chris Hays can be found on X @OS_ChrisHays.

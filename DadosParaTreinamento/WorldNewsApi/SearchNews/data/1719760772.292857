{"id": 225054482, "title": "Belgian police search EU parliament office over Russian interference", "text": "Belgian police have searched the European parliament office and Brussels home of a parliamentary staffer who is believed to have played \u201ca significant role\u201d in a Russian interference operation, the national prosecutor has said. French authorities also carried out a search of the employee\u2019s European parliament office in Strasbourg at the request of the Belgian examining magistrate overseeing the inquiry into corruption and Russian interference. The case is part of a Belgian investigation announced last month into alleged payments to MEPs to promote Russian propaganda on the Voice of Europe website. The searches come just over a week before elections to the European parliament. After a Czech investigation into the Prague-based website, Belgium\u2019s prime minister, Alexander De Croo, said last month a pro-Russian interference network was active in several European countries, including Belgium. The objective, he added, was to help elect more pro-Russian candidates to the European parliament in next week\u2019s elections and reinforce \u201ca certain pro-Russian narrative in that institution\u201d. In a statement on Wednesday, Belgium\u2019s federal public prosecutor\u2019s office said the searches were part of \u201ca case of interference, passive corruption and membership of a criminal organisation and relates to indications of Russian interference\u201d. A spokesperson for the prosecutor\u2019s office declined to name the suspect, citing the standard practice of secrecy. Citing sources close to the inquiry, Belgian media named the suspect as Guillaume Pradoura, who they said was the former assistant of Maximilian Krah, the lead candidate for Germany\u2019s Alternative f\u00fcr Deutschland party who recently resigned from the far-right party\u2019s leadership over comments about the SS. He has also been accused of accepting payments for interviews on Voice of Europe, allegations he strongly denies. One of his assistants, Jian Guo, has also been arrested over suspected espionage for China. Pradoura is listed as working for Marcel de Graaff, a Dutch MEP for the far-right Forum for Democracy party. Pradoura and de Graaff did not immediately respond to a request by the Guardian for comment. But in a post on X, de Graaff said he learned of the searches through the media, adding: \u201cI spoke to my employee and he appeared not to be aware of this. The authorities have not contacted me or him. To me this all comes as a complete surprise.\u201d De Graaff added that he personally had no involvement \u201cin any so-called Russian disinformation operation\u201d. Krah has been contacted for comment. After an earlier decision to ban the Voice of Europe from broadcasting, the EU on Monday imposed sanctions on the website, which it said had \u201cengaged in a systematic, international campaign of media manipulation and distortion of facts to destabilise Ukraine, the EU and its member states\u201d. Asset freezes and travel bans were also imposed on two businessmen connected to the site, Artem Marchevskyand Viktor Medvedchuk. Medvedchuk led a pro-Russian political party in Ukraine for years. One senior central European official told the Guardian the Russians were \u201cdefinitely increas[ing] pressure on many fronts\u201d before the European elections. The Voice of Europe was \u201ca kind of instrument through which they have leveraged the influence\u201d, the official said, noting that the operation was \u201csophisticated\u201d and different from usual forms of disinformation. Voice of Europe was used to \u201corganise meetings, or conferences or workshops. So this is quite an elaborate scheme. And it\u2019s not classical disinformation,\u201d the person said. Russia\u2019s goal with these kinds of operations, the official said, was to divide and weaken Europe: \u201cThey need to break the unity around Ukraine, I think that\u2019s something which they are really focused on. \u201cI think their overall goal is basically to split the EU, to create a mess \u2026 because in the mess you can always further your interest more easily.\u201d", "summary": "<p>Parliamentary staffer may have played \u2018significant role\u2019 in alleged payments to MEPs to promote propaganda on Voice of Europe website</p><p>Belgian police have searched the European parliament office and Brussels home of a parliamentary staffer who is believed to have played \u201ca significant role\u201d in a Russian interference operation, the national prosecutor has said.</p><p>French authorities also carried out a search of the employee\u2019s European parliament office in Strasbourg at the request of the Belgian examining magistrate overseeing the inquiry into corruption and Russian interference.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/article/2024/may/29/belgian-police-search-eu-parliament-office-russian-interference\">Continue reading...</a>", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/article/2024/may/29/belgian-police-search-eu-parliament-office-russian-interference", "image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/635e8a2bb8df039669db5470bcdcd1df36e0ac38/737_837_7124_4274/master/7124.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZ", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-05-29 12:57:17", "author": "Jennifer Rankin,Lili Bayer", "authors": ["Jennifer Rankin", "Lili Bayer"], "language": "en", "source_country": "us", "sentiment": 0.051}

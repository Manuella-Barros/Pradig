Verizon Fios has the edge over competing internet service providers in Delaware regarding max upload and download speeds, stable pricing, unlimited data, promotional offers and more. Such perks have earned Verizon Fios the top spot for customer satisfaction in the East region by J.D. Power for 11 consecutive years. Xfinity has the best selection of high-speed internet plans in Delaware, including one of the cheapest broadband options, starting at $25 a month for download speeds up to 200 megabits per second. Breezeline is also a solid choice for cheap internet, with service starting at $30 monthly for speeds up to 100Mbps, but availability is limited in the state. You\u2019ll also find that Xfinity offers the fastest maximum download speeds in Delaware, up to 1,200Mbps, though I\u2019d have to recommend Verizon Fios if you\u2019re looking for gigabit speeds. While Verizon Fios doesn\u2019t have the same max download speed potential (940Mbps), it has much faster max upload speeds (880Mbps compared with 35Mbps) and the reliability advantage of a 100% fiber-optic service.

Other available internet providers in Delaware Bloosurf: Local fixed wireless internet provider Bloosurf is a decent option for home internet in rural and suburban areas around Middletown, Bridgeville, Seaford and Oceanview. At $65 to $150 a month for speeds of 15 to 100Mbps, service is relatively expensive for the speeds you get, so be sure to explore other potential providers before signing up. Breezeline: Cable internet from Breezeline is fast and cheap, with plans starting at $30 a month and max speeds up to 1,000Mbps. Unfortunately, availability is highly limited in Delaware, with only around 4% of residences -- mostly in parts of Middletown, Townsend and Delaware City -- eligible for service.Mediacom: If cable internet from Xfinity is unavailable, Mediacom is likely the other option. Speeds and pricing are on par with other cable providers ($35 to $70 per month for speeds of 100 to 1,000Mbps), but all plans come with a data cap and a $14 modem rental fee.Satellite internet: Over 99% of Delaware has access to a wired or fixed wireless broadband connection (defined as speeds of 25Mbps down, 3Mbps up and higher), so you shouldn\u2019t have to rely on satellite internet service. If satellite is your only practical option, HughesNet and Viasat are almost always available, though Starlink may be the better choice for speed and data. Cheap internet options in Delaware Xfinity\u2019s $25 Connect More plan offers twice the maximum speed of Breezeline's plan and is available to many more households in the state. Keep in mind that renting Wi-Fi equipment may add $15 to your bill, and a term agreement may be required to get the lowest Xfinity price. For those who qualify for the mobile discount, T-Mobile Home Internet has the lowest all-in pricing, including equipment rental, at $30 monthly. Verizon 5G Home Internet isn\u2019t far behind, with speeds of 50 to 300Mbps for the potential all-in cost of $35 a month. Source: CNET analysis of provider data. How to find internet deals and promotions in Delaware The best internet deals and top promotions in Delaware depend on what discounts are available during that time. Most deals are short-lived, but we look frequently for the latest offers. Delaware internet providers, such as Xfinity, may offer lower introductory pricing or promotional offers for a limited time. Many, including Verizon Fios and Mediacom, run the same standard pricing year-round. For a more extensive list of promos, check out our guide on the best internet deals. How fast is Delaware broadband? Recent Ookla speed test data from Q3 2023 ranks Delaware eighth fastest overall among all US states and Washington, DC, with median download speeds of around 222Mbps. That\u2019s faster than the national average (213Mbps) and the neighboring states of Maryland (216Mbps) and Pennsylvania (192Mbps), but just a tick below New Jersey (also around 222Mbps, good for seventh overall). Xfinity is listed as the fastest provider in the state, with median download speeds of 232Mbps, but that\u2019s common for cable internet providers. That said, Xfinity does offer the fastest plan in the state with max download speeds up to 1,200Mbps. Source: CNET analysis of provider data. What\u2019s a good internet speed? Most internet connection plans can now handle basic productivity and communication tasks. If you're looking for an internet plan that can accommodate videoconferencing, streaming video or gaming, you'll have a better experience with a more robust connection. Here's an overview of the recommended minimum download speeds for various applications, according to the FCC. Note that these are only guidelines -- and that internet speed, service and performance vary by connection type, provider and address. For more information, refer to our guide on how much internet speed you really need. 0 to 5Mbps allows you to tackle the basics -- browsing the internet, sending and receiving email, streaming low-quality video.5 to 40Mbps gives you higher-quality video streaming and videoconferencing.40 to 100Mbps should give one person sufficient bandwidth to satisfy the demands of modern telecommuting, video streaming and online gaming. 100 to 500Mbps allows one to two people to simultaneously engage in high-bandwidth activities like videoconferencing, streaming and online gaming. 500 to 1,000Mbps allows three or more people to engage in high-bandwidth activities at the same time. How CNET chose the best internet providers in Delaware Internet service providers are numerous and regional. Unlike the latest smartphone, laptop, router or kitchen tool, it\u2019s impractical to personally test every ISP in a given city. So what\u2019s our approach? We start by researching the pricing, availability and speed information drawing on our own historical ISP data, the provider sites and mapping information from the Federal Communications Commission at FCC.gov. But it doesn\u2019t end there. We go to the FCC\u2019s website to check our data and ensure we consider every ISP that provides service in an area. We also input local addresses on provider websites to find specific options for residents. We look at sources, including the American Customer Satisfaction Index and J.D. Power, to evaluate how happy customers are with an ISP\u2019s service. ISP plans and prices are subject to frequent changes; all information provided is accurate as of publication. Once we have this localized information, we ask three main questions: Does the provider offer access to reasonably fast internet speeds?Do customers get decent value for what they\u2019re paying?Are customers happy with their service? While the answer to those questions is often layered and complex, the providers who come closest to \u201cyes\u201d on all three are the ones we recommend. When selecting the cheapest internet service, we look for the plans with the lowest monthly fee, though we also factor in things like price increases, equipment fees and contracts. Choosing the fastest internet service is relatively straightforward. We look at advertised upload and download speeds and consider real-world speed data from sources like Ookla and FCC reports. What\u2019s the final word on internet providers in Delaware? A fiber internet connection is often preferred, especially regarding the speeds, stable pricing, added perks and high customer satisfaction of Verizon Fios. As such, Verizon Fios is CNET\u2019s top pick for home internet in Delaware, even though it isn\u2019t the outright cheapest, fastest or most widely available provider in the state. Breezeline offers the cheapest internet plan in Delaware, starting at $20 monthly, but availability is limited. Xfinity has the next cheapest plan at $25 for speeds up to 200Mbps, not to mention the fastest max speed (1,200Mbps) and the best availability of any non-satellite provider in the state. Wireless internet from T-Mobile Home Internet and Verizon 5G Home Internet is another practical option for broadband service. The low pricing and simple service terms make for an enticing alternative to traditional fiber and cable internet services, even if wireless internet lacks the same speed potential.

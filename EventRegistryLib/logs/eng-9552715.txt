The Washington Examiner reported extensively on the charity's lack of financial transparency and ethical problems, prompting state and federal investigations. The charity and its ex-board secretary, Shalomyah Bowers, were accused in a September 2022 lawsuit by a group called BLM Grassroots of fraudulently siphoning off $10 million from supporters, though the lawsuit was dismissed last year.\n\nBLMGNF co-founder Patrisse Cullors resigned from the group in 2021 after legal scrutiny over her lavish real estate purchases, including a $6 million Los Angeles mansion where Cullors hosted parties.\n\nIn the newly filed lawsuit, BLMGNF said the Tides Foundation has refused to transfer it millions of dollars that Tides had pledged to turn over. The Tides Foundation, BLMGNF argued in the complaint, engaged in fraud and funneled BLMGNF's funds elsewhere instead of to a \"collective action fund\" intended for BLMGNF.\n\nFeatured Local Savings\n\nThe Tides Foundation said in a statement that the complaint's allegations are \"completely false.\"\n\n\"Resources in the Black Lives Matter [collective action fund] were never intended to be granted to large, well-funded national organizations like Black Lives Matter Global Network Foundation, and were always intended to be granted to local Black Lives Matter chapters,\" the group said. \"BLMGNF's lawsuit seeks to circumvent the intent of the Fund's donors and deprive grassroots Black Lives Matter chapters critical resources, for its own benefit.\"\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM THE WASHINGTON EXAMINER\n\nThe lawsuit comes as the Tides Foundation and its affiliates come under fire for funding protests across the United States that are hostile to Israel after it was attacked by Hamas terrorists on Oct. 7 of last year.\n\n\"There is an expectation for Black Lives Matter to challenge systems, break barriers and uphold the truth, no matter how uncomfortable,\" BLMGNF said in a statement. \"Today, that extends into nonprofit operations as we call out Tides Foundation and other so-called 'fiscal sponsors' who exploit their role.\"\n\nSign Up for Springs AM Update Your morning rundown of the latest news from Colorado Springs and around the country\n\nSign Up View all of our newsletters.

(BLMGNF) is suing its former partner, the Tides Foundation, claiming the fund has not delivered on more than $33 million in donations promised to the social activist group, the New York Post first reported.\n\nThe 285-page lawsuit filed in Los Angeles County Superior Court on Monday stated that Tides \"has engaged in deceptive business practices and has operated in a quasi-banking capacity without appropriate regulatory oversight or licenses.\"\n\nThe Tides Foundation, a left-wing nonprofit founded in 1976, states their mission is to shift \"power and resources to communities that have historically been denied both to unlock transformative change.\" The complaint noted that Tides manages over $1.4 billion in assets, more than many regulated community banks, yet operates without safeguards.\n\nIn a statement to the Post, BLMGNF said it \"never expected to become victims of ... unscrupulous business practices\" in its social justice movement.\n\n\"There is an expectation for Black Lives Matter to challenge systems, break barriers, and uphold the truth, no matter how uncomfortable,\" the statement said. \"Today, that extends into non-profit operations as we call out Tides Foundation and other so-called 'fiscal sponsors' who exploit their role.\"\n\nThe complaint stated that following the death of George Floyd in 2020, BLMGNF received tens of millions in donations and contacted Tides to help manage the influx of funds until they were able to obtain tax-exempt status from the IRS.\n\nThe lawsuit alleges Tides has refused to return the $33 million collected and instead has sent some of the funds to other BLM chapters without BLMGNF's permission.\n\nTides denied the allegations saying in a statement.\n\n\"Resources in the Black Lives Matter Support Fund were never intended to be granted to large, well-funded national organizations like Black Lives Matter Global Network Foundation and were always intended to be granted to local Black Lives Matter chapters,\" the statement read.\n\n\"We are deeply disappointed that it has reached this stage, and that the actions of BLMGNF leaders continue to prevent us from granting funds to Black-led and Black-serving organizations that need it.\n\n\"We are confident we have done everything in our power to uphold our fiduciary commitment and responsibility to act in accordance with the intent of the fund.\"\n\nEarlier in the week, Politico reported that Tides, which is heavily funded by George Soros' Open Society Foundation, has also been backing the pro-Palestinian protests that have roiled college campuses over the past two weeks.\n\nTides issued a statement to the outlet regarding their funding of the recent Columbia University protests saying it is \"committed to advancing social justice,\" adding its \"community of fiscally sponsored projects, donors, and grantees represent a wide range of perspectives on what social justice looks like.\"\n\nJames Morley III \u2709 James

Tides, however, contests this by claiming that donations to the fund were actually intended for smaller BLM organizations.\n\n\"Resources in the Black Lives Matter Support Fund were never intended to be granted to large, well-funded national organizations like Black Lives Matter Global Network Foundation, and were always intended to be granted to local Black Lives Matter chapters,\" Tides told the Daily Caller News Foundation. (RELATED: Black Lives Matter PAC Spent Most Of Its Money In 2023 Paying Its Own Treasurer For 'Consulting')\n\nThe Tides Center, which is affiliated with the Tides Foundation, previously served as the fiscal sponsor of BLM GNF, allowing the BLM group to accept tax-exempt donations without registering with the Internal Revenue Service. The two groups ended their relationship in December 2020.\n\n\"While the Black Lives Matter Foundation seeks to recover its funds unjustly held by the Tides Foundation, our legal challenge extends beyond this specific issue,\" BLM GNF told the DCNF. \"We aim to establish new rules for Tides and all fiscal sponsors, who operate like unlicensed banks, handling huge donations in ways that blur the lines of legal and fiscal sponsorship without proper oversight,\" they continued.\n\nBLM GNF alleges that Tides entered an oral contract with it stipulating that money donated to the fund would eventually be transferred to them. The organization also accuses Tides of unjustly skimming money off their donations by charging service fees.\n\n\"Tides assesses fees under its agreements with these organizations, including charging a significant percentage for each contribution dedicated to BLM GNF,\" according to the lawsuit.\n\nTides charges \"exorbitant fees to Black and Brown\" nonprofits, according to the suit, which BLM GNF argues is illegal because the fees \"equate to high interest rate fees similar to commercial bank fees\" and \"Tides is not organized for the purpose of engaging in the commercial banking business.\"\n\nThe lawsuit claims this constitutes Tides financially benefiting at the expense of BLM GNF as well as \"the communities it serves.\"\n\nBLM GNF is seeking $33.4 million in damages from Tides through its lawsuit.\n\n\"We are deeply disappointed that it has reached this stage, and that the actions of BLMGNF leaders continue to prevent us from granting funds to Black-led and Black-serving organizations that need it,\" Tides said in its statement to the DCNF.\n\nBLM GNF has its own history of alleged financial mismanagement. The organization fell under scrutiny in 2022 when it used charitable funds to purchase a 6,500-square-foot $6 million mansion in Southern California.\n\nBLM GNF was deeply involved in the racial justice movement that sprung up after the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis, Minnesota, in May 2020. After receiving a deluge of donations following Floyd's death, the organization doled out millions of dollars in grants to aid local BLM chapters and other racial justice activist groups.\n\nThe riots cause over $1 billion in damages, resulting in between $1 billion and $2 billion in paid insurance claims, according to Axios. A total of 24 people died during the Floyd riots.\n\nAll content created by the Daily Caller News Foundation, an independent and nonpartisan newswire service, is available without charge to any legitimate news publisher that can provide a large audience.

Jason Smith (R-MO) on Monday morning demanded answers from the president and CEO of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and from the president of the affiliated U.S. Chamber of Commerce Foundation to in-depth questions about donations the Chamber's foundation received from the Tides Foundation based on an exclusive report from Breitbart News earlier this year.\n\n\"Tax-exempt organizations like the Chamber of Commerce have operated without sufficient oversight for far too long,\" Smith, the author of the letter to both entities and chairman of the powerful tax committee, told Breitbart News exclusively. \"The Chamber -- which claims to stand for the interests of Main Street job creators -- must explain why it received millions of dollars in donations from an organization whose stated mission is to undermine small businesses in the United States. We have a duty to the American taxpayer to demand transparency and ensure tax-exempt organizations are operating in pursuit of the stated purpose for which they were organized under the tax code.\"\n\n05.06.2024 U.S. Chamber of Commerce Letter v4[2] by Breitbart News on Scribd\n\nFor whatever it's worth, it's not like Smith is some radically right-wing Republican who the Chamber of Commerce despises or something. Just a few months ago, he negotiated a bipartisan tax reform deal with Senate Finance Chairman Sen. Ron Wyden (D-OR) that the Chamber of Commerce wholeheartedly publicly endorsed in a glowing January statement saying it \"applauds\" Smith and Wyden for their work.\n\nThe three-page Monday morning letter from Smith to Chamber of Commerce president and CEO Suzanne Clark and to Chamber of Commerce Foundation president Carolyn Cawley provides the supposedly pro-business entities with a two-week deadline of May 20, 2024, at the close of business to answer in-depth questions about the suspect donations.\n\nSmith opens the letter, also obtained exclusively by Breitbart News ahead of its public release, by detailing efforts his committee has undertaken this Congress to investigate \"the growth of the tax-exempt sector established under Section 501(c) of the Internal Revenue Code.\"\n\n\"Throughout the 118th Congress, the Committee on Ways and Means has been investigating the growth of the tax-exempt sector established under Section 501(c) of the Internal Revenue Code,\" Smith writes. \"In April 2023, the Committee held a hearing on tax-exempt hospitals and the community benefit standard. In August 2023, the Committee published an open letter requesting information on tax-exempt organizations focused on potential violations of rules regarding political activities, inappropriate use of charitable funds, and concerns about foreign sources of funding. In December 2023, the Committee's Oversight Subcommittee held a hearing on the growth of the tax-exempt sector and its impact on the American political system.\"\n\nThe Ways and Means Committee, of course, oversees tax law and the IRS so this is an extremely serious matter that could have major implications for the Chamber of Commerce and its affiliated foundation and for any members of or donors to either institution -- which Smith notes in the next paragraph.\n\n\"These activities helped inform the Committee about the functioning of the sector and raised numerous concerns about activities of tax-exempt organizations like yours,\" Smith writes. \"Specifically, we are concerned about recent public reporting regarding the U.S. Chamber of Commerce Foundation (USCCF). The USCCF is tax-exempt under section 501(c)(3) and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce (USCC) is tax-exempt under section 501(c)(6).\"\n\nNext up, Smith cites a late March 2024 exclusive report from Breitbart News citing tax documents that showed the U.S. Chamber of Commerce Foundation accepted more than $12 million across several donations over the past few years from an organization called the Tides Foundation. The Tides Foundation is funded in part by liberal billionaire George Soros.\n\n\"The public reports at issue indicate that the USCCF has received over $12 million in funding from the Tides Foundation, a left-leaning organization that partners with and sponsors groups that advocate for policies that would harm the American business community,\" Smith writes, with a footnote citing the Breitbart News exclusive from late March.\n\nSmith notes in the next sentences of this paragraph that these donations in question raise serious concerns about the tax-exempt statuses of both the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and its affiliated foundation, and whether the organizations are running afoul of their intended purposes for which they were granted such status to instead pursue some twisted leftist political agenda on behalf of Soros and the Tides Foundation.\n\n\"Contrary to the USCC's stated mission of improving lives 'by advancing American business' and advocating 'for policies that help businesses create jobs and grow our economy,' it seems odd that the foundation would accept funding from a group like the Tides Foundation, which is so focused on activities that seem counter to USCC's mission,\" Smith writes. \"Furthermore, these reports raise concerns about how the USCC and USCCF are using their tax-exempt status.\"\n\nIn the next two paragraphs of the letter, Smith details how the Tides Foundation -- the Soros-funded group in question -- has a mission with a stated purpose that is at odds with the stated purposes of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and its affiliated foundation.\n\n\"According to the Tides Foundation's website, they work with 'foundations who share our vision' and help their foundation partners '[c]ollaborate with like-minded funders to fuel social movements and transform policy,'\" Smith writes. \"The Tides Foundation says that their vision is 'that a just and equitable future can exist only when communities who have been historically denied power have the social, political, and economic power they need to create it.' The Tides Foundation partners with and sponsors several anti-business organizations that seem to directly contradict the USCC's stated mission. One example of an anti-business Tides Foundation supported project is the International Corporate Accountability Roundtable (ICAR). In December 2023, ICAR published a report titled Building a Rights-Based Economy: A Corporate Accountability Agenda. In this report, ICAR said '[t]ransnational corporations with intentionally complex, opaque supply chains are able to conceal systematic wage theft, forced labor, and attacks against human rights defenders' and 'companies that pay little to nothing in federal income taxes go on to spend hundreds of millions of dollars on lobbying for their interests.'\"\n\nIn the next couple paragraphs, Smith asks several questions and then specifically says that the Chamber and its foundation are under investigation for their tax-exempt status.\n\n\"Does USCC share the vision of the Tides Foundation? If not, why would USCC accept funds from a group so opposed to its mission? Or perhaps the better question is why would the Tides Foundation think that this donation would advance its interests?\" Smith writes. \"These reports are concerning because the Committee is evaluating whether tax-exempt organizations like USCC and USCCF are operating for the exempt purposes that allowed them to obtain tax-exempt status. Additionally, the Committee is concerned about whether donors to, and members of, organizations like yours have sufficient awareness of how their money is being spent.\"\n\nAfter that, Smith then gives the deadline of 5 p.m. on May 20 for Clark and Cawley to answer the committee's detailed questions which follow that paragraph. The specific five questions that Clark and Cawley are told to answer in the next two weeks are as follows:\n\nIt is unclear if the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and its affiliated foundation will cooperate with the investigation. Sometimes entities that receive document and question requests like this do cooperate and answer them by their deadlines, and other times they do not cooperate. If the entities do not end up cooperating, the Ways and Means Committee has the authority and power to then subpoena them and compel cooperation.\n\nThe significance of this moment -- where a very serious Republican-led congressional committee is formally investigating the U.S. Chamber of Commerce -- cannot be understated. Relations between the Chamber and congressional Republicans have been getting much icier in recent years, as Breitbart News has documented repeatedly, but this is a whole new level of break between the GOP and the business community. It's worth noting that just a few years ago right before he became Speaker of the House now former House Speaker Paul Ryan was chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, the exact committee now investigating the Chamber of Commerce. It's hard to see Ryan ever doing something like what Smith is doing, so this represents a very clear shift among Republicans towards economic populist nationalism and away from the globalist international corporatist days of the past.\n\nCorporate America and Republicans have been growing further and further apart in the past few years, especially with the rise of former President Donald Trump in 2016. Trump, of course, is the presumptive GOP nominee for president again for the third straight presidential election -- meaning he has been leading the party for about a decade now -- and while he won in 2016 he did throughout his first term in office do some things with the business community, the two sides have definitely drifted further and further apart during that time and since Trump left office in early 2021. The New York Times' Jonathan Swan reported in a recent TikTok video for the Times that he expects if Trump wins again in November the rift will widen even more, and these trends of turning against big business across the Republican Party will continue to accelerate.\n\nSwan noted in the video that several major events in recent years have exacerbated the divorce between corporations and Republicans, culminating with companies committing what Trump and his allies view as the \"ultimate betrayal\" which was the pulling back of donations to Republicans from corporations:\n\nOf course, at the forefront of this political shift from corporate America was the Chamber of Commerce. As Breitbart News reported back in September 2020 -- when Trump was still president -- the Chamber of Commerce directly endorsed dozens of Democrats running for Congress in key swing districts. This push, a hard break from the Chamber's normal activity, was led as Breitbart News reported at the time by a man named Neil Bradley. Bradley, a former staffer for former Sen. Tom Coburn (R-OK), by this time had come to the U.S. Chamber as an executive vice president and chief policy officer. As Breitbart News later reported, Republicans on Capitol Hill began referring to Bradley as \"Kneel Bradley,\" a play on the spelling of his name of course referencing sports stars who were kneeling during the national anthem as a form of leftist pro-Democrat protest like the kind of leftism Bradley was facilitating at the Chamber.\n\nThe launch of this investigations comes at perhaps the worst possible time for Clark, Cawley, the Chamber, and its affiliated foundation. The news is breaking as the Chamber of Commerce is holding a major event in downtown Washington DC commencing Monday morning and continuing for the next three days. The event, the Chamber's 14th annual China Business Conference, is one the organization has aggressively publicly promoted on social media:\n\nAt the event, speakers according to the website will include of course the Chamber's Bradley but also several top Democrats including many top officials from Democrat President Joe Biden's current administration as well as other globalists like the president of the Council on Foreign Relations Michael Froman, WestExec's Michele Flournoy who worked at the same firm connected to Secretary of State Antony Blinken, former CIA director Michael Morrell, and many more. Some Republicans, like Rep. John Moolenaar (R-MI), are also listed to speak at this event, so there will probably be awkward interactions at the Chamber's gathering between them and the globalists now in charge of the Chamber as this formal Ways and Means Committee investigation into the Chamber's tax status commences. Top business leaders set to speak there like Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger might even face questions about why they are associating with a group under investigation like this. Dues-paying member corporations who attend the event may also have questions about why the Ways and Means Committee is investigating the organization now.", "source": {"uri": "breitbart.com",

The Washington Examiner reported extensively on the charity's lack of financial transparency and ethical problems, prompting state and federal investigations. The charity and its ex-board secretary, Shalomyah Bowers, were accused in a September 2022 lawsuit by a group called BLM Grassroots of fraudulently siphoning off $10 million from supporters, though the lawsuit was dismissed last year.\n\nBLMGNF co-founder Patrisse Cullors resigned from the group in 2021 after legal scrutiny over her lavish real estate purchases, including a $6 million Los Angeles mansion where Cullors hosted parties.\n\nIn the newly filed lawsuit, BLMGNF said the Tides Foundation has refused to transfer it millions of dollars that Tides had pledged to turn over. The Tides Foundation, BLMGNF argued in the complaint, engaged in fraud and funneled BLMGNF's funds elsewhere instead of to a \"collective action fund\" intended for BLMGNF.\n\nThe Tides Foundation said in a statement that the complaint's allegations are \"completely false.\"\n\n\"Resources in the Black Lives Matter [collective action fund] were never intended to be granted to large, well-funded national organizations like Black Lives Matter Global Network Foundation, and were always intended to be granted to local Black Lives Matter chapters,\" the group said. \"BLMGNF's lawsuit seeks to circumvent the intent of the Fund's donors and deprive grassroots Black Lives Matter chapters critical resources, for its own benefit.\"\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM THE WASHINGTON EXAMINER\n\nThe lawsuit comes as the Tides Foundation and its affiliates come under fire for funding protests across the United States that are hostile to Israel after it was attacked by Hamas terrorists on Oct. 7 of last year.\n\n\"There is an expectation for Black Lives Matter to challenge systems, break barriers and uphold the truth, no matter how uncomfortable,\" BLMGNF said in a statement. \"Today, that extends into nonprofit operations as we call out Tides Foundation and other so-called 'fiscal sponsors' who exploit their role.\"", "source": {"uri": "washingtonexaminer.com", "dataType": "news",

Tides, however, contests this by claiming that donations to the fund were actually intended for smaller BLM organizations.\n\n\"Resources in the Black Lives Matter Support Fund were never intended to be granted to large, well-funded national organizations like Black Lives Matter Global Network Foundation, and were always intended to be granted to local Black Lives Matter chapters,\" Tides told the Daily Caller News Foundation.\n\nThe Tides Center, which is affiliated with the Tides Foundation, previously served as the fiscal sponsor of BLM GNF, allowing the BLM group to accept tax-exempt donations without registering with the Internal Revenue Service. The two groups ended their relationship in December 2020.\n\n\"While the Black Lives Matter Foundation seeks to recover its funds unjustly held by the Tides Foundation, our legal challenge extends beyond this specific issue,\" BLM GNF told the DCNF. \"We aim to establish new rules for Tides and all fiscal sponsors, who operate like unlicensed banks, handling huge donations in ways that blur the lines of legal and fiscal sponsorship without proper oversight,\" they continued.\n\nBLM GNF alleges that Tides entered an oral contract with it stipulating that money donated to the fund would eventually be transferred to them. The organization also accuses Tides of unjustly skimming money off their donations by charging service fees.\n\n\"Tides assesses fees under its agreements with these organizations, including charging a significant percentage for each contribution dedicated to BLM GNF,\" according to the lawsuit.\n\nTides charges \"exorbitant fees to Black and Brown\" nonprofits, according to the suit, which BLM GNF argues is illegal because the fees \"equate to high interest rate fees similar to commercial bank fees\" and \"Tides is not organized for the purpose of engaging in the commercial banking business.\"\n\nThe lawsuit claims this constitutes Tides financially benefiting at the expense of BLM GNF as well as \"the communities it serves.\"\n\nBLM GNF is seeking $33.4 million in damages from Tides through its lawsuit.\n\n\"We are deeply disappointed that it has reached this stage, and that the actions of BLMGNF leaders continue to prevent us from granting funds to Black-led and Black-serving organizations that need it,\" Tides said in its statement to the DCNF.\n\nBLM GNF has its own history of alleged financial mismanagement. The organization fell under scrutiny in 2022 when it used charitable funds to purchase a 6,500-square-foot $6 million mansion in Southern California.\n\nBLM GNF was deeply involved in the racial justice movement that sprung up after the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis, Minnesota, in May 2020. After receiving a deluge of donations following Floyd's death, the organization doled out millions of dollars in grants to aid local BLM chapters and other racial justice activist groups.", "source": {"uri": "dailycallernewsfoundation.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "dailycallernewsfoundation.org"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tides_Foundation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tides Foundation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Lives_Matter", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Black Lives Matter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Lives_Matter_Global_Network_Foundation", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Black Lives Matter Global Network Foundation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawsuit", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Lawsuit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modern_liberalism_in_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Modern liberalism in the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tax_exemption", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tax exemption"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commercial_bank", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Commercial bank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internal_Revenue_Service", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Internal Revenue Service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Floyd", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "George Floyd"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-racism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Anti-racism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Damages", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Damages"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonprofit_organization", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nonprofit organization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brown_University", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Brown University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interest_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Interest rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_California", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Southern California"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minneapolis", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Minneapolis"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Minneapolis"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Holidays/Thanksgiving", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Holidays/Thanksgiving", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/In_Daily_Life", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/In Daily Life", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 87}], "image": null, "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9552715", "eventUri": "eng-9552715", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2020-12-", "textStart": 1110, "textEnd": 1123}, {"amb": false, "date": "2020-05-", "textStart": 3081, "textEnd": 3089}], "sentiment": 0.2078431372549019, "wgt": 184, "relevance": 1}

In addition to BLMGNF and other BLM groups, it manages donations for pro-Palestinian groups that have supported anti-Israel protests across the country.\n\nBillionaire George Soros and his son Alex Soros have funneled nearly $14 million from their Open Society Foundations to Tides, which sponsor activist groups including the pro-Palestinian Adalah Justice Project and others fueling campus protests.\n\n\"Tides has engaged in deceptive business practices and has operated in a quasi-banking capacity without appropriate regulatory oversight of licenses,\" the BLMGNF lawsuit says. \"Tides operates with a level of autonomy and minimal regulatory scrutiny that is starkly at odds with the regulatory framework imposed on traditional financial institutions.\"\n\nAccording to the lawsuit, Tide has more than $1.4 billion in assets and allegedly acts as a bank -- only without banking regulations.\n\nBLMGNF, the national organization of the civil rights movement founded in 2017, took in tens of millions in donations after the death of George Floyd in 2020. At the time the group did not have tax-exempt status from the IRS, and approached the Tides Foundation to help it manage the flood of cash.\n\nTides, which takes a percentage of donations to manage a group's funds, gave verbal assurances that it would return the collected money once BLMGNF received tax-exempt status, the lawsuit claims.\n\nIn the meantime, it managed donations in a \"collective action fund\" that would be accessible to BLMGNF, according to the lawsuit.\n\nBLMGNF ended its relationship with Tides in 2022, and Tides has refused to hand over the cash -- totaling some $33 million -- the complaint says.\n\nInstead, Tides, which takes between 3 and 9% of the donations it processes, has sent part of the funds to other BLM groups without the permission of BLMGNF, the lawsuit says.\n\nOn June 9, 2022, a Tides official said Tides had transferred $7.4 million from the collective fund back to BLMGNF. Instead, it sent part of the cash -- $4.75 million -- to an unaffiliated BLM chapter in Oklahoma City, the lawsuit says.\n\n\"It is unclear why such a large amount would have been granted to a single city's BLM chapter,\" the lawsuit says.\n\nIn a statement to The Post Wednesday, a spokeswoman for Tides Foundation called the allegations in the complaint \"completely false.\"\n\n\"Resources in the Black Lives Matter [collective action fund] were never intended to be granted to large, well-funded national organizations like Black Lives Matter Global Network Foundation, and were always intended to be granted to local Black Lives Matter chapters,\" the Tides statement says. \"BLMGNF's lawsuit seeks to circumvent the intent of the Fund's donors and deprive grassroots Black Lives Matter chapters critical resources, for its own benefit.\"\n\nWhile Tides' web site mentions that it offers \"grant management,\" an attorney for BLMGNF said in a statement to The Post that Tides was not authorized to dole out donations earmarked for BLMGNF to offshoot groups or local chapters.\n\nTides said that it had granted $12.6 million from the Support Fund to groups, including BLM Grassroots, a breakaway group helmed by activist Melina Abdullah.\n\nShe tried to collect $10 million from BLMGNF in a \"frivolous lawsuit\" for her breakaway BLM Grassroots. Abdullah -- who is running as independent candidate Cornel West's running mate in the US presidential election -- lost the lawsuit last year and was ordered to pay more than $700,000 in BLMGNF'S legal fees and costs.\n\nAn attorney for BLMGNF cited a June ruling by a Los Angeles Superior Court judge who dismissed BLM Grassroots' claims to any of BLMGNF's donations.\n\n\"This lawsuit against the Tides Foundation is not just about financial discrepancies but the principle of rightful ownership and transparency that should govern partnerships in social justice funding,\" said attorney Byron McLain Wednesday.\n\nIn a statement to The Post, BLMGNF said they \"never expected to become victims of...unscrupulous business practices\" in social justice philanthropy.\n\n\"There is an expectation for Black Lives Matter to challenge systems, break barriers and uphold the truth, no matter how uncomfortable,\" the statement said. \"Today, that extends into non-profit operations as we call out Tides Foundation and other so-called 'fiscal sponsors' who exploit their role.\"\n\nBLMGNF has had its own issues with finances, after raking in $90 million in donations for 2020 alone.\n\nPatrisse Cullors, the group's co-founder, then went on a multi-million dollar home buying spree, purchasing two homes in Los Angeles and a property in the Atlanta suburbs with an airplane hangar and runway, as first revealed by The Post.\n\nCullors denied that she used donations to buy the properties. She resigned from BLMGNF a month later, in May 2021.\n\nCullors also signed off on a $6 million Los Angeles mansion, to be used as an office for BLMGNF, and an $8 million property in Toronto for the

Established in 2017 to center Black political advocacy and invest in Black communities, the organization didn't have tax-exempt status. As a result, it enlisted the Tides Foundation, a left-leaning donor advised fund based in San Francisco, to help it accept donations, \"parking\" the funds with Tides.\n\nBlack Lives Matter said in its lawsuit that the Tides Foundation gave oral promises that the funds would be available to Black Lives Matter, as soon as it received its tax-exempt status. BLM ended its relationship with Tides in 2022, according to the complaint, and Tides has refused to transfer millions of dollars in funds to BLM, according to the complaint.\n\nTides manages over $1.4 billion in assets -- more than many regulated community banks -- allegedly acting like a bank without licensing, while preying on Black- and Brown-led organizations, according to the complaint filed Monday by the Black Lives Matter Global Network Foundation Inc. in California Superior Court, Los Angeles County.\n\nIn a 2020 oral contract, Tides led the nonprofit to believe that donations solicited toward a \"collective action fund\" were meant for BLM GNF and would be easily and readily available for distribution toward Black causes at the nonprofit's request. Instead, Tides deliberately sent part of the funds to third-party organizations without BLM GNF's authorization, the complaint said.\n\nAmong the accounting errors listed in the complaint is a mistaken $4.75 million grant to BLM - Oklahoma City -- which a Tides director had communicated as a transfer of $7.4 million to BLM GNF.\n\n\"Such inference of mistake is supported by the fact that the entries are directly next to one another alphabetically,\" the complaint said.\n\nTides didn't immediately respond to a request for comment. BLM GNF seeks at least $33.4 million in damages.\n\nBLM GNF's finances have been under scrutiny for years, with allegations that leaders purchased a $6 million house using donations kicking off fraud claims in California state court.\n\nTides benefits at the expense of Black and Brown-led charitable organizations, whose assets the fund holds, by charging donors a disproportionately large percentage for each contribution in fees, according to the complaint. It charges these tax code Section 501(c)(3) organizations \"exorbitant fees\" equivalent to high interest rate fees, in violation of California financial law, because Tides isn't organized as a bank, the suit said.\n\nThe complaint said it aims \"to ensure that nonprofits like Tides operate with the same integrity and scrutiny expected of traditional financial institutions.\"\n\nFoley & Lardner LLP and Segal Law Group represent Black Lives Matter Global Network Foundation Inc.", "source": {"uri": "news.bloomberglaw.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "news.bloomberglaw.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tides_Foundation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tides Foundation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Lives_Matter", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Black Lives Matter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Lives_Matter_Global_Network_Foundation", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Black Lives Matter Global Network Foundation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tax_exemption", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Tax exemption"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder_of_George_Floyd", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Murder of George Floyd"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonprofit_organization", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nonprofit organization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawsuit", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lawsuit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Left-wing_politics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Left-wing politics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "San Francisco"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "San Francisco"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California_superior_courts", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "California superior courts"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oral_contract", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Oral contract"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_County,_California", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles County, California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles County, California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/501(c)(3)_organization", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "501(c)(3) organization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tax_law", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tax law"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Damages", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Damages"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charitable_organization", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Charitable organization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interest_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Interest rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fraud", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fraud"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oklahoma_City", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Oklahoma City"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Oklahoma City"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance/Money_Management", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance/Money Management", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Holidays/Thanksgiving", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Holidays/Thanksgiving", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 87}], "image": "https://db0ip7zd23b50.cloudfront.net/dims4/default/8cc0021/2147483647/crop/3999x1536%2B0%2B543/resize/1919x740%3E/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbloomberg-bna-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F01%2F6e%2F25789d6b457192cda1a7d60aaaed%2Fblacklivesmatter.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9552715", "eventUri": "eng-9552715", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.003921568627450966, "wgt": 177, "relevance": 1}

The lawsuit, filed in California Superior Court in Los Angeles County, accuses Tides of fraud and withholding over $33 million in donations intended for BLMGNF.\n\nAccording to the detailed 285-page complaint submitted on Monday, the Tides Foundation, which has been operational since 1976, is alleged to have breached its fiduciary duties by diverting funds meant for BLMGNF to other groups, including a radical faction led by anti-police activist Melina Abdullah, as was noted in the Post report. Abdullah's group, which previously engaged in a legal dispute with BLMGNF described as \"frivolous\" by BLMGNF's attorney, reportedly received funding from the pool of donations under contentious circumstances.\n\nTides Foundation, with offices in Los Angeles and San Francisco, functions as a fiscal sponsor -- a role that involves managing donations on behalf of organizations that may lack 501(c)(3) tax-exempt status. This model is common in the nonprofit sector to facilitate funding for smaller or emerging groups. However, the information provided in the Post report said the lawsuit claims that Tides has failed to operate within the bounds of this role responsibly, accusing it of \"engaging in deceptive business practices\" and operating in a \"quasi-banking capacity\" without the necessary regulatory oversight.\n\nFurther complicating the scenario is the involvement of high-profile donors like billionaire George Soros and his son Alex Soros, whose Open Society Foundations have reportedly channeled nearly $14 million to Tides. The report in the Post also affirmed that some of these funds were directed to activist groups such as the Adalah Justice Project, which has been actively involved in anti-Israel protests across the United States, highlighting the political and ideological complexities interwoven with the fiscal management allegations.\n\nBLMGNF, established in 2017 and becoming a focal point for donations following the 2020 death of George Floyd, approached Tides Foundation during a period when it did not yet have IRS tax-exempt status. Indicated in the Post report was that Tides, a nonprofit that specializes in managing funds for various advocacy and charitable groups, was to act as a fiscal intermediary, handling the surge in contributions BLMGNF received amid widespread calls for social justice and police reform.\n\nAccording to the lawsuit, Tides, which controls assets totaling more than $1.4 billion, operates by taking a percentage of the donations it manages -- ranging from 3% to 9%. BLMGNF claims that it was verbally assured by Tides that the funds would be returned once BLMGNF secured its tax-exempt status, as was explained in the Post report. The funds were to be held in a \"collective action fund\" that ostensibly remained accessible to BLMGNF.\n\nThe relationship between BLMGNF and Tides Foundation soured and eventually ended in 2022. Despite the severance of ties, Tides has allegedly not complied with returning the remaining funds, which amount to some $33 million. The lawsuit highlights a specific incident where Tides reportedly misdirected funds: on June 9, 2022, Tides officials claimed they had transferred $7.4 million from the collective fund back to BLMGNF. However, the Post reported that BLMGNF has alleged that Tides instead sent $4.75 million to an unaffiliated BLM chapter in Oklahoma City, a move that BLMGNF claims was unauthorized and lacks transparency.\n\nThe lawsuit raises significant questions about the ethical management of nonprofit funds, particularly in how Tides has functioned akin to a bank but without adhering to the stringent regulations that govern financial institutions. This lack of regulatory oversight is central to BLMGNF's allegations of \"deceptive business practices\" against Tides.\n\nIn response to these allegations, a spokeswoman for the Tides Foundation firmly dismissed the claims, characterizing them as \"completely false.\" The Post reported that according to Tides, the funds in question, collected under the Black Lives Matter collective action fund, were specifically intended for distribution to local Black Lives Matter chapters rather than to large, national entities like BLMGNF. \"Resources in the Black Lives Matter [collective action fund] were never intended to be granted to large, well-funded national organizations like Black Lives Matter Global Network Foundation, and were always intended to be granted to local Black Lives Matter chapters,\" the Tides statement explained. They argue that BLMGNF's legal action aims to redirect resources away from grassroots operations, which would counter the original intent of the donors.\n\nOn the other side of this legal battle, an attorney for BLMGNF, Byron McLain, stated that Tides overstepped its bounds by reallocating funds earmarked for BLMGNF to other groups or local chapters without proper authorization, as per the information provided in the Post report.\n\nFurther complicating the situation is the involvement of BLM Grassroots, a breakaway faction led by activist Melina Abdullah, who previously engaged in legal action against BLMGNF. The report in the Post also revealed that Tides disclosed that it had allocated $12.6 million from the Support Fund to various groups, including BLM Grassroots. Abdullah's prior lawsuit against BLMGNF, which sought $10 million, was dismissed as \"frivolous,\" and she was subsequently ordered to cover more than $700,000 in legal fees and costs for BLMGNF.\n\nThis legal tangle is underscored by a June ruling from a Los Angeles Superior Court judge, which dismissed the claims of BLM Grassroots to any of BLMGNF's donations. The Post reported that McLain emphasized that the ongoing lawsuit against Tides encompasses more than financial discrepancies; it is fundamentally about \"the principle of rightful ownership and transparency that should govern partnerships in social justice funding.\"\n\n\"There is an expectation for Black Lives Matter to challenge systems, break barriers and uphold the truth, no matter how uncomfortable,\" BLMGNF stated. \"Today, that extends into non-profit operations as we call out Tides Foundation and other so-called 'fiscal sponsors' who exploit their role.\" The Post reported this accusation comes at a time when BLMGNF itself is under scrutiny over how it managed a significant influx of donations following the global response to racial injustice sparked by the death of George Floyd in 2020.\n\nBLMGNF, which brought in an astounding $90 million in donations during 2020, has faced its share of internal financial controversies. Notably, co-founder Patrisse Cullors was implicated in a personal spending scandal involving the purchase of high-value properties. According to the Post report, these acquisitions included two homes in Los Angeles and a substantial property in the Atlanta suburbs, complete with an airplane hangar and runway. These revelations, first brought to light by The Post, have stirred significant public and media scrutiny.\n\nCullors has consistently denied using BLMGNF donations to fund these purchases. Nevertheless, the Post reported that the timing of these acquisitions, coupled with her resignation from BLMGNF in May 2021, fueled ongoing debates and suspicions about the financial integrity within the upper echelons of BLMGNF.\n\nFurther financial decisions by Cullors, such as signing off on a $6 million Los Angeles mansion intended as an office for BLMGNF, and an $8 million property in Toronto for the group's Canadian chapter, have only added to the controversy. The Post pointed out that these expenditures raised questions about the appropriateness of spending and financial governance within BLMGNF, especially given the organization's high-profile role in social justice movements.", "source": {"uri": "thejewishvoice.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Jewish Voice"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

The group does not actually hold any fundraising events with candidates that it backs, the official said. But it has steered nearly $30 million to Democratic campaigns since its inception, according to FEC filings.\n\n-- HVP's latest joint fundraising committee, which formed in mid-March, includes Reps.

Mondaire Jones (D-N.Y.); Adam Gray and Rudy Salas in California; Josh Riley in New York; Kirsten Engel in Arizona; Lannon Baccam in Iowa; and Curtis Hertel in Michigan.\n\n-- The committee quickly raised $4.4 million in the first quarter, distributing $2.9 million of it from March 15-31 to the Democrats who formed the committee, according to FEC records.\n\n-- The coalition's 86 donors are well-off Democrats hailing mainly from the New York-New Jersey-Connecticut tri-state area who gave between $25,625 and $56,100 each.

Their sophisticated analysis of all the races has made a huge difference to us and we are giving to a lot more races than we would have without their analysis.\"\n\nHappy Tuesday and welcome to PI.

The paper examines how AI is being deployed across the manufacturing sector and \"offers policymakers a window into the future of AI in modern manufacturing -- and a roadmap to help us get there,\" she wrote.\n\n-- Unsurprisingly, NAM's priorities emphasize the need to avoid \"duplicative and burdensome requirements\" for AI developers and those deploying it, which the organization says could hamstring growth.\n\n-- NAM is warning policymakers not to assume that laws and regulations already on the books can't be reworked to account for AI-related concerns, while advocating that they avoid a one-size-fits-all approach that isn't tailored to specific use cases of the technology.\n\n-- One such example of a burdensome compliance requirement would be third-party audits, the framework says, adding that \"policymakers should remain mindful that the deployers of an AI system would depend on representations ... made by the system's developer\" when crafting a compliance regime.\n\n-- As European policymakers pull ahead in formulating landmark AI rules, NAM is pushing for a \"globally aligned regulatory environment\" led by the U.S. \"rather than a patchwork of redundant or incompatible laws,\" investments in career and technical education programs, and a federal data privacy law that \"also protect[s] manufacturers from frivolous litigation.\"\n\nVAUGHN HEADS TO BGR: Longtime GOP spokesperson Emma Vaughn has joined BGR Group as a vice president of public relations.

She's also done several stints on the Hill with Reps. Andrew Garbarino (R-N.Y.) and Dave Joyce (R-Ohio).\n\nCHAMBER SWIPES BACK AT GOP TAX INQUIRY: \"The U.S. Chamber of Commerce is pushing back on an investigation by the House Ways and Means Committee into donations it received from a left-leaning nonprofit and reporting by a right-wing outlet that prompted the inquiry,\" per The Hill's Taylor Giorno.\n\n-- \"The chair of the chief tax-writing committee, Rep. Jason Smith (R-Mo.), sent a letter Monday to Chamber President and CEO Suzanne Clark and U.S. Chamber of Commerce Foundation President Carolyn Cawley requesting information on donations from the Tides Foundation,\" a nonprofit that has received donations from Democratic megadonor George Soros' nonprofit group Open Society Foundations.\n\n-- \"Between 2018 and 2022, tax records first reported by the right-wing outlet Breitbart News indicate the Tides Foundation gave more than $12 million to the U.S. Chamber of Commerce Foundation for purposes including 'economic development,' 'project support' and 'equality, human rights and economic empowerment.'\"\n\n-- \"Citing the Breitbart report, Smith said in his Monday letter that the Tides Foundation 'partners with and sponsors several anti-business organizations' that appear to conflict with the Chamber's mission to support small businesses and raised questions about the business lobbying giant's tax-exempt status.\"\n\n-- But the head of the Chamber foundation's Hiring our Heroes program, Eric Eversole, said the Breitbart report's assertion that the Chamber is leaning on \"Soros-funded groups and Democrats to keep dwindling operations alive\" was \"inaccurate.\" Eversole told The Hill that the donations in question \"were charitable contributions from corporations made to the donor advised fund\" run by Tides, meaning it's almost impossible to trace the flow of individual donations.\n\nDIDN'T SEE THIS COMING!: Our Rebecca Kern reports that \"TikTok and its parent company ByteDance sued Tuesday to challenge a law President Joe Biden signed to force the sale or ban of the video sharing app.\"\n\n-- \"The petition filed with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit claims the law violates the First Amendment rights of its 170 million American users. It says the law shuts down the platform based on 'speculative and analytically flawed concerns about data security and content manipulation.'\"\n\n-- \"For the first time in history, Congress has enacted a law that subjects a single, named speech platform to a permanent, nationwide ban,\" the companies said in their complaint. TikTok and ByteDance are being represented by Covington & Burling and Mayer Brown in the case.\n\nMORE JUUL INFLUENCE EFFORTS COME TO LIGHT: \"Two New York University professors collaborated directly with executives of the vaping company Juul without disclosing those relationships to academic journals or Congress,\" per Stat News' Nicholas Florko.\n\n-- \"At the height of the youth vaping crisis, when many public health experts were calling for sweeping action that could upend the entire industry, David Abrams and Ray Niaura emerged as two authoritative voices willing to defend vaping -- despite its growing popularity among youth -- as an effective public health strategy to help adults cut back or quit smoking.\"\n\n-- \"There is no evidence either professor was paid for his work with the company. However, conflict-of-interest experts STAT spoke to said that even non-financial ties to Juul should have been reported, as did editors at several journals that published papers by Abrams and Niaura.\"\n\nFLY-IN SZN: The fitness industry kicked off a fly-in today to rally support for legislation that would let people use pre-tax medical accounts like FSAs and HSAs to pay for fitness-related expenses.\n\n-- Members of the Health and Fitness Association have more than 120 meetings on the books, and the fly-in is timed to the release of new data commissioned by the trade group that's aimed at highlighting the fitness industry's economic impact and making the case that the industry should be considered an important stakeholder in the policy shift toward preventive health care.\n\n-- The American Land Title Association, which represents the land title industry, kicked off its fly-in on Monday, with more than 250 members from across the country in town to meet with 60 different lawmakers and staff from 200 offices on the Hill.\n\n-- The Household & Commercial Products Association brought representatives from 18 member companies to town today to push for an increase in EPA funding for IT modernization at the agency and for addressing regulatory backlogs the industry says hamper innovation.

Leah's mother, Christine, and her best friend Kym Nadeau spoke to Newsweek about their decades-long friendship and viral vacation antics.\"The boat is almost capsized,\" Christine continued in the video. \"Thank god I saved my phone, that's all we have, we have nothing else, everything else is below deck.\"Kym and Christine (whose nickname is Aka) met in middle school, and their sailing trip video was inspired mostly by rough waters and strong drinks, Kym said.\"What usually prompts our videos are margaritas or martinis. The sailing trip video was actually from an 80's cruise on Royal Caribbean...Aka booked us on a sailing excursion,\" she said. \"We had a few drinks and they started taking bags and things below. It was because the water was pretty rough, and we were getting tossed around, but we were still slightly unsure and buzzed, so we decided to film it.\"The video is one of many adventures the pair share with Aka's daughter, Leah, who ends up posting the clips to TikTok. A recent cruise in March 2024 saw the friends, again after a few drinks, telling Leah that everyone on the ship was \"obsessed\" with them, Kym said. \"In actuality, not a single person was.\"Lifetimes of friendship and travelKym and Aka's friendship harkens back to childhood\u2014but their connection is even more dated. Both of their mothers were also best friends growing up, and their love for travel began with the four of them taking trips together.\"When I was a senior in high school [Aka's] mom and my mom took me to the Bahamas. I started traveling with them once a year, going to Aruba and Mexico, and then Aka started going with us, and our normal destination was Freeport, Bahamas,\" Kym said. \"Our moms taught us how to party and we learned everything from them. We would find them playing quarters with the locals and things like that.\"Now, the pair continue the tradition with their own wild travel stories: underground clubbing in Cuba, an outing with the crew from \"Vanderpump Rules\" and cigars and whisky with famous drummer Donnell Spencer Jr., to name a few.But these experiences are nothing without the duo's enduring friendship.\"Aka is the very best friend you can have,\" Kym said. \"When I am down, I watch videos of our trips and it always makes me laugh. She is...the life of the party. She always has my back, and we always want to do the same things and go the same places.\"Coming up for Kym and Aka are another 80's cruise, an African safari and a trip to the Bahamas. When the two were young, Kym's parents had a condo in the Bahamas which made it easy for the mothers and daughters to vacation there.\"That condo no longer exists,\" Kym said. \"But I purchased one there in 2019, hoping that one day Aka and I can retire there.\"", "summary": "\"What usually prompts our videos are margaritas or martinis,\" Kym Nadeau, her mother's best friend, told Newsweek.", "url": "https://www.newsweek.com/woman-asks-mom-enjoying-sailing-vacation-response-1908483", "image": "https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2404262/leah-aikens-tiktok-video.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-09 14:00:01", "author": "Maria Morava", "authors": ["Maria Morava"], "language": "en", "catgory": "politics", "source_country": "us", "sentiment": 0.424}

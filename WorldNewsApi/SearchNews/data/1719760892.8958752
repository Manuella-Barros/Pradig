When Judge Cannon asked Mr. Woodward what he actually wanted from the government, his answer seemed simple enough: any messages exchanged by prosecutors that mentioned his name.\" ALSO READ: Why Trump\u2019s strength is illusoryAccording to the NYT report, Cannon re-asked the question and requested Woodward explain his answer \"slowly.\"\"Even after that, it seemed that she was still a bit confused,\" Feuer wrote, and then noted that exchange was not the only one where she seemed out of her depth based on what followed moments later.David Harbach, one of the prosecutors, was asked to discuss Woodward's request, and had to elaborate a second time for her \"But Judge Cannon seemed to miss his point,\" Feuer wrote before adding Harbach grew visibly frustrated when she asked him a third time, at which point Harbach \"said as plainly as he could that Mr. Woodward\u2019s request had no basis in either fact or law,\" before loudly stating, \"This is what I\u2019m trying to tell you.\"That led to an admonishment from Cannon who warned him to \u201ccalm down.\u201dAccording to the Times report, that exchange is \"emblematic\" of the difficulties lawyers are having with Cannon, who is still relatively new to the bench after Donald Trump appointed her to the lifetime position.", "summary": "<img src=\"https://www.rawstory.com/media-library/judge-cannon-doc-access-ruling-could-pave-the-way-for-dismissing-her-from-trump-case-ex-prosecutor.jpg?id=34983010&width=1200&height=800&coordinates=85%2C0%2C86%2C0\"/><br/><br/><p>As part of an analysis of how U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida <a href=\"https://www.rawstory.com/jack-smith-aileen-cannon-2668393525/\" target=\"_blank\">Judge Aileen Cannon</a>, reports from her courtroom show a judge who is both <a href=\"https://www.rawstory.com/aileen-cannon-trump-2668189974/\" target=\"_blank\">\"prickly\" and\" insecure\"</a> and often has trouble understanding what lawyers f<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/29/us/politics/trump-documents-judge-aileen-cannon.html\" target=\"_blank\">rom both sides try to explain to her.</a><br/><br/>The controversial Cannon -- who has been accused of <a href=\"https://www.rawstory.com/aileen-cannon-denies-jack-smith/\" target=\"_blank\">slow-walking Donald Trump's obstruction of justice trial</a> related to his alle", "url": "https://www.rawstory.com/aileen-cannon-confused/", "image": "https://www.rawstory.com/media-library/judge-cannon-doc-access-ruling-could-pave-the-way-for-dismissing-her-from-trump-case-ex-prosecutor.jpg?id=34983010&width=1200&height=600&coordinates=0%2C9%2C0%2C10", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-05-29 13:21:39", "author": "Tom Boggioni", "authors": ["Tom Boggioni"], "language": "en", "source_country": "US", "sentiment": -0.458}

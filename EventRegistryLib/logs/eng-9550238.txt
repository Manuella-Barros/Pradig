Half an hour into the search, the homeless woman heard announcements from the sheriff's helicopter and returned the child back to the parking lot, both news outlets said.\n\nThe homeless woman was identified as 34-year-old Lauren Jope, who stays at a camp near Auburn Boulevard.\n\n\"After we'd gotten something to eat, we walked back up the hill and all the sudden the helicopter is going around and then, 'Attention on the ground, attention on the ground' and it says her name and describes me,\" Jope said to KXTV.\n\nJope she said she had been just walking down the street earlier when \"this car looked as if it was out of gas.\"\n\n\"This guy asked me, 'Hey, can you go into the store with my [granddaughter] to buy a pair of shorts and I was like, 'Okay, no problem.' He was like, 'You know buy yourself a few things and I'll give you some money or whatever,' so I said okay,\" Jope said to KCRA3.\n\nJope said that after she and the young girl came out of the thrift store, she noticed Warren was acting strange and, out of instinct, wanted to protect her.\n\n\"The guy is just totally belligerently drunk and just kind of scary. He turned into a totally different person, and so I got his granddaughter away until things kind of simmered down, because I didn't know what was really going on,\" Jope said to KCRA3. \"I just wanted to make sure she was safe and that she's OK.\"\n\nJope then took the child to her encampment to play with her dog and eat some food.\n\nThe child confirmed Jope's story with officials and didn't appear to be in distress. She was medically cleared as a precaution, according to the sheriff's office.\n\n\"I'm glad I was walking when I was cause you know she could have been left with some, some man or, you know, someone who doesn't want to watch her. Someone that doesn't really care,\" Jope said to KXTV.\n\nBar owner Andy Soto helped officials search for the girl. He said Warren was a first-time customer but noticed red flags due to his behavior.\n\n\"Thankfully I was able to go through some of the information with them and show them the angles and the actual physical description of the person who took the child,\" Soto said to KCRA3.\n\n\"This guy was being very erratic, being very loud and ultimately was asked to leave,\" he continued. \"He kind of scared a couple of other customers and then about 20 minutes later was asked to go away.\"\n\n\"It's kind of a serious thing. Where's your granddaughter? Why are you at a bar drinking if you're in charge of this child's life? It's really not where you need to be,\" Soto added. \"Hopefully he gets whatever help he needs. I'm glad that the girl was found safely.\"\n\nThe young girl's aunt had full custody and asked Warren to watch her because she had to work. The child is now home with her aunt.\n\nWarren was arrested for felony child endangerment and other charges.

YouTube screengrab from Fox affiliate KTXL.\n\nPolice say a \"highly intoxicated\" grandfather in California has been charged with child endangerment after he paid a homeless woman $20 so he could grab a drink at a bar and then proceeded to wander around later asking for help and declaring the 7-year-old had been kidnapped for human trafficking.\n\nJason Warren, 54, was arrested on May 6 in Sacramento after police responded to a 911 call from someone who said they spoke to a man walking around the parking lot of The Cinders bar on Auburn Boulevard pleading for help to find the girl, according to a statement from the Sacramento Sheriff's Facebook page.\n\nThat call to dispatch prompted sheriffs to use a helicopter, drones and K-9 units to immediately launch a search. Just 30 minutes later, police said the homeless woman heard an announcement over a nearby PA system about the search and brought the girl back to the bar parking lot.\n\n\"The female confirmed that Warren had given her money to take the child to the thrift store. She went on to tell deputies that Warren was highly intoxicated and she did not think he could care for the child,\" a police statement said.\n\nThe woman took the girl to her \"camp\" to give her food, and the child corroborated what the woman told police. The sheriff's office said the child was not injured nor in distress but she was given a medical evaluations as a precaution.\n\nThe woman who looked after Warren's daughter, Lauren Jope, 43, told Sacramento Fox affiliate KTXL: \"It was kind of like, OK, that's kind a big thing and you don't really know who I am but she'll be safe with me.\"\n\nJope said the girl did not seem scared and that \"it seems like its something that happened before.\"\n\nPolice said when they finally spoke to Warren, it was clear he was inebriated as he explained that he gave an \"unknown homeless woman $20 to take his granddaughter to a nearby thrift store while he want into the bar approximately four hours earlier,\" police said.\n\nSurveillance footage from outside of the bar showed him leaving the girl with the woman.\n\nIt was later determined that full custody of the child belonged to the girl's aunt and she had asked Warren to watch the child since she was called into work. The girl has been returned to her aunt's care after Child Protective Services determined it was safe.\n\nWarren was booked into the Sacramento County Main Jail and was held on $75,000 bond. He made his first court appearance Wednesday and remains in detention.\n\nIn an interview with Fox affiliate KTXL from inside jail, Warren told a reporter he left the girl with the woman because she seemed trustworthy.\n\n\"I knew, I could tell by her character, she looked like a decent person. I trusted her like I would trust my sister or my cousin,\" Warren said.\n\nWhen the Fox reporter asked if he had considered that something bad could have happened in the four hours he left her with a stranger, he said: \"I thought it about it the whole time. But I trust God. God is not going to lead me into a place where he can't do much.\"\n\nHe also remarked: \"Four hours I was there?\"\n\nWarren told the outlet he was having car trouble when he pulled up to the bar and he claimed his cellphone was dead. He also said that he knew he couldn't take the girl into the bar so he left her with Jope. A woman who worked at the thrift store where Jope took the child told Fox she was smiling and happy while they browsed the store. Jope said she also got the girl an ice cream and let her visit with her dog at her encampment.\n\nSacramento Sheriff's Office Sgt. Amar Gandhi called Jope \"for lack of a better word, a guardian angel.\"\n\n\"Is it my fault for leaving my granddaughter with a guardian angel?\" Warren said from behind glass at the Sacramento Main Jail on Wednesday.\n\nWhen asked if he would do it again, he said: \"Yes, I would. Everything I did I told God and I said, you know what, it's your will God, not mine.\"\n\nIn addition to the felony child endangerment charge, Warren is charged with a single misdemeanor of disorderly conduct/drunk in public.", "source": {"uri": "lawandcrime.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Law & Crime"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bar", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox_Broadcasting_Company", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Fox Broadcasting Company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homelessness", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Homelessness"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcohol_intoxication", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Alcohol intoxication"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sacramento,_California", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sacramento, California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Sacramento, California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KTXL", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "KTXL"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheriff", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Sheriff"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child_abuse", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Child abuse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_address_system", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Public address system"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auburn_University", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Auburn University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Police_dog", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Police dog"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_trafficking", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Human trafficking"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unmanned_aerial_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Unmanned aerial vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Facebook"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helicopter", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Helicopter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YouTube", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "YouTube"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child_protective_services", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Child protective services"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fault_(geology)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fault (geology)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Misdemeanor", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Misdemeanor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disorderly_conduct", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Disorderly conduct"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angel", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Angel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Felony", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Felony"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/God", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "God"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ice_cream", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ice cream"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_phone", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mobile phone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sacramento_County,_California", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sacramento County, California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Sacramento County, California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death/In_Memoriam", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death/In Memoriam", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 52}], "image": "https://lawandcrime.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/warren.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9550238", "eventUri": "eng-9550238", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-06", "textStart": 483, "textEnd": 488}], "sentiment": 0.07450980392156858, "wgt": 197, "relevance": 1}

The federal government is expected to announce the way forward for fish farms along British Columbia's coast. THE CANADIAN PRESS /Jonathan HaywardOTTAWA - The federal government is expected to announce the way forward for fish farms along British Columbia's coast. The ocean-pen aquaculture operations have been a flashpoint between First Nations, the industry, wild salmon advocates and environmentalists for several years. Fisheries Minister Diane Lebouthillier will make the announcement in Ottawa this afternoon, while Energy Minister Jonathan Wilkinson is expected to make the same announcement in Vancouver. Lebouthillier has been consulting with Indigenous leaders, industry stakeholders and coastal communities about the government's transition plan involving 79 salmon farms after Prime Minister Justin Trudeau pledged during the 2019 election that his government would phase out ocean-pen farms. The B.C. Salmon Farmers Association has said an economic analysis concluded the province could lose about 4,700 jobs and more than $1 billion in annual economic activity if the fish farm licences are not renewed. Former fisheries minister Joyce Murray announced in 2023 that the government wasn't renewing the licences for 15 Atlantic salmon farms off the Discovery Islands of northwestern Vancouver Island, a major migration route for wild salmon. Murray said then that wild salmon face multiple threats, including climate change, habitat degradation and overfishing, and the decision was meant to reduce the challenges for wild salmon that swim past the farms. Opponents worry that open-net salmon farms can spread disease or lice to wild fish, while supporters say the risks are low.

The federal government is expected to announce the way forward for fish farms along British Columbia's coast. THE CANADIAN PRESS /Jonathan HaywardVANCOUVER - With entrenched views on all sides of the salmon-farming debate in British Columbia, the federal government cast the issue five years down the road on Wednesday, saying aquaculture must move to land by 2029. The government had promised to phase out the farms by next year, but Fisheries Minister Diane Lebouthillier announced she would allow aquaculture farms to renew their licences in a \"responsible, realistic and achievable transition\" away from the ocean farms. Conservation and some Indigenous groups that have been lobbying Ottawa to make good on the 2019 commitment to phase out open net-pen salmon farms by 2025, said they were pleased with the decision to force the operations on land, but expressed concern with the extended time frame. Industry representatives and B.C. Indigenous nations involved in salmon farming reacted with concern and disappointment, saying the government has created an environment of uncertainty that could cause economic harm to coastal and Indigenous communities. \"I will expect that the salmon farming industry will probably react negatively, but my message to them is engage us,\" Jonathan Wilkinson, the federal energy and natural resources minister, said in an interview. \"Engage us in a conversation about how we can actually make closed containment systems cost effective,\" said Wilkinson, a former minister of fisheries. Lebouthillier has been consulting with many groups about the transition plan involving 79 salmon farms off the B.C. coast after Prime Minister Justin Trudeau pledged during the 2019 election that his government would phase out open ocean-pen farming. The government said part of its aquaculture future program will include the introduction of nine-year licences for closed containment salmon farm operations, either marine- or land-based. Wilkinson said the government is sending the message that it must move to protect declining wild salmon stocks, particularly in times when scientific debate is examining the possible impact of the farms on wild salmon. \"I'm not a scientist but I recognize the significance of the scientific debate, and in an era where these stocks are crashing, it behooves us to act with caution and not to wait until we actually don't have anything left to save,\" said Wilkinson, who announced the government's decision in 2019 to phase out the ocean-based salmon farms. Indigenous leaders and industry representatives reacted with disappointment on Wednesday, saying the government is making a decision rooted in politics and not science. \"Instead of embracing a balanced pathway towards economic opportunity, increasing healthy and affordable homegrown food, recognizing an exceptional level of Indigenous collaboration and economic reconciliation and incrementally greater environmental protection, it has embraced a position that reflects unaccountable and extreme activist voices,\" Timothy Kennedy, Canadian Aquaculture Industry Alliance president, said in a statement. The federal minister called the government's plan realistic, reasonable and achievable, but it really is \"unrealistic, unreasonable and unachievable,\" he said. The B.C. Salmon Farmers Association, which says the industry supports about 4,700 jobs and generates more than $1 billion annually, said the five-year transition plan will hurt coastal communities. \"Salmon farming in B.C. has been a vital sector contributing significantly to Canada's economy and food security,\"\u009d Brian Kingzett, B.C. Salmon Farmers Association executive director, said in a statement. \"However, the political conditions on the licences increase the uncertainty for aquaculture in B.C. and Canada.\" Isaiah Robinson, deputy chief of the Kitasoo Xai'xais Nation on B.C.'s Central Coast, said Ottawa is making a decision about the livelihoods of his people \"based off of wealthy billionaires, politicians and activists.\" Robinson made the comments at a Vancouver news conference with the leaders of several Indigenous nations who are involved in salmon farming. \"They're attempting to once again dictate our future as Indigenous people,\" he said. The plan to remove open net-pen salmon farms from B.C. coastal waters is supported by most First Nations in the province, said Bob Chamberlin, who represents more than 100 B.C. nations as the First Nations Wild Salmon Alliance chairman. \"It benefits all British Columbians and so this is a very important day for wild salmon, but I think it's a big day for reconciliation across the province,\" he said at a news conference. The Watershed Watch Salmon Society said it was pleased to hear the federal government will remove salmon farms from ocean waters, but has concerns about the five-year wait. \"We are relieved that the federal government is sticking to their commitment to remove the farms, but five years is too long for the phaseout period,\" executive director Aaron Hill said in a statement. \"That's five more years of bombarding wild salmon with parasites and viruses from factory fish farms.\" Lebouthtillier said while wild Pacific salmon are an iconic species important to First Nations, and commercial and recreational fishermen, aquaculture represents food security and its supply to consumers is surpassing wild fishing around the world. \"If we want to protect wild species, want to move forward, we have to use aquaculture,\" she said. Lebouthtillier said the future involves safely increasing aquaculture without harming wild salmon. Former fisheries minister Joyce Murray, who attended Wednesday's news conference in Vancouver with Wilkinson, said salmon farming can amplify and release parasites and alien diseases into ocean waters infecting wild Pacific salmon on their migration routes. \"This transition is an opportunity to build sustainable economic alternatives with affected communities and to support our government's critical work and rebuilding vital salmon stocks and fisheries throughout,\" she said.

Anti-fish-farm activists understandably interpreted that to mean all open-net salmon farms would have to be out of the water by 2025.\n\nBut the original mandate has been massaged somewhat, and Lebouthillier told Ha-Shilth-Sa newspaper in December that there \"will be no closure of aquaculture centres in 2025.\"\n\nThe salmon farming industry and First Nations that support it are lobbying for a compromise -- technology and hybrid systems that could minimize interactions and disease transmission.\n\nThey propose, for example, to rear salmon longer in land-based recirculating aquaculture systems before transferring them to open-net cages to reduce the amount of time fish spend in open water.\n\nTechnological approaches include a laser system made by Stingray Marine Solutions that zaps sea lice in salmon farms with lasers, eliminating the need for pesticides.\n\nSuch approaches would require multimillion-dollar investments. And to make those kinds of investments, salmon farmers say they need some guarantees they won't be shut down anytime soon. They are asking for licence renewals of at least six years.\n\n\"The minister has said farms will not be moving out of the water in the near term, but we are waiting to see what the term of licences will be,\" said Brian Kingzett, executive director of the BC Salmon Farmers Association.\n\n\"We've been asking for a six-year licence to justify making those massive investments into B.C. They're not going to invest unless they can see a runway that there will be some sort of return on investment, and that will allow them to invest in these new technologies.\"\n\nSonia Strobel, CEO and co-founder of Skipper Otto, which supports mom-and-pop commercial fishers through their seafood subscription business, wants open-net salmon farms shut down. She said she believes they are a real threat to wild salmon, and fears the original mandate for transitioning salmon farms is being watered down to allow for the hybrid systems supported by industry.\n\n\"I feel really strongly that the time has passed for that kind of experimentation,\" she said. \"It should have happened by now.\"\n\nThose opposed to salmon farming were led to believe the Trudeau government's \"transition\" plan meant a wholesale relocation of open-net salmon farms onto land, through the use of recirculating aquaculture systems, by 2025.\n\nThat would cost about $1.8 billion, according to a 2022 study commissioned by the provincial government, and so far no major investors have stepped forward with plans to build any large-scale systems in B.C.\n\nFisheries and Oceans Canada said in a 2019 report that such systems were ready for commercial development in B.C., but large land-based recirculating aquaculture systems in Florida and Nova Scotia have so far proven to be major money losers.\n\nIn Nova Scotia, Sustainable Blue was forced into receivership in April, after equipment failure led to the loss of an entire harvest of mature Atlantic salmon.\n\nIn its 2023 annual financial report, Atlantic Sapphire ASA, which developed large a recirculating aquaculture system in Florida, reported revenues of US$14 million, expenditures of US$105 million, and a net loss of US$134 million.\n\nMeanwhile in B.C., a pioneer in small-scale salmon farming systems was forced to switch from growing Atlantic salmon to steelhead after the federal government's closure of 15 open-net salmon farms in the Discovery Islands took down a whole supply chain that it had relied on.\n\nKuterra Salmon was originally co-developed by the Namgis First Nation near Port McNeill. Under an operating agreement with the Namgis, Kuterra Salmon is now operated by Whole Oceans.\n\nCody Smith, general manager of Kuterra, said a supply chain that served the open-net salmon farming sector in the region was also critical to Kuterra's Atlantic salmon farming.\n\n\"The [recirculating aquaculture systems] industry really rides in the slipstream of the net-pen industry,\" Smith explained.\n\n\"When that public pressure tilted the government to remove those sites, land-based producers -- generally smaller producers that are looking to pioneer a new method -- were also inadvertently impacted by that.\n\n\"The net-pen farmers effectively reduced their infrastructure in B.C. by 25 per cent, and that includes hatchery production. And we're reliant on hatcheries. We lost our access to quality Atlantic salmon smolt due to that government decision.\"\n\nCody said the recent financial troubles of large projects like Sustainable Blue are unfortunate, but that he believes there is a future for land-based salmon farming.\n\nHowever, he doesn't think shutting down the existing salmon-farming industry in B.C. will help foster land-based salmon farming.\n\n\"I think that could have some pretty tragic consequences for the province, in terms of jobs in coastal communities,\" he said.\n\n\"We believe there's a place in aquaculture for a variety of operators.\"\n\n[email protected]\n\ntwitter.com/nbennett_biv", "source": {"uri": "tricitynews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Tri-City News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Indigenous nations involved in salmon farming reacted with concern and disappointment, saying the government has created an environment of uncertainty that could cause economic harm to coastal and Indigenous communities.\n\n\"I will expect that the salmon farming industry will probably react negatively, but my message to them is engage us,\" Jonathan Wilkinson, the federal energy and natural resources minister, said in an interview.\n\n\"Engage us in a conversation about how we can actually make closed containment systems cost effective,\" said Wilkinson, a former minister of fisheries.\n\nLebouthillier has been consulting with many groups about the transition plan involving 79 salmon farms off the B.C. coast after Prime Minister Justin Trudeau pledged during the 2019 election that his government would phase out open ocean-pen farming.\n\nThe government said part of its aquaculture future program will include the introduction of nine-year licences for closed containment salmon farm operations, either marine- or land-based.\n\nWilkinson said the government is sending the message that it must move to protect declining wild salmon stocks, particularly in times when scientific debate is examining the possible impact of the farms on wild salmon.\n\n\"I'm not a scientist but I recognize the significance of the scientific debate, and in an era where these stocks are crashing, it behooves us to act with caution and not to wait until we actually don't have anything left to save,\" said Wilkinson, who announced the government's decision in 2019 to phase out the ocean-based salmon farms.\n\nIndigenous leaders and industry representatives reacted with disappointment on Wednesday, saying the government is making a decision rooted in politics and not science.\n\n\"Instead of embracing a balanced pathway towards economic opportunity, increasing healthy and affordable homegrown food, recognizing an exceptional level of Indigenous collaboration and economic reconciliation and incrementally greater environmental protection, it has embraced a position that reflects unaccountable and extreme activist voices,\" Timothy Kennedy, Canadian Aquaculture Industry Alliance president, said in a statement.\n\nThe federal minister called the government's plan realistic, reasonable and achievable, but it really is \"unrealistic, unreasonable and unachievable,\" he said.\n\nThe B.C. Salmon Farmers Association, which says the industry supports about 4,700 jobs and generates more than $1 billion annually, said the five-year transition plan will hurt coastal communities.\n\n\"Salmon farming in B.C. has been a vital sector contributing significantly to Canada's economy and food security,\" Brian Kingzett, B.C. Salmon Farmers Association executive director, said in a statement. \"However, the political conditions on the licences increase the uncertainty for aquaculture in B.C. and Canada.\"\n\nIsaiah Robinson, deputy chief of the Kitasoo Xai'xais Nation on B.C.'s Central Coast, said Ottawa is making a decision about the livelihoods of his people \"based off of wealthy billionaires, politicians and activists.\"\n\nRobinson made the comments at a Vancouver news conference with the leaders of several Indigenous nations who are involved in salmon farming.\n\n\"They're attempting to once again dictate our future as Indigenous people,\" he said.\n\nThe plan to remove open net-pen salmon farms from B.C. coastal waters is supported by most First Nations in the province, said Bob Chamberlin, who represents more than 100 B.C. nations as the First Nations Wild Salmon Alliance chairman.\n\n\"It benefits all British Columbians and so this is a very important day for wild salmon, but I think it's a big day for reconciliation across the province,\" he said at a news conference.\n\nThe Watershed Watch Salmon Society said it was pleased to hear the federal government will remove salmon farms from ocean waters, but has concerns about the five-year wait.\n\n\"We are relieved that the federal government is sticking to their commitment to remove the farms, but five years is too long for the phaseout period,\" executive director Aaron Hill said in a statement. \"That's five more years of bombarding wild salmon with parasites and viruses from factory fish farms.\"\n\nLebouthtillier said while wild Pacific salmon are an iconic species important to First Nations, and commercial and recreational fishermen, aquaculture represents food security and its supply to consumers is surpassing wild fishing around the world.\n\n\"If we want to protect wild species, want to move forward, we have to use aquaculture,\" she said.\n\nLebouthtillier said the future involves safely increasing aquaculture without harming wild salmon.\n\nFormer fisheries minister Joyce Murray, who attended Wednesday's news conference in Vancouver with Wilkinson, said salmon farming can amplify and release parasites and alien diseases into ocean waters infecting wild Pacific salmon on their migration routes.\n\n\"This transition is an opportunity to build sustainable economic alternatives with affected communities and to support our government's critical work and rebuilding vital salmon stocks and fisheries throughout,\" she said.", "source": {"uri": "bc.ctvnews.ca", "dataType": "news", "title":

Washington state, the last to do so, banned it in 2022.\n\nThe new five-year extensions will come with stricter conditions of licence, while after July 1 only marine or land-based closed containment facilities will be considered.\n\nOttawa will also introduce new nine-year licenses for facilities that commit to moving to closed-containment farms within five years.\n\nThe government aims to release a transition plan by July 31.\n\nThat plan will address how to support workers, First Nations and communities, identify necessary economic supports for clean aquaculture technology, address criteria for the five-year phasedown and deal with the management of existing open-net facilities until the ban takes effect, Wilkinson said.\n\nOpponents of the fish farming industry including environmental groups and a large coalition of First Nations hailed the plan to phase the industry out.\n\nBut Bob Chamberlain, chair of First Nation Wild Salmon Alliance, said it was disappointing to see a five-year delay given the multitude of threats salmon are already facing.\n\n\"There is a critical need of immediate safeguarding of wild salmon,\" he said.\n\nChamberlain said the announcement was a \"significant move\" to address food security and reconciliation with B.C. First Nations, 90 per cent of whom rely on wild salmon.\n\nBut he said the quality of the plan will largely depend on its finer details, which have yet to be released.\n\n\"Such as conditions of licence. Are they going to be restocked after they've been harvested? What are the new regulations, and is there going to be First Nations independent monitoring and oversight?\" he said.\n\n\"I know that is something that the majority of First Nations that participated in the transition planning process tabled with government, and certainly it is not something we are going to let up on.\"\n\nThe B.C. Salmon Farmers' Association said meeting the federal government's transition timeline would be \"very challenging.\"\n\n\"We have been prepared to invest hundreds of millions if not a billion dollars in new technology, but it is very doubtful whether a move to fully closed containment as is discussed today is achievable in a five-year period,\" executive director Brian Kingzett told Global News.\n\nLicencing and deploying new technology alone could take more than five years, he argued.\n\nKingzett said the industry employs close to 5,000 people, including 500 First Nations workers, and contributes about $1.2 billion to B.C.'s economy.\n\n\"They are literally putting thousands of jobs at risk,\" he said.\n\nDallas Smith, spokesperson for the First Nations for Finfish Stewardship, which backs the aquaculture industry, said the decision fails to account for the impacts climate change, habitat loss and overfishing are having on wild salmon.\n\n\"It's really important for us to look at all the stressors and impacts to wild salmon,\" he said. \"To simply say that salmon aquaculture is the reason for wild salmon decline is irresponsible.\"\n\nLebouthillier has been consulting with Indigenous leaders, industry stakeholders and coastal communities about the government's transition plan involving 79 salmon farms after Prime Minister Justin Trudeau pledged during the 2019 election that his government would phase out ocean-pen farms.\n\nLast year, the federal government announced it would not renew licences for 15 farms off the Discovery Islands, a key migration route for wild salmon.\n\nThe ecological effects of marine salmon farming remain hotly debated.\n\nOpponents point to sea lice, viruses and bacteria they say the farms propagate as critical threats to juvenile salmon already under threat from a variety of forces.\n\nThe salmon farming industry maintains that there is no scientific evidence of widespread harm to wild fish and that farms provide needed seafood without depleting wild salmon stock.", "source": {"uri": "globalnews.ca", "dataType": "news", "title": "Global News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Nation Wild Salmon Alliance.\n\n\"We will look forward to trying to find a path forward,\" added Kingzett. \"Five years is really one production cycle and it is going to be interesting to see if we

It's time for us to actually ensure that we are protecting the environment and thinking about how we actually move forward from the economic perspective,\" said Wilkinson.\n\nWilkinson said the new phase-out plan will come with stricter licence conditions to strengthen the protection of wild species in the marine environment, including more stringent measures to ensure improved management of sea lice on farmed fish, increased reporting requirements for industry and additional monitoring of marine mammal interactions.\n\nFacilities will be expected to make restocking and harvesting decisions that are consistent with the requirement to \"fully terminate\" all open-net pen farming by June 30, 2029, the minister said.\n\nAfter July 1 of this year, closed-containment salmon farming systems will be considered for a nine-year licence extension, he said.\n\nThe announcement comes five years after the federal government committed to phasing out open-net pen Atlantic salmon farms.\n\nThe transition from open-net ocean aquaculture operations to closed-container systems is achievable, Wilkinson said in an interview, noting Prime Minister Justin Trudeau made the pledge to phase out open-net pen salmon farming during the 2019 election and the Liberal government is making good on that promise.\n\nHe said the changes are imperative to save Pacific salmon stocks, which are at risk not only because of sea lice and other diseases from farmed fish, but because of habitats damaged by climate change.\n\n\"We really need to get going on this -- it's urgent,\" said Wilkinson. \"Our wild salmon are already facing so many risks. This is a precautionary measure, and by isolating the threats [in closed containment pens] we are taking away some of that risk to our wild salmon.\"\n\nPhase-out called 'unrealistic'\n\nBackers of the salmon-farming industry immediately slammed the federal government's plan to ban open-net farms.\n\nBrian Kingzett, executive director of the B.C. Salmon Farmers Association, called the five-year phase-out \"unrealistic.\"\n\n\"This focus on unproven [closed-containment] technology jeopardizes the sector's ability to fulfill agreements with rights-holder First Nations and will cause further harm to our communities,\" said Kingzett.\n\nIn a statement, Canadian Aquaculture Industry Alliance president and CEO Timothy Kennedy described the federal plan as \"irresponsible, unrealistic, unreasonable and unachievable.\"\n\nKennedy said the federal government has \"embraced a position that reflects unaccountable and extreme activist voices,\" rather than a \"balanced pathway.\"\n\nA ban on the farms by 2029 would be \"logistically impossible\" and would threaten nearly 5,000 jobs and 400 million \"salmon meals\" produced every year, he said.\n\n\"The objective is unreasonable because there is no scientific basis to this decision. The science at most calls for incremental protections for wild salmon in certain areas,\" Kennedy added.\n\nWilkinson, however, said the industry has to adapt, adding five years to transition to closed systems \"is a reasonable timeline to work with companies and communities.\"\n\n\"We're saying to the companies work with us,\" said the minister. \"At the end of the day, we can't hide behind excuses ... it's not OK to do nothing anymore.\"\n\nIn response to the pending ban, B.C. Minister of Land, Water and Resource Stewardship Nathan Cullen said the federal government must help fund the transition, especially for technology and infrastructure for closed-containment fish farms.\n\n\"Again and again, we have asked the federal government to deliver supports for B.C. workers, families and communities as part of any transition plan,\" Cullene said in a statement. \"Coastal communities need a clear plan and significant funding from the federal government to support workers and communities.\"\n\n'Five years is too long'\n\nCritics have warned for years that salmon farms act as breeding grounds for sea lice and piscine orthoreovirus (PRV), a debilitating pathogen that some researchers say has been spread by salmon-farming operations.\n\nAaron Hill, executive director of Watershed Watch Salmon Society, said he was \"relieved\" about the upcoming ban but \"very concerned\" about the length of the phase-out.\n\n\"Five years is too long,\" said Hill.\n\nHill said it's important that any new transition plan does not allow the discharge of salmon-farm water into the ocean.\n\nWilkinson said that while there remains significant scientific debate on the effects of salmon farms on wild fish, there's enough evidence for government to act on the \"precautionary principle.\"\n\nFormer fisheries minister Joyce Murray, MP for Vancouver Quadra, who was at the announcement in Vancouver, said it's known that open-net salmon farming \"does amplify and release parasites and ocean diseases into our ocean waters, infecting wild Pacific salmon, especially the juveniles on their migration routes.\"\n\nEconomic transitions to protect the environment are hard, she added, but would present an opportunity to build \"sustainable economic alternatives.\"\n\nAs fisheries minister, Murray announced last year that the federal government would not renew the licences for 15 Atlantic salmon farms off the Discovery Islands of northwestern Vancouver Island, a major migration route for wild salmon.\n\nA federal court recently rejected an application for a judicial review filed by some First Nations and aquaculture companies, ruling Murray's decision met the \"requirement of the duty to consult\" and \"did not breach the operators' right of procedural fairness.\"\n\n'Not enough'\n\nSean Godwin, a former researcher at Simon Fraser University and now assistant professor in sustainable aquaculture at University of California Davis, said the announcement came as a surprise but vindicated what most research indicated was a rising concern.\n\n\"All fingers point toward interactions between farm and wild salmon and effects of farms on wild salmon,\" said Godwin. \"It's a win for the environment, it's a win for coastal communities, and it's a win for wild salmon.\"\n\nBob Chamberlain, chair of the First Nation Wild Salmon Alliance, said 120 First Nations back the removal of open-net-pen salmon farms in B.C.\n\n\"I can categorically say to all of you that this transition plan to remove open net pen fish farms is supported by the majority of First Nations and British Columbia,\" said Chamberlain.\n\nChamberlain said the latest move was \"an important step\" but would require more money to safeguard wild Pacific salmon stocks.\n\n\"I'm here to tell you it's not enough.\"\n\nThe federal government says it will release a draft salmon aquaculture transition plan by the end of July, focusing on how to support First Nations, workers and communities in the transition, and identifying economic supports for the use of innovative and clean aquaculture technology.\n\n-- With files from Darron Kloster, Times Colonist", "source": {"uri": "timescolonist.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Times Colonist"},

More than half of wild salmon stock populations are declining in the province's waters, according to the Pacific Salmon Foundation.\n\nThe BC Salmon Farmers Association said the ban could cost up to 6,000 jobs and would harm an industry that generates C$1.2bn (US$880m) for the provincial economy.\n\n\"The idea that 70,000 tonnes of BC salmon can be produced on land in five years is unrealistic and ignores the current capabilities of modern salmon farming technology, as it has not been done successfully to scale anywhere in the world,\" said the organisation's executive director, Brian Kingzet.\n\nThe government said it would release a plan by the end of the month outlining how it would support First Nations, industry workers and communities that rely on open-net aquaculture for their livelihoods. Wilkinson said: \"We recognise the importance of meaningful and thoughtful engagement with First Nations partners and communities as we move forward, in order to ensure that economic impacts are mitigated.\"\n\nSalmon spawn in freshwater but spend much of their adult life in the ocean, making closed containment operations challenging and more expensive than farming them in open-net pens that float in the sea. Environmental campaigners say these salmon farms harm wild salmon populations by spreading disease.\n\n\"There's a large body of science that shows that they amplify parasites, viruses and bacteria right on the wild salmon migration routes and spread them to wild fish,\" said Stan Proboszcz, an analyst with conservation group Watershed Watch Salmon Society. \"Many of our stocks are in decline. So let's take [open-net farms] out and give wild salmon a bit of a relief.\"\n\nThe announcement needed to be enshrined in law \"in case we see a change in government next year\", Proboszcz said.\n\nOpinion polls have shown a majority of residents in British Columbia support ending open-net salmon farming, while more than 120 First Nations in the province have shown support for land-based closed containment fish farms.\n\nThe First Nation Wild Salmon Alliance welcomed the announcement. \"This date will serve the longer-term needs of protecting wild Pacific salmon from the impacts of the open-net pen fish farm industry, and is a positive step in that regard,' said Bob Chamberlin, its chairman.", "source": {"uri": "uk.news.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo News UK"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aquaculture_of_salmonids", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Aquaculture of salmonids"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aquaculture", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Aquaculture"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salmon", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Salmon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Columbia", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "British Columbia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "British Columbia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Canada"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oncorhynchus", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Oncorhynchus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonathan_Wilkinson", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jonathan Wilkinson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_resource", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Natural resource"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environmental_movement", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Environmental movement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environmental_protection", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Environmental protection"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Nations_in_Canada", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "First Nations in Canada"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canadian_dollar", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Canadian dollar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tonne", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tonne"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_dollar", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States dollar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fish_stocks", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fish stocks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fish_farming", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fish farming"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservation_movement", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Conservation movement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spawn_(biology)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Spawn (biology)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Provinces_and_territories_of_Canada", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Provinces and territories of Canada"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_migration", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Human migration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wild_fisheries", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wild fisheries"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fresh_water", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fresh water"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Virus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parasitism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Parasitism"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Food/Fish_and_Seafood", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Food/Fish and Seafood", "wgt": 29}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Agriculture_and_Forestry/Aquaculture", "label": "dmoz/Business/Agriculture and Forestry/Aquaculture", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Agriculture/Aquaculture", "label": "dmoz/Science/Agriculture/Aquaculture", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Animal/Fish", "label": "dmoz/Health/Animal/Fish", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Agriculture/Fisheries", "label": "dmoz/Science/Agriculture/Fisheries", "wgt": 25}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 64}], "image": "https://media.zenfs.com/en/theguardian_763/3d70c323b715a39294e169a725a9010a", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9664156", "eventUri": "eng-9664156", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.09019607843137256, "wgt": 196, "relevance": 1}

She promised a draft plan by July 31 to help the industry through the changes she is imposing and a final plan in 2025.\n\nEnvironmental groups and some First Nations have lobbied to shut open-net salmon farms because of the risks they pose to wild salmon stocks, while producers have defended the operations as economic lifelines for some communities and a source of high-quality food.\n\nIn Vancouver, federal Natural Resources Minister Jonathan Wilkinson acknowledged scientific and social disagreements about the impact of open-net salmon farms, but said the wild fish are in such dire straits that the government needs to take a precautionary approach.\n\n\"Given the dramatic declines we have been seeing in wild salmon runs and the existential threat this poses to the future of this species, the federal government agrees it is important for authorities to act on the basis of the precautionary principle - which means we must address all potential causes of the dramatic declines we are seeing,\" Mr. Wilkinson said.\n\nIndustry groups criticized the decision.\n\n\"Salmon farming in B.C. has been a vital sector contributing significantly to Canada's economy and food security,\" Brian Kingzett, executive director of the BC Salmon Farmers Association, said in a statement.\n\n\"However, the political conditions on the licences increase the uncertainty for aquaculture in B.C. and Canada.\"\n\nLicensing for salmon farms on the east coast falls under provincial jurisdiction while Ottawa issues licences for salmon farms in B.C.\n\nTimothy Kennedy, president and chief executive of the Canadian Aquaculture Industry Alliance, in a statement called the federal plan unrealistic, saying transferring the sector to closed containment by 2029 is \"logistically impossible.\"\n\nThe draft transition plan will focus on how to support affected First Nations, workers and communities, Ms. Lebouthillier said, adding that when current open-net salmon licences expire on June 30, licence holders will have the option to apply for five-year licences.\n\nThose licences would include new conditions designed to protect wild salmon, including improved management of sea lice, a pest that can latch on to migrating salmon, the minister said.\n\nNine-year licences will be available to companies that commit to a fully-closed containment system.\n\nThere are 85 marine finfish licences in B.C. that will expire on June 30. DFO received renewal requests for 66 of those licences, 63 of which are for salmon. The other three are for sablefish, said Carolyn Svonkin, press secretary to Mr. Wilkinson.\n\nThe B.C. government urged Ottawa to work closely with affected stakeholders to steer them through the consequences of the new policy.\n\n\"The federal government needs to work directly with impacted communities and workers on next steps, and they must make sure First Nations have a direct role in determining what the transition looks like in their territories,\" Nathan Cullen, the B.C. Water, Land and Resources Stewardship Minister, said in a statement.\n\nThe Coalition of First Nations for Finfish Stewardship, which has been pushing for a gradual transition that would keep open-net operations open, said Ottawa's plan falls short.\n\nSpokesman Dallas Smith cited the sector's economic impact in remote communities, saying \"a family-supporting job in First Nation communities is like four jobs anywhere else.\"\n\nBob Chamberlin, chair of the First Nation Wild Salmon Alliance, said the majority of First Nations in the province support the phase-out of open-net operations, calling Ottawa's decision a substantial step toward economic reconciliation.\n\nNDP fisheries critic Lisa Marie Barron said, in a statement, that British Columbians have been waiting for years for a plan on dealing with open-net farms.", "source": {"uri": "theglobeandmail.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Globe and Mail"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Nations_in_Canada", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "First Nations in Canada"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aquaculture_of_salmonids", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Aquaculture of salmonids"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salmon", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Salmon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ottawa", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ottawa"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Ottawa"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aquaculture", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Aquaculture"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonathan_Wilkinson", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jonathan Wilkinson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indigenous_peoples_in_Canada", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Indigenous peoples in Canada"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diane_Lebouthillier", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Diane Lebouthillier"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backbencher", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Backbencher"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_of_Commons_of_Canada", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "House of Commons of Canada"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precautionary_principle", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Precautionary principle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environmentalism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Environmentalism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberal_Party_of_Canada", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Liberal Party of Canada"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indigenous_peoples", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Indigenous peoples"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Politics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Brunswick", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New Brunswick"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New Brunswick"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Columbia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "British Columbia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "British Columbia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fish_stocks", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fish stocks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy_of_Canada", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Economy of Canada"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_of_Canada", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Government of Canada"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wild_fisheries", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Wild fisheries"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_F._Kennedy", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "John F.

As Robert Fife reported, the government is expected to give the province's aquaculture industry five years to transition to closed containment systems.\n\nB.C.'s marine-based salmon aquaculture industry is a growing contributor to Canada's economy.\n\nAlso called open-pen, these farms raise large numbers of fish in marine or freshwater within confines open to the natural environment, typically located in the middle of wild salmon migration routes. Tim Kennedy, president of the Canadian Aquaculture Industry Alliance, testified before the House of Commons fisheries committee last fall that these farms are not an ecological threat.\n\n\"Modern hatchery operations have substantial biosecurity and operational systems in place that simultaneously prevent disease and dramatically improve hatchery efficiency in water and electricity use,\" he said.\n\nMany see the future in a technology called recirculating aquaculture systems - \"closed containment\" production facilities in which water is constantly recirculated. Where that solves the problem of fish interacting with their wildlife colleagues, it creates a school of others: heavy energy consumption, increased labour costs and tense stakeholder considerations are cited in one economic analysis.\n\nHook: You can track the debate over open-net fish farms in British Columbia to the modern industry's inception in the seventies. Critics have long argued the farms expose the wild salmon to parasitic sea lice as they make their way to the ocean from the lakes and streams where they were born.\n\nLine: In his re-election campaign in 2019, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau threw those detractors a line - pledging to phase out ocean-based pen farms by 2025, citing risks to the health of wild Pacific salmon. Tony Allard, chair of conservation group Wild Salmon Forever, noted in a letter last fall to the Prime Minister that Canada stands alone on the Pacific Coast for allowing ocean-based farms.\n\n\"The government has mandated this transition twice. I am confident that they will deliver,\" he said last summer.\n\nSinker? That, of course, depends on who you ask. Proponents of the change argue it's not only necessary for the survival of several salmon species but the province's economy. The B.C. Salmon Farmers Association, meanwhile, says the province could lose more than 4,700 jobs and up to $1.2-billion in economic activity annually if the open-net industry cannot continue. And the transition to land-based farms will be neither easy nor cheap.\n\nEstimate for a full transition to land-based farms\n\nIt was just a 20-minute pitch. But by the end of it, Jeffrey Solomon found himself with a US$1.3-billion offer to consider.\n\nTwo senior leaders from TD Securities were offering to buy his company - Cowen Inc., a 106-year-old investment bank on the east side of Manhattan - to extend the reach of Canada's second-largest lender in the U.S. The offer made sense for Cowen, too, as its executives were seeking ways to fund ambitious growth plans into the health care and biotech sectors.\n\nBut then came the spring of 2023. After a blockbuster year for equity markets and merger and acquisition activity, Stefanie Marotta reports, the market slowed to a crawl. The two companies now have more challenges to overcome than they bargained for.\n\nBy the time the deal had closed in March, 2023, two companies faced a slow market beaten down by high interest rates, Marotta writes. \"The macro environment wasn't too conducive,\" National Bank analyst Gabriel Dechaine told Marotta. \"You had a lot of inflation and market volatility. The kind of business that Cowen is skewed to, that type of activity doesn't take place as much in the market environment that they had during the first year in which TD acquired it.\"\n\nGlobal markets ticked higher as investors awaited U.S. economic data and comments from Federal Reserve officials later in the day for more clarity on the central bank's roadmap for interest rate cuts.\n\nThe pan-European STOXX 600 was 0.62 per cent higher in morning trading.

It also fulfills a party goal of Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's Liberal Party, which called for a transition away from open net-pen salmon farming in B.C.\n\n\"The government is firmly committed to taking concrete steps to protect wild Pacific salmon,\" Lebouthillier said. \"Today, I'm announcing the essence of a responsible, realistic, and achievable transition that ensures the protection of wild species, food security, and the vital economic development of British Columbia's First Nations, coastal communities, and others, as we keep working toward a final transition plan by 2025.\"\n\nThe five-year renewal period, according to the Canadian Department of Fisheries and Oceans (DFO), will also come with stricter conditions, ostensibly designed to protect wild salmon in the region through better management of sea lice and reporting requirements.\n\n\"These conditions will strengthen protections for wild species and the marine environment while ensuring aquaculture facilities can operate safely during this transition period,\" the DFO said.\n\nThe DFO also said that the new plan was finalized through extensive consultations with relevant groups, including salmon farmers and First Nations groups.\n\nHowever, the decision was immediately criticized as neither realistic nor achievable by salmon-farming companies and other companies supporting the industry in B.C. Relevant parties, including the BC Salmon Farmers Association (BCSFA), were calling for at least a six-year renewal to allow companies to have some certainty for a full cycle of salmon production - from broodstock to egg to harvest.\n\nNow, the industry is worried it is facing a shorter time limit rife with increased operational costs caused by the stricter protocols.\n\n\"This decision will signal continued industry stagnation and uncertainty, resulting in a continued lack of investor confidence in our B.C. aquaculture sector,\" Skretting North America Managing Director Trevor Stanley said in a release. \"The result is reduced investment in innovation, ultimately forcing us to look for growth and investment opportunities in other progressive aquaculture sectors.\"\n\nBCSFA said that the \"unrealistic\" time period for the transition is undermining the Canadian government's commitment to science-based decision-making. A study done by the DFO found little connection between salmon aquaculture and sea lice on wild salmon; though other scientists claimed the study was flawed, the government has yet to prove any link between salmon aquaculture and declines in wild salmon.\n\nTherefore, some parts of the salmon-farming industry called the decision a political one, rather than a scientific one.\n\n\"It is disappointing to learn that the Liberal government has yet again turned its back on coastal communities who rely heavily on salmon farming to drive their fractured economies. In doing so, the government has chosen to ignore science and their own commitments to truth and reconciliation,\" Brown's Bay Packing Co. Co-Owner and CEO Dave Stover said. \"The decision is a political one - a desperate attempt to save a few ridings in Vancouver.\"\n\nA study commissioned by the British Columbia Ministry of Agriculture and Food and performed by Counterpoint Consulting also found that the government's plan to transition to land-based or closed-pen salmon farming isn't viable economically, with Cermaq CEO Steven Rafferty claiming the five-year time limit only creates further uncertainty for the company.\n\n\"Throughout our meetings and consultations, we have explained to various departments within the Canadian government why land-based and closed-containment-based farming cannot replace current seawater production in a period as short as five years,\" he said. \"Unfortunately, our arguments - and those of the entire industry - have been rejected. The objective the government has put forward in front of us cannot be delivered in this timeframe and is, in fact, logistically impossible in remote coastal areas due to lack of suitable land or supporting infrastructure.\"\n\nRafferty added that the decision by Lebouthillier will limit any opportunities for modern salmon farming in B.C. and will continue to impact communities and the company's Indigenous partners in the region. The company said since the DFO announced its plans to transition away from net-pen salmon farming in 2020, the sector has lost 1,500 jobs.\n\n\"Over the last four years, we have worked hard to meaningfully engage in the process set out by the DFO, in support of a healthy salmon-farming sector and healthy wild salmon populations,\" Cermaq Canada Managing Director David Kielmele said. \"It is extremely disappointing to see that engagement has not resulted in a better understanding of our company and the realities of the limitations of certain innovation pathways.\"", "source": {"uri":

Environmental and wildlife groups have welcomed the decision, but industry representatives remain critical.\n\nBecause many First Nations and coastal communities currently rely on open-net pen aquaculture, the Canadian government says it will release a draft plan by the end of next month with an emphasis on supporting those communities during the transition, economic support for innovative or clean aquaculture technology, and effective management.\n\n\"The government is firmly committed to taking concrete steps to protect wild Pacific salmon,\" said Diane Lebouthillier, Minister of Fisheries, Oceans, and the Canadian Coast Guard.\n\n\"Today, I'm announcing the essence of a responsible, realistic, and achievable transition that ensures the protection of wild species, food security, and the vital economic development of British Columbia's First Nations, coastal communities, and others, as we keep working towards a final transition plan by 2025,\" she added.\n\nRead more: Animals Up In Flames: The Growing Threat Of Barn Fires\n\nApproximately half of the Pacific salmon populations are in some sort of decline, per Fisheries and Oceans Canada, and some studies have linked this downward trajectory to farming and aquaculture. There are currently dozens of open net farms in British Columbia.\n\nMuch like other forms of factory farming, aquaculture promotes the spread of disease, and open-net pen farming, in particular, allows parasites, chemicals, bacteria, and fatal diseases like piscine orthoreovirus (PRV) to flow into the wider ocean ecosystem, infecting other animals.\n\nIn 2021, the Pacific Salmon Foundation reported that 86 percent of British Columbians showed \"high levels of concern\" over declining salmon stocks.\n\n\"Since 2019, Canadians have looked to the federal government to protect wild salmon - including regulating fish farming,\" said Taleeb Noormohamed, Member of Parliament for Vancouver Granville. \"Ending open net aquaculture is a transformative shift that will make Canada a world leader

This focus on unproven technology jeopardizes the sector's ability to fulfill agreements with rights-holder First Nations and will cause further harm to our communities.\"\n\nThe BCFA says the timeline is unrealistic and undermines federal government commitments such as science-based decision making, restoration of wild salmon populations, growth of Canada's blue economy, among others.\n\nThey added that they will have more to say in the coming weeks, once the conditions of licence and transition plan details are revealed.\n\nAccording to Wild First, a conservationist group advocating for an end to open net-pen fish farming, for over 30 years, this practice has put wild Pacific salmon at risk with multiple species now in a critical decline.\n\nThey say that the large cages or nets that make an open net-pen fish farm cannot contain or control the outflow of waste from their facilities.\n\nWild First says that they pollute freely every day, causing rampant deadly parasites, pathogens and pollutants to be released into BC's coastal waters.\n\nSpecifically, they say that these fish farms are oftentimes located in the middle of wild salmon migration routes and rearing grounds.\n\nThe high density of fish packed into a farm pen then acts as a bio-amplifier, which increases the amount of contagious viruses in the water.\n\nFor migrating baby salmon who are heading out to sea for the first time and to adult fish returning to spawn, this could be devastating, according to Wild First.", "source": {"uri": "victoriabuzz.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

It could all but wipe out much of Canada's farmed salmon production.\n\nThe government said salmon aquaculture licences will be renewed for five years with stricter conditions, effective from July 1 2024. After this date only marine or land based closed containment systems will be considered for new licences.\n\nFisheries Minister Diane Lebouthillier has outlined a transition to closed-containment salmon farm operations and said she would allow aquaculture farms to renew their licences in a \"responsible, realistic and achievable\" way.\n\nGrieg Seafood was the first company to comment and said that based on the announcement the company was suspending investment in BC and would await a draft transition plan to assess further action.\n\nGrieg pointed out that the decision only applied to British Columbia and had no implications for its operations in Newfoundland.\n\nTim Kennedy, CEO of the Canadian Aquaculture Industry Alliance, said the government objective was unreasonable because there was no scientific basis to the decision.\n\nHe added: \"The objective is irresponsible because it threatens 5,000 highly paid and skilled jobs in coastal British Columbia (500 of these jobs held by Indigenous people) during a time of economic stagnation.\"\n\nThe alliance said over 95% of Canada's salmon production comes from salmon farms in ocean pens in British Columbia.\n\nThe B.C. Salmon Farmers Association has said an analysis showed the province could lose up to CA $1.2 billion in economic activity annually if the licences are not renewed.\n\nFirst Nations groups are divided on the issue with some supporting a ban but with others calling for it to continue because they depend on it for their livelihoods.\n\nThe influential Canadian seafood website SeaWest News said the ban has triggered a fierce backlash, adding it has made a mockery of pledges with the First Nations.\n\nSeaWest News added: \"Denying the science of its fisheries experts that show the marine operations pose less than a minimal risk to wild stocks and bowing to the demands of activists to get their votes, the government's decision is being described as irresponsible, unrealistic and unreasonable.\n\n\"It also makes a mockery of the Liberals promise to deliver science-based decisions regarding the future of salmon farming in BC and walks back on the pledge of economic reconciliation with First Nations, said Indigenous community leaders.\"\n\nMowi today described the decision as unfortunate, saying it had been made despite its efforts to pave the way for future sustainable growth and employment.\n\nThis included a thorough consultation process with several stakeholders, and strong support over the years from the local communities.\n\n\"We are disappointed by the decision, as traditional salmon farming in the sea is absolutely sustainable, and thus the decision lacks a scientific basis,\" Mowi said", "source": {"uri": "fishfarmermagazine.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Fish Farmer Magazine"}, "authors": [{"uri": "vince_mcdonagh@fishfarmermagazine.com", "name": "Vince McDonagh", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aquaculture_of_salmonids", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Aquaculture of salmonids"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aquaculture", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Aquaculture"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Columbia", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "British Columbia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "British Columbia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Canada"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fish_farming", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fish farming"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Provinces_and_territories_of_Canada", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Provinces and territories of Canada"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocean", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ocean"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ottawa", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ottawa"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Ottawa"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Nations_in_Canada", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "First Nations in Canada"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grieg_Seafood", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Grieg Seafood"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_F._Kennedy", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "John F.

However, not everyone is keen to applaud salmon farming, especially those from the wild salmon sector.\n\nThe Last Salmon is a podcast hosted by \"renowned actor Jim Murray and award-winning producer Daire Whelan\" which is claimed to offer hope and solutions to the tragic story that is unfolding for this iconic species.\n\nSadly, the majority of the 11 episodes are nothing but an attack on the salmon farming sector. Each episode features a special guest or guests who are encouraged to talk about the perils of salmon farming for wild salmon.\n\nIn the episode featuring Alexandra Morton, Jim and Daire begin by saying that \"the whole point of this podcast is to get people talking, to get people discussing Atlantic salmon and if we are going to 'prod a few bears' with the odd guest with contentious opinion then so be it\".\n\nYet, the podcast is only interested in one side of the story; that from the angler's perspective and thus any hope for the future of this species will be extremely limited. Despite offers to provide another view, Jim Murray doesn't think that, for his intended audience, having someone appear from the salmon farming sector would be a great fit. This is because his views on salmon farming come from an extremely restricted knowledge base. It is only necessary to look at the qualifications of some of his guests, especially those with an opinion on salmon farming, to understand the narrative.\n\nGuests include: Yvon Chouinard, founder of Patagonia and angler; Jesper P\u00e4\u00e4kk\u0151nen, actor and angler; Alexandra Morton, salmon scientist and activist; Matt Harris, angler, activist, photographer; Mikael Fr\u0151din, angler, guide and activist; Elvar Fri\u0151riksson, North Atlantic Salmon Fund and angler; Dominic West, actor and angler (although he has yet to appear); Paul Whitehouse, actor and activist; and Simen Saetre, co-author of the Patagonia-published book The New Fish.\n\nThe reason that the angling sector has such a negative view of salmon farming is, of course, down to the fact that they only hear their own view. It is a view that developed in the early 1980s and has never changed although the understanding of what is happening to wild salmon has much improved since then.\n\nWhat is more concerning is that Mr Murray is not just an actor and now podcaster, but also an ambassador for the Atlantic Salmon Trust and the Angling Trust. Clearly, these organisations are happy to involve people with extremely blinkered views. However, my experience with the Atlantic Salmon Trust is that even this supposed science-based organisation isn't interested in discussing any science except their own science.\n\nThere is far too much to cover from over 11 hours of podcast, so I am just focusing on one episode. This features Mikael Fr\u0151din, someone I have come across in person. The podcast describes Mikael as a Swedish salmon maestro who used to fish 250 days each season in his younger days but as well as being an expert angler, he is an ardent conservationist who says he will never stop fighting for the wild salmon.\n\nMr Fr\u0151din attended the London premiere of the Patagonia film Artifishal in which he appeared. He sat on the panel along with Corin Smith and Andrew Graham Stewart and to my shame I never asked any questions. I had been stopped at the door with a request to desist from speaking out which I agreed to in exchange for a meeting with Patagonia. Sadly, Patagonia reneged on this agreement, although later their European manager agreed to speak to me on the phone, but he wasn't interested in the slightest in hearing what I might have to say.\n\nMikael Fr\u0151din said on the podcast that it's obvious that the biggest threat to wild salmon is from fish farming. He came into public awareness because he swam out to a salmon pen in Norway to take photos. He was sued by the farming company as he contravened the Norwegian Aquaculture Act preventing anyone moving within 20 metres of a pen. The case received a great deal of publicity as did Mr Fr\u0151din. It doesn't seem to matter that he has done little else against salmon farming since as he continues to ride on that wave of publicity.\n\nIn the podcast, he says that if every salmon farm was taken out of the water, then within two decades, the salmon population will fully recover, but if the salmon industry is allowed to continue then within two decades, then all wild salmon will be gone. He says that the answer is to get all salmon farms into closed containment.\n\nMr Fr\u0151din reaches his conclusion from his experience in Norway where salmon farming can be found across almost all the coastline. In Scotland, the east coast rivers are free of salmon farming although some critics say that the decline on east coast rivers seen since 2011 is due to the fact that salmon smolts migrate north past salmon farms in Orkney and Shetland. Yet, prior to 2011, the east coast rivers were having their most fruitful years, and no-one suggested then that Orkney and Shetland farms were causing problems. These east coast rivers are now seriously under threat and blaming salmon farming will not stop the declines.\n\nRemoving salmon farms will not make any difference to wild salmon stocks, not just in the east but also in the west. This is because salmon farms are not the problem. The latest catch statistics published mid-May certainly don't give any hope for a recovery of the Loch Maree sea trout fishery even though the farm in Loch Ewe closed three years ago.\n\nSadly it has proved impossible to correct any of the misconceptions spread by this podcast. Jim Murray sees any attempt to challenge his narrative about salmon farming as the work of an industry with a highly paid publicity machine that is ready to bend the truth to suit its own cause.\n\nPodcasts are an extremely useful platform to provide open discussion of the issues but when that discussion simply becomes an echo chamber of unproven views, then all they are doing is hastening the prophecy of the last salmon.", "source": {"uri": "fishfarmermagazine.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Fish Farmer Magazine"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

The Government of Canada is committed to protecting wild salmon and promoting more sustainable aquaculture practices.\n\nToday, the Honourable Diane Lebouthillier, Minister of Fisheries, Oceans and the Canadian Coast Guard, announced that the Government of Canada will ban open net-pen salmon aquaculture in British Columbia coastal waters by June 30, 2029.\n\nA number of First Nations, coastal communities, and others in British Columbia rely on open net-pen aquaculture for their livelihood and prosperity. The Government of Canada will release a draft salmon aquaculture transition plan by the end of July, that will focus on:\n\nOver the coming months, federal departments, as part of a whole-of-government effort, will engage with those directly and indirectly affected by this transition to discuss how best to support them. This transition only applies to aquaculture practices in British Columbia, where Fisheries and Oceans Canada is the lead regulator for aquaculture. Elsewhere in Canada, where provinces and territories are the lead regulator, Fisheries and Oceans Canada respects their jurisdiction.\n\nTo facilitate a successful transition, Minister Lebouthillier also announced her intention to renew salmon aquaculture licences for five years. Effective July 1, 2024, these licences will come with stricter conditions to ensure improved management of sea lice on farmed fish, robust reporting requirements for industry, and additional monitoring of marine mammal interactions. These conditions will strengthen protections for wild species and the marine environment, while ensuring aquaculture facilities can operate safely during this transition period.\n\nAfter July 1, 2024, only marine or land-based closed-containment systems will be considered for salmon aquaculture licences in coastal British Columbia. The Government of Canada recognizes that such systems are likely to come with increased investment costs. To provide greater predictability, Minister Lebouthillier also announced her intention to issue nine-year licences to successful closed-containment production applicants.\n\nOver the past several years, the Department of Fisheries and Oceans heard a wide range of opinions, concerns, and views on open net-pen salmon aquaculture in coastal British Columbia. The Government of Canada is committed to ensuring a responsible, realistic, and achievable transition that will encourage innovative forms of aquaculture production for a more sustainable future.", "source": {"uri": "foreignaffairs.co.nz", "dataType": "news", "title": "foreignaffairs.co.nz"}, "authors": [{"uri": "mil_osi_publisher@foreignaffairs.co.nz", "name": "Mil-Osi Publisher", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aquaculture_of_salmonids", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Aquaculture of salmonids"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_of_Canada", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Government of Canada"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aquaculture", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Aquaculture"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Columbia", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "British Columbia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "British Columbia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fisheries_and_Oceans_Canada", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Fisheries and Oceans Canada"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Canada"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Nations_in_Canada", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "First Nations in Canada"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oncorhynchus", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Oncorhynchus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canadian_Coast_Guard", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Canadian Coast Guard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salmon", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Salmon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ottawa", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ottawa"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Ottawa"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Provinces_and_territories_of_Canada", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Provinces and territories of Canada"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocean", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ocean"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jurisdiction", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jurisdiction"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sea_louse", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sea louse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fish_farming", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fish farming"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marine_mammal", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Marine mammal"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Food/Fish_and_Seafood", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Food/Fish and Seafood", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Earth_Sciences/Oceanography", "label": "dmoz/Science/Earth Sciences/Oceanography", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Agriculture_and_Forestry/Aquaculture", "label": "dmoz/Business/Agriculture and Forestry/Aquaculture", "wgt": 38}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Agriculture/Aquaculture", "label": "dmoz/Science/Agriculture/Aquaculture", "wgt": 34}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Agriculture/Fisheries", "label": "dmoz/Science/Agriculture/Fisheries", "wgt": 32}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 48}], "image": null, "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9664156", "eventUri": "eng-9664156", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2392156862745098, "wgt": 155, "relevance": 1}

Let's get into it.\n\nIn today's edition:\n\n\u2192 Ottawa charts a controversial \"transition\" plan for British Columbia salmon farms.\n\nFISH FARMS -- Technically, it was Fisheries Minister DIANE LEBOUTHILLIER who announced news of the mega-compromise \"transition\" plan that could spell the end of open-net salmon farms on the coast of British Columbia. The roadmap was officially Lebouthillier's bailiwick.\n\nBut she was not the only face of the decision in B.C. on Wednesday.\n\nEnergy Minister JONATHAN WILKINSON held his own press conference in Vancouver. When he was fisheries minister back in 2019, the MP for North Vancouver first made the Liberals' campaign pledge to rid coastal waters of open-net pens when he was fisheries minister.\n\nWilkinson's turn at the lectern was an \"echo,\" in comms jargon, of Lebouthillier's long-promised decision. The former fisheries minister was flanked by a more recent former fisheries minister, JOYCE MURRAY, and Citizens' Services Minister TERRY BEECH.\n\n-- Fin spin: Lebouthillier's media advisory previewed a \"path forward for salmon aquaculture\" in B.C. Wilkinson's advisory was all about \"wild Pacific salmon protection.\"\n\nThe not-so-subtle messaging schism on the issue reflected a divide in the Liberal caucus, though everybody played nice on Wednesday.\n\nB.C. Liberal caucus chair TALEEB NOORMOHAMED and Richmond Centre MP WILSON MIAO joined Lebouthillier, whose Quebec riding includes the Gulf of St. Lawrence.\n\n\u2192 A quick refresher: An alliance of environmentalists, sportfishers, wilderness tourism operators and First Nations insist disease emanating from open-net pens harm wild salmon populations. The farmers, including those in coastal Indigenous communities, insist right back that technology minimizes negative impacts.\n\n-- Promise made, promise kept, mostly: Lebouthillier granted five-year licence renewals to existing open-net pens, but banned them as of June 30, 2029.\n\nThe minister committed to publishing a draft transition plan for the aquaculture industry this summer, with a final version to follow next year.\n\nShe spoke to the role fish farms could still play in food security. She intends to grant nine-year licences to closed-containment systems -- whether on land or in the water -- that don't interact with wild salmon.\n\n\u2192 Election-sized caveat: Canadians will go to the polls before the end of 2025, and could vote at least once more before the ban takes effect.\n\nConservatives have been cagey about their views, but fish farmers are keenly aware of shifting political winds in Ottawa.\n\n-- Diversity is our strength: Every Liberal at a mic nodded to robust debate behind closed doors. Noormohamed described the caucus talks as \"important and lively.\"\n\nWilkinson told Playbook that the salmon file is the top priority of every B.C. Liberal MP, though he acknowledged maritimers in the caucus room see the issue differently.\n\nNew Brunswick MP WAYNE LONG was vocally disappointed in his government.\n\nCabinet wasn't a slam dunk, either. \"You have different perspectives, and you have discussions and and at times you have arguments,\" Wilkinson said. \"And at the end of the day, you make a decision, and that decision belongs to every member of Cabinet.\"\n\n-- Sharp response: The news landed with a thud in the aquaculture sector and its suppliers, who argue that a five-year transition is too quick.\n\nFirst Nations leaders who support open-net farms held a fiery press conference. \"Our rights have been dismissed in favor of a privileged Liberal urban riding political narrative,\" said Hereditary Chief Hasheukumiss of the Ahousaht Nation.\n\nOof.\n\n-- The other side of the debate: KILIAN STEHFEST, a marine conservation specialist for the David Suzuki Foundation, applauded Ottawa's move in a statement -- but still cast a critical eye on the timelines.\n\n\"It's great to see the federal government commit to concrete deadlines, even though they do not meet the government's original commitment to transition from open-net pens by 2025 or the urgency of the moment given the dire state of many wild salmon runs.\n\n-- What's next: Lebouthillier's draft transition plan, which will inevitably invigorate a perennially polarized debate.\n\n-- Prime Minister JUSTIN TRUDEAU is in Housing Minister SEAN FRASER's Central Nova backyard. Families Minister JENNA SUDDS will join the pair for meetings with local students and educators, as well as an announcement -- at 2:15 p.m. local time -- related to the government's promised national school food program.\n\nTrudeau and Fraser will also \"visit a local farm to discuss female entrepreneurship and supports given to local school food programs.\"\n\n-- Deputy PM CHRYSTIA FREELAND will be in Vancouver, where she will visit a school and discuss the government's investments in a national school food program. She will hold a media availability at 1:15 p.m. local time, joined by ministers HARJIT SAJJAN and TERRY BEECH. At 7 p.m., she will meet with local students in an event that is closed to media.\n\n-- Green Leader ELIZABETH MAY will attend the Wabano Igniting the Spirit Gala 2024 from 5 to 9:30 p.m. at the Ottawa Conference and Event Centre in celebration of National Indigenous Peoples Day.\n\nCLOSING TIME -- The Ottawa airport will welcome an exodus tonight and tomorrow morning. The parliamentary precinct is about to fall blissfully silent.\n\nYes, it's adjournment time. MPs jetted from their chamber yesterday. Senators could've sat a few more days, but they're sick of the place. They plan to wrap up their work tonight.\n\nHello, summer solstice. Goodbye, parliamentarians.\n\n\u2192 Rush job on C-70: The foreign interference bill flew through the Senate only a week after receiving first reading. Monday's second-reading debate got spicy, but the government had the votes in the Senate -- including Conservatives. Add it to the royal assent queue.\n\n-- Backup plan: Senators could sit Friday if they don't clear the legislative decks today.\n\nMYSTERY SOLVED -- CHRYSTIA FREELAND flew to Washington on Monday to have dinner with U.S. Treasury Secretary JANET YELLEN.\n\nIt was a minor teeth-pulling exercise to extract details on the DPM's quick trip to Washington, described in her public itinerary as a \"working dinner with members of the U.S. Administration focused on Canada-U.S. economic co-operation.\"\n\n-- Also at the table: Canadian Ambassador KIRSTEN HILLMAN.\n\nSTOLTENBUDDIES -- NATO Secretary General JENS STOLTENBERG swung by the Sir John A. Macdonald Building for a speech and fireside chat, ahead of his dinner with PMJT.\n\nThe military alliance's honcho said meeting with allied world leaders is important in the lead-up to the NATO summit in Washington that runs July 9 to 11.\n\nThe one-day stop -- sandwiched by high-level talks in Washington, of course -- did not set off fireworks over Canada's failure to ratchet up defense spending to 2 percent of GDP.\n\nBut Stoltenberg talked about it.\n\n-- Back of the pack: Stoltenberg praised Canada as a \"highly valued\" ally and, speaking with reporters, offered that Canada's defense spend was at a \"very low level\" when it first made the 2 percent pledge in 2014.\n\n\"So, compared to some other allies, you have a longer way to go.\"\n\n-- Waiting on a plan: Still, Stoltenberg expects Canada, and the seven other allies that failed to reach the agreed upon spending floor this year, to produce a plan to meet its commitment.\n\nHe did not set a timeline for that expectation.\n\n-- Canada connection: In an armchair talk moderated by LISA LAFLAMME, Stoltenberg said his mother studied at McGill University and married a Canadian.\n\nThat's how he ended up meeting LEONARD COHEN, a friend of his father's, around 2010, when Stoltenberg was PM of Norway and Cohen visited Oslo for a concert.\n\nPlaybook caught up with the minister in Toronto last week, just after he delivered a Canadian Club speech on the care economy. We inquired about the state of labor relations.\n\nO'Regan makes a habit of keeping tabs on fractious bargaining tables.\n\nHe recalled the hard bargaining between WestJet pilots and their bosses in May 2023. During the talks, the minister spent nights in a string of Toronto airport hotels -- including one of the Sheratons, though \"not the fancy one attached to the terminal.\"\n\nThat negotiation is where our conversation starts. The interview transcript has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nWhat have unions and employers learned from each other over a series of tough negotiations in the post-pandemic era?\n\nOne of the lessons in WestJet was it was the first time those two sides had reached an agreement at a bargaining table. They'd only ever gotten an agreement that was imposed on them in some way, shape or form or back-to-work legislation. And so the animosities were just brewing, and our guys were telling me, \"I've rarely seen a more acrimonious table.\"\n\nBy the time I got in there, their arms were around one another. They cracked open another bottle of champagne. Both sides, but especially the pilots, were saying to me, \"We didn't know this feeling.\" This feeling of reaching an agreement with somebody who you've been at loggerheads for weeks, months, maybe years, and then you both take that leap together.\n\nIt's a huge moment, because you're suddenly going back and hopefully they'll catch you -- and they do.\n\nHow have both sides adapted their approach to bargaining?\n\nIt is worth noting that not one political party in the House of Commons asked for back-to-work legislation during those two weeks in B.C. ports. Not one. By that I mean Conservatives, and that'll tell you something, right? I keep repeating that, because I want all parties to understand that.\n\nLabor does hold sway right now. If you understand the market, it's simple supply and demand. There are fewer of them, and we need more. When they come to the table and ask for more, negotiate more -- and I think there's a growing acceptance that if you want to retain good employees, you pay more. That's just a demographic reality that has become a political reality that is increasingly becoming an economic and labor reality.\n\n-- The Hill Times brought the alliteration to this headline: Telford untouchable at the top of the 21st Terrific 25 Staffers list, as Conservatives sweep Most Knowledgeable and Best Spin.\n\nGeneral Motors posted a May 7 meeting about military procurement with a long list of federal officials, including Public Services and Procurement DM ARIANNE REZA; IAN FOUCHER, chief of staff to Industry Minister FRAN\u00c7OIS-PHILIPPE CHAMPAGNE; PMO strategic adviser on special projects JASON EASTON; HARRY ORBACH-MILLER, PMO senior coordinator of policy and Cabinet affairs; JASPINDER KOMAL, assistant deputy minister at National Defence; and MARY-ROSE BROWN, policy director to Procurement Minister JEAN-YVES DUCLOS.\n\nFrom the ethics files: Immigration Minister MARC MILLER recently recused himself from \"any discussion or decision relating to the appointment process of a Citizen Judge to avoid any opportunity to further the private interest of a family friend.\"\n\nPM JUSTIN TRUDEAU disclosed to the ethics commissioner four gifts given to him when he co-chaired a meeting at the self-governing Indigenous organizations permanent bilateral mechanism meeting in Gatineau.\n\n-- California reaches $15M settlement with Snapchat over alleged sex discrimination.\n\n-- Congress passes bipartisan nuclear bill in a bid to revive the struggling sector.\n\n-- Judge rejects Exxon lawsuit over shareholder climate activism.\n\nProps to BENEDICTA ARTHUR, DARRYL DAMUDE, JOHN ECKER, TRACY SALMON, JOANNA PLATER, ROBERT MCDOUGALL, CHELSEA BERRY, LISA KIRBIE, GERMAINE MALABRE, GORDON RANDALL, ROSS LECLAIR and MARCEL MARCOTTE.\n\nWant to grab the attention of movers and shakers on Parliament Hill?

The Government of Canada is committed to protecting wild salmon and promoting more sustainable aquaculture practices.\n\nToday, the Honorable Diane Lebouthillier, Minister of Fisheries, Oceans and the Canadian Coast Guard, announced that the Government of Canada will ban open-net pen salmon aquaculture in the coastal waters of British Columbia by June 30, 2029.\n\nA number of First Nations, coastal and other communities in British Columbia rely on open net pen aquaculture for their livelihood and prosperity. The Government of Canada will release a draft transition plan for salmon aquaculture by the end of July, which will focus on the following:\n\nhow to support First Nations, workers and communities in this transition, identifying economic support measures to use innovative and clean aquaculture technologies, milestones, principles and criteria for the phase-down of aquaculture open net pen salmon during the five-year license period, and management of open net pen salmon farming until the ban is fully implemented.\n\nOver the coming months, federal departments, as part of a whole-of-government effort, will work with all those directly and indirectly affected by this transition to discuss how best to support them. This transition only applies to aquaculture practices in British Columbia, where Fisheries and Oceans Canada is the primary regulator of aquaculture. Elsewhere in Canada, where provinces and territories are the primary regulatory bodies, Fisheries and Oceans Canada respects their jurisdiction.\n\nTo facilitate a successful transition, Minister Lebouthillier also announced her intention to renew salmon farming permits for a period of five years. Starting July 1, 2024, these permits will have stricter conditions, aimed at ensuring better management of sea lice on farmed fish, rigorous reporting requirements for industry, and monitoring additional interactions with marine mammals. These conditions will strengthen protections for wildlife and the marine environment, while ensuring that aquaculture facilities can operate safely during this transition period.\n\nAfter July 1, 2024, only marine or land-based closed containment systems will be considered for salmon farming licenses in coastal British Columbia. The Government of Canada recognizes that these systems are likely to result in increased investment costs. To ensure greater predictability, Minister Lebouthillier also announced her intention to issue nine-year permits to successful candidates for closed containment production.\n\nOver the past several years, the Department of Fisheries and Oceans has heard a wide range of opinions, concerns and perspectives on open-net pen salmon farming in coastal British Columbia. The Government of Canada is committed to ensuring a responsible, realistic and achievable transition that will encourage the most innovative forms of aquaculture production for a more sustainable future.\n\nEDITOR'S NOTE: This article is a translation.

After that, well, that's not going to sit well with us and we're not going to stand for it.\"\n\nThe press conference in Vancouver came immediately after the federal government announced it will ban open-net-pen salmon farming in five years after extending current licences to allow for companies to transition to land-based or closed-containment operations. The government had promised to phase out the farms by 2025.\n\n\"Our Nations have been the stewards of our coastal territories since time immemorial,\" a statement from the Coalition of First Nations for Finfish Stewardship (the Coalition) says. \"Due to human impact on wild Pacific salmon stocks since colonization, many Nations have had to evolve their salmon stewardship and food security to include salmon farming. As a result, the sector has become interwoven into the fabric of our communities over the past few decades, and anything less than a responsible, realistic, and achievable transition of this industry, as promised to us by the Government of Canada, will be unacceptable.\"\n\nThe Coalition says the federal government's salmon farming plan \"falls short\" of what member Nations discussed with the government. The Coalition will continue to participate in the ongoing transition process with the federal government towards closed containment systems. However, the process has to respect member nations' rights and objectives. The social and economic health of their communities is reliant on sustainable growth and the ability of the sector to attract investment, as finfish aquaculture supports meaningful employment in their territories.\n\nWhile the Coalition's statement professes cooperation, individual chiefs who spoke at Wednesday's press conference didn't mince words.\n\n\" As we're all aware of, a high paying job, a family supporting job, in a First Nations community is like four jobs anywhere else,\" Coalition spokesperson and Tlowitsis Acting Chief Dallas Smith said. \"With the unemployment that we face in our communities, with the downturn of Pacific salmon, with forest resources being managed the way that they are, we need to continue to find a way to economically support our people while building a sustainable path forward.\"\n\nThe decision was criticized on the basis of who it appeared to be appeasing.\n\n\"There's profound sadness and disappointment with the decision to prioritize the whims of so called environmentalists over the rights of the Gwa'sala-'Nakwaxda'xw Nations,\" said Chief Terry Walkus. \"This decision is an attempt to extinguish constitutionally-guaranteed rights and titles.\"\n\nDeputy Chief Isaiah Robinson, Kitasoo Xai'xais Nation, said, \"This is a political decision. This is not based on science or fact. But it's based on the appease of white privileged activists who fearmonger false data and build anti-fish farm narratives. This decision is the work of billionaires and activists who misguide and mislead Vancouverites.\"\n\nThese First Nations got into aquaculture because they provided opportunity for their communities.\n\n\"When colonization hit, our people were economically excluded, leading to the generational trauma of poverty,\" Chief Robinson said. \"We have decided to join this overall salmon aquaculture industry and build a business that could be great for our people. And based on the economics and social well being without compromising our traditional knowledge and stewardship efforts.\"\n\nThe decision is also incompatible with reconciliation, the chiefs said.\n\n\"I can't express enough this process is far from reconciliation,\" Chief George said. \"No longer can we trust Canada to do the right thing; to walk alongside of us with what I call 'reconcili-action.' Far too long has reconciliation been on the table. My grandfather, my father have gone through it. And right now I've had enough of it.

These are the following projects:\n\nThe Investment Agriculture Foundation of British Columbia will receive $3 million to work with Indigenous partners at the watershed level to determine climate change adaptation and mitigation goals. The Faculty of Geography, Earth and Environmental Sciences at the University of Northern British Columbia will receive $5 million for research into the effects of climate change on salmon ecosystems and, with collaborators from Fisheries and Oceans Canada and the Upper Fraser Fisheries Conservation Alliance, for improving hatchery infrastructure to enhance and conserve Chinook salmon. The Pacific Salmon Foundation will receive $3.98 million to help communities monitor climate change in freshwater salmon habitats, and enable local and large-scale planning for climate-resilient salmon ecosystems . The Nanwakolas Council Society will receive $2.86 million for the Nanwakolas 50 Watersheds Project, an Indigenous-led science and research partnership project aimed at better understanding the threats of climate change and forest management to salmon populations and their habitat, and to develop tools to deal with them.\n\nOther projects support habitat restoration, improved hatchery operations and sustainable sablefish aquaculture. The 15 projects announced today are essential to strengthening ecosystems and ensuring the long-term resilience of Pacific salmon, other fish species, and a robust seafood sector.\n\nEDITOR'S NOTE: This article is a translation.

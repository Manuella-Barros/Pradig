More than 100 others were hospitalized.\n\nLast August, food supplier Warabeya Nichiyo disclosed two instances of cockroaches being found inside its rice balls that were sold at a 7-Eleven convenience store in Saitama, north of Tokyo, according to Reuters.\n\nSome of the fast food chains selling the country's famous beef rice bowls and sushi were also subject to what was dubbed \"food terrorism\" pranks carried out by people licking shared soy sauce bottles or eating communal ginger with used chopsticks.\n\nPasco's recall has drawn a flurry of comments on social media from patrons torn between their love of the company's products and shock from the discovery.\n\nOne affected customer wrote on X: \"I was thinking whether I should put it in the freezer for the expiration date when I got the news ... I used to like the chojuku the best.\"\n\nSome took sarcastic aim at the company by referencing an advertisement for the bread.\n\nThe 15-second commercial, released months ago, features a family excitingly declaring their love of good toast as breakfast, accompanied by a voice-over saying: \"We put nothing unnecessary in it.\"\n\n\"\u2060I love chojuku bread. It is safe and contains no unnecessary ingredients. I also use it for my child's baby food,\" another person wrote on X.\n\n\"I bet it tastes good for small animals too,\" the user said.\n\nThe-CNN-Wire\n\n\u2122 & \u00a9 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

Kennedy, 70, made the claim in a 2012 deposition as part of his divorce from his second wife, according to the New York Times, which said the scion of the storied political clan reported severe memory loss and mental fog. A New York surgeon who reviewed his brain scans told Kennedy his health issues could have been \"caused by a worm that got into my brain and ate a portion of it and then died,\" he reportedly told attorneys. AFP has not independently reviewed the deposition.\n\nAn ad for the new iPad Pro on Wednesday caused an uproar for showing an industrial-sized hydraulic press crushing objects linked to human creativity -- such as a record player and trumpet -- into a sleek tablet. Social media users immediately criticized the ad, which was posted on X by Apple CEO Tim Cook, as painfully tone-deaf at a time when the creative community is worried about its future with the emergence of generative artificial intelligence. \"The destruction of the human experience. Courtesy of Silicon Valley,\" actor Hugh Grant wrote on X. Set to the song All I Ever Need is You by Sonny and Cher, the one-minute ad titled Crush sees the pile of creative artifacts, also including a piano and paint cans, explode under the pressure of Apple's press. \"I'm not sure 'wanton destruction of all the good and beautiful things in this world' was really the vibe you were trying for,\" X user Judd Baroff wrote.\n\nMore than 100,000 packets of sliced bread have been recalled after parts of a black rat's body were discovered inside two of them, the manufacturer said on Wednesday. Food recalls are rare in Japan, a country with famously high standards of sanitation, and Pasco Shikishima Corp said it was investigating how the rodent remains had crept into its products. The company said it was so far unaware of anyone falling sick after eating its processed white chojuku bread, long a staple of Japanese breakfast tables. About 104,000 packs of the bread have been recalled in mainland Japan, from Tokyo to the northern Aomori region. \"We would like to apologize deeply for causing trouble to our customers and clients,\" the company said in a statement on Tuesday. Then on Wednesday, Pasco confirmed that parts of a black rat had contaminated the two packs.\n\nPolice have arrested a senior official involved in talks with international organizations on labor reforms, state media said yesterday, adding that the action was linked to disclosure of classified information. The detention of Ministry of Labour, Invalids and Social Affairs Legal Affairs Department Director Nguyen Van Binh follows months of arrests of prominent experts and activists, in what some diplomats see as a further crackdown on civil society amid a major reshuffle of top political leaders in the communist-ruled country. Binh, 51, was charged with overseeing reforms to labor law on which he worked closely with the International Labour Organization, the ministry said on its Web site. Binh was detained on charges of intentionally revealing state secrets, the state-run Tuoi Tre newspaper said.", "source": {"uri": "taipeitimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Taipei Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Worm", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Worm"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_F._Kennedy", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "John F.

are rare in Japan, a country with famously high standards of sanitation\n\nMore than 100,000 packets of sliced bread have been recalled in Japan after parts of a black rat\u2019s body were discovered inside two of them, the manufacturer said Wednesday.\n\nFood recalls are rare in Japan, a country with famously high standards of sanitation, and Pasco Shikishima Corporation said it was investigating how the rodent remains had crept in to its products.\n\nThe company said it was so far unaware of anyone falling sick after eating its processed white \u201cchojuku\u201d bread, long a staple of Japanese breakfast tables.\n\nAround 104,000 packs of the bread have been recalled in mainland Japan, from Tokyo to the northern Aomori region.\n\nJapanese media reports said at least two people who bought the bread in Gunma Prefecture, northwest of Tokyo, complained to the company about finding a rodent in the bread.\n\n\u201cWe would like to apologise deeply for causing trouble to our customers and clients,\u201d the company said in a statement on Tuesday.\n\nThen on Wednesday, Pasco confirmed that parts of a black rat had contaminated the two packs.\n\nThey were produced by the bread maker at a factory in Tokyo, whose assembly line has been suspended pending its probe, Pasco said.\n\n\u201cWe will strengthen our quality management system to ensure there won\u2019t be a recurrence,\u201d it added.\n\nThe company, based in Nagoya city, central Japan, also makes rolls, bagels and muffins.\n\nCleanness and hygiene are taken seriously in Japan, but food poisonings and recalls occasionally make headlines.\n\nLast year, convenience store chain 7-Eleven apologised and announced recalls after a cockroach was found in a rice ball.\n\nEarlier this month, 1,000 children were sickened by milk and two people fell ill after eating steak at a restaurant.\n\nAnother recent health scare scandal in Japan was over the recall by drug maker Kobayashi Pharmaceutical of dietary supplements meant to lower cholesterol.\n\nThe firm said last month it was probing five deaths potentially linked to the products containing red yeast rice, or \u201cbeni koji\u201d.\n\nAdditional reporting by Associated

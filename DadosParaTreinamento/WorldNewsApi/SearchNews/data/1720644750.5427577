{"id": 231290316, "title": "\u2018Georgia Is Our Laboratory\u2019: Inside Trump\u2019s Plan to Rig 2024", "text": "T he presidential election this year will come down to seven states \u2014 but there\u2019s one that Donald Trump and his most committed lieutenants see as a blueprint for corrupting future local and national elections: Georgia. The Peach State is unique \u2014 it\u2019s the sole battleground state in which the Republican Party has total control over the levers of power: a trifecta in the state House, Senate, and governorship. Over the past four years, Trump-loving elements of the Georgia GOP have wielded that advantage in a crusade to convert discredited election-conspiracy theories into policies well ahead of Election Day 2024. It is an alarmingly anti-democratic experiment that Trumpland and much of the GOP hope to take national. \u201cGeorgia is our laboratory,\u201d a source close to the former president tells Rolling Stone. \u201cIf you can get this up and running in Georgia, you get a road map for other states, maybe the country as a whole.\u201d In 2020, top Georgia Republicans such as Gov. Brian Kemp and Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger managed to block Trump\u2019s attempts to illegally overturn the election results. Kemp earned Trump\u2019s fury by refusing to use what the then-president called \u201cemergency powers\u201d to stop the certification of Joe Biden\u2019s victory. In an infamous January 2021 phone call that helped lead to Trump\u2019s indictment in Fulton County, Raffensperger rebuffed the president\u2019s demands to \u201cfind\u201d him votes. Kemp and Raffensperger both won handily in their 2022 reelection runs. But ever since President Biden\u2019s inauguration, conservative activists and policymakers in Georgia have tried to bypass Raffensperger and worked diligently to turn Trump\u2019s heads-I-win-tails-you-lose philosophy of elections into public policy. As Trump has continued to lie that the 2020 election was \u201cstolen\u201d and \u201crigged\u201d , the former president and his supporters have been making concrete, step-by-step progress in shaping electoral processes to his benefit. Across the state, MAGA die-hards are devoting considerable resources to purging voter rolls, intimidating election officials, employing legal dirty tricks, and ousting Republican officials and election appointees who haven\u2019t been initiated into the cult of Trump. Republican operatives have remade Georgia\u2019s state election board, executive branch, Legislature, and legal ecosystems, all in Donald Trump\u2019s image. Conservatives in the state Assembly have unleashed thousands of voter eligibility challenges on county election boards \u2014 an effort that will be turbocharged with a new election law. Lawmakers also worked to limit Raffensperger\u2019s role in overseeing elections, while sapping resources for election administration. Conservative activists heckle election officials on a regular basis with the conspiracy theories Trump birthed, and an indicted election denier \u2014 now the state\u2019s lieutenant governor \u2014 pushes Trump\u2019s agenda in the Assembly as he eyes higher office. Trump sits atop this sprawling network, receiving updates on progress from political advisers and other MAGA acolytes. Lawyers close to Trump are already preparing for the former president to claim fraud in Georgia and challenge the results of the election \u2014 even in the event that he wins \u2014 just to prove a point about imaginary \u201cfraud\u201d in Democratic areas. \u201cThere\u2019s massive fraud, so that should be \u2026 solved, no matter who wins in Georgia or any state,\u201d says one lawyer and conservative-movementarian who has discussed the matter with Trump, although they present no evidence to back such claims. \u201cYou can\u2019t let the left get away with it just because their cheating did not work.\u201d None of this may be necessary. If the election were held today, polls suggest Trump would win Georgia outright. But to the Trump faithful, that is almost beside the point. In the past four years, Trump and his allies have been doing everything they can to make sure that a Republican defeat in Georgia simply cannot happen again \u2014 and to entrench a permanent GOP majority in a deeply divided state. It\u2019s happening throughout the country: Nearly every leader who matters in various state GOPs, the national Republican Party, and within the conservative movement is playing part in a well-funded, coordinated attempt to corrupt American elections in a way so transparently cynical, so authoritarian, that it makes the right\u2019s \u201cvoter fraud\u201d crackdowns of the pre-Trump era look like a flicker of intellectual calm by comparison. In Georgia, with Election Day just months away, the effects of these Trump-backed initiatives can be felt in every corner of the state\u2019s political environment, from the governor\u2019s mansion to the local election officials increasingly facing threats and intimidation, all the way down to the everyday residents who are forced by conservative activists to defend their right to vote. \u201cThe effort to suppress the vote in Georgia happens year-round, and the countereffort needs to be equally, if not more, robust,\u201d says Saira Draper, a Democratic state representative who worked on voter-protection issues for the Biden campaign in 2020. \u201cInstead of investing in voter protection only in big election years, Democrats need to be at the forefront of defending democracy every day, and for every election.\u201d With both the Biden and Trump presidential campaigns privately bracing for an extraordinarily close election in November \u2014 and a possible protracted legal battle in the aftermath \u2014 any minor change at the margins on either side could help make the difference between a Trump victory or loss in the state. And Trump and Georgia Republicans have made it abundantly clear they aren\u2019t willing to leave the electoral outcome up to chance. \u201cEverybody is gearing up for full-blown warfare,\u201d says a Republican source close to Trump who has worked on \u201celection integrity\u201d efforts. \u201cThe campaign, the RNC, everyone is going to be fighting Biden\u2019s team over every single inch, and each bit of process.\u201d IN THE WAKE of Trump\u2019s loss and record-breaking voter turnout in 2020, Republicans enacted a series of sweeping laws to suppress the vote. SB 202, the \u201cElection Integrity Act,\u201d passed in 2021, restricted early voting and ballot drop boxes and limited mail-in-ballots. It also made it illegal to provide water or food to people waiting in line to vote. And it limited the secretary of state\u2019s role on the state election board \u2014 a move to punish Raffensperger. Despite the bad blood between Trump and Kemp, the Georgia governor signed the bill, dubbed \u201cJim Crow in the 21st century \u201d by Biden, into law. Perhaps most important, the law massively expanded the number of challenges that activists can file contesting the validity of voter registrations in their county \u2014 opening up more voters to pernicious nuisance challenges to their right to vote. MAGA activists have flooded the state with tens of thousands of baseless voter-eligibility claims. Everybody is gearing up for full-blown warfare. \u2014Republican source close to Trump One Fulton County resident had her voter registration challenged by a third party on the suspicion that she had listed an invalid address, despite living at the same home since 2011. Atlanta\u2019s mayor and city council moved unanimously in 2018 to change the name of her street, as part of an effort to rid the city of its Confederate iconography. Thanks to Georgia Republicans, that street-name change was used as a rationale to try to disenfranchise her. \u201cI just feel like this is a waste of my time and also my kids\u2019 time,\u201d she told county officials at a 2023 hearing. \u201cI\u2019m here when I have other things to do,\u201d she said. \u201cI have a job.\u201d Many challengers rely on data from a website known as VoteRef. The site is a subsidiary of Restoration Action Inc., an election-denial group backed by the billionaire Trump donor and cardboard-box magnate Richard Uihlein. VoteRef purports to offer a user-friendly interface for aggregated government voter-registration data. But Kristin Nabers, the state director for the nonprofit voting-rights group All Voting Is Local, says the site \u201cis using a voter roll for Georgia from November 2022. It\u2019s a year-and-a-half-old voter roll that is massively out of date. The secretary of state did a list cleanup in 2023, none of which is reflected on VoteRef. These sites are just not reliable.\u201d The wave of voter challenges has been exacerbated by new rules in how the state funds its elections. For years, election officials in Georgia and around the country have benefited from grants and donations from private foundations. Now, just as county election boards grapple with the overwhelming weight of mass challenges, officials will have fewer resources available to manage them. Last year, Republicans made Georgia one of the first states to ban private charitable contributions for election administration in 2024. The move was part of a nationwide campaign by MAGA activists to block those donations, which they call \u201cZuckerbucks,\u201d based on the prominent role of Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg in funding nonpartisan election-support charities. \u201cI consider Facebook to be an enemy of the people\u201d for Zuckerberg\u2019s role in funding election-administration charities, Trump told CNBC in March. County election boards have dismissed most of the challenges resulting from SB 202. However, a Republican law that Kemp signed in early May offers new guidance to county election boards, and could lead to more voter-registration challenges being upheld on thin evidence before the 2024 election. Under the National Voter Registration Act, states are required to finish cleaning their voter rolls 90 days before federal elections. The new Georgia law, however, sets its moratorium on registration challenges at 45 days before an election \u2014 which some experts argue is a violation of the NVRA. \u201cThe 45-day quiet period is trying to bypass the 90-day quiet period the NVRA has. You don\u2019t have a quiet period unless what you\u2019re trying to do is list maintenance under another name. That gives away the game right there,\u201d one Georgia election official says. The official adds that with the new law, \u201cif a voter gets caught up in a challenge, they are never going to get the opportunity to reregister if they were inappropriately removed.\u201d To the former president, however, these voter-suppression laws do not go far enough. During his time out of office, Trump has noted to close advisers that while the state\u2019s voting overhaul does \u201csome nice things,\u201d the changes won\u2019t matter unless, in Trump\u2019s words, \u201cyou get the fucking RINOs out of the way,\u201d according to a source with direct knowledge of the ex-president\u2019s opinions on the matter. AS REPUBLICANS HAVE overloaded local election boards with frivolous voter challenges, they have also worked to reshape the state board overseeing elections \u2014 and make it more MAGA. Trump has played a key role here, behind the scenes. Ed Lindsey, a Republican member of the state election board, landed in the former president\u2019s crosshairs after he opposed an end to no-excuse mail-in voting, which allows registered voters to submit their ballot by mail without providing a reason. In recent months, Trump spent time calling Georgia lawmakers and fellow MAGA hard-liners in the state to ask them about Lindsey and to demand that he be shown the door, somehow. \u201cHe\u2019s got to go,\u201d Trump said privately, noting Lindsey\u2019s position on the \u201cvery important\u201d election board, according to two sources familiar with the matter. Lindsey\u2019s vote against recommending that the Legislature curb voting by mail was just one in a series of moves that infuriated the MAGA activists who have become influential in the state party. He also took a hard line on the bogus claims of election fraud made by the conspiracy nonprofit True the Vote, which recently had to admit in federal court that it had no evidence for voter-fraud claims it had put before the board of elections. Lindsey\u2019s principles did not sit well with the MAGA movement, which sprang into action. The DeKalb County Republican Party demanded Lindsey\u2019s resignation, claiming newfound conflicts of interest on his part. That position was echoed by a host of conservative media outlets and at least one think tank with ties to Trump. The final straw came in May. At a meeting of the state election board, Lindsey refused to join calls for the Georgia attorney general to investigate Fulton County\u2019s audit of the 2020 election \u2014 long a rallying cry for election deniers. On May 15, the far-right activists got their wish when Lindsey abruptly resigned his post on the state election board. Republican state House Speaker Jon Burns announced that he would replace Lindsey with Janelle King, a Republican media pundit in Georgia who supported Trump in 2020 and said on her podcast that she is \u201cagainst no-excuse\u201d voting by mail. Lindsey, a holdover appointment from the previous speaker, had already served a term on the board and expressed a willingness to continue serving throughout the 2024 election, or until Burns found a replacement for him, according to a copy of his resignation letter obtained by Rolling Stone. In the letter to Burns, which came shortly after the contentious May election-board meeting, Lindsey indicated that the speaker prompted his exit: \u201cIn our talk yesterday, you informed me that you have found someone to appoint and wish to do so this week.\u201d In an email to friends and colleagues announcing his departure, also obtained by Rolling Stone, Lindsey revealed the pressure the state\u2019s election officials will face, including from conspiracy theorists, in the upcoming election. \u201cTogether they must not only be strong and diligent enough to root out those who wish to cheat the system through fraud or suppression, but also wise and judicious enough to identify, expose, and call out others who cynically spread false claims of the same for cheap personal or partisan gain,\u201d he wrote. The move to implement a more MAGA elections agenda in Georgia has been a bottom-up process as well as a top-down one. Across the state, conspiracy theorists have begun to populate the ranks of election boards in places like Spalding County, giving Trump\u2019s election lies a more powerful constituency than they enjoyed in 2020. \u201cThe MAGA movement will be set for life if Donald Trump and the party can purge the RINOs from Georgia,\u201d says the Republican source close to Trump. \u201cIn the last [presidential] election, there were too many establishment Republicans standing in the way. They are why Georgia fell to Joe Biden.\u2026 If we beat them back there, which we couldn\u2019t in 2022, you\u2019re clearing out the losers who want to go back to the party of Bush or McCain.\u201d Deep within Trumpworld, preliminary planning is underway, spearheaded by attorneys and others close to the former president, to challenge the results and supposed fraud in Georgia\u2019s Democratic strongholds. Already, at least a handful of influential Republicans in Georgia have moved in a similar direction. In the state\u2019s November 2023 elections, four Republican board members on three Georgia county-election boards refused to certify the results of the elections, citing concerns about voting machines, reminiscent of Trump\u2019s lies in 2020. During Georgia\u2019s presidential primary in March, Fulton County Republican Board of Elections member Julie Adams refused to certify the results of a primary contest that Trump won without question. In May, Adams sued the board with help from lawyers at the Trump-connected nonprofit America First Policy Institute \u2014 seeking judicial backing for her claims that Board of Elections members have the authority to deny the certification of election results. Democrats see Adams\u2019 move as part of a pattern. \u201cThe MAGA Republicans have made it clear they are planning to try to block certification of November\u2019s election, and this is a transparent attempt to set the stage for that fight,\u201d the Georgia Democratic Party said in a statement responding to Adams\u2019 suit. TRUMP\u2019S YEARS-LONG election-denial campaign has unleashed a darker tide of threats toward election officials. The intimidation of election workers has grown to such a peak that the Justice Department had to create a special Election Threats Task Force to prosecute what Attorney General Merrick Garland earlier this year called \u201ca deeply disturbing spike in threats against those who serve the public.\u201d In January, Gabriel Sterling, a Republican and the chief operating officer in Raffensperger\u2019s office, was the victim of a \u201cswatting\u201d call \u2014 an attempt to trick armed police into rushing a victim\u2019s home on false pretenses. Around the same time, Georgia\u2019s state assembly received a bomb threat. The secretary of state\u2019s office has had to prepare for a range of different security contingencies as the 2024 election gets closer. \u201cInterest gets elevated, as do emotions, so that is something that we are assessing,\u201d Raffensperger tells Rolling Stone. His office has set up regular meetings with county election officials and law enforcement to carry out tabletop exercises examining a host of different potential threats, some of them fairly exotic. \u201cSomeone sent a fentanyl-laced letter several months ago to Fulton County,\u201d Raffensperger says. The attack targeted election officials in Georgia and Washington state. \u201cWithin days of that happening, we worked with state public health and we were able to get Narcan to all 109 counties and do a training session for everybody who was at our big state conference,\u201d explains Sterling. \u201cWe had public health come and do training on that for about 45 minutes, and we distributed it all.\u201d For Sara Tindall Ghazal, the Georgia state election board\u2019s lone Democrat, the prospects of violence and intimidation loom heavy. \u201cI am worried about more-aggressive voter-intimidation efforts,\u201d she says. \u201cI am worried about people getting in the back of a truck with AR-15s and giant flags, and driving past polling places.\u201d Tindall Ghazal, who is battling cancer, recounts how she had to reach out to police \u201cafter a pointed email talking about treason and the death penalty\u201d landed in her inbox. \u201cI had police patrol in front of my house before a particularly controversial meeting,\u201d Tindall Ghazal says. At the time, the state election board was convening to consider a push by Republicans in the state Assembly to give the body the authority to investigate Raf-fensperger over his handling of the 2020 election. At another meeting, Tindall Ghazal tried to explain that voters had already reelected Raffensperger by a commanding majority in 2022. The crowd erupted in shouts of denunciation. \u201cI am the one person who they literally yell at in meetings. I can\u2019t tell you the number of times I\u2019ve had to stop speaking because I\u2019m getting yelled over,\u201d she says. \u201cAny time I talk about the fact that the 2020 election was legitimate, they just start yelling,\u201d she says. FOR TRUMP AND HIS FOLLOWERS, the right\u2019s multipronged offensive to influence Georgia\u2019s election process isn\u2019t just about 2024. Since last year, Trump has regularly asked confidants whether Georgia\u2019s Republican Lt. Gov. Burt Jones would make a good governor. A hard-line MAGA conservative, Jones served as one of Trump\u2019s fake electors in Georgia during the then-president\u2019s endeavor to overturn the 2020 election results. The day before the Jan. 6 riot, Jones was in Washington, D.C., trying to convince Vice President Mike Pence to go along with Trump\u2019s coup plot. Jones\u2019 efforts earned him scrutiny from state law enforcement. In April, a special prosecutor was appointed to probe his role in the 2020 Georgia election-subversion scheme. In Trump\u2019s private discussions of Jones, he likes to note that Jones is \u201cvery loyal,\u201d and has frequently suggested that Jones would be a \u201cstrong\u201d leader for Georgia, two people familiar with the situation say. As lieutenant governor, Jones replaced a Republican critical of Trump. Now, Jones is aiming for higher office. There\u2019s no guarantee that Jones secures a Trump endorsement, much less the Republican nomination. But the election of an indicted election denier to the state\u2019s highest office would represent a stunning and four-year-belated victory for the MAGA movement. And for a thoroughly Trumpified GOP, that\u2019s the goal. \u201cIt is Donald Trump\u2019s party,\u201d says a GOP source close to Trump. \u201cEvery conservative state is gonna act like it, and there\u2019s nowhere more important for winning that battle than Georgia.\u201d", "summary": "Team Trump sees Georgia as \u2018a road map\u2019 for putting Trump\u2019s heads-I-win-tails-you-lose philosophy of elections into practice", "url": "https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-features/trump-georgia-laboratory-rig-2024-1235034510/", "image": "https://www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/R1389_NAT-AFF_Georgia.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-08 14:00:00", "author": "Adam Rawnsley,Andrew Perez,Asawin Suebsaeng", "authors": ["Adam Rawnsley", "Andrew Perez", "Asawin Suebsaeng"], "language": "en", "catgory": "politics", "source_country": "us", "sentiment": 0.081}

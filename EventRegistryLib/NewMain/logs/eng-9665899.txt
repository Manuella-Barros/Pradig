As I mentioned on NHL Network on Wednesday, the Ottawa Senators pushed for Ullmark during the season and have recently circled back in a big way. ... Ottawa is also believed to be on [Ullmark's no-trade] list, but two separate sources have told me he would accept a trade to the Senators if a deal between the two teams is finalized.\"\n\nSeveral reports have tabbed the Senators -- whose team save percentage of .884 ranked 31st of 32 teams last season -- as a franchise in hot pursuit of Ullmark.\n\nBruce Garrioch of the Ottawa Sun reported in May that Ottawa tried to acquire Ullmark at the trade deadline in March. Citing a league executive, Garrioch added that \"the Senators would likely have to offer [defenseman] Jakob Chychrun along with a first-round pick and another selection to acquire Ullmark.\"\n\nWhile the Senators currently hold both the No. 7 pick and No. 25 pick in this upcoming draft, Ottawa senior vice president Dave Poulin acknowledged earlier this month that the Sens would move that No. 7 selection for the right price this offseason.\n\nAcquiring any first-round selection in exchange for Ullmark would be viewed as a nice haul for Boston, especially when factoring in the added cap space that comes with moving Ullmark's $5 million cap hit off the books.\n\nBut adding a top-10 selection or a top-four fixture like Chychrun would be a steal for Boston, especially given Ullmark's standing as a luxury on the Bruins' roster.\n\nOttawa's interest in Ullmark doesn't seem to have any waned following Wednesday's flurry of goalie moves.\n\n\"While league sources told Postmedia earlier in the day the Senators had already had stepped up their efforts to acquire goaltender Linus Ullmark from the Boston Bruins, Ottawa may be the last serious team in the mix,\" Garrioch wrote in a story published Wednesday, adding: \"League sources say the Senators have circled back to the Bruins to see if there's a fit to acquire Ullmark to steady the club's struggling net and those talks have intensified.\"\n\nGiven the rumored returns linked to the Bruins in a deal involving Ottawa, Boston likely would have no qualms about moving Ullmark to another team in the Atlantic Divison.\n\nBut it might come down to whether or not Ullmark, who is entering the final year of his contract, would want to entrench himself on an Ottawa roster high on talent, but lacking in defensive fortitude.\n\nOttawa may not be as appealing of a destination for a goalie as, say, the Devils or the Hurricanes.\n\nBut if Ullmark is willing to sign off on a trade (especially if he secures a long-term contract in the process), the Bruins' best shot of landing a sizable return for their talented netminder likely rests with a desperate team like Ottawa.", "source": {"uri": "boston.com",

You have to stay very flexible.\"\n\nIf the Senators are really willing to play ball with such a lofty draft pick, a Bruins team woefully short on high-end talent in their prospect pipeline would definitely be interested.\n\nOf course, the main hurdle in any deal would involve Ullmark and the no-trade protection that he currently features -- with a rebuilding team like Ottawa not exactly a squad that players in high demand are lining up to join.\n\nBut what about the New Jersey Devils -- an East Coast squad primed to contend, so long as they address a major deficiency in net?\n\nApproving a trade to New Jersey feels far more likely for Ullmark than a move to Ottawa, especially if he can carve out a featured role on a New Jersey team primed for a bounce-back campaign.\n\nIt just so happens that the Devils are also in possession of the No. 10 pick -- and are reportedly willing to listen to offers about it to fix a goalie grouping that ranked 30th in the NHL in save percentage (.885).\n\nEarlier this month, Devils GM Tom Fitzgerald told NHL.com's Mike G. Morreale he'd be willing to move that first-round selection for the proper return.\n\n\"If we feel it helps us now and in the foreseeable future, then, yes, I'm listening,\" Fitzgerald said. \"I haven't gotten anything yet but the more I talk to teams, I say 'Listen, I'm open to moving No. 10, but it's going to have to be something [significant].\"\n\nA 30-year-old goalie with a Vezina Trophy on his resume like Ullmark sure seems like a significant return for the Devils, who have already identified netminding as their top priority this offseason.\n\n\"I'm in the goalie market talking to teams, but there's a 'but' and the 'but' is 'how do we want to build our team?'\" Fitzgerald said. \"We'd like to add up front, we'd like to add on the back end, so what are those pieces going to cost us. With the goaltending, what's that going to cost us?\n\nAs tempting as an NHLer like Martin Necas could be as the primary return in a Ullmark deal, a top-10 pick might offer the highest possible return for the Bruins as they try to secure top value for a prime asset.\n\nBoston not in possession of a first-round pick this year, and the Bruins also didn't select in the first round of the 2018, 2020, 2022, and 2023 drafts.\n\nWith talented centers like Cayden Lindstrom, Tij Iginla, and Berkly Catton expected to be within that top-10 range, the Bruins could bolster their most pressing need internally as far as talent down the middle.\n\nSigning a top-six center this offseason like Elias Lindholm would certainly move the needle for Boston in 2024-25. But if the Bruins are realistically trying to add a franchise, 80-plus point center for the long haul, the most realistic avenue is through the draft.\n\nIf the Bruins are looking to make the most out of moving a top asset like Ullmark, a top-10 selection might be the best haul they're going to get.", "source": {"uri": "bostonglobe.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Boston Globe"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ottawa_Senators", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ottawa Senators"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draft_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Draft (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linus_Ullmark", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Linus Ullmark"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ottawa", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ottawa"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Ottawa"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defenceman", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Defenceman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Hockey_League", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "National Hockey League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jakob_Chychrun", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jakob Chychrun"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bo_Horvat", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bo Horvat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cory_Schneider", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cory Schneider"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ottawa_Sun", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ottawa Sun"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vancouver_Canucks", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Vancouver Canucks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vezina_Trophy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Vezina Trophy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NHL_Entry_Draft", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NHL Entry Draft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goaltender", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Goaltender"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dave_Poulin", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dave Poulin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Fitzgerald_(ice_hockey)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tom Fitzgerald (ice hockey)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ottawa_Citizen", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ottawa Citizen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Jersey_Devils", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "New Jersey Devils"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alex_DeBrincat", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Alex DeBrincat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Jersey", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "New Jersey"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New Jersey"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detroit", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Detroit"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Detroit"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyler_Bertuzzi", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tyler Bertuzzi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Ne\u010das", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Martin Ne\u010das"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elias_Lindholm", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Elias Lindholm"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_manager", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "General manager"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Paintball/Teams", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Paintball/Teams", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Robotics/Competitions", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Robotics/Competitions", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Moving_and_Relocating/Moving", "label": "dmoz/Home/Moving and Relocating/Moving", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Locks", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Locks", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Charts", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Charts", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://bostonglobe-prod.cdn.arcpublishing.com/resizer/myzSmudjDN_nwWeZPr4uCMTh2eE=/506x0/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/bostonglobe/TUTUBC775VM6EEDMKHSSA4HJ5Q.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9665899", "eventUri": "eng-9665899", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1294117647058823, "wgt": 224, "relevance": 1}

You have to stay very flexible.\"\n\nIf the Senators are really willing to play ball with such a lofty draft pick, a Bruins team woefully short on high-end talent in their prospect pipeline would definitely be interested.\n\nOf course, the main hurdle in any deal would involve Ullmark and the no-trade protection that he currently features -- with a rebuilding team like Ottawa not exactly a squad that players in high demand are lining up to join.\n\nBut what about the New Jersey Devils -- an East Coast squad primed to contend, so long as they address a major deficiency in net?\n\nApproving a trade to the Tri-State Area feels far more likely for Ullmark than a move to Ottawa, especially if he can carve out a featured role on a New Jersey team primed for a bounce-back campaign.\n\nAnd it just so happens that the Devils are also in possession of the No. 10 pick -- and are reportedly willing to listen to offers about it to fix a goalie grouping that ranked 30th in the NHL in save percentage (.885).\n\nSpeaking earlier this month, Devils GM Tom Fitzgerald told NHL.com's Mike G. Morreale he'd be willing to move that first-round selection for the proper return.\n\n\"If we feel it helps us now and in the foreseeable future, then, yes, I'm listening,\" Fitzgerald said. \"I haven't gotten anything yet but the more I talk to teams, I say 'Listen, I'm open to moving No. 10, but it's going to have to be something (significant).\"\n\nA 30-year-old goalie with a Vezina Trophy on his resume like Ullmark sure seems like a significant return for the Devils, who have already identified netminding as their top priority this offseason.\n\n\"I'm in the goalie market talking to teams, but there's a 'but' and the 'but' is 'how do we want to build our team?'\" Fitzgerald said. \"We'd like to add up front, we'd like to add on the back end, so what are those pieces going to cost us. With the goaltending, what's that going to cost us?\n\nAs tempting as an NHLer like Martin Necas could be as the primary return in a Ullmark deal, a top-10 pick might offer the highest possible return for the Bruins as they try to secure top value for a prime asset.\n\nNot only is Boston not in possession of a first-round pick this year, they didn't select in the first round of the 2018, 2020, 2022, and 2023 drafts.\n\nWith talented centers like Cayden Lindstrom, Tij Iginla, and Berkly Catton expected to be within that top-10 range, the Bruins could bolster their most pressing need internally as far as talent down the middle.\n\nSigning a top-six center this offseason like Elias Lindholm would certainly move the needle for Boston in 2024-25. But if the Bruins are realistically trying to add a franchise, 80+-point pivot for the long haul, the most realistic avenue for that is through the draft.\n\nAnd if the Bruins are looking to make the most out of moving a top asset like Ullmark, a top-10 selection might be the best haul they're going to get.", "source": {"uri": "boston.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Boston"}, "authors":

As unlikely as that may seem given the expected raise for Swayman as well as the Bruins' other needs that need to be addressed.\n\nBut Wednesday came with one team officially ruled out of the equation should an Ullmark trade have to come from the Bruins with this summer, as New Jersey found their next No. 1 goalie by way of a trade with Calgary for Jacob Markstrom. To bring Markstrom to New Jersey, the Devils parted with defenseman Kevin Bahl, as well as a top-10 protected first-round pick in 2025, while the Flames retained 31 percent of Markstrom's salary to bring his cap hit down to $4.125 million per season.\n\nGeneral manager Tom Fitzgerald and the Devils entered the offseason openly acknowledging that they needed a goalie, and there was even talk that they had let other teams know that the No. 10 overall pick in the 2024 NHL Draft was in play in potential trade talks. The price paid for the 34-year-old Markstrom, who has another two years left on his contract and is coming off a 2023-24 campaign that featured 23 wins and a .905 save percentage in 48 games, ultimately did not get that high for Fitzgerald's club.\n\nThe obvious 'bummer' from the B's point of view with this trade comes with the fact that if location has played a factor in his willingness or unwilling to use his trade protection, it's hard to find a team in need of a goalie that's closer to Boston (and in turn closer to Sweden) than New Jersey. The Devils' aforementioned willingness to pay a first-round pick to address their goalie also played to the Black and Gold's desires and needs with a potential Ullmark trade, with Sweeney openly referencing the 2013 trade that saw then-Canucks goalie Cory Schneider traded for a top-10 pick when discussing goalie returns, giving you a slight idea as to what he and the pick-deficient Bruins would target in a potential trade.\n\nNow, the good news within that Markstrom-to-NJ trade comes with the Devils sending a first-round pick and more out the door to acquire Markstrom. It's perhaps not an apples-to-apples kind of comparison given the fact that Markstrom has two years left on his current contract while Ullmark has just one, it is worth mentioning that Ullmark is both younger and has better numbers of late.\n\nIn essence, the Bruins still should be able to get something of legitimate value in a potential Ullmark deal.\n\nThe Sens are still interested in adding a goalie (and willing to pay a premium), and same for the Kings, who tried to make a play for Ullmark at the 2024 trade deadline before Ullmark reportedly nixed a trade. But Ullmark's trade protection will ultimately remain the greatest obstacle, as Ullmark still possesses an insanely player-friendly trade list, and with that list set to go from 16 teams to 15 teams in 2024-25.\n\nUllmark, who won 22 games and posted a .915 save percentage in 40 games last season, is entering the final year of a contract that comes with a $5 million cap hit.", "source": {"uri": "985thesportshub.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "98.5 The Sports Hub - Boston's Home For Sports"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeremy_Swayman", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jeremy Swayman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacob_Markstr\u00f6m", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jacob Markstr\u00f6m"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linus_Ullmark", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Linus Ullmark"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Jersey", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New Jersey"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New Jersey"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Bahl", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kevin Bahl"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don_Sweeney", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Don Sweeney"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defenceman", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Defenceman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Restricted_free_agent", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Restricted free agent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calgary", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Calgary"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Calgary"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Fitzgerald_(ice_hockey)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tom Fitzgerald (ice hockey)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NHL_Entry_Draft", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NHL Entry Draft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_manager", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "General manager"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sweden", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sweden"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Sweden"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cory_Schneider", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cory Schneider"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Day_Trading", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Day Trading", "wgt": 28}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Commodities_and_Futures", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Commodities and Futures", "wgt": 24}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Trading", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Trading", "wgt": 28}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Business_Services/Barter", "label": "dmoz/Business/Business Services/Barter", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/International_Business_and_Trade/Associations", "label": "dmoz/Business/International Business and Trade/Associations", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 87}], "image": "https://985thesportshub.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/88/2024/04/USATSI_22930188_168399896_lowres.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9665899", "eventUri": "eng-9665899", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1137254901960785, "wgt": 215, "relevance": 1}

And mere hours later, the Kings (who tried to make a play for Ullmark at the 2024 trade deadline before Ullmark reportedly nixed a would-be trade) decided to address their goalie issue with a reunion, with Darcy Kuemper brought back to Los Angeles from Washington in a one-for-one trade for Pierre-Luc Dubois. That trade was as much about getting out of the Dubois contract as it was getting a goaltender, as the Kings were days away from Dubois and his no-movement clause kicking in and his signing bonus being paid out.\n\nBut the Ullmark trade market is not dead. Far from it, in fact, as the goaltending carousel has reportedly led to the Senators 'stepping up' for their efforts to make a play for the 2023 Vezina winner.\n\n\"Knowing there wasn't a fit with Calgary, league sources say that Steve Staios, the Senators president of hockey operations and general manager, has been making a hard push to try to acquire Ullmark,\" Sens insider Bruce Garrioch wrote for the Ottawa Citizen on Wednesday evening. \"League sources say the Senators have circled back to the Bruins to see if there's a fit to acquire Ullmark to steady the club's struggling net and those talks have intensified.\"\n\nThis is not the first time that the Senators have been linked to Ullmark, with earlier reports indicating that the Senators were going to make him a top priority this summer and were willing to pay a premium for him. Ottawa's interest in the 6-foot-5 Ullmark also makes all the sense in the world, as the Sens are coming off what was a downright pitiful 2023-24 year in goal, with 3.43 goals against per game (fifth-worst in the NHL) and a team save percentage of .885 (second-worst in the league).\n\nGiven that the Flames were able to secure a first-round pick in the deal that sent the older (and with worse numbers) Markstrom to New Jersey, and considering Ottawa's similarly desperate thirst for goaltending help, it stands to reason that the Bruins would begin any talks with the Sens asking about a first-round pick in return.\n\nAnd the Senators do possess two first-round picks in this year's draft, their natural coming at No. 7 overall, while they also possess the No. 25 overall pick, which originally belonged to Boston but was sent to Ottawa from Detroit in last year's trade for Alex DeBrincat. There's been rumblings that the Sens are interested in shopping their first-round picks around for help in the now, too.\n\nBeyond the first-round pick, it's also been mentioned that the Senators may dangle defenseman Jakob Chychrun out there as a potential trade chip this summer. Chychrun, who put up 14 goals and 41 points this past season, is entering the final year of his current contract. The Bruins were linked to Chychrun prior to his move from Arizona to Ottawa, and Boston may have a need for another high-impact left-shot defenseman with Matt Grzelcyk and Derek Forbort expected to depart as free agents and with just five left-shooting defensemen signed to NHL contracts for the 2024-25 season.\n\nOf course, the big mystery in all of this is whether or not Ullmark would have any interest in going to Ottawa, and whether or not he would have say in that decision.\n\nUllmark's trade protection drops from 16 teams to 15 teams in 2024-25, and he's made it pretty clear that he has an extremely limited interest in leaving Boston.\n\nThe 30-year-old Ullmark is entering the final year of a four-year, $20 million contract signed in 2021, and has posted an 88-26-10 record and .924

During the 2023-24 regular season, both Jeremy Swayman and Ullmark ranked in the league's top 10 in goals against (2.53 and 2.58, respectively) and save percentage (.916 and .915, respectively).\n\nSwayman shifted into another gear in the postseason, effectively ending the Bruins' tandem system they had employed throughout the regular season, but that says more about Swayman's dominance in net than it does about Ullmark's performance.\n\nThe fact is, Ullmark is a No. 1 goalie who, so long as he remains in Boston, would be relegated to a No. 2 role. The Bruins have been discussing an extension with Swayman's camp for months. Last year, he was awarded a one-year, $3.475 million agreement through an arbitration hearing, and by all accounts, both sides hope to avoid going through that again this year.\n\nUllmark is under contract for one more season on a four-year, $20 million deal he signed in July 2021.\n\nIn 2023-24, Swayman, 25, and Ullmark, 30, accounted for a combined cap hit of $8.475 million. But if Swayman receives the long-term deal he's after (and that he's certainly worth), allocating $11 or $12 million to the goaltender position will limit the Bruins' ability to bring in a top skater who could help the team over the playoff hump.\n\nPer CapFriendly, Ullmark has 16 teams on his no-trade list, which has hamstrung general manager Don Sweeney's attempts to find a favorable return for him. Presumably Ullmark will command more than Jacob Markstrom, whom the Calgary Flames traded to the New Jersey Devils for defenseman Kevin Bahl and a top-10-protected first-round pick in 2025. The Flames also retained 31.25% of Markstrom's salary.\n\nUllmark is four years younger than Markstrom and won the Vezina Trophy in 2023.\n\nBut with the Devils having addressed the position, that leaves one fewer landing place for Ullmark should the Bruins be looking to make a trade. So who are the suitors still in contention?\n\nAccording to The Fourth Period, Ullmark has also been linked to the Los Angeles Kings, Ottawa Senators, Carolina Hurricanes and Buffalo Sabres. Ullmark reportedly vetoed a deal that would have sent him to Los Angeles at this year's trade deadline, with speculation being that he'd like to remain on the East Coast.\n\nWhile the Senators have been mentioned in connection with Ullmark, the Sabres are a surprising new team entering the trade chatter. And yet, Buffalo makes perfect sense. It's on the East Coast and, of course, it's the team with which Ullmark spent the first six seasons of his career.\n\nThe Sabres are developing Devon Levi, 22, but could use a veteran presence in net to form a tandem with Ukko-Pekka Luukkonen, 25. In 54 games last season, Luukkonen broke out with a 2.57 goals against average and a save percentage of .910.\n\nWhile Ullmark has proven he could be \"the guy\" and may balk at becoming part of another 50/50 rotation, the interest on the Sabres' end in welcoming back their former star to bolster their rotation and avoid upping Levi's workload too early in his career is clear.\n\nBuffalo has missed the playoffs for 13 consecutive seasons, tied with the NFL's New York Jets for the longest postseason drought in professional sports.\n\nPer The Hockey News' Michael DeRosa, the Sabres \"are open to moving this year's 11th overall pick for the right price and have several top prospects who could intrigue the Bruins.\"\n\nWhat the Markstrom trade showed the Bruins front office, however, is that they might have to retain some of Ullmark's $5 million cap hit to make a deal work. And with Ullmark set to become an unrestricted free agent in summer 2025, teams may be gun-shy to invest unless they know Ullmark will be open to an extension.", "source": {"uri": "bleacherreport.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Bleacher Report"}, "authors": [{"uri": "michelle_bruton@bleacherreport.com", "name": "Michelle Bruton", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeremy_Swayman", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jeremy Swayman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linus_Ullmark", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Linus Ullmark"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacob_Markstr\u00f6m", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Jacob Markstr\u00f6m"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goaltender", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Goaltender"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Bahl", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kevin Bahl"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don_Sweeney", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Don Sweeney"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vezina_Trophy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Vezina Trophy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ottawa_Senators", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ottawa Senators"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defenceman", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Defenceman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Jersey_Devils", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "New Jersey Devils"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_manager", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "General manager"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calgary_Flames", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Calgary Flames"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Devon_Levi", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Devon Levi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukko-Pekka_Luukkonen", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ukko-Pekka Luukkonen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carolina_Hurricanes", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Carolina Hurricanes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goals_against_average", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Goals against average"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Kings", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Kings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buffalo_Sabres", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Buffalo Sabres"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hockey_News", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Hockey News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_agent", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Free agent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trade_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Trade (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional_sports", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Professional sports"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Jets", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "New York Jets"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buffalo,_New_York", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Buffalo, New York"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Buffalo, New York"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Hockey/Ice_Hockey", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Hockey/Ice Hockey", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Day_Trading", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Day Trading", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Commodities_and_Futures", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Commodities and Futures", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Trading", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Trading", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://media.bleacherreport.com/image/upload/c_fill,g_faces,w_3800,h_2000,q_95/v1718842385/vhouhic53rusertx1gdq.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9665899", "eventUri": "eng-9665899", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1137254901960785, "wgt": 212, "relevance": 1}

But in just one afternoon, those options quickly dissipated as two teams reportedly interested in Ullmark found their solutions in goal elsewhere on Wednesday.\n\nAs the pressure escalates with time running out to maximize the return they receive for Ullmark, the Bruins may have a lifeline in the Ottawa Senators.\n\nShortly after the goalie market dried up yesterday, Bruce Garrioch of the Ottawa Citizen reported the Senators are intensifying their efforts to swing a deal with the Bruins for the former Vezina Trophy-winning netminder.\n\n\"League sources say that Steve Staios, the Senators' president of hockey operations and general manager, has been making a hard push to try to acquire Ullmark,\" wrote Garrioch. \"The Senators had already stepped up their efforts to acquire goaltender Linus Ullmark from the Boston Bruins, [and] Ottawa may now be the last serious team in the mix.\"\n\nEven as perhaps the last team legitimately interested in acquiring Ullmark, the Senators will need to provide Bruins general manager Don Sweeney with a serious offer to get a deal done.\n\nWhat would such a deal look like? Here are some pieces the Bruins will likely ask for and probably demand from Ottawa.\n\nJakob Chychrun:\n\nOne of the biggest needs for the Bruins this offseason is a left-handed defenseman, and they could add one by acquiring Jakob Chychrun from the Senators.\n\nIt's been just a little over a year since the Senators traded away three draft picks to pick up Chychrun, but are now putting him back on the market with one season remaining on his current contract.\n\nThe former 16th overall pick hasn't developed into the top-flight defenseman that many projected him to be when he was drafted eight years ago. Still, at 26 and just now entering his prime, he is very much worthy of a top-four role. Effective at both ends of the ice, Chychrun would make for a reliable partner next to either Charlie McAvoy or Brandon Carlo on the Bruins' blue line while playing minutes on both special teams units.\n\nThe Bruins would certainly like some sort of guarantee that Chychrun is willing to stay in Boston for the foreseeable future, but an extension will likely be an issue they'd address next summer.\n\nHowever, like Ullmark, Chychrun has a modified no-trade clause attached to his deal. It's not known whether or not his list includes the Bruins, but that is one detail that needs to be ironed out in this hypothetical transaction.\n\nFirst-Round Pick:\n\nThere may be room to negotiate over Chychrun, but any scenario in which the Bruins send Ullmark to Ottawa without getting a first-round draft pick back in return is highly unlikely.\n\nThe Calgary Flames set the goalie market yesterday when they received a first-round selection in next year's draft from the New Jersey Devils for Jacob Markstrom. However, the Bruins will probably demand a pick in this year's draft, taking place next week.\n\nAfter trading away its draft stock over the last handful of seasons, Boston enters the 2024 NHL Entry Draft with only three picks of which none fall in the first three rounds. Meanwhile, Ottawa owns seven picks, including two in the first round.\n\nSenators senior vice president Dave Poulin is already on the record saying the team has discussed parting with the No. 7 overall pick, but the Bruins may be just as satisfied with the same No. 25 overall selection they traded to Detroit last year for Tyler Bertuzzi.\n\nAnton Forsberg:\n\nWhile Chyrchun and a first-round pick will be the main pieces Boston gets in return for Ullmark, they'll still need a goalie to replace him.\n\nAnton Forsberg was supposed to be the backup in Ottawa last year but began to receive more regular starts when Joonas Korpisalo failed to meet expectations.\n\nForsberg struggled with a .890 save percentage and 3.21 goals against average through 30 games in 2023-24. Those results, however, came after he returned midseason following his recovery from surgery to repair a torn MCL and were compounded by a bad Ottawa defense in front of him. In Boston, Forsberg would play a much smaller role as the understudy to Jeremy Swayman behind a much better defense.\n\nEven if he doesn't win the backup job out of training camp, he'd still serve as extra insurance in Providence while playing out the final year of his contract as the final piece in the Bruins' return for Ullmark.", "source": {"uri": "bostonhockeynow.com", "dataType": "news",

Ullmark has one more Vezina Trophy than his fellow Swede. In 2023-24, Ullmark saved 14.8 goals above expectation, per Moneypuck. Markstrom was at 13.7.\n\nYou can combine all those facts to argue that Ullmark has a higher trade value than Markstrom based on performance. It is a winnable case.\n\nBut the other fact is that Markstrom is signed through 2026. Ullmark is under contract through 2025.\n\nIn the NHL trade market, that one year makes a big difference.\n\nConsider, then, what the New Jersey Devils gave the Calgary Flames on Wednesday for a discounted Markstrom. Devils general manager Tom Fitzgerald ceded a top-10-protected 2025 first-round pick and 23-year-old defensive defenseman Kevin Bahl to get back Markstrom at $4.125 million annually (31.25 percent salary retention) for the next two seasons. If Markstrom locks down the net, gets support from Jake Allen and lets Jack Hughes and the other New Jersey whiz kids snap the puck around, the Flames may not be using the 2025 pick until late in Round 1.\n\nThe 23-year-old Bahl, meanwhile, was No. 6 among Devils defensemen with 17:24 of average ice time per game in 2023-24, including 1:48 on the penalty kill. The 6-foot-6, 230-pounder (1-10 -- 11) projects to be a second-pairing defenseman with little offensive upside.\n\nSo if that was the price for two years of No. 1 goaltending at an annual cap hit lower than Elvis Merzlikins' AAV, you better believe the market will not be much higher for one season of Ullmark's services at $5 million annually.\n\nThere is also the sticky matter of Ullmark's partial no-trade protection. Ullmark's list takes half the league off the table if he holds firm to his wishes.\n\nPerhaps GM Don Sweeney can stick to his ask now that the goalie supply has been reduced by one of Ullmark's closest peers. The Ottawa Senators and Los Angeles Kings, to name two teams, would still like to upgrade in net.\n\nBut the likelihood of securing a 2024 first-round selection as some or all of Ullmark's return may be a far-fetched notion. The only way such capital would become part of Sweeney's ledger would be if Ullmark gave his acquiring team a good idea he'd be willing to sign an extension. Otherwise, few teams would be willing to deal a package of riches if Ullmark prefers to walk on July 1, 2025. As for acquiring a legitimate NHLer like Martin Necas for Ullmark, the Markstrom trade proves the Bruins would have to add at least one high-end asset to convince new Carolina GM Eric Tulsky to listen.\n\nSo as has been estimated during the 2023-24 season and upon its conclusion, the best the Bruins might be able to do for Ullmark is futures. Sweeney might even have to retain some of Ullmark's dough as Calgary GM Craig Conroy had to do with Markstrom.\n\nThe trade market for goalies, even ones as good as Markstrom and Ullmark, is muted. It is a reality the Bruins have to accept.", "source": {"uri": "nytimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New York Times"}, "authors": [{"uri": "fluto_shinzawa@nytimes.com", "name": "Fluto Shinzawa", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacob_Markstr\u00f6m", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jacob Markstr\u00f6m"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linus_Ullmark", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Linus Ullmark"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defenceman", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Defenceman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Fitzgerald_(ice_hockey)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tom Fitzgerald (ice hockey)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vezina_Trophy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Vezina Trophy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Jersey_Devils", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New Jersey Devils"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_manager", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "General manager"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Hockey_League", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National Hockey League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calgary_Flames", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Calgary Flames"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sweden", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sweden"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Sweden"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Bahl", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kevin Bahl"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Hughes_(ice_hockey,_born_2001)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jack Hughes (ice hockey, born 2001)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elvis_Merz\u013cikins", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Elvis Merz\u013cikins"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jake_Allen_(ice_hockey)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jake Allen (ice hockey)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Short-handed", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Short-handed"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goaltender", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Goaltender"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Craig_Conroy", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Craig Conroy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don_Sweeney", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Don Sweeney"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ottawa_Senators", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ottawa Senators"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Kings", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Kings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calgary", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Calgary"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Calgary"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Brokerages", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Brokerages", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Day_Trading", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Day Trading", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Commodities_and_Futures", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Commodities and Futures", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Trading", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Trading", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 96}], "image": "https://cdn.theathletic.com/app/uploads/2024/06/19141045/USATSI_22590658-scaled.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9665899", "eventUri": "eng-9665899", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.02745098039215677, "wgt": 191, "relevance": 1}

A Bruins-Hurricanes swap would make sense, as Martin Necas would fill one of Boston's needs, but the Senators might have a better package.\n\nIt seems like an inevitability that the Bruins will trade Ullmark at some point this offseason, as Jeremy Swayman has cemented himself as the team's starting goalie.

They have some young talent and were expected to be in the playoff conversation after showing some progress in the 2022-2023 season. Part of the struggles this season were due to the poor goaltending of Joonas Korpisalo and Anton Forsberg. Senior vice president Dave Poulin said the Senators are working hard to improve that area of the team.\n\n\"We've spent a lot of time on it and we're still working hard on it,\" Dave Poulin said, according to Litman. \"Our goaltending will be better next season.\"\n\nThe Senator had Joonas Korpisalo play in 55 games in the 2023-2024 season. He got 21 wins with a 3.27 goals against average and an .890 save percentage, according to NHL.com. Anton Forsberg played in 30 games and di not post good numbers either, as he had 15 wins with a 3.21 goals against average with an .890 save percentage as well.\n\nNeedless to say, the Senators lacked in the goaltending department, and they are working very hard to improve that situation this season. It will be interesting to see if they can make this trade with the Bruins for Ullmark work. There are other teams in the league who could use goaltending help as well, as mentioned before with the Hurricanes.\n\nThe Senators hope that their young team can begin to emerge as a playoff contender next season, and getting them goaltending help in the form of Ullmark would help.", "source": {"uri": "clutchpoints.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ClutchPoints"}, "authors": [{"uri": "ryan_bologna@clutchpoints.com", "name": "Ryan Bologna", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacob_Markstr\u00f6m", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jacob Markstr\u00f6m"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ottawa_Senators", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ottawa Senators"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Hockey_League", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "National Hockey League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linus_Ullmark", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Linus Ullmark"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeremy_Swayman", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Jeremy Swayman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Ne\u010das", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Martin Ne\u010das"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goaltender", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Goaltender"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dave_Poulin", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Dave Poulin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Staios", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Steve Staios"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carolina_Hurricanes", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Carolina Hurricanes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Bruins", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Boston Bruins"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Jersey_Devils", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New Jersey Devils"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calgary_Flames", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Calgary Flames"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anton_Forsberg", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Anton Forsberg"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forward_(ice_hockey)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Forward (ice hockey)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joonas_Korpisalo", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Joonas Korpisalo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goals_against_average", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Goals against average"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Day_Trading", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Day Trading", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Food/Seasonings", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Food/Seasonings", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Commodities_and_Futures", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Commodities and Futures", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Trading", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Trading", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Business_Services/Barter", "label": "dmoz/Business/Business Services/Barter", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://wp.clutchpoints.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Senators-pursuit-of-Linus-Ullmark-has-intensified.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9665899", "eventUri": "eng-9665899", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.04313725490196085, "wgt": 191, "relevance": 1}

Meanwhile, the Calgary Flames detailed their plans after the Jacob Markstrom trade and confirmed conversations with Oliver Kylington. Pierre-Luc Dubois was traded to the Washington Capitals on Wednesday. Where did that trade come from and why now?\n\nA couple of hockey journalists have been doing some digging on the Ottawa Senators and what they might be up to. Christopher Maher writes, \"Not sure the entirety of the deal just yet - but believe the Philadelphia Flyers are acquiring a defenseman from Ottawa. More than one asset going the other way on the Flyers end.\" Meanwhile, Travis Yost, who broke the Markstrom trade, writes, \"Believe the Ottawa Senators and Philadelphia Flyers have the framework of a trade in place as well, though this one may go closer to the Draft.\"\n\nSome of the potentially available Ottawa trade assets include Jakob Chychrun, Thomas Chabot, Erik Brannstrom, Mathieu Joseph, and the Senators' overall draft picks.\n\nWith the Los Angeles Kings now out of the running for Linus Ullmark (the Kings acquired Darcy Kuemper on Wednesday), Bruce Garrioch of the Ottawa Citizen writes that the Ottawa Senators have circled back to the Bruins to see if there's a fit to acquire Ullmark. Talks have intensified, the scribe adds.\n\nGarrioch noted in a column on Wednesday:\n\nWhile league sources told Postmedia earlier in the day the Senators had already stepped up their efforts to acquire goaltender Linus Ullmark from the Boston Bruins, Ottawa may now be the last serious team in the mix... Knowing there wasn't a fit with Calgary, league sources say that Steve Staios, the Senators' president of hockey operations and general manager, has been making a hard push to try to acquire Ullmark.\n\nApparently, the Senators made an effort to acquire Ullmark at last season's trade deadline. Staios held several discussions with Boston general manager Don Sweeney. One league source said the Senators would be willing to offer Anton Forsberg in the deal. Another said the Senators would likely have to offer defenceman Jakob Chychrun along with a first-round pick and another selection to acquire Ullmark.\n\nCalgary Flames GM Craig Conroy commented on contract talks with Oliver Kylington this week. He noted, \"We've been in contact and going back-and-forth. There's been a lot of stuff going on but I actually talked to Oliver the other day. Things are progressing. I know everyone wants things quicker, but sometimes it just takes a little time.\"\n\nRelated: NHL Rumors: Kraken, Sharks, Rangers, Hurricanes, Canucks, Oilers\n\nAs far as the Jacob Markstrom trade goes, Conroy said he had been working on it for some time. The deal needed to make sense for the team, but there really wasn't much doubt it was New Jersey Markstrom was going to. There was talk that the Maple Leafs did inquire about Markstrom, but it was the Devils and the trade return was the hold-up.\n\nPierre-Luc Dubois was traded by the Los Angeles Kings on Wednesday. The deal happened quickly, the Kings making sure they could move his contract before his no-trade clause kicked in on July 1. Speculation is that the trade chatter between the Washington Capitals and Kings started at the NHL combine and it wasn't because Dubois asked for the trade out of Los Angeles. He would have stayed with the Kings, but he's excited to get going in Washington.\n\nDubois has seven seasons remaining on his deal at a cap hit of $8.5 million and is still owed $59 million in actual salary.", "source": {"uri": "thehockeywriters.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Hockey Writers"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jim_parsons@thehockeywriters.com", "name": "Jim Parsons", "type": "author",

TSN.ca keeps you up to date with all the latest rumours and speculation from around the NHL beat.\n\nAfter the Calgary Flames moved Jacob Markstrom to the New Jersey Devils on Wednesday, Linus Ullmark of the Boston Bruins appears to be the top option remaining at goaltender on the trade market.\n\nBruce Garrioch of Postmedia reports the Ottawa Senators stepped up their efforts to acquire Ullmark on Wednesday as the door closed on Markstrom. He notes that talks between the two teams have intensified and wonders if the Senators may be the only serious team left in the mix for the goaltender.\n\nGarrioch adds that the Senators have also \"kicked tires\" on Nashville Predators star netminder Juuse Saros. There remains a strong chance, though, that Saros stays put in Nashville this summer.\n\nThe Senators were among the team's to make a push for Ullmark at the trade deadline, but Bruins ultimately elected to keep their goalie tandem intact. With Jeremy Swayman in need of a new deal as a restricted free agent this summer, Ullmark, who's signed through next season at a $5 million cap hit, appears to be firmly on the trade block.\n\nThe 30-year-old went 22-10-7 with the Bruins this season, posting a .915 save percentage and a 2.55 goals-against average. He appeared in just two games for Boston during the postseason, going 0-1 with a 3.90 GAA and a .886 save percentage.\n\nGarrioch reports the Senators previously offered goaltender Joonas Korpisalo as part of their package for Ullmark, but the Bruins are unwilling to take on his $4 million cap hit, with four years left on his deal. He adds the Bruins could have some interest in taking back Anton Forsberg, who is entering the last year of his deal at a cap hit of $2.75 million.\n\nGarrioch also reiterates that the Senators would likely have to offer defenceman Jakob Chychrun, a first-round pick and an additional draft pick to pry Ullmark from Boston, though it remains unknown if Ottawa is on his 15-team no-trade list.\n\nThe Senators hold their own pick at No. 7 overall in this month's draft and the Bruins' first-rounder at No. 25 overall, which was acquired from the Detroit Red Wings last summer.\n\nOttawa's pursuit of a goaltender has been well documented since their season came to an end after Korpisalo and Forsberg both struggled last season.\n\n\"We're not happy with the goaltending tandem, but I don't think the goaltending tandem was happy with the goaltending tandem,\" senior vice president Dave Poulin said at a season-ticket holders event earlier this month. \"If you talk to both guys, and we have, they weren't pleased with their season. They weren't pleased with it numerically, statistically or from an analytics standpoint.\n\n\"We take it a step further, where the goals are scored, breakdowns on the ice, cross-ice passes, where the shots are coming from and the quality of chances. We didn't help our goalies very much. We've studied from every detail possible. We have to improve our goaltending situation. Can that come from the two goaltenders we have? It can, but that's still to be determined.\n\n\"We've chatted with people around the league who are in different situations. One thing with Joonas Korpisalo, you have to look at some off-ice factors as well. It was his first-long term contract, he came in, he had a new baby and, quite frankly, the defence in front of him wasn't as good as it was in L.A. He played so well for them down the stretch. There's a lot of different factors and we're still working hard on it.\"\n\nKorpisalo finished his first season in Ottawa with a 21-26-4 record and .890 save percentage after a inking a five-year contract in free agency last July. Forsberg went 15-12-0 with a .890 save percentage.\n\nTSN Hockey Analyst Kevin Weekes wonders whether the Los Angeles Kings could be a landing spot for Toronto Maple Leafs star Mitch Marner after moving Pierre-Luc Dubois on Wednesday.\n\nThe Kings sent Dubois to the Washington Capitals in exchange for goaltender Darcy Kuemper, freeing $3.25 million in cap space. Kuemper's $5.25 million cap hit will come off their books in 2026-27, while Dubois' contract at a cap hit of $8.5 million runs through 2030-31.\n\nWeekes notes that the Kings are now content at goaltender with Kuemper and David Rittich between the pipes for next season, allowing the team go big-game hunting.\n\n\"Why not go Mitch Marner hunting? Not limited to, but why not?\" Weekes asked while appearing on OverDrive.\n\nAfter the trade, CapFriendly projects the Kings to have $23.45 million in cap space this off-season with just 13 players under contract for next season. Quinton Byfield headlines the team's five restricted free agents in need of new deals this summer.\n\nMarner, 27, is signed through the upcoming season at a cap hit of $10.9 million. It remains unclear whether the Maple Leafs will consider moving him and TSN Hockey Insider Darren Dreger reported this week he believes general manager Brad Treliving would rather extend the winger. Marner also owns a full no-move clause in his contract.\n\nTSN Hockey analytics writer Travis Yost stepped into the world of the insiders Wednesday, breaking the trade that Jacob Markstrom to the Devils.\n\nIt appears Yost may be at it again, though he gave his less details this time around.\n\n\"Believe the Ottawa Senators and Philadelphia Flyers have the framework of a trade in place as well, though this one may go closer to the Draft,\" Yost posted Wednesday afternoon.\n\nSpeculation has run wild in the replies as it remains completely unclear who could be involved in the trade.",

George Walker IV/Associated Press\n\nThe Edmonton Oilers and the sublime Connor McDavid may have suddenly injected some life into this Stanley Cup Final, beating the Florida Panthers on Tuesday to extend the series to a Game 6 in Edmonton on Friday.\n\nBut nothing slows down the calendar. We are now a week away from the draft (for which the Bruins - currently without picks in the first three rounds - are scheduled to mostly observe) and less than two weeks away from the opening bell of free agency on July 1.\n\nThe first shoe in the goalie market dropped on Wednesday, and now there's one less potential landing spot for Linus Ullmark. The New Jersey Devils, long believed to be coveting Calgary Flames netminder Jacob Markstrom, finally landed their prey for a return that's fairly decent: big 23-year-old defenseman Kevin Bahl, who has a decent upside as a shutdown defenseman, and a top-10 protected first-round draft pick in 2025. Calgary also has to retain $1.875 million of Markstrom's $6 million cap hit.\n\nThat should at least set the market for Ullmark, though it is still not clear just who is on his 16-team no-trade list, which goes to a 15-team no-trade list on July 1.\n\nThe Bruins have said signing Jeremy Swayman to a long-term deal is a priority. They've already tried trading Ullmark at the trade deadline and are likely to explore his market again in hopes of getting cap space and player or draft assets. The NHL Draft is June 28, while free agency begins July 1.\n\nThe 2023 Vezina Trophy winner, Ullmark split duties with Swayman during the regular season, but the Bruins went mostly with the Swayman in the playoffs. Swayman is younger (25) and figures to be the team's No. 1 moving forward. Ullmark has one year remaining at $5 million.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThough he hasn't yet won a playoff series, Ullmark is three and a half years younger than Markstrom, has a Vezina on his resume and is a relative bargain for the 2024-25 season. The no-trade list has been a stumbling block - he reportedly nixed a deal to the Kings at the trade deadline (Los Angeles finally picked up a goalie on Wednesday when they sent Pierre-Luc Dubois to Washington for Darcy Kuemper) - but if a team on Ullmark's list comes through with a handsome extension, perhaps he'd be willing to change his mind.\n\nOSKAR STEEN'S agent, Joakim Persson, confirmed to Swedish website Hockeynews.se that the free-agent-to-be will be looking for a new team. NHL free agency officially begins July 1.\n\n\"Boston has given us permission to already start talking to other teams to see what interest there is,\" Persson said. \"So those are the conversations we are in the middle of now, and I'm going over to Vegas for the NHL draft and continue to have conversations and dialogues there.\"\n\nSteen was placed on waivers by Boston in February and returned to Providence of the American Hockey League. In 34 games for the Bruins, he amassed just one point - a goal on Nov. 14 against the Buffalo Sabres. Steen finished the 2023-24 season with Providence, recording 16 points (12 goals, four assists) in 25 games.\n\nAfter getting eliminated in the second round of the Stanley Cup playoffs by the Florida Panthers, Bruins General Manager Don Sweeney said he expects to be \"aggressive\" this summer.\n\nIF JULY 1 COMES and Jake DeBrusk is not re-signed by the Bruins, history has shown us that coveted UFAs are out the door. If DeBrusk walks, GM Don Sweeney's job of getting the Bruins back among the elite will be much more difficult.\n\nCopy the Story Link\n\nSend questions/comments to the editors.\n\nRelated Stories

I project him as being a very good playoff player. Get him done long term now, and avoid the financial pain that comes after a bridge deal.\"\n\nJimmy Murphy: Confirmed from a Los Angeles Kings source that they weren't the team that Boston Bruins goaltender Linus Ullmark blocked a trade to at the trade deadline.

Ullmark saw his numbers drop this year compared to his Vezina-winning 2022-23 campaign but he still posted a solid 2.57 GAA with a .915 SV% in 40 games. Those numbers would represent a significant improvement on the 3.30 and .888 that Ottawa put up as a team in 2023-24. Ullmark has one year left on his contract with a $5MM price tag and it's worth noting that he has a 16-team no-trade clause so he does have some say in where he could ultimately be moved.\n\nMeanwhile, Garrioch adds that the Bruins don't have interest in taking back the final four years of Joonas Korpisalo's contract as expected. However, with Anton Forsberg ($2.75MM) set to enter the final year of his deal next season, Boston could be amenable to taking him back, allowing the Senators to reduce the additional salary they're taking on.

While Ottawa wasn't targeting Kuemper publically, it is safe to assume that any general manager willing to move a goalie has been in contact with Senators GM Steve Staios.\n\nBruce Garrioch confirmed that with Markstrom, the Devils, and the Kings out of the conversation, the Senators are now the front-runners for Boston Bruins goalie Linus Ullmark (from 'With Jacob Markstrom dealt to Devils, Senators step up efforts to land Boston's Linus Ullmark,' Ottawa Sun, June 19, 2024).\n\nRelated: Senators Should Deal Jakob Chychrun to Bruins for Linus Ullmark\n\nOther teams are calling Boston about Ullmark, likely including the Toronto Maple Leafs and Colorado Avalanche, but Ottawa has been linked to this potential deal for months now. There has been no confirmation that Ullmark's no-trade list has the Senators on it. There was a report at the deadline that he invoked his right to decline a trade, but that team was never identified. However, if Ottawa is on his no-trade list or had previously been denied a deal, trade talks and rumours would likely have ended by now.\n\nChychrun Trade Rumors Never End\n\nIt seems like Chychrun has been on the trading block his entire career. His time with the Arizona Coyotes seemed to hang by a string, and once he was finally dealt, he expressed relief. Well, less than 18 months later, Chychrun is headlining trade rumours yet again.\n\nWhether or not he is part of a trade for Ullmark, it sounds like he will be on the move this offseason. Garrioch also noted that the Senators are in no rush to move the defenceman, but rumours have picked up after former NHLer Jordan Schmaltz posted the following on X:\n\nGood afternoon folks, The People's phones are buzzing .. hearing some rumblings regarding OTT 26 year old left handed shot defenseman Jacob Chicky Parm Chychrun.. nothing imminent but the situation is evolving .. We'll see where this goes. Plan is to hopefully move him before the draft..\n\nHe followed that post by saying that Staios has multiple defencemen in play and it shouldn't be shocking if a big name leaves Ottawa very soon. While credible insiders have not mentioned any specific deals linked to Chychrun, some could make sense.\n\nSenators and Flyers Cooking Up a Deal\n\nTravis Yost of TSN reported that the Senators and Flyers have the framework of a deal ready, but it may not be done until closer to the draft.\n\nThe Flyers would certainly like the seventh overall pick in this draft, and a defenceman like Chychrun could be enticing as well. It has also been reported that Mathieu Joseph could be on his way out of Ottawa, and he could be of interest to Philadelphia.\n\nAs for the Senators, it's been rumoured in the past that they like Scott Laughton, but that was under a different regime. Does Staios feel the same? If the Senators are moving Joseph and bringing in Laughton, that isn't much of an upgrade. Staois could move down in the draft, trading the seventh pick for the twelfth, but it would take a pretty good incentive from the Flyers for that to happen.\n\nOttawa could also be targeting Travis Konecny - although it's unlikely they'll go for a splash that big - or Joel Farabee. Konecny would cost a lot, and he doesn't necessarily fill a glaring hole on the Senators' lineup. He would be a great addition, but that kind of player shouldn't be the priority. Farabee, who has developed nicely into a $5 million player who scores 20 goals and 50 points, could be a good option to add depth on the wing. The Senators don't need a super high-end player like Konecny, but a middle-six option like Farabee makes sense.\n\nWhether any of these deals come to fruition, there is no doubt that Staios has been busy on the phone for a while now.", "source": {"uri": "thehockeywriters.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Hockey Writers"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jacob_billington@thehockeywriters.com", "name":

The Colorado Avalanche, Carolina Hurricanes and Edmonton Oilers might also make a move if it's worthwhile. But there are still options.\n\nHere are five choices remaining for them, either on the free agent market or via trade. In no particular order:\n\nJuuse Saros, Nashville Predators\n\nThe most coveted goalie who may - repeat, may - be available is Predators star netminder Saros. He is entering the final season of his current contract, which carries an average annual cap hit of $5 million.\n\nThe Predators may opt to sign the 29-year-old to a lengthy and lucrative extension. But if they choose to deal Saros, he'll bring a very healthy return, either in terms of prospects, draft picks or both.\n\nSaros is a difference-maker between the pipes, and if he is dealt to the highest bidder, he could significantly accelerate Nashville's retooling process.\n\nLinus Ullmark, Boston Bruins\n\nUllmark formed a terrific tandem with Jeremy Swayman for the Bruins, but by the time the playoffs arrived, it became clear that Swayman was definitely the No. 1 goalie for Boston.\n\nThat means the 30-year-old Ullmark is redundant, and there's no shortage of teams who would be interested in acquiring his services.\n\nUllmark has a modified no-trade clause that allows him to pick 15 teams he can block a trade to, but that leaves 16 teams he could be moved to. His $5-million cap hit in 2024-25 means the salary won't be a problem for most teams.\n\nWith the Bruins still intending to contend for a Stanley Cup and likely targeting player upgrades, Ullmark's days in Boston are nearing an end. He's the most proven asset after Saros, and he's someone who will be motivated to prove the Bruins made the wrong move by dealing him.\n\nRelated: Five Veteran UFAs That Can Help Teams Level Up\n\nAnthony Stolarz, Florida Panthers\n\nStolarz bounced around the NHL before finding a home with the Panthers this season, and he proved to be one of the best backups of the year. In 27 appearances, he posted a very respectable 2.02 goals-against average and .925 save percentage.\n\nGranted, playing for the high-functioning Panthers played into Stolarz's individual numbers, but the 30-year-old won't break the bank this coming year. He may double his $1.1-million salary, but he won't get a $5-million deal as a UFA - and he will be a nice tandem option for a team vying for a Cup right away.\n\nLaurent Brossoit, Winnipeg Jets\n\nThe 31-year-old Brossoit - soon to be a UFA - had a stellar season in his second stint in Winnipeg, posting a 2.00 GAA and .927 SP in 23 appearances.\n\nBrossoit has valuable playoff experience from his time with the Vegas Golden Knights, and his $1.75-million salary from 2023-24 will get bumped up by some team that doesn't land Ullmark or Saros.\n\nBrossoit may not be the sexy name available to teams in need of a different goaltending look, but in the right scenario, he can be a solid contributor in his prime who can fit into most teams' cap picture.\n\nCam Talbot, Los Angeles Kings\n\nThe arrival of Kuemper in Los Angeles spells the end of the line for Talbot with the Kings. But that's not to say the 36-year-old Talbot can't be an above-average netminder on a playoff-contending squad.\n\nTalbot put up a 2.50 GAA and .913 SP in 54 appearances this past season. His $1-million salary - which might be raised to $1.5 million or $2 million as a UFA - makes him a solid option for a team looking for better goalie depth. Rest assured, some team will take a chance on him.\n\nWhere do you think these goaltenders will be next season?

A league source not affiliated with the team told the Herald on Thursday that the B's are confident that they would be landing a first round pick for Ullmark, but in the lower part of the round, which takes place next Friday in Las Vegas. The Senators also hold the 25th pick while Colorado and Carolina, two teams who are also reportedly interested in acquiring a netminder, hold the 24th and 27th pick, respectively. The source did not know of any other moving pieces that may or may not be involved in any potential deal.\n\nNashville's Juuse Saros is another No. 1 goalie believed to be on the market.\n\nMeanwhile, The Fourth Period reported that Ottawa is indeed on Ullmark's no-trade list but that he would be willing to move to the Canadian capital if a deal can get pushed over the goal line.\n\nIf Chychrun somehow came back in the deal, that would chew up nearly all of the savings on Ullmark' $5 million for the B's, who currently have approximately $21 million in cap spending money. But it would at least fill a need of a left-shot defenseman, though not exactly a perfect fit. As of now, the B's have a left side of Hampus Lindholm, Mason Lohrei and Parker Wotherspoon.\n\nChychrun, who was a hot commodity when he was on the trade block two seasons ago when he was a member of the Arizona Coyotes, was third on the Sens in icetime (22:23) and had good offensive numbers (14-27-41). But he was not used regularly on the penalty kill - with Derek Forbort expected to be out the door, one would think the B's would want another D-man they could use on the PK - and was tied for a team-low minus-30, though that no doubt would have a little something to do with why the Sens are in the hunt for a goalie in the first place. Still, the B's do need more scoring, no matter where it comes from, and he could help in that department.\n\nGM Don Sweeney, who as of right now does not have a draft pick in the first three rounds, has work to do. He has to sign goalie Jeremy Swayman to an extension that could take up at least a third of the current cap space. Jake DeBrusk is set to become an unrestricted free agent on July 1 and, if he's not re-signed, Sweeney will have to find a way to replace him and then add another impact forward on top of that, whether that be at the center position or on the wing.\n\nAnd now it looks there's a good possibility he won't be sitting on his hands when the first round of the draft takes place next Friday.",

"body": "PARIS -- It's been nearly a week since Neymar landed in Paris, and the world's most expensive player still can't play for his new club in the French league.\n\nNeymar's world-record 222 million euros ($262 million) transfer from Barcelona to Paris Saint-Germain was completed last week, but the Brazil international has yet to be granted permission to play.\n\nPSG wanted Neymar to start the season at the Parc des Princes last week against Amiens but his debut was delayed because his international transfer certificate (ITC) had not been received by the French league on time.\n\nNeymar was unveiled to the PSG fans on Saturday, but watched from the stands as his new team started its league campaign with a 2-0 win.\n\nThe former Santos forward was then expected to play on Sunday night at Guingamp at the 18,000-capacity Stade du Roudourou, but PSG fans might have to wait a bit longer to see the star in action.\n\nThe French league said in an email to The Associated Press on Thursday that it had not received the document needed from the Spanish federation. It added the deadline for receiving the document was midnight local time.\n\nThe league however said Neymar could still be qualified for Sunday's game if PSG and the French federation decide against referring the issue to FIFA after the deadline expires.\n\n\"If the French federation does not start proceedings with FIFA, we could still receive the ICT up until Saturday night,\" the league said.\n\nAccording to French newspaper L'Equipe, PSG is unlikely to ask FIFA to rule on the issue because it could slow down proceedings further. The club did not immediately answer a message from The Associated Press seeking comments.\n\nFIFA told the AP that it \"has not been contacted by the FFF (French football federation) in connection with the player Neymar and the ITC procedure.\"\n\nThe French league added that it \"does not understand\" why its Spanish counterpart \"refuses to accept the payment for the buyout clause for Neymar.\"\n\nBarcelona said there is nothing strange about the situation and that the wait is due to the banks, which have to make the 222 million euros available in the club's account before the transfer is authorized.\n\nThere has been speculation in France that Barcelona slowed down the whole process as a retaliation measure against PSG after the French league club lured one of its three biggest stars out of the Camp Nou.\n\nAsked about his views on the issue after the Amiens game, PSG coach Unai Emery said last week he was not sure \"Spain did everything\" to ensure Neymar would be cleared to play for PSG without delay.\n\nFFF president Noel Le Graet said another reason for the delay could be the current turmoil within the Spanish federation. Angel Maria Villar, who ran the Spanish soccer federation since 1988, was suspended from the presidency for one year in July by Spain's top sports authority for his suspected involvement in a case of misappropriation of private and public funds received by the federation since 2009.\n\n\"I don't need to tell you that the Spanish federation is having some problems at the moment,\" Le Graet told L'Equipe. \"The transfer is complete, so this should not last.\"\n\nIn any case, the paperwork issues have left Neymar unfazed. He has making the most of his time off to head to Saint-Tropez, where he has been photographed partying with friends. Neymar has since returned to training with his teammates.\n\n___\n\nJoe Wilson, in Barcelona, Spain, and AP Sports Writer Rob Harris in London contributed to this report.", "time": "21:26:00"}

(AP) -- It's been nearly a week since Neymar landed in Paris, and the world's most expensive player still can't play for his new club in the French league.\n\nNeymar's world-record 222 million euros ($262 million) transfer from Barcelona to Paris Saint-Germain was completed last week, but the Brazil international has yet to be granted permission to play.\n\nPSG wanted Neymar to start the season at the Parc des Princes last week against Amiens but his debut was delayed because his international transfer certificate (ITC) had not been received by the French league on time.\n\nNeymar was unveiled to the PSG fans on Saturday, but watched from the stands as his new team started its league campaign with a 2-0 win.\n\nThe former Santos player was then expected to play on Sunday night at Guingamp at the 18,000-capacity Stade du Roudourou, but PSG fans might have to wait a bit longer to see the star in action.\n\nThe French league said in an email to The Associated Press on Thursday that it had not received the document needed from the Spanish federation. It added the deadline for receiving the document was midnight local time.\n\nThe French league added that it \"does not understand\" why its Spanish counterpart \"refuses to accept the payment for the buyout clause for Neymar.\"\n\nThere has been speculation in France that Barcelona slowed down the whole process as a retaliation measure against PSG after the French league club lured one of their its players out of the Camp Nou.\n\nAccording to French newspaper L'Equipe, PSG is unlikely to ask FIFA to rule on the issue because it could slow down proceedings further. The club did not immediately answer a message from The Associated Press seeking comments.\n\nAsked about his views on the issue after the Amiens game, PSG coach Unai Emery said last week he was not sure \"Spain did everything\" to ensure Neymar would be cleared to play for PSG without delay.\n\nFrench football federation president Noel Le Graet said another reason for the delay could be the current turmoil within the Spanish federation. Angel Maria Villar, who ran the Spanish soccer federation since 1988, was suspended from the presidency for one year in July by Spain's top sports authority for his suspected involvement in a case of misappropriation of private and public funds received by the federation since 2009.\n\n\"I don't need to tell you that the Spanish federation is having some problems at the moment,\" Le Graet told L'Equipe. \"The transfer is complete, so this should not last.\"\n\nIn any case, the paperwork issues have left Neymar unfazed. He has making the most of his time off to head to Saint-Tropez, where he has been photographed partying with friends. Neymar has since returned to training with his teammates.\n\nCONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORE\n\nCopyright 2017 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

was against the PSG move. (Source: Reuters) Neymar PSG debut lifts France to fever pitchHard cash, soft power: Neymar's price a small one for Qatar royal familyNeymar's transfer certificate received by French federation\n\nAfter dazzling Rio's imposing Maracana and Barcelona's storied Camp Nou, the world's most expensive footballer Neymar will be welcomed to French football today at Guingamp's humble 17,000-capacity Stade du Rouduorou in sleepy Brittany.\n\nWith the mundanity of transfer paperwork finally resolved, the 25-year-old Brazilian magician will line up for Paris Saint-Germain for the first time since his mind-boggling 222 million euro ($261 million) move from Barcelona.\n\n\"He's physically ready to play the whole ninety minutes,\" PSG coach Unai Emery told AFP.\n\n\"He's been working well and we looked hard at tactics and free-kicks. We all want him in the starting 11, he's a player we need in the group.\"\n\nEven Guingamp coach Antoine Kombouare, himself a former PSG boss, wants Neymar to play despite the potential havoc he could wreak on the home defence.\n\n\"I want the fans to come on Sunday to see Guingamp win... preferably against a side with Neymar in it,\" he said.\n\nIt will be a major culture shock for Neymar in a town which has a population of just 7,000 and is best known for its annual Breton dance showcase, the Saint Loup Festival.\n\nHowever, that's not to say that Guingamp do not have football pedigree -- former Chelsea and Ivory Coast star Didier Drogba spent a season at the club in 2002/2003.\n\nThey were French Cup winners in 2009 and 2014, and last season beat PSG 2-1 in the corresponding league fixture.\n\n\"We could have filled a stadium of 40,000 seats with no problem at all,\" said Guingamp president Bertrand Desplat, whose club budget is an eighth of what PSG paid for Neymar.\n\nJournalists from far and wide are expected for the game -- the ground's press tribune, built to hold 80 people, has been extended to cater for 350.\n\nA total of 145 stewards will be on duty at the ground -30 more than usual.\n\nNeymar will simply be glad to put his tax troubles behind him and get back to doing what he does best after his lawyer revealed on Saturday that the Brazilian superstar has agreed to pay a $2.5 million fine for tax evasion in his homeland.\n\nHis 2013 transfer to Barca from Sau Paulo's Santos is also the subject of a Spanish tax fraud investigation.\n\n- 1,200km away, Barca start new era -\n\nMeanwhile, French media speculated over who in the expensively-assembled PSG team will make way for Neymar.\n\nLe Parisien suggested it will be Javier Pastore, the Argentine star who was the first major signing after PSG were bought by their ambitious Qatari owners.\n\n\"After first giving up his No.10 shirt, will he (Pastore) now give him (Neymar) his place in the team?\" Le Parisien asked of the player who took up the No.10 shirt after Zlatan Ibrahimovic left for Manchester United last season, only to hand it to the Brazilian this summer.\n\n\"Neymar will start on the left at the expense of Pastore.\"\n\nSports daily L'Equipe saw things differently, though.\n\n\"A trio of Neymar, Pastore and Angel di Maria will support (striker) Ederson Cavani,\" predicted L'Equipe.\n\nThe match in Guingamp kicks-off at 1900GMT.\n\nAn hour later, and around 1,200km further south, Barcelona will start their first competitive match without Neymar by facing bitter rivals Real Madrid in the first leg of the Spanish Super Cup.\n\nBarca's scattergun approach to finding a replacement for Neymar has so far been unsuccessful with bids for Liverpool's Philippe Coutinho and Ousmane Dembele of Borussia Dortmund rebuffed.\n\nGerard Deulofeu was handed Neymar's role alongside Lionel Messi and Luis Suarez up front in Monday's 5-0 friendly win over Chapecoense on his return to the club after spells at Everton and AC Milan.\n\nAnd while he's not a like-for-like replacement, Spanish press claim former Tottenham Hotspur midfielder Paulinho, a Brazil international, is on the verge of a 40-million-euro move to Barca from China's Guangzhou Evergrande.\n\nFor all the latest Sports News, download Indian Express App\n\nTags: Neymar", "time": "17:39:00"}

his long-awaited debut with Paris Saint-Germain on Sunday in the small Brittany town of Guingamp after French football authorities finally received the Brazil star's international transfer certificate (ITC).\n\nThe French football federation said on Friday it had received the document from its Spanish counterpart, more than a week after PSG signed the Brazilian from Barcelona.\n\nThe French football league then told The Associated Press that the ITC had been submitted by the federation and that Neymar's transfer would be ratified later Friday, clearing the way for him to play at Guingamp on Sunday night.\n\nThe hold-up prevented Neymar from making his PSG debut last Saturday against Amiens after completing his world-record 222 million euro ($262 million) transfer.\n\nPSG wanted Neymar to start the season at the Parc des Princes but his debut was delayed because of the paperwork issues. Neymar was unveiled to the PSG fans on Saturday but could only watch from the stands as his new team started its league campaign with a 2-0 win.\n\nBarcelona said there was nothing strange about the situation and that the wait was due to the banks. A few hours before the French federation confirmed it had received the ITC, several Spanish media reported on Friday that the 222 million euros had finally been made available in the club's accounts.\n\nThere has been speculation in France that Barcelona slowed down the whole process as a retaliation measure against PSG after the French league club lured one of its three biggest stars out of the Camp Nou.\n\nAsked about his views on the issue after the Amiens game, PSG coach Unai Emery said he was not sure \"Spain did everything\" to ensure Neymar would be cleared to play for PSG in time.\n\nEmery has yet to announce his squad for the trip to Guingamp but it is very unlikely Neymar will not be included. After partying with friends in southern France, Neymar has returned to training with his teammates this week and Emery said he wants him to start on Sunday.\n\n\"We all want him to start playing,\" Emery told a press conference on Friday. \"We want him in the squad, and in the starting XI. He has trained well, and we have also worked on tactical aspects and set pieces. He is ready.\"", "time": "22:54:00"}

Saturday night,' the league said.\n\nAccording to French newspaper L'Equipe, PSG is unlikely to ask FIFA to rule on the issue because it could slow down proceedings further.\n\nFIFA said it 'has not been contacted by the FFF (French Football Federation) in connection with the player Neymar and the ITC procedure.'\n\nNeymar trains with his new Paris Saint-Germain team-mates but he must wait for his debut\n\nThe French league added it 'does not understand' why its Spanish counterpart 'refuses to accept the payment for the buyout clause for Neymar.'\n\nBarcelona said there is nothing strange about the situation and that the wait is due to the banks, which have to make the \u20ac222m available in the club's account before the transfer is authorised.\n\nThere has been speculation in France that Barcelona slowed down the whole process as a retaliation measure against PSG after the French league club lured one of its three biggest stars out of the Camp Nou.\n\nAsked about his views on the issue after the Amiens game, PSG coach Unai Emery said last week he was not sure 'Spain did everything' to ensure Neymar would be cleared to play for PSG in time.\n\nFFF president Noel Le Graet said another reason for the delay could be the turmoil within the Spanish federation. Angel Maria Villar, who ran Spanish soccer since 1988, was suspended last month from the presidency for one year by Spain's top sports authority for his suspected involvement in corruption.\n\nThe Brazilian is facing an anxious wait before he can make his debut for his new side\n\nNeymar was named in Brazil's squad for the forthcoming World Cup qualifiers in September\n\n'I don't need to tell you that the Spanish federation is having some problems at the moment,' Le Graet told L'Equipe. 'The transfer is complete, so this should not last.'\n\nIn any case, the paperwork issues have left Neymar unfazed. He has making the most of his time off to head to Saint-Tropez, where he has been photographed partying with friends.\n\nDespite the frustration, Neymar has shown he hasn't lost any of his competitive streak during a card game with team-mate Lucas Moura and friends.\n\nWearing a black hoodie and baseball cap, the 25-year-old shrugged his shoulders for the photo posted on his Instagram account.\n\nLucas flaunts his deck, seemingly happy with his performance, with Neymar posting in Portuguese: 'The girls wanted to win and we let them, but Lucas was on their side!'", "time": "23:17:00"}

The Brazil star became the most expensive player in soccer history after completing his blockbuster transfer from Barcelona for 222 million euros ($262 million) on Thursday. (AP Photo/Francois Mori)\n\nBy Samuel Petrequin, Associated Press\n\nPARIS (AP) -- Neymar is expected to make his much-awaited debut for Paris Saint-Germain on Sunday in the small Brittany town of Guingamp after French football authorities finally received his international transfer certificate.\n\nThe French Football Federation received the document from its Spanish counterpart on Friday, more than a week after PSG signed the Brazilian from Barcelona.\n\nThe French football league then told The Associated Press the ITC was submitted by the federation, and Neymar's transfer would be ratified later Friday, clearing the way for him to play at Guingamp on Sunday.\n\nThe hold-up prevented Neymar from making his PSG debut last Saturday against Amiens after completing his world-record 222 million euros ($262 million) transfer.\n\nPSG wanted Neymar to start the season at its Parc des Princes home but his debut was delayed because of the paperwork issues. Neymar was unveiled to the PSG fans on Saturday but could only watch from the stands as his new team started its league campaign with a 2-0 win.\n\nBarcelona said there was nothing strange about the situation and the wait was due to the banks. Just a few hours before the French federation said it had received the ITC, the 222 million euros was made available in Barcelona's accounts.\n\nBarcelona denied speculation that slowed down the process in retaliation for PSG luring one of its biggest stars out of the Camp Nou. Barcelona said it had been waiting on the banks to complete the transaction for the massive amount of money.\n\nPSG coach Unai Emery has yet to announce his squad for the trip to Guingamp, but wants Neymar to be playing.\n\n\"We all want him to start playing,\" Emery told a news conference on Friday. \"We want him in the squad, and in the starting 11. He has trained well, and we have also worked on tactical aspects and set-pieces. He is ready.\"\n\n___", "time": "23:37:00"}

17,000-capacity Stade du Rouduorou, tucked away in sleepy Brittany, which on Sunday greets Neymar, the world's most expensive footballer.\n\nWith the mundanity of transfer paperwork finally resolved, the 25-year-old Brazilian magician will line up for Paris Saint-Germain for the first time since his mind-boggling 222 million euro ($261 million) move from Barcelona.\n\n\"He's physically ready to play the whole ninety minutes,\" PSG coach Unai Emery told AFP.\n\n\"He's been working well and we looked hard at tactics and free-kicks. We all want him in the starting eleven, he's a player we need in the group.\"\n\nEven Guingamp coach Antoine Kombouar\u00e9, himself a former PSG boss, wants Neymar to play despite the potential for destruction at the feet of the Brazilian superstar.\n\n\"I want the fans to come Sunday to see Guingamp win... preferably against a side with Neymar in it.\n\n\"But the people here are not talking about Neymar.

There is no reason for this hold-up to continue.\n\n\"These are complicated deals, but there is no missing document today.\n\n\"I do not need to tell you that there are a few problems within the Spanish federation. I do not doubt that this will be quickly solved.

The other players here are also some great players, so together we can get better and grow.\"\n\nOnce again, PSG's main rivals for domestic honours appear to be Monaco, who are desperately trying to hang on to rising star Kylian Mbappe in the face of serious interest from Real Madrid.\n\nThe 18-year-old started in their opening 3-2 victory over Toulouse last weekend, as captain Radamel Falcao found the net.\n\nLeonardo Jardim's principality outfit will be expecting to make it two wins from two when they pay a visit to Dijon on Sunday.\n\nNice, who have the first leg of their Champions League play-off against Napoli on Wednesday, kick off the second weekend at home to promoted Troyes on Friday without their two star players the injured Mario Balotelli and new signing Wesley Sneijder.\n\nLyon's youthful side started with a 4-0 thumping of Strasbourg last week and travel out to Brittany to take on Rennes on Friday.\n\nNantes v Marseille (1500), Amiens v Angers (1800), Bordeaux v Metz (1800), Caen v Saint-Etienne (1800), Toulouse v Montpellier (1800)\n\nSunday\n\nStrasbourg v Lille (1300), Dijon v Monaco (1500), Guingamp v Paris Saint-Germain (1900)", "time": "14:28:00"}

and Barcelona's storied Camp Nou, the world's most expensive footballer Neymar will be welcomed to French football on Sunday at Guingamp's humble 17,000-capacity Stade du Rouduorou in sleepy Brittany.\n\nWith the mundanity of transfer paperwork finally resolved, the 25-year-old Brazilian magician will line up for Paris Saint-Germain for the first time since his mind-boggling 222 million euro ($261 million) move from Barcelona.\n\n\"He's physically ready to play the whole ninety minutes,\" PSG coach Unai Emery said.\n\n\"He's been working well and we looked hard at tactics and free-kicks. We all want him in the starting 11, he's a player we need in the group.\"\n\nEven Guingamp coach Antoine Kombouare, himself a former PSG boss, wants Neymar to play despite the potential havoc he could wreak on the home defence.\n\n\"I want the fans to come on Sunday to see Guingamp win... preferably against a side with Neymar in it,\" he said.\n\nIt will be a major culture shock for Neymar in a town which has a population of just 7,000 and is best known for its annual Breton dance showcase, the Saint Loup Festival.\n\nHowever, that's not to say that Guingamp do not have football pedigree - former Chelsea and Ivory Coast star Didier Drogba spent a season at the club in 2002/2003.\n\nThey were French Cup winners in 2009 and 2014, and last season beat PSG 2-1 in the corresponding league fixture.\n\n\"We could have filled a stadium of 40,000 seats with no problem at all,\" said Guingamp president Bertrand Desplat, whose club budget is an eighth of what PSG paid for Neymar.\n\nJournalists from far and wide are expected for the game - the ground's press tribune, built to hold 80 people, has been extended to cater for 350.\n\nA total of 145 stewards will be on duty at the ground - 30 more than usual.\n\nNeymar will simply be glad to put his tax troubles behind him and get back to doing what he does best after his lawyer revealed on Saturday that the Brazilian superstar has agreed to pay a $2.5 million fine for tax evasion in his homeland.\n\nHis 2013 transfer to Barca from Sau Paulo's Santos is also the subject of a Spanish tax fraud investigation.\n\nMeanwhile, French media speculated over who in the expensively-assembled PSG team will make way for Neymar.\n\nLe Parisien suggested it will be Javier Pastore, the Argentine star who was the first major signing after PSG were bought by their ambitious Qatari owners.\n\n\"After first giving up his No.10 shirt, will he (Pastore) now give him (Neymar) his place in the team?\" Le Parisien asked of the player who took up the No.10 shirt after Zlatan Ibrahimovic left for Manchester United last season, only to hand it to the Brazilian this summer.\n\n\"Neymar will start on the left at the expense of Pastore.\"\n\nSports daily L'Equipe saw things differently, though.\n\n\"A trio of Neymar, Pastore and Angel di Maria will support (striker) Ederson Cavani,\" predicted L'Equipe.\n\nThe match in Guingamp kicks-off at 1900GMT.\n\nAn hour later, and around 1,200km further south, Barcelona will start their first competitive match without Neymar by facing bitter rivals Real Madrid in the first leg of the Spanish Super Cup.\n\nBarca's scattergun approach to finding a replacement for Neymar has so far been unsuccessful with bids for Liverpool's Philippe Coutinho and Ousmane Dembele of Borussia Dortmund rebuffed.\n\nGerard Deulofeu was handed Neymar's role alongside Lionel Messi and Luis Suarez up front in Monday's 5-0 friendly win over Chapecoense on his return to the club after spells at Everton and AC Milan.\n\nAnd while he's not a like-for-like replacement, Spanish press claim former Tottenham Hotspur midfielder Paulinho, a Brazil international, is on the verge of a 40-million-euro move to Barca from China's Guangzhou Evergrande.\n\nGet latest news & live updates on the go on your pc with News App. Download The Times of India news app for your device.", "time": "12:43:00"}

There is no reason for this hold-up to continue.\n\n\"These are complicated deals, but there is no missing document today.\n\n\"I do not need to tell you that there are a few problems within the Spanish Federation. I do not doubt that this will be quickly solved. Wolves do not eat each other, you know.\"\n\nNeymar watched from the Parc des Princes stands as PSG cruised to a low-key 2-0 win over newly-promoted Amiens in their Ligue 1 opener last time out, and coach Unai Emery will want the forward available sooner rather than later.\n\nThe 25-year-old scored 105 goals in his four seasons at Barcelona, and his new team will be expecting him to score far more over the next few years.\n\nAlthough the main goal for the capital club is to finally challenge for the Champions League crown, their first task this term will be to retake the Ligue 1 title from Monaco.\n\nSpaniard Emery has no doubt that his new arrival will help the team achieve those lofty goals, whether he makes his debut on Sunday or the following week against Toulouse.\n\n\"He's a player who will help the club get to a higher level,\" he said.\n\n\"Without Neymar PSG is a great club, but with Neymar it's a little better.\n\n\"The way we will adapt being close to a player like him... The other players here are also some great players, so together we can get better and grow.\"\n\nOnce again, PSG's main rivals for domestic honours appear to be Monaco, who are desperately trying to hang on to rising star Kylian Mbappe in the face of serious interest from Real Madrid.\n\nThe 18-year-old started in their opening 3-2 victory over Toulouse last weekend, as captain Radamel Falcao found the net.\n\nLeonardo Jardim's principality outfit will be expecting to make it two wins from two when they pay a visit to Dijon on Sunday.\n\nNice, who have the first leg of their Champions League play-off against Napoli on Wednesday, kick off the second weekend at home to promoted Troyes on Friday without their two star players the injured Mario Balotelli and new signing Wesley Sneijder.\n\nLyon's youthful side started with a 4-0 thumping of Strasbourg last week and travel out to Brittany to take on Rennes on Friday.\n\nNantes v Marseille (1500), Amiens v Angers (1800), Bordeaux v Metz (1800), Caen v Saint-Etienne (1800), Toulouse v Montpellier (1800)\n\nSunday\n\nStrasbourg v Lille (1300), Dijon v Monaco (1500), Guingamp v Paris Saint-Germain (1900)", "time": "11:56:00"}

The French side's hierarchy are looking to put in place a three-man trident of striker Edinson Cavani, new recruit Neymar and Mbappe. Sporting director Antero Henrique is also after a defensive midfielder with FC Porto's Danilo Pereira at the top of his wish list. That would cost an additional \u20ac60million - the value of his release clause.\n\nHowever, PSG will find Monaco digging in their heels over a move for Mbappe. Last season's Ligue 1 champions have so far resisted the temptation to cash in on their star man - especially to the side that challenged them for the title last season. Mbappe is believed to be concerned about the exits of team-mates Bernardo Silva, Benjamin Mendy - both sold to Manchester City - and Tiemoue Bakayoko, who is now at Chelsea.\n\nMbappe remains PSG's top target and according to Le Parisien the arrival last week of Neymar in a world-record \u20ac222million transfer has opened his eyes to the possibility of a move to the French capital.\n\nPSG aren't worried about breaking Uefa's Financial Fair Play regulations. They are confident of increasing sponsorship income on the back of the Neymar deal alone. In addition, they are hopeful of raising sale proceeds from the sales of forward Grzegorz Krychowiak, midfielder Blaise Matuidi, right-back Serge Aurier and winger Angel di Mar\u00eda.\n\nBut PSG's business this summer has irritated some of Europe's elite. The French club will have the opportunity to field any criticisms head-on when the European Clubs Association meets in Madrid on Wednesday.", "time": "10:42:00"}

it's Guingamp's humble 17,000-capacity Stade du Rouduorou, tucked away in sleepy Brittany, which on Sunday greets Neymar, the world's most expensive footballer.\n\nWith the mundanity of transfer paperwork finally resolved, the 25-year-old Brazilian magician will line up for Paris Saint-Germain for the first time since his mind-boggling 222 million euro ($261 million) move from Barcelona.\n\n\"He's physically ready to play the whole ninety minutes,\" PSG coach Unai Emery told AFP.\n\n\"He's been working well and we looked hard at tactics and free-kicks. We all want him in the starting eleven, he's a player we need in the group.\"\n\nEven Guingamp coach Antoine Kombouar\u00e9, himself a former PSG boss, wants Neymar to play despite the potential for destruction at the feet of the Brazilian superstar.\n\n\"I want the fans to come Sunday to see Guingamp win... preferably against a side with Neymar in it.\n\n\"But the people here are not talking about Neymar. The people here support their team.\"\n\nIt will be a major culture shock for Neymar in a town which has a population of just 7,000 and is best known for its annual Breton dance showcase, the Saint Loup Festival which draws visitors from around the world.\n\nHowever, that's not to say that Guingamp do not have football pedigree.\n\nThey were French Cup winners in 2009 and 2014 and last season beat PSG 2-1 in the corresponding league fixture, the capital city club's second defeat in four visits to Guingamp since their hosts were promoted in 2013.\n\nFurthermore, former Chelsea and Ivory Coast star Didier Drogba spent a season at the club in 2002/2003.\n\n\"We could have filled a stadium of 40,000 seats with no problem at all,\" said Guingamp president Bertrand Desplat whose club budget is an eighth of what PSG paid for Neymar.\n\n\"Remember the star of the show is going to be Neymar and for us we want to welcome this very special player and his team in the best conditions possible.\"\n\nJournalists from far and wide are expected for the game -- the ground's press tribune, built to hold 80 people, has been extended to cater for 350.\n\nA total of 145 stewards will be on duty at the ground -- 30 more than usual.\n\n1,200km away, Barca start new era\n\nMeanwhile, French media speculated over who in the expensively-assembled PSG team will make way for Neymar.\n\nLe Parisien suggested it will be Javier Pastore, the Argentine star who was the first major signing after PSG were bought by their ambitious Qatari owners.\n\n\"After first giving up his No.10 shirt, will he (Pastore) now give him (Neymar) his place in the team?\" Le Parisien asked of the player who took up the No.10 shirt after Zlatan Ibrahimovic left for Manchester United last season, only to hand it to the Brazilian this summer.\n\n\"Neymar will start on the left at the cost of Pastore.\"\n\nSports daily L'Equipe saw things differently, though.\n\n\"Neymar -- the football version,\" ran their headline on Saturday in a light-hearted reference to how the most expensive transfer in football history has dominated news despite Neymar not yet having kicked a ball in anger.\n\n\"A trio of Neymar, Pastore and Angel di Maria will support (striker) Ederson Cavani,\" predicted L'Equipe.\n\nThe match in Guingamp kicks-off at 1900GMT.\n\nAn hour later, and around 1,200km further south, Barcelona will start their first competitive match without Neymar by facing bitter rivals Real Madrid in the first leg of the Spanish Super Cup.\n\nBarca's scattergun approach to finding a replacement for Neymar has so far been unsuccessful with bids for Liverpool's Philippe Coutinho and Ousmane Dembele of Borussia Dortmund rebuffed.\n\nGerard Deulofeu was handed Neymar's role alongside Lionel Messi and Luis Suarez up front in Monday's 5-0 friendly win over Chapecoense on his return to the club after spells at Everton and AC Milan.\n\nAnd the Spanish international took his chance with a goal and two assists in just 45 minutes on the field.\n\nAFP", "time": "10:12:00"}

There is no reason for this hold-up to continue.\n\n\"These are complicated deals, but there is no missing document today.\n\n\"I do not need to tell you that there are a few problems within the Spanish federation. I do not doubt that this will be quickly solved. Wolves do not eat each other, you know.\"\n\nNeymar watched from the Parc des Princes stands as PSG cruised to a low-key 2-0 win over newly-promoted Amiens in their Ligue 1 opener last time out, and coach Unai Emery will want the forward available sooner rather than later.\n\nThe 25-year-old scored 105 goals in his four seasons at Barcelona, and his new team will be expecting him to score far more over the next few years.\n\nAlthough the main goal for the capital club is to finally challenge for the Champions League crown, their first task this term will be to retake the Ligue 1 title from Monaco.\n\nSpaniard Emery has no doubt that his new arrival will help the team achieve those lofty goals, whether he makes his debut on Sunday or the following week against Toulouse.\n\n\"He's a player who will help the club get to a higher level,\" he said.\n\n\"Without Neymar PSG is a great club, but with Neymar it's a little better.\n\n\"The way we will adapt being close to a player like him... The other players here are also some great players, so together we can get better and grow.\"\n\nOnce again, PSG's main rivals for domestic honours appear to be Monaco, who are desperately trying to hang on to rising star Kylian Mbappe in the face of serious interest from Real Madrid.\n\nThe 18-year-old started in their opening 3-2 victory over Toulouse last weekend, as captain Radamel Falcao found the net.\n\nLeonardo Jardim's principality outfit will be expecting to make it two wins from two when they pay a visit to Dijon on Sunday.\n\nNice, who have the first leg of their Champions League play-off against Napoli on Wednesday, kick off the second weekend at home to promoted Troyes on Friday without their two star players the injured Mario Balotelli and new signing Wesley Sneijder.\n\nNeymar back to Brazil for World Cup qualifiers\n\nLyon's youthful side started with a 4-0 thumping of Strasbourg last week and travel out to Brittany to take on Rennes on Friday.\n\nNeymar will rejoin Brazil for 2018 World Cup qualifiers against Ecuador and Colombia in his first international duty since being transferred in a record setting deal from Barcelona to Paris Saint-Germain, national coach Tite said.\n\nRested for the June friendlies -- a 1-0 loss to Argentina and a 4-0 defeat of Australia -- the 25-year-old striker will be alongside three of his new PSG teammates: Marquinhos, Thiago Silva and Daniel Alves.\n\nTite said the drama over Neymar's transfer \"changes absolutely nothing\" for the Brazilian team.\n\nNeymar \"is looking for new challenges, but the important thing is that he be happy to play football, that he adapts well and evolves to a new level,\" Tite said.\n\nThe coach said Barcelona and PSG have \"a similar tactical formation of 4-3-3.\"\n\nThe main change to the Brazilian squad is the arrival of talented midfielder Luan Vieira, 24, who was in the Olympic gold medal winning team at Rio 2016. He currently plays for Gremio in Brazil but is bound for Spartak Moscow.\n\nAfter some torrid years, Brazil look back to their best, knocking Germany from the top of the FIFA rankings and in March becoming the first country to qualify for the 2018 World Cup. During his time in charge, Tite has eight victories out of eight in competitive matches.\n\nBrazil play Ecuador on August 31 in Porto Alegre, Brazil, and go to Barranquilla in Colombia on September 5.\n\nAFP", "time": "15:15:00"}

serious danger of losing out on Thomas Lemar - if Monaco decide to sell Kylian Mbappe.\n\nSunSport revealed last month Lemar had already agreed a switch to the Emirates with a \u00a340million fee close to being sealed.\n\nGunners boss Arsene Wenger has been frustrated in his attempts to get the deal for Lemar over the line ahead of the start of the new season against Leicester City on Friday.\n\nWenger has added Alexandre Lacazette and Sead Kolasinac to his ranks and is desperate to land another top target before the window shuts.\n\nHowever, the 21-year-old French international could see his dream move to the Premier League scuppered if Monaco allow his mate Mbappe to leave.\n\nMbappe, 18, is reportedly keen to leave Monaco this summer with Barcelona, Real Madrid and Paris Saint-Germain fighting it out for his signature.\n\nThe teenager has become the most wanted player in world football - and unlike Neymar there is a genuine market for his talents.\n\nPSG are reported to have agreed personal terms with the teenage sensation valued at \u00a3160million, but will find it difficult to land him as Monaco are refusing to sell to domestic rivals.\n\nIf Mbappe quits the French champions the club hierarchy will draw a line under the summer departures and the Stade Louis II exit door will be slammed shut.\n\nWenger could be forced to play a waiting game while the Mbappe saga is played out - and if he is sold the Gunners boss will have to move on to other targets.\n\nLeicester City winger Riyad Mahrez is an option, but the Foxes will only consider bids of over \u00a345m for the Algerian star.\n\nBernardo Silva, Benjamain Mendy, Tiemoue Bakayoko and Valere Germain have all left the principality in recent months and a club trying to defend the title cannot afford to haemorrhage more top stars.\n\nLemar and Mbappe featured for the champions when they kicked off the defence of their title with a 3-2 win over Toulouse on Sunday.\n\nIf the answer is no you need to take a long, hard look at yourself.\n\nBecause the Dream Team game - the UK's biggest fantasy football game - is back and better than ever this season.\n\nYou've got a \u00a350m budget to pick 11 players, with all the biggest new signings ready and raring to go ahead of a mouthwatering new Premier League campaign.\n\nSo what are you waiting for?

happen.\n\nThe forward is a Nike athlete and the company supply the PSG kit.\n\nEdison Cavani, Marco Veratti and Neymar all represent Nike who want Mbappe in the French capital to line up a huge marketing strategy ahead of the 2018 World Cup in Russia.\n\nThe biggest stumbling block will be the Ligue 1 champions reluctance to sell to a domestic rival.\n\nBernardo Silva, Benjamin Mendy to Mancehster City and Tiemoue Bakayoko to Chelsea have all been sold abroad.\n\nFabinho was a PSG target this summer - but thier advances have so far been rejected out of hand.\n\nValere Germain was the only first team squad member sold to a French club when he joined Marseille in June.\n\nMbappe featured for the champions who kicked off the defence of thier title with a 3-2 home win against Toulouse.\n\nThomas Lemar, who is keen to join Arsenal this summer also started to game at the Stade Louis II stadium last Friday.\n\nIf the answer is no you need to take a long, hard look at yourself.\n\nBecause the Dream Team game - the UK's biggest fantasy football game - is back and better than ever this season.\n\nYou've got a \u00a350m budget to pick 11 players, with all the biggest

world's most expensive footballer Neymar will be welcomed to French football on Sunday at Guingamp's humble 17,000-capacity Stade du Rouduorou in sleepy Brittany.\n\nWith the mundanity of transfer paperwork finally resolved, the 25-year-old Brazilian magician will line up for Paris Saint-Germain for the first time since his mind-boggling 222 million euro ($261 million) move from Barcelona.\n\n\"He's physically ready to play the whole ninety minutes,\" PSG coach Unai Emery told AFP.\n\n\"He's been working well and we looked hard at tactics and free-kicks. We all want him in the starting 11, he's a player we need in the group.\"\n\nEven Guingamp coach Antoine Kombouare, himself a former PSG boss, wants Neymar to play despite the potential havoc he could wreak on the home defence.\n\n\"I want the fans to come on Sunday to see Guingamp win... preferably against a side with Neymar in it,\" he said.\n\nIt will be a major culture shock for Neymar in a town which has a population of just 7,000 and is best known for its annual Breton dance showcase, the Saint Loup Festival.\n\nHowever, that's not to say that Guingamp do not have football pedigree -- former Chelsea and Ivory Coast star Didier Drogba spent a season at the club in 2002/2003.\n\nThey were French Cup winners in 2009 and 2014, and last season beat PSG 2-1 in the corresponding league fixture.\n\n\"We could have filled a stadium of 40,000 seats with no problem at all,\" said Guingamp president Bertrand Desplat, whose club budget is an eighth of what PSG paid for Neymar.\n\nJournalists from far and wide are expected for the game -- the ground's press tribune, built to hold 80 people, has been extended to cater for 350.\n\nA total of 145 stewards will be on duty at the ground -- 30 more than usual.\n\nNeymar will simply be glad to put his tax troubles behind him and get back to doing what he does best after his lawyer revealed on Saturday that the Brazilian superstar has agreed to pay a $2.5 million fine for tax evasion in his homeland.\n\nHis 2013 transfer to Barca from Sau Paulo's Santos is also the subject of a Spanish tax fraud investigation.\n\n- 1,200km away, Barca start new era -\n\nMeanwhile, French media speculated over who in the expensively-assembled PSG team will make way for Neymar.\n\nLe Parisien suggested it will be Javier Pastore, the Argentine star who was the first major signing after PSG were bought by their ambitious Qatari owners.\n\n\"After first giving up his No.10 shirt, will he (Pastore) now give him (Neymar) his place in the team?\" Le Parisien asked of the player who took up the No.10 shirt after Zlatan Ibrahimovic left for Manchester United last season, only to hand it to the Brazilian this summer.\n\n\"Neymar will start on the left at the expense of Pastore.\"\n\nSports daily L'Equipe saw things differently, though.\n\n\"A trio of Neymar, Pastore and Angel di Maria will support (striker) Ederson Cavani,\" predicted L'Equipe.\n\nThe match in Guingamp kicks-off at 1900GMT.\n\nAn hour later, and around 1,200km further south, Barcelona will start their first competitive match without Neymar by facing bitter rivals Real Madrid in the first leg of the Spanish Super Cup.\n\nBarca's scattergun approach to finding a replacement for Neymar has so far been unsuccessful with bids for Liverpool's Philippe Coutinho and Ousmane Dembele of Borussia Dortmund rebuffed.\n\nGerard Deulofeu was handed Neymar's role alongside Lionel Messi and Luis Suarez up front in Monday's 5-0 friendly win over Chapecoense on his return to the club after spells at Everton and AC Milan.\n\nAnd while he's not a like-for-like replacement, Spanish press claim former Tottenham Hotspur midfielder Paulinho, a Brazil international, is on the verge of a 40-million-euro move to Barca from China's Guangzhou Evergrande.", "time": "11:32:00"}

Share this article with Twitter Share this article with Google Plus Share this article with Whatsapp Share this article through email Share this article through sms\n\nKylian Mbappe is on the verge of becoming the second most expensive player ever after Monaco finally relented and agreed to sell the teenager to rivals Paris Saint-Germain.\n\nWhy no-one can stop the Premier League title from heading back to Manchester this season\n\nThe 18-year-old enjoyed an incredible breakout campaign last season in which he scored 15 league goals and became the youngest ever scorer in a Champions League final.\n\nThe likes of Arsenal and Manchester City had both made contact with Mbappe and his entourage as they tried to convince him to join, though Real Madrid seemed the likeliest destination.\n\nBut, according to Marca, it is PSG who have won the race to sign the youngster, agreeing a 'deal in principle' to sign the forward for \u20ac180 million (\u00a3163m), of which \u00a318m is bonuses.\n\nThe news comes barely a week after Neymar was unveiled at the Parc des Princes in a world-record \u00a3198m move, with Mbappe excited about the prospect of playing with the Brazilian.\n\nLes Parisiens will boast perhaps the most exciting attack in Europe next season, with Unai Emery able to call on Neymar, Mbappe, Edinson Cavani and Angel Di Maria.\n\nQuite how PSG are funding the deal without breaching Financial Fair Play rules is another matter entirely, and the deal will likely see UEFA scrutinise the club's summer business to ensure FFP is not being exploited.\n\nKylian Mbappe's Ligue 1 stats 2016/17Games played29Goals15Assists8\n\nShare\n\nBoth PSG boss Unai Emery and President Nasser Al-Khelaifi made huge plays to lure Mbappe to the French capital, travelling to Bondy to talk with both the player and his father, Wilfried - the closest thing he has to an agent.\n\nAfter allaying fears that Emery's system is not suited to his style, L'Equipe - who confirm the agreement between Mbappe and PSG - say the French starlet was further won over by the capture of Neymar, who he is desperate to play alongside next season.\n\nReports in Spain say Mbappe will receive a salary of \u00a310.8m-a-year after tax (over \u00a3200,000-a-week).\n\nWhen Mbappe requested that offer be matched by Real in negotiations with the Spanish giants, they baulked at his demands and, according to COPE, said, 'Congratulations and good luck in Paris'.\n\nThe move will be a further blow to Monaco who have been asset stripped this summer, losing Benjamin Mendy, Bernardo Silva, Tiemoue Bakayoko and now, seemingly, Mbappe.\n\nPSG, meanwhile, look set to challenge for the Champions League after a summer spend that could exceed \u00a3400m, having also added Dani Alves on a free transfer, though have recouped just \u00a315m of that in player sales.\n\nMORE: Kylian Mbappe sends Manchester City fans into a frenzy by posing with Leroy Sane amid

The other players here are also some great players, so together we can get better and grow.\"\n\nOnce again, PSG's main rivals for domestic honours appear to be Monaco, who are desperately trying to hang on to rising star Kylian Mbappe in the face of serious interest from Real Madrid.\n\nThe 18-year-old started in their opening 3-2 victory over Toulouse last weekend, as captain Radamel Falcao found the net.\n\nLeonardo Jardim's principality outfit will be expecting to make it two wins from two when they pay a visit to Dijon on Sunday.\n\nNice, who have the first leg of their Champions League play-off against Napoli on Wednesday, kick off the second weekend at home to promoted Troyes on Friday without their two star players the injured Mario Balotelli and new signing Wesley Sneijder.\n\nLyon's youthful side started with a 4-0 thumping of Strasbourg last week and travel out to Brittany to take on Rennes on Friday.\n\nNantes v Marseille (1500), Amiens v Angers (1800), Bordeaux v Metz (1800), Caen v Saint-Etienne (1800), Toulouse v Montpellier (1800)\n\nSunday\n\nStrasbourg v Lille (1300), Dijon v Monaco (1500), Guingamp v Paris Saint-Germain (1900)", "time": "15:33:00"}

this article with Whatsapp Share this article through email Share this article through sms\n\nParis Saint-Germain's sensational summer spending may not be over yet as they reportedly look to follow up the Neymar deal with the transfer of Monaco striker Kylian Mbappe.\n\nRumour Mill: our round-up of football gossip, rumours and speculation\n\nThe Ligue 1 giants have just broken the world transfer record to bring in the Brazilian in a \u00a3199million deal from Barcelona, but believe they can continue to spend vast amounts on bolstering their attack even further this summer.\n\nMbappe has been linked with PSG already in this transfer window, as well as with Arsenal, Manchester City and Real Madrid, and is seemingly back on the agenda.\n\nLikely to cost around \u00a3163m, PSG are aware they will have to sell players in order to make the move work, with a number of options already being considered.\n\nAccording to Le Parisien, the first-teamers who could make way are Angel Di Maria, Grzegorz Krychowiak, Serge Aurier and Jese Rodriguez, while there has also been some recent speculation over Julian Draxler and Lucas Moura.\n\nMbappe has mostly looked set for Real Madrid this summer, though latest surprise reports suggest they've cooled their interest for the time being, which could allow PSG to swoop.\n\nKylian Mbappe's Ligue 1 stats 2016/17Games

team-mate Neymar.\n\nPSG have signed a number of big names since their Qatari takeover in 2011, though if they could land both Neymar and Mbappe in one summer this would trump any of their previous work.\n\nMORE: Antonio Conte rules out mega-signing this summer amid Bale and Mbappe talk", "time": "07:34:00"}

Loges in Saint-Germain-en-Laye, near Paris, on August 11, 2017. ALAIN JOCARD / AFP\n\nAfter dazzling Rio's imposing Maracana and Barcelona's storied Camp Nou, the world's most expensive footballer Neymar will be welcomed to French football on Sunday at Guingamp's humble 17,000-capacity Stade du Rouduorou in sleepy Brittany.\n\nWith the mundanity of transfer paperwork finally resolved, the 25-year-old Brazilian magician will line up for Paris Saint-Germain for the first time since his mind-boggling 222 million euro ($261 million) move from Barcelona.\n\n\"He's physically ready to play the whole ninety minutes,\" PSG coach Unai Emery told AFP.\n\n\"He's been working well and we looked hard at tactics and free-kicks. We all want him in the starting 11, he's a player we need in the group.\"\n\nEven Guingamp coach Antoine Kombouare, himself a former PSG boss, wants Neymar to play despite the potential havoc he could wreak on the home defence.\n\n\"I want the fans to come on Sunday to see Guingamp win... preferably against a side with Neymar in it,\" he said.\n\nIt will be a major culture shock for Neymar in a town which has a population of just 7,000 and is best known for its annual Breton dance showcase, the Saint Loup Festival.\n\nHowever, that's not to say that Guingamp do not have football pedigree -- former Chelsea and Ivory Coast star Didier Drogba spent a season at the club in 2002/2003.\n\nThey were French Cup winners in 2009 and 2014, and last season beat PSG 2-1 in the corresponding league fixture.\n\n\"We could have filled a stadium of 40,000 seats with no problem at all,\" said Guingamp president Bertrand Desplat, whose club budget is an eighth of what PSG paid for Neymar.\n\nJournalists from far and wide are expected for the game -- the ground's press tribune, built to hold 80 people, has been extended to cater for 350.\n\nA total of 145 stewards will be on duty at the ground -- 30 more than usual.\n\nNeymar will simply be glad to put his tax troubles behind him and get back to doing what he does best after his lawyer revealed on Saturday that the Brazilian superstar has agreed to pay a $2.5 million fine for tax evasion in his homeland.\n\nHis 2013 transfer to Barca from Sau Paulo's Santos is also the subject of a Spanish tax fraud investigation.\n\n1,200km away, Barca start new era\n\nMeanwhile, French media speculated over who in the expensively-assembled PSG team will make way for Neymar.\n\nLe Parisien suggested it will be Javier Pastore, the Argentine star who was the first major signing after PSG were bought by their ambitious Qatari owners.\n\n\"After first giving up his No.10 shirt, will he (Pastore) now give him (Neymar) his place in the team?\" Le Parisien asked of the player who took up the No.10 shirt after Zlatan Ibrahimovic left for Manchester United last season, only to hand it to the Brazilian this summer.\n\n\"Neymar will start on the left at the expense of Pastore.\"\n\nSports daily L'Equipe saw things differently, though.\n\n\"A trio of Neymar, Pastore and Angel di Maria will support (striker) Ederson Cavani,\" predicted L'Equipe.\n\nThe match in Guingamp kicks-off at 1900GMT.\n\nAn hour later, and around 1,200km further south, Barcelona will start their first competitive match without Neymar by facing bitter rivals Real Madrid in the first leg of the Spanish Super Cup.\n\nBarca's scattergun approach to finding a replacement for Neymar has so far been unsuccessful with bids for Liverpool's Philippe Coutinho and Ousmane Dembele of Borussia Dortmund rebuffed.\n\nGerard Deulofeu was handed Neymar's role alongside Lionel Messi and Luis Suarez up front in Monday's 5-0 friendly win over Chapecoense on his return to the club after spells at Everton and AC Milan.\n\nAnd while he's not a like-for-like replacement, Spanish press claim former Tottenham Hotspur midfielder Paulinho, a Brazil international, is on the verge of a 40-million-euro move to Barca from China's Guangzhou Evergrande.", "time": "10:27:00"}

Maracana and Barcelona's storied Camp Nou, the world's most expensive footballer Neymar will be welcomed to French football on Sunday at Guingamp's humble 17,000-capacity Stade du Rouduorou in sleepy Brittany.\n\nWith the transfer paperwork finally resolved, the 25-year-old Brazilian magician will line up for Paris Saint-Germain for the first time since his mind-boggling 222 million euro ($261 million) move from Barcelona.\n\n\"He's physically ready to play the whole ninety minutes,\" PSG coach Unai Emery told AFP.\n\n\"He's been working well and we looked hard at tactics and free-kicks. We all want him in the starting 11, he's a player we need in the group.\"\n\nEven Guingamp coach Antoine Kombouare, himself a former PSG boss, wants Neymar to play despite the potential havoc he could wreak on the home defence.\n\n\"I want the fans to come on Sunday to see Guingamp win... preferably against a side with Neymar in it,\" he said.\n\nIt will be a major culture shock for Neymar in a town which has a population of just 7,000 and is best known for its annual Breton dance showcase, the Saint Loup Festival.\n\nHowever, that's not to say that Guingamp do not have football pedigree -- former Chelsea and Ivory Coast star Didier Drogba spent a season at the club in 2002/2003.\n\nThey were French Cup winners in 2009 and 2014, and last season beat PSG 2-1 in the corresponding league fixture.\n\n\"We could have filled a stadium of 40,000 seats with no problem at all,\" said Guingamp president Bertrand Desplat, whose club budget is an eighth of what PSG paid for Neymar.\n\nAt the Lapin Rouge bistro, a Guingamp fan hangout 200 metres from their ground, all the talk was of Neymar and how to get a photo when the team bus arrived from the PSG hotel a 30-minute drive away at nearby Saint-Brieuc.\n\n\"I'm sure he'll score tonight,\" one of the fans told AFP.\n\nJournalists from far and wide are expected for the game -- the ground's press tribune, built to hold 80 people, has been extended to cater for 350.\n\nA total of 145 stewards will be on duty at the ground -- 30 more than usual.\n\nNeymar will simply be glad to put his tax troubles behind him and get back to doing what he does best after his lawyer revealed on Saturday that the Brazilian superstar has agreed to pay a $2.5 million fine for tax evasion in his homeland.\n\nHis 2013 transfer to Barca from Sao Paulo's Santos is also the subject of a Spanish tax fraud investigation.\n\nAn hour later, and around 1,200km further south, Barcelona will start their first competitive match without Neymar by facing bitter rivals Real Madrid in the first leg of the Spanish Super Cup.\n\nBarca's scattergun approach to finding a replacement for Neymar has so far been unsuccessful with bids for Liverpool's Philippe Coutinho and Ousmane Dembele of Borussia Dortmund rebuffed.\n\nGerard Deulofeu was handed Neymar's role alongside Lionel Messi and Luis Suarez up front in Monday's 5-0 friendly win over Chapecoense on his return to the club after spells at Everton and AC Milan.\n\nAnd while he's not a like-for-like replacement, Spanish press claim former Tottenham Hotspur midfielder Paulinho, a Brazil international, is on the verge of a 40-million-euro move to Barca from China's Guangzhou Evergrande.", "time": "16:40:00"}

remains active in the summer transfer market.\n\nIt could be that they go big once again, with one of the most sought-after teenage talents in world football the next player in their sights.\n\nMbappe has registered on the Parc des Princes transfer radar for some time, with Tidesports source revealing in June that a \u20ac135m bid had been tabled.\n\nNo deal was done then, as attention turned to Neymar, but PSG has continued to remain in contact with Monaco's striking sensation.\n\nIn fact, it is understood that president Nasser Al-Khelaifi put a personal call to Mbappe during the Neymar negotiations to assure the youngster that he remained in the club's plans.\n\nPSG has also been in touch with the people around Mbappe, in particular his father Wilfried.\n\nInitial suspicions regarding the motives of the capital club have started to ease, with the project on offer in Paris becoming ever more appealing.\n\nThat has forced Monaco into a corner, with discussions regarding a planned contract extension having to be shelved due to the demands being made.\n\nMbappe has left contractual matters in the hands of his representatives and family, amid talk of interest from PSG, Real Madrid and Manchester City.\n\nTo him, of greater concern is the sporting aspect of any deal, as he seeks guarantees that he will get regular minutes in a World Cup year and a Champions League stage on which to perform.\n\nReal Madrid and PSG are considered to be the sides best equipped to offer him the game time that he craves, but Monaco have him tied to a contract which means that they do not have to sell.\n\nThe reigning champions are also reluctant to do business with a direct domestic rival, with vice-president Vadim Vasilyev eager to avoid negotiations with PSG at any cost.\n\nThat puts Real Madrid in pole position to get a deal done, but Al-Khelaifi is unlikely to throw in the towel having made a considerable effort up until this point to keep Mbappe in the loop and to have made him aware of what could happen were his future to lie in Paris.", "time": "02:38:00"}

storied Camp Nou, but it's Guingamp's humble 17,000-capacity Stade du Rouduorou, tucked away in sleepy Brittany, which on Sunday greets Neymar, the world's most expensive footballer.\n\nWith the mundanity of transfer paperwork finally resolved, the 25-year-old Brazilian magician will line up for Paris Saint-Germain for the first time since his mind-boggling 222 million euro ($261 million) move from Barcelona.\n\n\"He's physically ready to play the whole ninety minutes,\" PSG coach Unai Emery told AFP.\n\n\"He's been working well and we looked hard at tactics and free-kicks. We all want him in the starting eleven, he's a player we need in the group.\"\n\nEven Guingamp coach Antoine Kombouar\u00e9, himself a former PSG boss, wants Neymar to play despite the potential for destruction at the feet of the Brazilian superstar.\n\nREAD: Dortmund, Bayern start with easy German Cup wins\n\n\"I want the fans to come Sunday to see Guingamp win... preferably against a side with Neymar in it.\n\n\"But the people here are not talking about Neymar. The people here support their team.\"\n\nIt will be a major culture shock for Neymar in a town which has a population of just 7,000 and is best known for its annual Breton dance showcase, the Saint Loup Festival which draws visitors from around the world.\n\nHowever, that's not to say that Guingamp do not have football pedigree.\n\nThey were French Cup winners in 2009 and 2014 and last season beat PSG 2-1 in the corresponding league fixture, the capital city club's second defeat in four visits to Guingamp since their hosts were promoted in 2013.\n\nFurthermore, former Chelsea and Ivory Coast star Didier Drogba spent a season at the club in 2002/2003.\n\n\"We could have filled a stadium of 40,000 seats with no problem at all,\" said Guingamp president Bertrand Desplat whose club budget is an eighth of what PSG paid for Neymar.\n\n\"Remember the star of the show is going to be Neymar and for us we want to welcome this very special player and his team in the best conditions possible.\"\n\nJournalists from far and wide are expected for the game -- the ground's press tribune, built to hold 80 people, has been extended to cater for 350.\n\nA total of 145 stewards will be on duty at the ground -- 30 more than usual.\n\n- 1,200km away, Barca start new era -\n\nMeanwhile, French media speculated over who in the expensively-assembled PSG team will make way for Neymar.\n\nLe Parisien suggested it will be Javier Pastore, the Argentine star who was the first major signing after PSG were bought by their ambitious Qatari owners.\n\n\"After first giving up his No.10 shirt, will he (Pastore) now give him (Neymar) his place in the team?\" Le Parisien asked of the player who took up the No.10 shirt after Zlatan Ibrahimovic left for Manchester United last season, only to hand it to the Brazilian this summer.\n\n\"Neymar will start on the left at the cost of Pastore.\"\n\nSports daily L'Equipe saw things differently, though.\n\n\"Neymar -- the football version,\" ran their headline on Saturday in a light-hearted reference to how the most expensive transfer in football history has dominated news despite Neymar not yet having kicked a ball in anger.\n\n\"A trio of Neymar, Pastore and Angel di Maria will support (striker) Ederson Cavani,\" predicted L'Equipe.\n\nThe match in Guingamp kicks-off at 1900GMT.\n\nAn hour later, and around 1,200km further south, Barcelona will start their first competitive match without Neymar by facing bitter rivals Real Madrid in the first leg of the Spanish Super Cup.\n\nBarca's scattergun approach to finding a replacement for Neymar has so far been unsuccessful with bids for Liverpool's Philippe Coutinho and Ousmane Dembele of Borussia Dortmund rebuffed.\n\nGerard Deulofeu was handed Neymar's role alongside Lionel Messi and Luis Suarez up front in Monday's 5-0 friendly win over Chapecoense on his return to the club after spells at Everton and AC Milan.\n\nAnd the Spanish international took his chance with a goal and two assists in just 45 minutes on the field.\n\n\u00a9 Agence France-Presse\n\nFor more sports coverage, visit the ABS-CBN Sports website.", "time": "06:53:00"}

He will be able to play on Sunday,\" said Professional Football League (LFP) on Friday.\n\nThe world's most expensive player should therefore run out into the mundane surroundings of the Stade du Roduourou -- capacity just over 15,000 -- in the tiny Brittany town of barely 7,000 people.\n\n\"Quite honestly it's better if he's there, much better,\" said Guingamp coach Antoine Kombouare, a former PSG player and Paris coach from 2009 to 2011.\n\n\"For us it is an extra source of motivation. We know that by beating PSG with Neymar it would be even more momentous. If Neymar is there it is all the better for the spectacle, for the supporters and for those who want to see him play, but we will be ready with or without him.\"\n\nNeymar was unveiled to the PSG fans at the Parc des Princes last weekend, but was forced to watch from the stands as his new team-mates cruised to a low-key 2-0 win over newly-promoted Amiens in their Ligue 1 opener.\n\nThe 25-year-old Brazilian scored 105 goals in his four seasons at Barcelona, and his new team will be expecting him to score far more over the next few years.\n\nAlthough the main goal for the capital club is to finally challenge for the Champions League crown, their first task this term will be to retake the Ligue 1 title from Monaco.\n\nCoach Unai Emery has no doubt that his new arrival will help the team achieve those lofty goals.\n\n\"He's a player who will help the club get to a higher level,\" said the Spaniard.\n\n\"Without Neymar PSG is a great club, but with Neymar it's a little better.\n\n\"The way we will adapt being close to a player like him... The other players here are also some great players, so together we can get better and grow.\"\n\nOnce again, PSG's main rivals for domestic honors appear to be Monaco, but they are in serious danger of losing rising star Kylian Mbappe to the capital outfit.\n\nThe 18-year-old, who is also wanted by Real Madrid, started in their opening 3-2 victory over Toulouse last weekend, as captain Radamel Falcao found the net.\n\nLeonardo Jardim's principality outfit will be expecting to make it two wins from two when they pay a visit to Dijon on Sunday.\n\nNice, who have the first leg of their Champions League play-off against Napoli on Wednesday, kick off the second weekend at home to promoted Troyes on Friday without their two star players, the injured Mario Balotelli and new signing Wesley Sneijder. Lyon's youthful side started with a 4-0 thumping of Strasbourg last week and travel out to Brittany to take on Rennes on Friday.\n\nMarseille visit Claudio Ranieri's Nantes on Saturday looking to build on their 3-0 win over Dijon last time out, but with captain Dimitri Payet missing due to injury.", "time": "21:50:00"}

have secured Mbappe from under the nose of Real Madrid.\n\nIt is understood that both sides are exchanging documentation but the deal for one of Europe's most exciting young talents has been finalised in principle.\n\nMarca report that Mbappe 'dribbled past' Real Madrid and will sign for PSG from Monaco\n\nThe 18-year-old striker is regarded as one of the most talented youngsters in Europe\n\nMbappe has been linked with elite clubs across the continent throughout the transfer window but has been pushed in the direction of PSG by his father.\n\nA previous deal in place with Los Blancos has been hijacked, with PSG willing to spend whatever is necessary to lure Mbappe to the French capital.\n\nAnd last season's Ligue 1 runners-up have stolen a march on their rivals with another huge deal, following the world record \u00a3198 fee paid for Neymar.\n\nPSG smashed the transfer record already this window with the \u00a3198million addition of Neymar\n\nThe former Barcelona forward could now form a deadly strike partnership with Mbappe as the Nasser Al-Khelaifi owned club look to establish themselves as the most powerful side in Europe.\n\nIf the 18-year-old is to complete his impending move, it will be fascinating to see which new addition will play through the middle.\n\nIt was understood Neymar opted for Unai Emery's side to break clear of Lionel Messi's shadow and lead the line but whatever the line-up, a combination with Mbappe up front will undoubtedly form one of the most deadly strike forces in football.\n\nMbappe looks set to depart last

He will be able to play on Sunday,\" said the LFP on Friday.\n\nThe world's most expensive player should therefore run out into the mundane surroundings of the Stade du Roduourou -- capacity just over 15,000 -- in the tiny Brittany town of barely 7,000 people.\n\n\"Quite honestly it's better if he's there, much better,\" said Guingamp coach Antoine Kombouare, a former PSG player and Paris coach from 2009 to 2011.\n\n\"For us it is an extra source of motivation. We know that by beating PSG with Neymar it would be even more momentous.\n\n\"If Neymar is there it is all the better for the spectacle, for the supporters and for those who want to see him play, but we will be ready with or without him.\"\n\nNeymar was unveiled to the PSG fans at the Parc des Princes last weekend but was forced to watch from the stands as his new team-mates cruised to a low-key 2-0 win over newly-promoted Amiens in their Ligue 1 opener.\n\nThe 25-year-old Brazilian scored 105 goals in his four seasons at Barcelona, and his new team will be expecting him to score far more over the next few years.\n\nAlthough the main goal for the capital club is to finally challenge for the Champions League crown, their first task this term will be to retake the Ligue 1 title from Monaco.\n\n- Better with Neymar -\n\nCoach Unai Emery has no doubt that his new arrival will help the team achieve those lofty goals.\n\n\"He's a player who will help the club get to a higher level,\" said the Spaniard.\n\n\"Without Neymar PSG is a great club, but with Neymar it's a little better.\n\n\"The way we will adapt being close to a player like him... The other players here are also some great players, so together we can get better and grow.\"\n\nOnce again, PSG's main rivals for domestic honours appear to be Monaco, but they are in serious danger of losing rising star Kylian Mbappe to the capital outfit.\n\nThe 18-year-old, who is also wanted by Real Madrid, started in their opening 3-2 victory over Toulouse last weekend, as captain Radamel Falcao found the net.\n\nLeonardo Jardim's principality outfit will be expecting to make it two wins from two when they pay a visit to Dijon on Sunday.\n\nNice, who have the first leg of their Champions League play-off against Napoli on Wednesday, kick off the second weekend at home to promoted Troyes on Friday without their two star players, the injured Mario Balotelli and new signing Wesley Sneijder.\n\nLyon's youthful side started with a 4-0 thumping of Strasbourg last week and travel out to Brittany to take on Rennes on Friday.\n\nMarseille visit Claudio Ranieri's Nantes on Saturday looking to build on their 3-0 win over Dijon last time out but with captain Dimitri Payet missing due to injury.", "time": "18:20:00"}

December last year at the tender age of 17, it was at that moment the football world opened their eyes and took notice.\n\n26 goals later, the young Frenchman is tipped to be the next Thierry Henry. With the extraordinary talent he possesses, it's easy to see why.\n\nHe has been heavily linked with a staggering $210 million move to Real Madrid which would be the second highest transfer fee in history. For a now 18-year-old who has only played six months of first tier football shows how mature he is.\n\nNow it comes down to a young and inexperienced player to practically choose his next destination, but which club would suit him best?\n\nFirst off, I'll begin by saying that now is the right time for Mbappe to move on from the Principality. Seeing as Monaco have sold their star names such as Bernardo Silva, Benjamin Mendy and Ti\u00e9mou\u00e9 Bakayoko, it should make him realise that bigger and better things await as he needs a bigger challenge.\n\nA knee injury late in the second half in the opening game of the season against Toulouse on Saturday will make him think twice about turning down a chance to sign for either Real Madrid or Barcelona as injuries happen in football. This is an opportunity that doesn't arise for many.\n\nReal Madrid have been in negotiations for Mbapp\u00e9's signature for seemingly this whole transfer window. It would be cruel on the club to have the player turn them down, but Mbapp\u00e9 would be making the right decision if he does choose to look elsewhere.\n\nWith the World Cup just around the corner, the Frenchman has been given chances under Didier Deschamps. This should be his primary focus heading into this new season because he has every possible chance of gaining a starting berth.\n\nWith Cristiano Ronaldo, Karim Benzema and Gareth Bale dominating the front three, it will be hard for Mbapp\u00e9 to get consistent playing time under Zidane. Will he settle in? Will he succumb under the pressure of the fans? Who will drop to the bench if Mbapp\u00e9 does manage to start? These are all questions that need to be answered.\n\n(photo: AFP)\n\nAt Barcelona however, Mbapp\u00e9 would find it easy to slot into the front three with Messi and Suarez after the departure of Neymar to PSG. A tactical change may be required as Mbapp\u00e9 and Suarez are both out and out strikers, which may lead to the new manager reverting to a 4-3-2-1 with Messi filling the number 10 role.\n\nFor me, he would take the club by storm and send a message to the rest of the world that they are ready to bring in the youth in exchange for the old for the likes of Andreas Iniesta and Sergio Busquets.\n\nIf he makes the move to the Catalan club, learning off Luis Suarez would be more beneficial than playing with any of the front three in the Madrid capital. This would make Mbapp\u00e9 an even more clinical finisher and improve on certain weaknesses in his game, most notably his defensive contribution and work rate, something that it is hammered into Suarez's game.\n\nIf Barcelona are able to add a few more players to their squad for the purpose of depth, then they can really challenge once again for the Champions league which will give Mbapp\u00e9 a great chance of cementing his spot at next year's World Cup.\n\nThis kid is destined for greatness, and it will be interesting to see if he can match the heights of the Brazilian Ronaldo in the near future. In a few years time when Messi and Ronaldo hang up the boots, Neymar could be facing some competition for the Ballon'dor award. In order to do that, he needs to choose Barcelona as his next home.\n\nIt's your move, Kylian.", "time": "22:18:00"}

The ex-Barcelona player should be cleared to join PSG as they take on Guingamp On Aug. 13 at 3:00 PM ET. Don't miss it!\n\nAfter missing Paris Saint-Germain's season opener, Neymar, 25, should be cleared to hit the field with his brand new club. The ex-Barcelona striker will (hopefully) make his Ligue 1 debut when Les Parisiens travel to Stade du Roundourou to take on En Avant de Goingamp (aka EA Guingamp or simply Guingamp.) However, if Barca didn't send the paperwork in time, French soccer fans better wait a little longer to see Neymar in action. Keep your fingers crossed that everything is in order and he's not simply riding the bench again.\n\nNeymar missed out on PSG's season opener against Amiens SC because Barcelona didn't give him the international transfer certificate, according to Fox Sports. Neymar was presented to the PSG fans but had to watch in the stands as PSG started their season with a 2-0. By Aug. 10, Ligue 1 had yet to receive the document from Barcelona, saying it \"does not understand\" why Barca, and La Liga, \"refuses to accept the payment for the buyout clause for Neymar.\" Barca says that it's the banks' fault, since they have to make the 222 million Euros (which PSG paid to get Neymar out of his contract with Barcelona) free to the Spanish club.\n\nAlso, Spain's top soccer league is in the middle of some drama. Angel Maria Villar, who has been in charge of La Liga since 1988, was suspended from the presidency for a year for his alleged involvement in a case of misappropriation of private and public funds. So, La Liga's without its president right now, which could explain why Neymar's transfer is caught up in some red tape. \"\"I don't need to tell you that the Spanish federation is having some problems at the moment,\" French soccer president Noel Le Graet told L'Equipe, per Fox News. \"The transfer is complete, so this should not last.\"\n\nWith or without Neymar, PSG shouldn't have a problem in dealing with Guingamp. While Les Parisiens didn't win the Ligue 1 championship at the end of the 2016-17 season - as they fell behind champs Monaco - they far surpassed EAG, who finished 10th. EAG did win their season opener with a resounding 3-1 victory over FC Metz. Can they pull off the upset and hand PSG a loss? Or will Neymar's paperwork arrive in time for him to start his Ligue 1 career?", "time": "16:26:00"}

Barcelona will start their first competitive match without Neymar by facing bitter rivals Real Madrid in the first leg of the Spanish Super Cup.\n\nPARIS: He has dazzled Rio's imposing Maracana and Barcelona's storied Camp Nou, but it's Guingamp's humble 17,000-capacity Stade du Rouduorou, tucked away in sleepy Brittany, which on Sunday greets Neymar, the world's most expensive footballer.\n\nWith the mundanity of transfer paperwork finally resolved, the 25-year-old Brazilian magician will line up for Paris Saint-Germain for the first time since his mind-boggling 222 million euro ($261 million) move from Barcelona.\n\n\"He's physically ready to play the whole ninety minutes,\" PSG coach Unai Emery told AFP.\n\n\"He's been working well and we looked hard at tactics and free-kicks. We all want him in the starting eleven, he's a player we need in the group.\"\n\nEven Guingamp coach Antoine Kombouar\u00e9, himself a former PSG boss, wants Neymar to play despite the potential for destruction at the feet of the Brazilian superstar.\n\n\"I want the fans to come Sunday to see Guingamp win... preferably against a side with Neymar in it.\n\n\"But the people here are not talking about Neymar. The people here support their team.\"\n\nIt will be a major culture shock for Neymar in a town which has a population of just 7,000 and is best known for its annual Breton dance showcase, the Saint Loup Festival which draws visitors from around the world.\n\nHowever, that's not to say that Guingamp do not have football pedigree.\n\nThey were French Cup winners in 2009 and 2014 and last season beat PSG 2-1 in the corresponding league fixture, the capital city club's second defeat in four visits to Guingamp since their hosts were promoted in 2013.\n\nFurthermore, former Chelsea and Ivory Coast star Didier Drogba spent a season at the club in 2002/2003.\n\n\"We could have filled a stadium of 40,000 seats with no problem at all,\" said Guingamp president Bertrand Desplat whose club budget is an eighth of what PSG paid for Neymar.\n\n\"Remember the star of the show is going to be Neymar and for us we want to welcome this very special player and his team in the best conditions possible.\"\n\nJournalists from far and wide are expected for the game -- the ground's press tribune, built to hold 80 people, has been extended to cater for 350.\n\nA total of 145 stewards will be on duty at the ground -- 30 more than usual.\n\n1,200km away, Barca start new era\n\nMeanwhile, French media speculated over who in the expensively-assembled PSG team will make way for Neymar.\n\nLe Parisien suggested it will be Javier Pastore, the Argentine star who was the first major signing after PSG were bought by their ambitious Qatari owners.\n\n\"After first giving up his No.10 shirt, will he (Pastore) now give him (Neymar) his place in the team?\" Le Parisien asked of the player who took up the No.10 shirt after Zlatan Ibrahimovic left for Manchester United last season, only to hand it to the Brazilian this summer.\n\n\"Neymar will start on the left at the cost of Pastore.\"\n\nSports daily L'Equipe saw things differently, though.\n\n\"Neymar -- the football version,\" ran their headline on Saturday in a light-hearted reference to how the most expensive transfer in football history has dominated news despite Neymar not yet having kicked a ball in anger.\n\n\"A trio of Neymar, Pastore and Angel di Maria will support (striker) Ederson Cavani,\" predicted L'Equipe.\n\nThe match in Guingamp kicks-off at 1900GMT.\n\nAn hour later, and around 1,200km further south, Barcelona will start their first competitive match without Neymar by facing bitter rivals Real Madrid in the first leg of the Spanish Super Cup.\n\nBarca's scattergun approach to finding a replacement for Neymar has so far been unsuccessful with bids for Liverpool's Philippe Coutinho and Ousmane Dembele of Borussia Dortmund rebuffed.\n\nGerard Deulofeu was handed Neymar's role alongside Lionel Messi and Luis Suarez up front in Monday's 5-0 friendly win over Chapecoense on his return to the club after spells at Everton and AC Milan.\n\nAnd the Spanish international took his chance with a goal and two assists in just 45 minutes on the field.", "time": "04:30:00"}

He will be able to play on Sunday,\" said the LFP on Friday.\n\nThe world's most expensive player should, therefore, run out into the mundane surroundings of the Stade du Roduourou -- capacity just over 15,000 -- in the tiny Brittany town of barely 7,000 people.\n\n\"Quite honestly it's better if he's there, much better,\" said Guingamp coach Antoine Kombouare, a former PSG player and Paris coach from 2009 to 2011.\n\n\"For us it is an extra source of motivation. We know that by beating PSG with Neymar it would be even more momentous.\n\n\"If Neymar is there it is all the better for the spectacle, for the supporters and for those who want to see him play, but we will be ready with or without him.\"\n\nNeymar was unveiled to the PSG fans at the Parc des Princes last weekend but was forced to watch from the stands as his new team-mates cruised to a low-key 2-0 win over newly-promoted Amiens in their Ligue 1 opener.\n\nThe 25-year-old Brazilian scored 105 goals in his four seasons at Barcelona, and his new team will be expecting him to score far more over the next few years.\n\nAlthough the main goal for the capital club is to finally challenge for the Champions League crown, their first task this term will be to retake the Ligue 1 title from Monaco.\n\n- Better with Neymar -\n\nCoach Unai Emery has no doubt that his new arrival will help the team achieve those lofty goals.\n\n\"He's a player who will help the club get to a higher level,\" said the Spaniard.\n\n\"Without Neymar PSG is a great club, but with Neymar it's a little better.\n\n\"The way we will adapt being close to a player like him... The other players here are also some great players, so together we can get better and grow.\"\n\nOnce again, PSG's main rivals for domestic honours appear to be Monaco, but they are in serious danger of losing rising star Kylian Mbappe to the capital outfit.\n\nThe 18-year-old, who is also wanted by Real Madrid, started in their opening 3-2 victory over Toulouse last weekend, as captain Radamel Falcao found the net.\n\nLeonardo Jardim's principality outfit will be expecting to make it two wins from two when they pay a visit to Dijon on Sunday.\n\nNice, who have the first leg of their Champions League play-off against Napoli on Wednesday, kick off the second weekend at home to promoted Troyes on Friday without their two star players, the injured Mario Balotelli and new signing Wesley Sneijder.\n\nLyon's youthful side started with a 4-0 thumping of Strasbourg last week and travel out to Brittany to take on Rennes on Friday.\n\nMarseille visit Claudio Ranieri's Nantes on Saturday looking to build on their 3-0 win over Dijon last time out but with captain Dimitri Payet missing due to injury.\n\nNantes v Marseille (1500), Amiens v Angers (1800), Bordeaux v Metz (1800), Caen v Saint-Etienne (1800), Toulouse v Montpellier (1800)\n\nSunday\n\nStrasbourg v Lille (1300), Dijon v Monaco (1500), Guingamp v Paris Saint-Germain (1900)", "time": "13:36:00"}

\u00a3160million move to the Parc des Princes after wanting to create a \u00a3360m-strike partnership with Brazilian\n\nKYLIAN MBAPPE has decided to join Paris Saint-Germain as he wants to link up with Neymar, according to reports.\n\nPSG landed the French wonderkid for \u00a3160million with PSG's players told that the 18-year-old is set to be unveiled at the Parc des Princes as soon as Monday.\n\nAnd L'Equipe are reporting that Mbappe decided to snub Real Madrid for PSG because he wanted to form a super strike-force with \u00a3198m Neymar.\n\nPSG are now hoping their \u00a3360m front line can help them dominate Ligue 1 and the Champions League.\n\nSpanish giants Real were favourites to land Mbappe but his financial demands saw the Chmapions League winners walk away from a deal.\n\nMonaco had been insistent they wanted to hold on to the teenager despite the interest from Real.\n\nBut Mbappe's father convinced Monaco to let the youngster leave this summer instead of hanging on for another 12 months.\n\nThat gave PSG the green light to begin negotiations over a mega-deal for the striker, with agreement reached swiftly once they were happy to match Madrid's offer.\n\nPSG boss Unai Emery gave assurances that PSG would give Mbappe a starring role this season despite the purchase of Neymar.\n\nThe signing is another huge statement of intent by PSG after they landed Neymar from Barcelona in a deal that saw questions asked over Uefa's Financial Fair Play regime.\n\nKeep up to date with ALL the latest transfer news and speculation with our live transfer feed\n\nIf the answer is no you need to take a long, hard look at yourself.\n\nBecause the Dream Team game - the UK's biggest fantasy football game - is back and better than ever this season.\n\nYou've got a \u00a350m budget to pick 11 players, with all the biggest new signings ready and raring to go ahead of a mouthwatering new Premier League campaign.", "time": "08:12:00"}

if Monaco decide to sell Kylian Mbappe.\n\nSunSport revealed last month Lemar had already agreed a switch to the Emirates with a \u00a340million fee close to being sealed.\n\nMbappe,18, is reportedly keen to leave Monaco this summer with Barcelona, Real Madrid and Paris Saint-Germain fighting it out for his signature.\n\nThe teenager has become the most wanted player in world football this summer - and unlike Neymar there is a genuine market for his talents.\n\nPSG are reported to have agreed personal terms with teenage sensation valued at \u00a3160million, but will find it difficult to land him as Monaco are refusing to sell to domestic rivals.\n\nIf Mbappe quits the French champions - the club hierarchy will draw a line under the summer departures and the Stade Louis II exit door will be slammed shut.\n\nWenger could be forced to play a waiting game while the Mbappe saga is played out - and if he is sold the Gunners boss will have to move on to other targets.\n\nLeicester City winger Riyad Mahrez is an option, but the Foxes will only consider bids over \u00a345m for the Algerian star.\n\nBernardo Silva, Benjamain Mendy, Tiemoue Bakayoko and Valere Germain have all left the principality in recent months and a club trying to defend the title cannot afford to haemorrhage more top stars.\n\nLemar and Mbappe featured for the champions who kicked off the defence of the title with a 3-2 win over Toulouse on Sunday.\n\nIf the answer is no you need to take a long, hard look at yourself.\n\nBecause the Dream Team game - the UK's biggest fantasy football game - is back and better than ever this season.\n\nYou've got a \u00a350m budget to pick 11 players, with all the biggest new signings ready and raring to go ahead of a mouthwatering new Premier League campaign.\n\nSo what are you waiting for?

This, it probably goes without saying, isn't quite the reputation the small number of obscenely rich Qataris who run the country would like their dear nation to have. Thus they've fronted their top public-relations/soft power vessel -- the famed Paris Saint-Germain soccer club -- an ungodly amount of money to get everyone to forget that nasty slavery and terrorism business and associate Qatar with famous and beautiful soccer guys kicking balls into nets and winning trophies. And the record-shattering Neymar transfer was just the start.\n\nAfter spending \u20ac222 million for the right to pry Neymar away from the despairing clutches of Barcelona -- the irony should not be lost here that this is club that broke its high-minded, long time no-shirt-sponsor policy in exchange for Qatar's millions and finally lost their Brazilian jewel the first year in which the team changed sponsors -- and in the process doubling the previous transfer record, PSG are reportedly now preparing to make what would probably wind up the second-highest fee ever. The Parisian club is seriously pushing for the signature of Ligue 1 rivals Monaco's star, Kylian Mbapp\u00e9. If the 25-year-old Neymar is the closest thing the sport has to a \"Next Messi,\" meaning a generational talent the likes of which comprehensively surpasses all others, then the 18-year-old Mbapp\u00e9 is probably the best bet to be the singular star of the generation of players after Neymar's. He is unbelievably good already and had a coming out season so amazing that traditional superclubs like Real Madrid and Barcelona are hot for him. It's only natural that PSG would see this shiny new trinket and go for it.\n\nPSG have, according to reports, been after the French striker all summer. It seemed like the Neymar deal would put them out of the running, seeing as it was already unclear whether the club could even foot that bill without coming under Financial Fair Play punishment, but here we are. Le Parisien reports that PSG believe they can fund both the Neymar deal and the likely \u20ac180 million-plus Mbapp\u00e9 one by selling a few rotation players and renegotiating some sponsorship agreements in light of all their great new fame -- not, of course, that attached to the recent widespread acknowledgement that Qatar funds terrorism (and it will remain forever ironic that saying this clear truth in polite society didn't really become fashionable until shameless terrorism-supporters Saudi Arabia made it A Thing), but instead the fact that Qatar's pet team has the incredibly famous Neymar.\n\nAccording to one report, Mbapp\u00e9 and PSG have actually already agreed to personal terms. The more reputable Le Parisien won't go that far, but they do note both that Mbapp\u00e9 is definitely willing to hear PSG out and that PSG have a pricy backup plan in case Real Madrid or someone else beats them to Mbapp\u00e9. Yes, PSG have apparently listened to their new star's apparent wishes and intend to try for Liverpool's Phillipe Coutinho. It would be the perfect fuck you to Bar\u00e7a if PSG thrice thwarted their Catalan rivals' plans, first by batting away their attempts to sign Marco Verratti, then by snatching away Neymar, and finally by swooping in for Bar\u00e7a's top Neymar-replacement option.\n\nAll this money is almost nauseating to even think about, and that's exactly the point. Qatar, by way of PSG, want you to think of them as an entity so rich and powerful that nothing can prevent them from achieving what they most desire, that even the established powers-that-be must cower before their financial might, and that when their best-laid plans finally, inevitably come to fruition, the result is a product so dazzlingly and stupefyingly great that no one can help but bow down in awe of what they've created. After all, it's a bit harder to remember thousands of faceless poor people dying in deplorable working conditions when the resulting World Cup stadiums are just so damn cool looking, or to think of the thousands of innocent people murdered at the hands of terrorists backed by the Qatari government when the broad smiles and shining faces and stunning highlights of Neymar and Mbapp\u00e9 in their gorgeous PSG shirts are plastered on the TV all the time.", "time": "22:13:00"}

He will be able to play on Sunday,\" said the LFP on Friday.\n\nThe world's most expensive player should therefore run out into the mundane surroundings of the Stade du Roduourou -- capacity just over 15,000 -- in the tiny Brittany town of barely 7,000 people.\n\n\"Quite honestly it's better if he's there, much better,\" said Guingamp coach Antoine Kombouare, a former PSG player and Paris coach from 2009 to 2011.\n\n\"For us it is an extra source of motivation. We know that by beating PSG with Neymar it would be even more momentous.\n\n\"If Neymar is there it is all the better for the spectacle, for the supporters and for those who want to see him play, but we will be ready with or without him.\"\n\nNeymar was unveiled to the PSG fans at the Parc des Princes last weekend but was forced to watch from the stands as his new teammates cruised to a low-key 2-0 win over newly-promoted Amiens in their Ligue 1 opener.\n\nThe 25-year-old Brazilian scored 105 goals in his four seasons at Barcelona, and his new team will be expecting him to score far more over the next few years.\n\nAlthough the main goal for the capital club is to finally challenge for the Champions League crown, their first task this term will be to retake the Ligue 1 title from Monaco.\n\nCoach Unai Emery has no doubt that his new arrival will help the team achieve those lofty goals.\n\n\"He's a player who will help the club get to a higher level,\" said the Spaniard.\n\n\"Without Neymar PSG is a great club, but with Neymar it's a little better.\n\n\"The way we will adapt being close to a player like him ... The other players here are also some great players, so together we can get better and grow.\"\n\nOnce again, PSG's main rivals for domestic honours appear to be Monaco, but they are in serious danger of losing rising star Kylian Mbappe to the capital outfit.\n\nThe 18-year-old, who is also wanted by Real Madrid, started in their opening 3-2 victory over Toulouse last weekend, as captain Radamel Falcao found the net.\n\nLeonardo Jardim's principality outfit will be expecting to make it two wins from two when they pay a visit to Dijon on Sunday.\n\nNice, who have the first leg of their Champions League play-off against Napoli on Wednesday, kick off the second weekend at home to promoted Troyes on Friday without their two star players, the injured Mario Balotelli and new signing Wesley Sneijder.\n\nLyon's youthful side started with a 4-0 thumping of Strasbourg last week and travel out to Brittany to take on Rennes on Friday.\n\nMarseille visit Claudio Ranieri's Nantes on Saturday looking to build on their 3-0 win over Dijon last time out but with captain Dimitri Payet missing due to injury.\n\nLigue 1 fixtures (kick-offs 10pm UAE time unless stated)\n\nNantes v Marseille (7pm), Amiens v Angers, Bordeaux v Metz, Caen v Saint-Etienne, Toulouse v Montpellier.\n\nSunday\n\nStrasbourg v Lille 5pm, Dijon v Monaco 7pm, Guingamp v Paris Saint-Germain 11pm.", "time": "02:43:00"}

deal\n\nFirst it was nigh-on \u00a3200m for Neymar and now Paris Saint-Germain have clinched the signature of Kylian Mbappe for a cool \u00a3160m, claims The Sun.\n\nDescribing the double swoop as a \"blockbuster partnership\", the paper says that the French outfit have won the race to the Monaco magician and the 18-year-old \"is set to be unveiled as soon as Monday\".\n\nReal Madrid made most of the early running for Mbappe but, like a British athlete at the world championships, the Spanish outfit faded as the pressure increased, allowing PSG to steal in and make off with the gold.\n\nThe Sun says that the PSG players have been informed that Mbappe will introduced to them at the Parc des Princes at the start of next week having successfully completed negotiations with Monaco.\n\nThe French champions had wanted to hold on to Mbappe for another season but the Sun says his dad \"convinced Monaco to let the youngster leave this summer instead of hanging on for another 12 months\". The capture of the young frontman, which is also reported by the Spanish press, completes an extraordinary few weeks in the transfer market for PSG with their total outlay now standing at \u00a3372.5m having already signed Neymar, Spanish left-back Yuri Berchiche and Dani Alves.\n\nAs for Real, says the Sun, their failure to lure Mbappe to Madrid could have consequences for one English club with the European champions expected now to \"crank up their interest in Chelsea's Eden Hazard\".\n\nBlues boss Antonio Conte was forced to dismiss speculation earlier in the week that his Belgian playmaker could make the move to the Spanish capital but rumours continue to circulate at Stamford Bridge that Hazard would welcome the opportunity to move to Real.\n\nBut hold on one second. Apparently all is not what it seems, with French paper Le Parisien claiming that no deal is in place.

He will be able to play on Sunday,\" said the LFP on Friday.\n\nThe world's most expensive player should therefore run out into the mundane surroundings of the Stade du Roduourou -- capacity just over 15,000 -- in the tiny Brittany town of barely 7,000 people.\n\n\"Quite honestly it's better if he's there, much better,\" said Guingamp coach Antoine Kombouare, a former PSG player and Paris coach from 2009 to 2011.\n\n\"For us it is an extra source of motivation. We know that by beating PSG with Neymar it would be even more momentous.\n\n\"If Neymar is there it is all the better for the spectacle, for the supporters and for those who want to see him play, but we will be ready with or without him.\"\n\nNeymar was unveiled to the PSG fans at the Parc des Princes last weekend but was forced to watch from the stands as his new team-mates cruised to a low-key 2-0 win over newly-promoted Amiens in their Ligue 1 opener.\n\nThe 25-year-old Brazilian scored 105 goals in his four seasons at Barcelona, and his new team will be expecting him to score far more over the next few years.\n\nAlthough the main goal for the capital club is to finally challenge for the Champions League crown, their first task this term will be to retake the Ligue 1 title from Monaco.\n\n- Better with Neymar -\n\nCoach Unai Emery has no doubt that his new arrival will help the team achieve those lofty goals.\n\n\"He's a player who will help the club get to a higher level,\" said the Spaniard.\n\n\"Without Neymar PSG is a great club, but with Neymar it's a little better.\n\n\"The way we will adapt being close to a player like him... The other players here are also some great players, so together we can get better and grow.\"\n\nOnce again, PSG's main rivals for domestic honours appear to be Monaco, but they are in serious danger of losing rising star Kylian Mbappe to the capital outfit.\n\nThe 18-year-old, who is also wanted by Real Madrid, started in their opening 3-2 victory over Toulouse last weekend, as captain Radamel Falcao found the net.\n\nLeonardo Jardim's principality outfit will be expecting to make it two wins from two when they pay a visit to Dijon on Sunday.\n\nNice, who have the first leg of their Champions League play-off against Napoli on Wednesday, kick off the second weekend at home to promoted Troyes on Friday without their two star players, the injured Mario Balotelli and new signing Wesley Sneijder.\n\nLyon's youthful side started with a 4-0 thumping of Strasbourg last week and travel out to Brittany to take on Rennes on Friday.\n\nMarseille visit Claudio Ranieri's Nantes on Saturday looking to build on their 3-0 win over Dijon last time out but with captain Dimitri Payet missing due to injury.", "time": "12:32:00"}

But Monaco are standing firm on both Lemar and Mbappe.\n\nPSG are interested in Mbappe and could launch a bid of their own worth around \u20ac180million (\u00a3162million). There have been rumours that after their signing of Neymar for \u00a3198million last week Mbappe is now open to a move to PSG. Previously, it had been thought that Real Madrid would be his preferred destination.\n\nBut if Mbappe leaves then Lemar is unlikely to follow him out of the door and that could scupper Arsenal's bid to sign the France international.\n\nMonaco are still publicly insisting that neither Mbappe or Lemar will leave before the transfer window closes at the end of this month.\n\nArsenal winger Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain is the subject of a \u00a325million bid from Chelsea, according to reports today. But PSG's interest in Alexis Sanchez appears to be at an end.\n\nBoth players are out of contract at the end of next season, but whereas Sanchez's concern is money and honours, Oxlade-Chamberlain worries about how much time he is getting on the pitch.\n\nAccording to the Daily Mail, Chelsea have stepped up their interest over the past week and have lodged a bid with Arsenal. But Arsene Wenger has brushed aside that bid. He has no plans to sell the 23-year-old despite running the risk of losing him for nothing next summer.\n\nBut there are mixed rumours about PSG and their interest in Alexis Sanchez. Having signed one of their original three transfer targets of Neymar, Mbappe and Sanchez it is being claimed that they are no longer interested in Sanchez as well as Mbappe.\n\nHowever, other rumours suggest that the French club's interest in the Chile international is very much alive and that PSG are ready to bid \u00a380million.\n\nArsene Wenger insists that, like Oxlade-Chamberlain, Sanchez will be going nowhere this month.", "time": "07:26:00"}

We all want him in the starting 11, he's a player we need in the group.\"\n\nEven Guingamp coach Antoine Kombouare, himself a former PSG boss, wants Neymar to play despite the potential havoc he could wreak on the home defence.\n\n\"I want the fans to come on Sunday to see Guingamp win... preferably against a side with Neymar in it,\" he said.\n\nTake one! @NeymarJR named to PSG's roster for tomorrow's match vs. @EAGuingamp ! #NeymarJR10 pic.twitter.com/sd6npiiNld\n\n-- PSG English (@PSG_English) August 12, 2017\n\nIt will be a major culture shock for Neymar in a town which has a population of just 7,000 and is best known for its annual Breton dance showcase, the Saint Loup Festival.\n\nHowever, that's not to say that Guingamp do not have football pedigree -- former Chelsea and Ivory Coast star Didier Drogba spent a season at the club in 2002/2003.\n\nThey were French Cup winners in 2009 and 2014, and last season beat PSG 2-1 in the corresponding league fixture.\n\n\"We could have filled a stadium of 40,000 seats with no problem at all,\" said Guingamp president Bertrand Desplat, whose club budget is an eighth of what PSG paid for Neymar.\n\nJournalists from far and wide are expected for the game -- the ground's press tribune, built to hold 80 people, has been extended to cater for 350.\n\nA total of 145 stewards will be on duty at the ground -- 30 more than usual.\n\nNeymar will simply be glad to put his tax troubles behind him and get back to doing what he does best after his lawyer revealed on Saturday that the Brazilian superstar has agreed to pay a $2.5 million fine for tax evasion in his homeland.\n\nHis 2013 transfer to Barca from Sau Paulo's Santos is also the subject of a Spanish tax fraud investigation.", "time": "10:54:00"}

signing striker Mbappe, 18, with a five-year contract already agreed.\n\nAccording to Spanish sports daily Marca, Monaco have accepted PSG's offer of 180 million euros (\u00a3163m).\n\nBut ex-Monaco defender Abidal told BBC World Service Sport's World Football programme: \"It's not the time to move.\"\n\nThe retired former Barcelona player, 37, added: \"It's true that Mbappe has reached a high level really quickly, and he has had an amazing past six months, but now he has to confirm that level.\n\n\"He has to show he can be consistent, perform at a big competition like the World Cup with France, and then make his move.\n\n\"Right now, Monaco is the best club for him. There is not too much pressure. He is a quiet guy, only thinking of work. At a big club, there is pressure every day, and if you don't score, even in one game, it is hard.\"\n\nMbappe, one of the most coveted talents in football, has also been linked with moves to Real Madrid and Manchester City this summer.\n\nIn July, Monaco accused several \"top European clubs\" of making illegal approaches for the teenage forward.\n\nBBC Sport understands City were the only English club accused, although Fifa say they are yet to receive an official complaint.\n\nEarlier in August, PSG completed the \u00a3200m signing of 25-year-old Brazilian forward Neymar from Barcelona.\n\nUnai Emery's side have also brought in 27-year-old Spanish left-back Yuri Berchiche from Real Sociedad and right-back Dani Alves, 34, who joined on a free transfer after leaving Juventus.\n\nThe signing of Mbappe would take their total spend this summer to around \u00a3380m.\n\nPSG is backed by money from Gulf state Qatar and La Liga president Javier Tebas has accused the French club of \"financial doping\".\n\nBefore Neymar's transfer was complete, Barcelona said they would call on Uefa to investigate a possible breach of its Financial Fair Play rules (FFP), which are designed to stop clubs spending more than they earn.\n\nPSG were punished in 2014 for breach of FFP. Their \u00a3167m commercial contract with the Qatar Tourism Authority was deemed to have an unfair value by Uefa's independent investigation panel.\n\nThey were given a \u00a320m fine, their spending was capped to \u00a349m and they competed in the 2014-15 Champions League with just 21 players instead of the usual 25.", "time": "08:15:00"}

controversy-laden \u20ac222m signing of Neymar.\n\nAccording to PSG and Monaco sources, the Qatar-owned club do not intend to stop at creating a forward line of Mbappe, Neymar and Edison Cavani at a combined transfer fee cost of significantly more than \u20ac450m. They also have a deal in place to bring Fabinho from AS Monaco and are attempting to persuade Jan Oblak to join them from Atletico Madrid.\n\nAs The Daily Record reported last month, PSG were one of three clubs to offer Monaco a transfer fee of \u20ac180m for Mbappe, a record sum for a teenager and, following the Ligue 1 side's release-clause recruitment of Neymar, a figure that would be the second highest ever paid for a professional footballer. Real Madrid and Manchester City were also in competition for the striker's signature.\n\nPep Guardiola has led City's efforts to persuade Mbappe to join a club he helped knock out of last season's Champions League, meeting the 18-year-old in person to discuss the proposed move. Madrid's approach has been handicapped by concerns over making space for Mbappe in their Galactico-laden squad, leading the European champions to float a reluctant Gareth Bale on the transfer market.\n\nAll three clubs are willing to meet Mbappe's salary demands, which according to a source familiar with the negotiations, are for a basic salary of between \u20ac7 and \u20ac8m net.\n\nFollowing Madrid's 2-1 UEFA Super Cup victory over Manchester United on Tuesday, Madrid president Florentino Perez told reporters that he did not expect the club to make any acquisitions this month. \"I don't think there will be any more, we already have great players,\" Perez said. \"My and Zidane's idea after winning the Champions League was to do nothing and keep the team as it was.\"\n\nFabinho, who Monaco initially priced at \u20ac45m, was included on the summer recruitment lists of both Guardiola and Jose Mourinho. City were involved in advanced negotiations for a player who can operate both in midfield and as a full back, then stepped away from a deal earlier this summer. United elected to reinforce their midfield with Nemanja Matic from Chelsea, a player with extensive experience of English football and Mourinho's methods.\n\nOblak, 24, is considered one the best goalkeepers in Europe and has been Atletico's No.1 since March 2015. PSG attempted to sign the Slovenia international last summer; his current contract runs until 2021 and includes a \u20ac100m buy-out clause. It is understood the player has reservations about leaving Atletico in the current window as a FIFA transfer ban prevents the club from signing a replacement until January.\n\npoll loading Would PSG boast the world's best attacking line-up? 0+ VOTES SO FAR Yes No Debatable", "time": "16:36:00"}

How many fans would Neymar have played in front of with Barcelona when they are away at Alaves, Eibar, Getafe, Girona & Leganes? https://t.co/DE4fslrpqw - Jonathan Johnson (@Jon_LeGossip)\n\nAugust 11, 2017\n\nThere has been a lot of that this week. Like it means anything.\n\nWhen Barca travel to tiny Eibar's 7,083-capacity Ipurua Municipal Stadium next February, Neymar and his new Paris Saint-Germain side will host recently promoted Strasbourg at Parc des Princes in front of what will probably be close to a 47,929-strong crowd. So?\n\nAlaves, Getafe, Girona and Leganes also play at venues smaller than the Stade de Roudourou -- where Neymar will make his PSG debut on Sunday.\n\nDear @SkyKaveh,\n\n7000 people in the town but better atmosphere than 99000 in Camp Nou. Come @neymarjr !#NeymarAuVillage pic.twitter.com/UuVkopyPW0 - Pierre Henry-Dufeil (@PierreHD)\n\nAugust 7, 2017\n\nLike any major European league, there are big fixtures and smaller ones, and it is simply the luck of the draw when the big teams visit the little ones and vice versa.\n\n\"Ligue 1 is full of farmers.\"\n\nThere have been many of those sorts of comments too since Neymar showed the audacity to leave Barca for PSG in a world-record \u20ac222 million deal.\n\nWrong.\n\nThere are a number of other top sides in Le Championnat, and not just the obvious ones such as Monaco, Nice, Lyon and Marseille.\n\nThe likes of Bordeaux and Saint-Etienne are also capable of competing against the best in France's top flight, so the idea that Neymar has moved to a league completely lacking in quality is a complete non-starter.\n\nIt is ironic, though, that the Brazilian superstar should make his debut this weekend against a team that is reveling in its agricultural image and in many ways fits the lazy, stereotypical image those unfamiliar with Ligue 1 have of the competition.\n\nDespite the fact that they have continually defied the odds to be competing in their fifth consecutive season in Le Championnat, have won the Coupe de France twice -- once while in Ligue 2 -- and represent a commune with a population of just over 7,000, modest En Avant de Guingamp, half-jokingly, actually pride themselves on their image as a farmers club.\n\n#NeymarAuVillage (\"Neymar to the village\") has been trending on Twitter this week ahead of PSG and Neymar's visit to the department of Cotes-d'Armor -- yes, the Internet and Twitter exist in such a sleepy place -- and the club have also been joking about their country bumpkin image, not to mention their love of tractors and menial work.\n\nOn paper, Unai Emery's men should walk all over Antoine Kombouare's hosts. However, the reality is that things are never that straightforward for Les Parisiens or any other Ligue 1 sides when they travel to Brittany to face Les Guingampais.\n\nThe Spanish tactician knows this well. He watched his team lose 2-1 there last December and only a 5-0 thrashing of Lorient at Parc des Princes to end 2016 was enough to prevent the Basque from being sacked for the humiliation of going down to Guingamp.\n\nThat was not the first time that the Bretons had humiliated their illustrious capital city visitors either. Back in December of 2014, and with the mighty Zlatan Ibrahimovic in the starting XI, then-coach Jocelyn Gourvennec engineered another memorable result just days after PSG had been beaten 3-1 by Barcelona at Camp Nou in the UEFA Champions League group stages.\n\nGuingamp is a tough away day in Ligue 1, and although everybody enjoys the spectacle created by the passionate supporters at their intimate venue, nobody relishes playing in that sort of intimidating environment on a tight pitch that is often far from in pristine condition.\n\nOn top of all of this, the hosts have already sold enough tickets for the encounter to set a record attendance at the Roudourou.\n\nIt is as close to an English Premier League road match against the likes of Bournemouth, Burnley or Swansea as you will get in Le Championnat, and it is likely to show Neymar the sort of football and atmosphere that he will have rarely experienced in Spain and might have thought did not exist in France.\n\nAs Emery put it in his pre-match news conference at Camp des Loges on Friday, Guingamp will be \"up for it.\"\n\n\"We respect all of our opponents a lot,\" the 45-year-old told journalists. \"Guingamp enjoyed a great season last time campaign, they have won their first match this term and their stadium will be packed for our visit.\n\n\"All of our opponents are highly motivated each time they play us -- they want to push us around and cause an upset. We must prepare thoroughly for this match. We know that it will be difficult -- we lost there last season -- but we need to get a result, so we will go for the win.\n\n\"The players all know that it will be complicated and that there will be an intimidating atmosphere. Everyone has warned the new recruits that this sort of game will not be easy.\n\n\"I think that Guingamp absolutely want to see Neymar play. It would be great for everyone, notably their fans at the ground.\"\n\nIt promises to be quite the debut for Neymar. The Brazil international will get little time on the ball and will almost certainly be on the receiving end of some hefty challenges from some of the French top flight's most physical players.\n\nOn top of that, Kombouare -- a PSG legend and former coach -- has a good record against the club and will have his troops motivated to get in the visitors' faces.\n\nGuingamp's former PSG youth academy graduate Jordan Ikoko summed up the occasion of Neymar's debut quite well when speaking with L'Equipe earlier in the week.\n\n\"This is the first time in my career that I will come up against a genuinely world-class player,\" he said, despite having faced the likes of former teammates Edinson Cavani and Marco Verratti, as well as Angel Di Maria, before. \"Like everybody at Guingamp, I will be disappointed if he is not there.\n\n\"I will not concoct an anti-Neymar plan. It does not exist! The whole team must be at its best,\" Ikoko said. \"There is Neymar, but there are also 10 other players. I am a defender, I will not drop my head if he nutmegs me. It is Neymar, you have to expect that from him.\"\n\nGuingamp know to expect the unexpected from Neymar, but can the same be said of the 25-year-old towards his maiden Ligue 1 opponents?\n\nThe man from Mogi das Cruzes is about to get his first taste of the non-Champions League part of the challenge that he has taken on by moving to PSG from Barca, and it promises to be fascinating for all involved.\n\nJonathan Johnson covers PSG and the French national team for ESPN FC.

last season.\n\nAccording to The Sun, the Qatari-backed French side who have won the race, with PSG's players told that the 18-year-old is set to be unveiled at the Parc des Princes as soon as Monday.\n\nAnd the mega \u00a3360m double swoop is set to turn Ligue 1 into a one-team procession while PSG aim to slay the best in Europe.\n\nHowever, Monaco had been insistent they wanted to hold on to the teenager despite the interest from Real.\n\nBut Mbappe's father convinced Monaco to let the youngster leave this summer instead of hanging on for another 12 months.\n\nThat gave PSG the green light to begin negotiations over a mega-deal for the striker, with agreement reached swiftly once they were happy to match Madrid's offer.\n\nThe signing is another huge statement of intent by PSG after they landed Neymar from Barcelona in a deal that saw questions asked over Uefa's Financial Fair Play regime.\n\nIn total, PSG have spent a eye-watering \u00a3372.5m this summer, with Spanish

as soon as Monday\n\nPARIS SAINT-GERMAIN have followed up their world-record capture of Neymar by landing French sensation Kylian Mbappe for a staggering \u00a3160million.\n\nReal Madrid had been favourites to land the Monaco starlet after he burst on to the scene last season.\n\nBut it is the Qatari-backed French side who have won the race, with PSG's players told that the 18-year-old is set to be unveiled at the Parc des Princes as soon as Monday.\n\nNOT PICKED YOUR FANTASY FOOTBALL TEAM YET? WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR?\n\nAnd the mega \u00a3360m double swoop is set to turn Ligue 1 into a one-team procession while PSG aim to slay the best in Europe.\n\nMonaco had been insistent they wanted to hold on to the teenager despite the interest from Real.\n\nBut Mbappe's father convinced Monaco to let the youngster leave this summer instead of hanging on for another 12 months.\n\nThat gave PSG the green light to begin negotiations over a mega-deal for the striker, with agreement reached swiftly once they were happy to match Madrid's offer.\n\nMbappe was convinced after a meeting with PSG boss Unai Emery that he would play a huge role in the starting side this season -- despite the \u00a3198m spent to lure Neymar from the Nou Camp.\n\nThe signing is another huge statement of intent by PSG after they landed Neymar from Barcelona in a deal that saw questions asked over Uefa's Financial Fair Play regime.\n\nIn total, PSG have spent a eye-watering \u00a3372.5m this summer, with Spanish left-back Yuri Berchiche (\u00a314.5m) and Brazilian right-back Dani Alves (free) also arriving in the French capital.\n\nUefa introduced break-even FFP rules in 2013 to stop clubs accumulating too much debt and to prevent wealthy owners from injecting too much cash into their clubs.\n\nThe rules state that over a three-year period a club like PSG, owned by the Gulf state of Qatar, can spend 30m euros more than it earns.\n\nPSG could also offload players to balance the books.\n\nFor Real, losing out on \u00a3200,000-a-week Mbappe is a hammer blow and could see them crank up their interest in Chelsea's Eden Hazard.\n\nMeanwhile, Real's rivals Barcelona also suffered a setback in the market after Borussia Dortmund rejected a bid, understood to be worth \u00a390m, for Ousmane Dembele.\n\nBut the wantaway France striker, 20, has been suspended by the German giants until next week after missing training.\n\nDortmund coach Peter Bosz said: \"We don't know why. We tried to reach him but we were unable to.\"\n\nThe Bundesliga outfit claim a possible Nou Camp move for Dembele, lined up as a replacement for Neymar, is unlikely because the offer did not reflect his \"extraordinary\" value in the current state of the transfer market.\n\nA club statement read: \"As there is no other offer on the table, a transfer by the player to FC Barcelona is not at this time expected, nor currently very likely.\"\n\nIt is thought Dortmund are holding out for \u00a3140m for their rising star but Barca are not willing to match that fee.\n\nIf the answer is no you need to take a long, hard look at yourself.\n\nBecause the Dream Team game - the UK's biggest fantasy football game - is back and better than ever this season.\n\nYou've got a \u00a350m budget to pick 11 players, with all the biggest new signings ready and raring to go ahead of a mouthwatering new Premier League campaign.", "time": "21:36:00"}

but Mbappe is understood to be tempted by the prospect of becoming part of Guardiola's City revolution.\n\nThe 18-year-old has been made aware of City's interest and is determined to leave Monaco after watching last season's French champions dismantled by the sale of a host of key players.\n\nHe could reunite with two of those - Bernardo Silva and Benjamin Mendy - if he completes a move to the Eithad.\n\nGuardiola has targeted Mbappe since first taking over at the Etihad 12 months ago - and has stepped up his pursuit as part of a dramatic overhaul of his squad this summer.\n\nWhile City sources claim Monaco's valuation is too high, they have refused to pull out of the running - maintaining hope a deal will be struck.\n\nMonaco are adamant they will not accept less than their asking price - but City's chances have been boosted by the French side's reluctance to sell to domestic rivals PSG.\n\nThat could yet see a compromise reached over Mbappe's valuation.\n\nCity have long-believed Real are favourites to sign the teenager - but he is said to doubt his chances of regular first team football if he has to compete with Cristiano Ronaldo, Gareth Bale and Karim Benzema at the Bernabeu.\n\nHe knows he will get more opportunities under Guardiola, despite City boasting a forward line that already includes Gabriel Jesus and Sergio Aguero.\n\nBut PSG have already proved their spending power by signing Neymar for \u00a3200m - and sources in France believe they lead the race, despite Monaco's preference to sell abroad.\n\nCompetition remains fierce and all interested parties believe they can land the most sought-after teenager in Europe.\n\nIt has become clear that Real would need to sell Bale to convince Mbappe that he will be a key part of Zinedine Zidane's plans - and they have buyers ready and waiting in Manchester United.\n\nMeanwhile, Barcelona have only just emerged as serious contenders, but have left their move late.\n\nCity's refusal to drop out of the running is a measure of their own determination to pull off a British record deal that would dwarf the \u00a389m United paid for Paul Pogba last summer.\n\nAnd they are growing increasingly encouraged that Mbappe could see his future at the Etihad.", "time": "19:44:00"}

focus switched from his record transfer fee to the question of which star would make way for the Brazilian.\n\nLe Parisien daily newspaper suggested it would be Javier Pastore, the silky but fragile Argentine who was the first major signing after PSG were bought by their ambitious Qatari owners, who splashed out a world record \u20ac222 million ($ 261 million) for Neymar.\n\n\"After first giving up his No.10 shirt, will he (Pastore) now give him (Neymar) his place in the team?\" one Le Parisien headline asked of the player who took up the No.10 shirt after Zlatan Ibrahimovic left last season, only to hand it to the Brazilian this season.\n\n\"Neymar will start on the left at the cost of Pastore,\" the article claimed.\n\n\"So it'll be Neymar, (Edinson) Cavani and without doubt (Angel) di Maria in a three pronged attack,\" said Le Parisien, which then gave a long list of top signings who will be warming the PSG bench.\n\nAlongside Pastore will be the Brazilian Lucas Moura, who is rumoured to be staying as he has been friends with Neymar since the age of nine, and Germany captain at the Confederations Cup Julian Draxler, who arrived just last year in a big money transfer of his own.\n\nSports daily L'Equipe saw things differently, though.\n\n\"Neymar -- the football version,\" ran their headline in a joke about how the most expensive transfer in football history has dominated news without the 25-year-old forward even kicking a ball yet.\n\n\"A trio of Neymar, Pastore and di Maria will support Cavani,\" they predicted, but were unsure where the extra man would be cut.\n\nThe only sure thing is that Neymar will start.\n\n\"He's been working well and we looked hard at tactics and free-kicks,\" said the Spaniard.\n\n\"We all want him in the starting eleven, he's a player we need in the group.\"\n\nGuingamp coach Antoine Kombouarhimself a former PSG manager, also wants Neymar to play.\n\n\"I want the fans to come Sunday to see Guingamp win... preferably against a side with Neymar in it.\n\n\"But the people here are not talking about Neymar,\" he claimed. \"The people here support their team.\"\n\nIn the tiny Brittany town of Guingamp, with a population of around 7,000, tickets for the match have been changing hands for a king's ransom as the Stade du Rouduorou has a capacity of just over 17,000.\n\n\"We could have filled a stadium of 40,000 seats with no problem at all,\" Guingamp president Bertrand Desplat told local newspaper Le Telegramme.\n\n\"Remember the star of the show is going to be Neymar and for us we want to welcome this very special player and his team in the best conditions possible,\" he said.\n\nJournalists however may find themselves a bit squeezed for space as the rustic press tribune allowing for 80 press seats has been extended to a blockbuster 350.", "time": "17:29:00"}

Photo: Kamil Zihnioglu, AP\n\nPARIS - Neymar will watch from the stands as Paris Saint-Germain open their season Saturday, but the French club have already clawed back around a million euros on their world record investment thanks to selling a staggering 10 000 shirts bearing the Brazilian's name in just one day.\n\nThe 25-year-old superstar, signed from Barcelona for a mind-boggling \u20ac222 million (about R3.53 billion), will be presented to the PSG support prior to his new team's first game of the Ligue 1 campaign against promoted Amiens.\n\nA ceremony will begin at 3.45pm French time, with the kickoff put back quarter of an hour to 5.15pm to allow extra time for the player's unveiling before an expected sell-out crowd of more than 45 000 at the Parc des Princes.\n\nHowever, Neymar's hopes of playing in the match were dashed when his international transfer certificate failed to be lodged with the French league by the midnight deadline on Friday.\n\n\"I am ready to start on Saturday if I can,\" he said before falling victim to the constraints of paperwork.\n\nThe @neymarjr era at PSG has begun!! \u1f534\u1f535#BemvindoNeymarJr \u1f1e7\u1f1f7 pic.twitter.com/nMpKWKckHc\n\n-- PSG English (@PSG_English) August 4, 2017\n\nDespite the minor setback, Neymar has already started repaying his mammoth transfer fee.\n\nPSG said that more than 10 000 shirts bearing his name and his new number No 10 were sold on Friday.\n\nAt an average of \u20ac100 each, PSG generated \u20ac1 million even before he had kicked a ball.\n\nMoney was the subject of most of the questions fired at the Brazilian when he was unveiled to the media on Friday after arriving in the French capital on a private jet.\n\nHowever, Neymar, who is poised to earn around \u20ac30m a year, insisted financial gain was not a factor.\n\n\"I want something bigger, a greater challenge. I am here to give my best and help the club win titles,\" said Neymar, who signed a five-year contract with the Qatar-owned club.\n\n\u1f4fd @NeymarJR's first interview in Paris \u1f534\u1f535\n\n\u1f1e7\u1f1f7 #BemvindoNeymarJR pic.twitter.com/ZqBDx8kVeb\n\n-- PSG English (@PSG_English) August 4, 2017\n\nHe insisted he had come to France \"for the ambition of the club, which is very similar to mine.\"\n\nNeymar admitted that leaving Barcelona, where he formed part of a lethal attacking trio with Lionel Messi and Luis Suarez, was not a decision he took lightly.\n\n\"It was one of my most difficult decisions. In Barcelona, I had adapted well to the city and the team. I had friends there and it has not been easy,\" he said.\n\n\"It was a tense time, thinking about what I should do in my life.

WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR?\n\nAnd it has also ended once and for all the charade of Uefa's FFP regulations.\n\nPSG have muscled their way into becoming the biggest clubs on the planet in the space of a fortnight.\n\nWhile the likes of Real Madrid, Barcelona and Manchester United have built their status on the back of years of success on the field, PSG have reached that level with two bank transfer payments.\n\nAny club who can sign one of the biggest superstars in world football, and follow it up with the capture of the best young talent in the game, are punching at a seriously high level.\n\nTraditionalists may not be happy, and nor will some of the other big clubs in Europe who are desperate to protect their own status, but a team who has never won the European Cup is now dictating the future of football.\n\nWhen Uefa introduced their FFP rules there was always a scepticism over their motives - and whether they could ever really enforce them.\n\nThe traditional big clubs around Europe were happy because on paper FFP helped protect them and prevent upstarts from gatecrashing the party.\n\nOthers thought they didn't do enough to provide the framework to stop clubs operating beyond their means.\n\nThere have been suspicions in the past some clubs have bent the rules in order to sign a player or two - but PSG have essentially blown the whole system out of the water.\n\nThe \u00a3198m Neymar release clause is not going through their books, instead it has been met by the Qatari investment fund who own the club as a private commercial sponsorship deal.\n\nQuite where the \u00a3160m to sign Mbappe is coming from is anyone's guess - but the reality is PSG are benefiting from the arrival of two players worth \u00a3358m when they simply do not have the revenue streams to comply with FFP.\n\nGiven these deals won't have to be presented until the 2018/19 accounts, they have the freedom conjure up ways to present their books to Uefa in a way that meets the regulations.\n\nAnd if they do fall foul of them, what is the punishment? A hefty fine which will mean absolutely nothing.\n\nA transfer embargo would also do little damage, because by that point PSG would have amassed a squad so strong they wouldn't have to worry.\n\nBut those potential sanctions are all in the future in any case. In the meantime, PSG can go on their merry way doing whatever they want and to hell with the consequences.\n\nFFP is dead in the water.\n\nBut what else does this mad summer mean for the future of football?\n\nBy virtue of winning the European Cup for the past two seasons, Real Madrid have to be considered favourites to make it a hat-trick this season.\n\nBut PSG have now assembled a side that has to be feared across the continent and are serious contenders to win the competition for the first time\n\nNeymar and Mbappe make up a fearsome attacking unit when you combine them with Edinson Cavani.\n\nBut it is not just that trio of top class talents in their squad - Julian Draxler, Lucas Moura, Marco Verratti, Javier Pastore, Thiago Motta and Thiaga Silva. The list just goes on and on.\n\nIt is a squad of astonishing depth and quality and puts them right up there as one of the two sides to beat in the Champions League this season.\n\nMore worrying perhaps is that the business the club have done could ultimately threaten the financial viability of other clubs across Europe.\n\nPSG haven't just assembled a squad the envy of world football, they have changed the face of the game forever.\n\nIt is all well and good being bankrolled by an oil-rich country, but there are few clubs who can dip into that kind of resource and survive.\n\nThe problem is, the Neymar and Mbappe deals set a new benchmark in transfers - both in terms of the size of fee and the market rate for salaries.\n\nThe effect will be an inflation in player and agent demands that will see clubs across Europe having to stretch beyond their means to make a signing in order to keep up with the rest.\n\nNot just at the highest level with the elite clubs, but the drip down will filter through to the domestic leagues and below as the going rate and demands get ever bigger.\n\nClubs are going to be saddled with crippling debts and wage bills over the coming few years at levels few can imagine.\n\nThere are some who say football is already morally bankrupt. Financially, it could well be in the next five years.\n\nHaving not even won the French League last season, it may seem a ridiculous notion but PSG risk killing the long-term future of their domestic competition.\n\nMonaco were brilliant as they won the title last season, but the harsh realities of the modern game mean that squad has been torn apart as Europe's elite picked off their best talent.\n\nSo the Monaco side that has started the defence of their crown is not anything like the team of champions that went before.\n\nPSG, on the other hand, have riches in talent beyond the wildest dreams of their rivals in Ligue 1 and as they continue to strengthen, so their dominance over their home rivals is in danger of growing.\n\nIt is in danger of becoming a one-club league, with others so far behind and lacking the financial muscle to do anything about it.\n\nLack of competition means lack of interest, from supporters going through the turnstiles to corporate sponsors and television companies making lucrative deals.\n\nThe struggles of the Scottish game is an example the French League will be desperate to avoid - but they might not be able to do anything to prevent it.\n\nKeep up to date with ALL the latest transfer news and speculation with our live transfer feed\n\nIf the answer is no you need to take a long, hard look at yourself.\n\nBecause the Dream Team game - the UK's biggest fantasy football game - is back and better than ever this season.\n\nYou've got a \u00a350m budget to pick 11 players, with all the biggest new signings ready and raring to go ahead of a mouthwatering new Premier League campaign.", "time": "10:04:00"}

the hysteria mounts ahead of Neymar's Paris Saint-Germain (PSG) debut on Sunday focus switched from his record transfer fee to the question of which star would make way for the Brazilian.\n\nLe Parisien daily newspaper suggested it would be Javier Pastore, the silky but fragile Argentine who was the first major signing after PSG were bought by their ambitious Qatari owners, who splashed out a world record \u20ac222 million ($262 million) for Neymar.\n\n\"After first giving up his No.10 shirt, will he (Pastore) now give him (Neymar) his place in the team,\" one Le Parisien headline asked of the player who took up the No.10 shirt after Zlatan Ibrahimovic left last season, only to hand it to the Brazilian this season.\n\n\"Neymar will start on the left at the cost of Pastore,\" the article claimed.\n\n\"So it'll be Neymar, (Edinson) Cavani and without doubt (Angel) di Maria in a three pronged attack,\" said Le Parisien, which then gave a long list of top signings who will be warming the PSG bench.\n\nAlongside Pastore will be the Brazilian Lucas Moura, who is rumored to be staying as he has been friends with Neymar since the age of nine, and Germany captain at the Confederations Cup Julian Draxler, who arrived just last year in a big money transfer of his own.\n\nSports daily L'Equipe saw things differently, though.\n\n\"Neymar -- the football version,\" ran their headline in a joke about how the most expensive transfer in football history has dominated news without the 25-year-old forward even kicking a ball yet.\n\n\"A trio of Neymar, Pastore and di Maria will support Cavani,\" they predicted, but were unsure where the extra man would be cut.\n\nIn the tiny Brittany town of Guingamp, with a population of around 7,000, tickets for the match have been changing hands for a king's ransom as the Stade du Roduourou has a capacity of just over 15,000.\n\n\"We could have filled a stadium of 40,000 seats with no problem at all,\" Guingamp President Bertrand Desplat told local newspaper Le Telegramme.\n\n\"Remember the star of the show is going to be Neymar and for us we want to welcome this very special player and his team in the best conditions possible,\" he said.\n\nJournalists however may find themselves a bit squeezed for space as the rustic press tribune allowing for 80 press seats has been extended to a blockbuster 350.\n\nMeanwhile, sources said Neymar is willing to pay a fine of $2.5 million to settle tax evasion allegations in Brazil.", "time": "20:48:00"}

He's left behind one of the most famous sporting institutions in the world for a club that is younger than Jennifer Aniston, and is expected to pocket in excess of \u00a3500,000, after tax, each and every week in France.\n\nBut to accuse the Brazilian superstar of simply quitting Camp Nou for a huge pay day is the lazy criticism, and more than a little unfair.\n\nNeymar answered those critics in his own words on Friday: \"What I say to these people is they don't know anything about my personal life, I was never motivated by money.\n\n\"If I was following the money, I would be somewhere else, with other clubs in other countries. I'm really sad that people still think that way and I'm glad that PSG believe in me.\"\n\nA major theme of the 2013 autobiography Neymar co-wrote with his father centred on money not being a driving factor in his career. Together, they both explained how football was always the most important thing and that had money been a motivating factor the emerging player could have left Santos on several occasions in a lucrative deal before he eventually joined Bar\u00e7a at the age of 21.\n\nAs difficult as it is to push the money angle to one side, fans and critics must do so because Neymar was absolutely right to leave Barcelona for PSG for footballing reasons.\n\nThe message that Lionel Messi's recently signed new long-term contract effectively gave to Neymar was, 'This is still out guy for the next four year, not you'.\n\nMessi was apparently given terms that Neymar was told a year previously were impossible. That doesn't mean it's about the money itself, but rather parity and validation. How is Neymar supposed to feel when he is constantly told he'll soon be the best player in the world, but his club won't treat him as an equal to the star they expect him to match?\n\nIt has nothing to do with the personal relationship between the pair either. But Neymar, with ambition to be the greatest footballer on the planet, would have looked at the situation and seen Messi backed to remain number one at Camp Nou until 2021, by which time the Brazilian would be 29 and have potentially missed his best years still stuck in the shadows of a club hero.\n\nLeaving is not the easy option, staying and continuing to stay in those shadows would have been the far safer choice. He had a very good contract anyway, was still very highly thought of regardless of Messi being in front, and could easily have collected many more trophies.\n\nBut what Neymar has done by accepting the call from PSG is risk everything. He has backed himself and staked his whole reputation on proving that he can actually be the main man at the highest level, the world-leading superstar that his potential always suggested he would be.\n\nHe won't get plaudits for helping PSG to French titles or domestic cups, those were the minimum requirement at Parc des Princes for six years before Neymar arrived. Instead, the dream is the Champions League, to become only the second French club to be crowned European champions.\n\nPSG's only appearance in the old European Cup ended in a first round exit in 1986, while they have never been beyond the semi-finals in the Champions League. In fact, their only appearance in the last four actually came as far back as 1995, long before the current regime of Qatar-backed wealth.\n\nNeymar is presented with the challenge of creating history where there isn't much.

It will be a physical encounter but their team also possesses some quality. It will be a good test for us and for Neymar -- if he plays. It is difficult to win away from home in Spain, just like it is here.\"\n\nEmery has been getting to know Neymar over the course of the week and is convinced PSG's new No. 10 is ready for his maiden appearance.\n\n\"He has done well in training, where we have worked tactically and technically,\" he said. \"He is ready. He can be a part of the squad and he can play.\n\n\"We want him on the pitch because he is somebody we need. We are going to train on Saturday and then the staff will discuss the possibility [of him starting in Guingamp]. He is ready to start and in good physical condition to complete a full 90 minutes.\"\n\nEmery has already told Neymar what is expected of him and the PSG boss feels his new forward has already adapted well.\n\n\"He works hard and, like the others, he has his own habits while training and during lunch,\" Emery said. \"I have spoken with him in the same way that I have with the other players, about how we are going to play and how we work.\"\n\nSpeaking with PSG's official website, midfielder Adrien Rabiot said that Neymar signing for the club is a big deal but that he and his teammates have remained focused throughout the furore that surrounded the most expensive transfer ever.\n\n\"It is true that Neymar's arrival has caused quite a fuss,\" Rabiot said. \"People are happy and it has brought quite a lot of them together. All the fans rushed out to buy his shirt.\n\n\"It was a really big deal for the media but among us players, we were focused on the opening match against Amiens. We wanted to start with a good result at home.\n\n\"We are happy to have him, though, because he is a great player. He is going to be a plus for the team and will help us in our goals -- he will settle in easily thanks to the other Brazilian players and he is young, so we are interested in the same things, I have no doubt.\"\n\nA source has told ESPN FC that Monaco forward Kylian Mbappe is keen on a move to Parc des Princes to link up with Neymar but that no agreement has been reached yet.\n\nQuestioned on PSG's interest in the 18-year-old, Emery was evasive and more reserved on the topic than he was earlier this summer when he admitted his interest in him.\n\n\"I am only talking about players who are here,\" Emery said. \"I do not know what is going to happen over the next few days but he is a Monaco player right now.\"\n\nEmery also fielded a question on midfielder Marco Verratti and how he has digested Barcelona's failed move for his services this summer.\n\n\"I feel like he is fine,\" Emery said. \"He was injured in Miami. He played in the Trophee des Champions against Monaco but was not 100 percent physically. He is getting better little by little.\n\n\"When he gets back to his best physically, he will be able to show all of his qualities. I am relaxed and he is too. He is an important player. In his mind, he decided to stay here. He is very happy in Paris and he still wants to develop as a part of this team.\"\n\nEmery also revealed that Lucas Moura is currently struggling with injury, while Jese Rodriguez is missing for personal reasons -- both are unlikely to be included in the squad for the trip to Guingamp.\n\nJonathan Johnson covers PSG and the French national team for ESPN FC.

Apart from playing for PSG, the four are all Brazilians which is what Neymar pointed out in his caption. \"Brazukas in the House. AllezParis,\" said Neymar in his caption.\n\nNeymar and Alves have played together at Barcelona for three seasons before the latter moved to Juventus. He played with the Italian champions for a year before moving to PSG. While Alves moved between the three clubs on free transfers, Neymar has been the subject of a record 222 million Euro deal that saw him move from Barcelona to Paris St Germain. It is more than twice of the amount paid by Manchester United to bring back Paul Pogba from Juventus and thus makes Neymar the most expensive player in the world by some distance.\n\nBrazukas in the House \u1f919\u1f3fd\u270c\u1f3fd \u1f1e7\u1f1f7 AllezParis\n\nA post shared by Nj \u1f1e7\u1f1f7 \u1f47b neymarjr (@neymarjr) on Aug 12, 2017 at 5:08am PDT\n\n//platform.instagram.com/en_US/embeds.js\n\nNeymar is expected to make his debut for PSG against Guingamp in the French league after French football authorites received clearance for the Brazilian to play. PSG manager Unai Emery also stated that Neymar is physically ready to start the game. He had earlier watched from the stands as his new side beat Amiens in their French Ligue 1 opener.\n\nNeymar had stated that he decided to move away from the Spanish giants so as to get a new challenge. \"The life of an athlete is made by challenges. Some are given to us. Others are fruits of our own decisions to keep the light that illuminates our career, which is intense, but short,\" he said in a farewell statement he posted on his social media accounts.\n\nFor all the latest Sports News, download Indian Express App", "time": "15:34:00"}

Neymar's transfer certificate received by French federationNeymar might have to wait longer for PSG debutFans chant 'Neymar die' as Barcelona host Chapecoense, watch video\n\nPSG's world record transfer fee for Neymar may appear to be a lot but for the club's owners, the Qatar royal family, this is a small price to pay as it continues to further its interests via football.\n\nDrop in the ocean\n\nPSG is owned by Qatar Sports Investments, a branch of the state-owned Qatar Investment Authority, bought the French club five years ago for $170 million. The acquisition was a part of the kingdom's larger strategy to invest in global brands, whether in business, fashion, property or sport. Neymar's total value of $600 million including wages, taxes and fees. For a country that has reserves in excess of $300 billion and population of 313,000, this amount is just a drop in the ocean.\n\nFootball as soft power\n\nNeymar may soon be the poster-boy of the 2022 World Cup, for which Qatar reportedly paid millions in bribes to win the hosting rights, according to a Sunday Times investigation in 2014. Football has been central to Qatar raising its profile internationally. The nation has set aside $200 billion to prepare infrastructure for the tournament. Soon after, they then signed a sponsorship deal with Barcelona through Qatar Foundation. This was the first time a sponsor's name appeared on the jerseys of the Catalan side's century-long existence. Former players like Xavi were paid millions to play in the Qatari league. The purchase of PSG fuelled their ambitions.\n\nSlew of deals\n\nThe money splashed on Neymar is nothing compared to the other deals Qatar has entered since June, when a Saudi-led alliance cut ties with them and accused them of supporting terrorism. According to the New York Times, the world's top exporter of liquefied natural gas bought F-15 fighter jets from the US for $12 billion, seven warships from Italy which cost them $6 billion. They also came closing to buying a stake in American Airlines but shelved the idea for the time being. While these purchases were to show that they have not been derailed by the crisis, signing Neymar was a show of soft power via football.\n\nShow of strength\n\nThe Neymar deal also changed the narrative surrounding the 2022 World Cup. The regional crisis cast a long shadow on the World Cup and amidst the uncertainty, there have been calls to change the venue. FIFA, too, has said they are monitoring the situation. Jean-Marc Rickli, director of global risks at the Geneva Center for Security Policy, told a French website that purchasing Neymar was a show of strength. \"In the current context, Riyadh and its allies would be pleased to see FIFA withdraw the organisation of the 2022 World Cup football in Qatar,\" Rickli said. \"The arrival of Neymar allows Doha to assert its role in the politics of sport on a global level and especially in football.\"\n\nEuropean glory\n\nPSG's owners are desperate for the club to be counted as a European giant. While the Paris-based side became the undisputed best in France, it constantly failed at the continental championships, with their best performance being the semifinals. For the owners, there was just one solution. To compete with Real Madrid, Barcelona and Bayern Munich, PSG realised they needed to spend heavily. Millions have been splurged on assembling a squad and the results are visible. PSG came within seconds of knocking Barcelona out of the Champions League last year but Neymar killed their hopes by scoring twice. PSG had been courting Neymar for a year but, perhaps, at that moment they realised the Brazilian had to be theirs at any cost.\n\nFor all the latest Sports News, download Indian Express App\n\nTags: Neymar PSG", "time": "19:56:00"}

As the hysteria mounts ahead of Neymar's Paris Saint-Germain debut on Sunday focus switched from his record transfer fee to the question of which star would make way for the Brazilian.\n\nLe Parisien daily newspaper suggested it would be Javier Pastore, the silky but fragile Argentine who was the first major signing after PSG were bought by their ambitious Qatari owners, who splashed out a world record 222 million-euro ($261 million) for Neymar.\n\n\"After first giving up his No.10 shirt, will he (Pastore) now give him (Neymar) his place in the team,\" one Le Parisien headline asked of the player who took up the No.10 shirt after Zlatan Ibrahimovic left last season, only to hand it to the Brazilian this season.\n\n\"Neymar will start on the left at the cost of Pastore,\" the article claimed.\n\n\"So it'll be Neymar, (Edinson) Cavani and without doubt (Angel) di Maria in a three pronged attack,\" said Le Parisien, which then gave a long list of top signings who will be warming the PSG bench.\n\nAlongside Pastore will be the Brazilian Lucas Moura, who is rumoured to be staying as he has been friends with Neymar since the age of nine, and Germany captain at the Confederations Cup Julian Draxler, who arrived just last year in a big money transfer of his own.\n\nSports daily L'Equipe saw things differently, though.\n\n\"Neymar - the football version,\" ran their headline in a joke about how the most expensive transfer in football history has dominated news without the 25-year-old forward even kicking a ball yet.\n\n\"A trio of Neymar, Pastore and di Maria will support Cavani,\" they predicted, but were unsure where the extra man would be cut.\n\nIn the tiny Brittany town of Guingamp, with a population of around 7,000, tickets for the match have been changing hands for a king's ransom as the Stade du Roduourou has a capacity of just over 15,000.\n\n\"We could have filled a stadium of 40,000 seats with no problem at all,\" Guingamp president Bertrand Desplat told local newspaper Le Telegramme.\n\n\"Remember the star of the show is going to be Neymar and for us we want to welcome this very special player and his team in the best conditions possible,\" he said.\n\nJournalists however may find themselves a bit squeezed for space as the rustic press tribune allowing for 80 press seats has been extended to a blockbuster 350.\n\nShares", "time": "13:14:00"}

But the French league has yet to receive this from its Spanish counterparts and so cannot register the Brazilian.\n\nA spokesperson for the LFP said: \"The Spanish federation of football has until Thursday night to send the international contract of transfer to the French federation of football, who send it back to the French professional football league, and then Neymar can play with PSG this weekend.\"\n\nThe 25-year-old, who has signed a five-year deal which makes him the highest-paid player in the history of his sport, was unveiled at the Parc des Princes last Friday.\n\nSpanish league officials initially tried to block the deal after PSG triggered the release clause for the 25-year-old's contract, claiming the French club was breaking the Financial Fair Play rules set by UEFA, European football's governing body.\n\nBut there could be further stumbling blocks ahead in a transfer which has been far from straightforward.\n\nIf the LFP does not receive the certificate by August 18, FIFA would have to intervene.\n\nEven if the certificate is received, Neymar and Barcelona need to confirm their contract has expired. A failure for all parties to reach a mutual agreement would see FIFA rejecting the ITC.\n\nIn a statement, a FIFA spokesperson said: \"Once [the ITC] has been completed the former association of the player asks the player and his former club to confirm if his contract has expired, if it was ended early or on mutual agreement or whether there is a contractual dispute.\n\n\"The ITC can be rejected if the contract between the player and his former club has not expired, or if there is no mutual agreement regarding its early termination.\"\n\nTM & \u00a9 2017 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.

ahead of Neymar's Paris Saint-Germain debut tomorrow focus switched from his record transfer fee to the question of which star would make way for the Brazilian.\n\nLe Parisien daily newspaper suggested it would be Javier Pastore, the silky but fragile Argentine who was the first major signing after PSG were bought by their ambitious Qatari owners, who splashed out a world record \u00a3222 million (RM1.12 billion) for Neymar.\n\n\"After first giving up his No.10 shirt, will he (Pastore) now give him (Neymar) his place in the team,\" one Le Parisien headline asked of the player who took up the No.10 shirt after Zlatan Ibrahimovic left last season, only to hand it to the Brazilian this season.\n\n\"Neymar will start on the left at the cost of Pastore,\" the article claimed.\n\n\"So it'll be Neymar, (Edinson) Cavani and without doubt (Angel) di Maria in a three pronged attack,\" said Le Parisien, which then gave a long list of top signings who will be warming the PSG bench.\n\nAlongside Pastore will be the Brazilian Lucas Moura, who is rumoured to be staying as he has been friends with Neymar since the age of nine, and Germany captain at the Confederations Cup Julian Draxler, who arrived just last year in a big money transfer of his own.\n\nSports daily L'Equipe saw things differently, though.\n\n\"Neymar -- the football version,\" ran their headline in a joke about how the most expensive transfer in football history has dominated news without the 25-year-old forward even kicking a ball yet.\n\n\"A trio of Neymar, Pastore and di Maria will support Cavani,\" they predicted, but were unsure where the extra man would be cut.\n\nIn the tiny Brittany town of Guingamp, with a population of around 7,000, tickets for the match have been changing hands for a king's ransom as the Stade du Roduourou has a capacity of just over 15,000.\n\n\"We could have filled a stadium of 40,000 seats with no problem at all,\" Guingamp president Bertrand Desplat told local newspaper Le Telegramme.\n\n\"Remember the star of the show is going to be Neymar and for us we want to welcome this very special player and his team in the best conditions possible,\" he said.\n\nJournalists however may find themselves a bit squeezed for space as the rustic press tribune allowing for 80 press seats has been extended to a blockbuster 350. -- AFP", "time": "13:50:00"}

Yes, Neymar has proved his mettle as a player at 25 is probably about to hit his peak but that sort of amount for an individual was unheard of. So what made PSG splash so much money for just one player? Well, PSG is owned by the Qatar Sports Investments, a branch of the state-owned Qatar Investment Authority. The company had bought PSG five years ago for $170 million with an aim to turn it into a football powerhouse.\n\nThe acquisition was a part of the kingdom's larger strategy to invest in global brands, whether in business, fashion, property or sport. In last five years, the club signed players like Zlatan Ibrahimovic, Angel Di Maria, Edison Cavani, Lucas and Thiago Silva for an incredible amount of money. The transfer strategy started to show in the results as PSG won back to back seasons without threat.\n\nHowever, the European Glory stayed away. The best PSG could do was reach the semi-final of the UEFA Champions League, demanding a change in approach and arrival of few fresh legs. To compete with Real Madrid, Barcelona and Bayern Munich, PSG realised they needed to spend heavily. Maybe the club realised that Neymar could be the man who can change the club's fortune.\n\n#TheGlory @gagamilanoworld#gagamilano pic.twitter.com/irJQa7WSdK\n\n-- Neymar Jr (@neymarjr) August 1, 2017\n\nAnother side of the story is that there were voices asking FIFA to shift the venue of 2022 World Cup but with Neymar's arrival, Qatar has shown its strength. \"In the current context, Riyadh and its allies would be pleased to see FIFA withdraw the organisation of the 2022 World Cup football in Qatar,\" Jean-Marc Rickli, director of global risks at the Geneva Center for Security Policy told a French website. \"The arrival of Neymar allows Doha to assert its role in the politics of sport on a global level and especially in football.\"\n\nComing back to the money part, well, it never mattered. Neymar's total value including wages, taxes and fees is $600 million but for a country that has reserves in excess of $300 billion a and population of 313,000, this amount is just a drop in the ocean.", "time": "06:37:00"}

Transfer Talk is monitoring the whispers ahead of all the summer moves. Check out the latest deals and potential deals here.\n\nParis Saint-Germain have already rocked La Liga this summer by signing Neymar from Barcelona. Now, according to reports in Spain, they are looking to repeat the trick by beating Real Madrid to Monaco striker Kylian Mbappe.\n\nSport claims PSG have agreed a \u20ac180 million deal with their Ligue 1 rivals for the 18-year-old France international, who was also said to be a target for Barcelona and Manchester City. That breaks down as \u20ac150m up front and \u20ac30m to follow in bonuses and additional payments and would take PSG's total spend to over \u20ac400m this summer.\n\nMarca agrees, although they report a slight variation of the transfer fee, and reports documentation is already being filed to ratify the move that will see Mbappe return to his hometown. They also say that next up for ambitious PSG is a move for Atletico Madrid goalkeeper Jan Oblak.\n\nIn France, though, Le Parisien, has an altogether different take, with the outlet reporting that Monaco and PSG have both denied an offer has been made or that the transfer is happening at all.\n\nAnother player in demand across Europe this summer is Alexis Sanchez, but according to the Daily Mail at least, he could be tempted to stay at Arsenal and earn a cool \u00a3300,000-a-week.\n\nTo say Sanchez was influential last season would be an understatement. In all competitions the Chile international scored 30 goals and set up a further 15 for the Gunners, leading to speculation that Manchester City, PSG and Bayern Munich were interested.\n\nArsene Wenger might not be able to offer the Champions League football that Sanchez wants, but he has gone from stubbornly refusing to sell to increasingly confident of keeping his star man, the report claims, and with that kind of offer on the table it is easy to see why.\n\nBorussia Dortmund are playing hardball, but it seems like only a matter of time until Barcelona reach an agreement to sign Ousmane Dembele.\n\nIn Spain, Sport reports that the player has already reached an agreement with Barca on a five-year contract worth \u20ac10m a year. That's the easy part though, convincing Dortmund to sell given that they know how much Barca have to spend following the sale of Neymar is a different proposition altogether.\n\nEarlier on Thursday, Dortmund rejected an initial bid from the Catalans for Dembele, reportedly in the region of \u20ac100m.\n\n- Tottenham's Danny Rose is wanted by Manchester United, the Mirror claims, as Jose Mourinho has decided signing a new left-back is now an issue that needs resolving. Last season the role was shared between Daley Blind, Matteo Darmian, Marcos Rojo, Luke Shaw and Ashley Young but Mourinho would like a player capable of starting regularly in the position.\n\n- The Mirror reckons West Ham fear Liverpool will try to sign Manuel Lanzini if they lose Philippe Coutinho to Barcelona and are planning to offer the Argentine a new five-year contract to keep him in East London.

The payment was due on 31 July and was the difference between his former release fee of \u20ac196million and the revised release fee of \u20ac222million which Paris Saint-Germain paid early in August.\n\nBarcelona have lodged the payment with a firm of local solicitors while the row rumbles on. Neymar claims the money should be paid over and a lawyer representing the new PSG player states that the Brazilian maintained a good relationship with the club. Barcelona are claiming the fee should be reduced by at least four-fifths: Neymar signed a five-year deal in July 2016 and left one year into that deal.\n\nBut reports from Portugal today are making the claim that Neymar actually signed his contract with PSG at the end of June.\n\nCorreio da Manha reports that his contrct was signed over a month earlier than had been previously though. But it adds that no fewer than six agents were involved in the Neymar deal: Pini Zahavi, Marcelo Simoniam, Juan Figer, Wagner Ribeiro, Mohamed Afzal and Humberto Paiva. The news hasn't gone down well in France as none of the agents are French. Ribeiro and Paiva are Brazilians, Zahavi is Israeli, Simonian is Argentine, Figer is Uruguayan and Afzal is Portugese.\n\nBut if Neymar can be shown to have signed for PSG before the end of July then his father won't be due the \u20ac26million. The insinuation is that the transfer was deliberately delayed until 2 August so Neymar senior could pick up his money.\n\nMounting disaffection in France with new PSG sporting director Antero Henrique is rooted in him dismissing seven employees and replacing them with people he has brought in from his former club FC Porto where he was vice-president. One of the new faces was Paiva, an agent as well as - until May - one of the sporting directors at Belgian side Mouscron.", "time": "14:05:00"}

to the question of which star would make way for the Brazilian.\n\nLe Parisien daily newspaper suggested it would be Javier Pastore, the silky but fragile Argentine who was the first major signing after PSG were bought by their ambitious Qatari owners, who splashed out a world record 222 million-euro ($261 million) for Neymar.\n\n\"After first giving up his No.10 shirt, will he (Pastore) now give him (Neymar) his place in the team,\" one Le Parisien headline asked of the player who took up the No.10 shirt after Zlatan Ibrahimovic left last season, only to hand it to the Brazilian this season.\n\n\"Neymar will start on the left at the cost of Pastore,\" the article claimed.\n\n\"So it'll be Neymar, (Edinson) Cavani and without doubt (Angel) di Maria in a three pronged attack,\" said Le Parisien, which then gave a long list of top signings who will be warming the PSG bench.\n\nAlongside Pastore will be the Brazilian Lucas Moura, who is rumoured to be staying as he has been friends with Neymar since the age of nine, and Germany captain at the Confederations Cup Julian Draxler, who arrived just last year in a big money transfer of his own.\n\nSports daily L'Equipe saw things differently, though.\n\n\"Neymar - the football version,\" ran their headline in a joke about how the most expensive transfer in football history has dominated news without the 25-year-old forward even kicking a ball yet.\n\n\"A trio of Neymar, Pastore and di Maria will support Cavani,\" they predicted but were unsure where the extra man would be cut.\n\nIn the tiny Brittany town of Guingamp, with a population of around 7,000, tickets for the match have been changing hands for a king's ransom as the Stade du Roduourou has a capacity of just over 15,000.\n\n\"We could have filled a stadium of 40,000 seats with no problem at all,\" Guingamp president Bertrand Desplat told local newspaper Le Telegramme.\n\n\"Remember the star of the show is going to be Neymar and for us we want to welcome this very special player and his team in the best conditions possible,\" he said.\n\nJournalists, however, may find themselves a bit squeezed for space as the rustic press tribune allowing for 80 press seats has been extended to a blockbuster 350.", "time": "12:41:00"}

"http://www.thehindu.com/thread/sports/with-neymar-buy-paris-saint-germain-will-inflate-club-football/article19473696.ece", "body": "With the Brazilian football superstar Neymar da Silva Santos J\u00fanior's recent signing, Paris Saint-Germain F.C. has clearly sent the message across -- we mean business. The fact that that sort of message cost the ruthlessly-growing French club a whopping, record-breaking, record-making \u20ac222 million ($264 million) will in no small measure potentially alter the economic dynamics of world club football. With the Brazilian magician's former Barcelona forward partner Lionel Messi having crossed the 30-mark and Real Madrid's Cristiano Ronaldo 32, age is on Neymar's side. He represents the future of world football. He's seen as the torch-bearer of the next generation of stars. The indisputable future contender/candidate for Ballon d'Or.\n\nInflation is not something that affects the prices of basic commodities alone. Every passing year brings with it ballooning inflation in the football market too. Over the years, and even more so in the last decade, with increasing popularity and penetration of television and cable network, the Beautiful Game has only succeeded in bringing millions of new followers/worshippers into its fold. That broadens viewership and fandom, logically, spinning more money.\n\nOn the back of the history-making deal, clubs are now quite phlegmatically quoting exorbitant prices for their players from interested clubs. And those in pursuit are willingly offering equally absurd amounts of money to land their targets\n\nThe immediate impact of Neymar's, in many ways controversial, move from Barcelona F.C. to PSG is visible already. In the first day after the official announcement of the transfer and even before the 25-year-old kicked a ball for his new club, PSG revealed that it had recouped over \u20ac1 million, albeit just a fraction of the total outlay needed to meet the contract release clause of the world-class talent, through shirt sales. The club's jersey manufacturer ostensibly has its task cut out for the foreseeable future.\n\nPSG has been on a sky-high mission ever since the club's takeover by Oryx Qatar Sports Investments in 2011. In no time, the new owners, with the boundless backing of the oil-rich Gulf nation, injected astronomical sums of money into the club's coffers. Naturally, the club put into motion a shake-up of the line-up. Swedish maverick and mean goal machine Zlatan Ibrahamovic arrived the following year. Alongside came the Italian and gifted midfield playmaker Marco Veratti. The next year saw another marquee signing in the name of the unstoppable Uruguayan striker Edinson Cavani. Bit by bit, a semi-galaxy of stars was strung together at the heart of Paris. Success followed. Shirt sales rose. Match coverage broadened. Image rights shot up. TV rights raked in millions. More and more spectators thronged to the stadium. Millions more from around the world started watching, nay following, the club. PSG went on to become the most successful French club in history, at least in terms of trophies won. Today, they are on a par with the elite in European football.\n\nThis success story may not, however, sound unique, as it has more or less become a 'trend' these days. Club takeovers have been on the rise over the last decade and before. Many minnows or middle-tiered clubs saw their fortunes rise overnight with the munificence of wealthy patrons, albeit to varying degrees of success. But what sets the French sporting establishment apart is that none dared so big as PSG has in their acquisition of Neymar. This represented a new incredible high in the history of football transfers. The immediate impact on PSG was there for all to see, signified by the mega jamboree of an \"unveiling\" of the player before a full house.\n\nAlready, everyone's talking about not Barcelona, not Real Madrid, not Bayern Munich, not Manchester United and not even the perennially ambitious Pep Guardiola-led Manchester City, who have splurged a jaw-dropping \u20ac217 this summer so far in their efforts to be the new game-changer. It's Neymar and PSG. Cristiano Ronaldo's unfolding court saga over tax evasion allegations can wait. The real acid test of Belgian giant Romelu Lukaku's English Premier League record transfer suddenly became a thing of lesser importance. Even before the French league commenced, PSG have made their mark, their TV rights revenues increasing reportedly exponentially.\n\nNeymar will now serve as the benchmark for the rest of the PSG players, essentially requiring his teammates to raise their games as well. This should have a positive domino effect in the league, in that PSG's opponents will find themselves in a non-negotiable position to set their own bar higher. That means an improved overall performance. That means, eventually, larger viewership, and, needless to say, more money. In turn, this would augment the purchasing power of most of the clubs involved. Meaning, more clout and standing and wherewithal to attract better talent to France in the face of tough competition from the league's more popular and more moneyed counterparts, chiefly the English Premier League, La Liga, Bundesliga, Serie A. The cycle goes on.\n\nIt's also obvious that PSG owners are undaunted by the bogey of Financial Fair Play regulations as they seem more than confident about counterbalancing the sudden money outflow to its European rivals. The new signing is expected to boost the club's coffers sooner than later by means of image rights, sponsorship deals and a myriad network of merchandising.\n\nWhen the French ace Paul Pogba moved from Juventus back to his former club Manchester United for a then-record transfer sum of \u00a389.3 million plus bonuses last August, eyebrows were raised over the skyrocketing of transfer fees in football. However, none would have guessed that in just about a year, that record would be easily surpassed by over double the amount. Neymar's world-record move has already set off ripples in football transfers elsewhere.\n\nOn the back of the history-making deal, clubs are now quite phlegmatically quoting exorbitant prices for their players from interested clubs.

When he posted the video of him telling the story he used the caption tagging the New Yorker: 'Looking forward to seeing how you spin this one.'\n\nDailyMail.com reached out to the Kennedy campaign for comment.\n\nRead More Mystery deepens as autopsy concludes black bear found dead in Central Park was 'run over and killed by a vehicle'\n\nIn October 2014, a mysterious dead bear was discovered in Central Park. It was discovered by a dog walker who then notified a Central Park Conservancy worker who contacted police.\n\nAn investigation by the Department of Environmental Conservation (DEC) concluded that the six-month-old bear was run over and killed by a vehicle, but they could not figure out how it ended up in the park since black bears were not known to live in or roam in the park.\n\nKennedy said in his video that the next day after leaving the dead bear in the park, it was on every television station and in every paper.\n\n'I turned on the TV and it was like, mile of yellow tape, and there were 20 cop cars. There were helicopters flying over it,' Kennedy said. 'I was like \"oh my god. What did I do?\"'\n\nKennedy said he was worried because his prints were all over the bike. But Kennedy said the story died after a while and 'it stayed dead for a decade.'\n\nHe said the New Yorker somehow found out about it and were going to do a big article on him.\n\n'It's going to be a bad article,' Kennedy said.\n\nAt the time, the DEC was investigating potential law violations. If caught, a person could face charges including illegal possession to disposing of an untagged bear.", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Mail Online"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Park", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Central Park"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_F._Kennedy", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "John F.

The bear was found in the New York park in October 2014 by a dog walker who then notified a Central Park Conservancy worker who contacted police.\n\nAn investigation by the Department of Environmental Conservation (DEC) concluded that the six-month-old bear was run over and killed by a vehicle, but they could not figure out how it ended up in the park.\n\nIn a video with comedian Roseanne Barr (pictured left), Kennedy now claims he was there when the bear died and said he was responsible for it being located in Central Park. 'A woman in the van in front of me hit a bear and killed it, a young bear,' he recalled. 'So I pulled over, and I picked up the bear and put him in the back of my van because I was going to skin the bear, and it was in very good condition, and I was going to put the meat in my refrigerator. You can do that in New York state. You can get a bear tag for roadkill bear,' he said.\n\nThe 70-year-old presidential candidate said he then proceeded to go hawking with the dead bear in his car. He said they were catching a lot of game and stayed late, so instead of heading home to Westchester, NY he had to go straight to New York City for a dinner. But then the dinner also went late, and according to Kennedy, he needed to go to the airport instead of his home. 'The bear was in my car, and I didn't want to leave the bear in the car because that would have been bad,' Kennedy said.\n\nKennedy said there was ' a little bit of the redneck in me' when he explained there had been a series of bicycle accidents in the city and multiple people had gotten killed or badly injured. Kennedy recalled it was in the press every day and that he also had an old bike in his car someone asked him to get rid of.\n\n'I said let's go put the bear in Central Park, and we'll make it look like it got hit by a bike,' Kennedy said as he and Barr laughed. 'So everybody thought that's a great idea.' Kennedy said he had not been drinking when the decision was made but others had been.\n\nIt appeared Kennedy was attempting to the story now because he is trying to get ahead of an article by the New Yorker. When he posted the video of him telling the story he used the caption tagging the New Yorker: ' Looking forward to seeing how you spin this one.' DailyMail.com reached out to the Kennedy campaign for comment.\n\nKennedy said in his video that the next day after leaving the dead bear in the park, it was on every television station and in every paper. 'I turned on the TV and it was like, mile of yellow tape, and there were 20 cop cars. There were helicopters flying over it,' Kennedy said. 'I was like \"oh my god. What did I do?\"'\n\nKennedy said he was worried because his prints were all over the bike. But Kennedy said the story died after a while and 'it stayed dead for a decade.' He said the New Yorker somehow found out about it and were going to do a big article on him. 'It's going to be a bad article,' Kennedy said.\n\nAt the time, the DEC was investigating potential law violations. If caught, a person could face charges including illegal possession to disposing of an untagged bear.\n\nWant more stories like this from the Daily Mail?

So we went and did that and thought it would be amusing for whoever found it,\" Kennedy recounted in a video posted on X that featured sitcom actress Roseanne Barr.\n\nA media frenzy quickly ensued in 2014 after a woman discovered the dead bear under some bushes concealed in part by a bike.\n\nThe bear was described in reports at the time as a cub, though Kennedy simply called it \"a young bear.\"\n\n\"I turned on the TV and there was like a mile of yellow tape, and there were 20 cop cars.

Luckily the story died after a while.\"\n\nLocals were puzzled by the sudden appearance of the dead bear at the time and many people were horrified.\n\nKennedy claimed in the video that he stumbled upon the dead bear while trekking through New York state for a falconing trip in Goshen, New York.\n\nDuring his ride up there in the wee hours of the morning, Kennedy claims that a woman in front of her hit a bear with her vehicle and killed it.\n\n\"So I pulled over and I picked up the bear and put him in the back of my van because I was going to skin the bear and it was very good condition and I was going to put the meat in my refrigerator,\" he recalled.\n\nThe environmental lawyer explained that he planned to obtain a bear tag for a road kill bear and put the meat in his refrigerator later. But the falconing trip ran late.\n\nHe then had to dash over to New York City instead of heading back to his home in Westchester County due to a dinner that he needed to attend. At that point, he realized he needed to go to the airport, but had the dead bear in his car.\n\nAll of this prompted his decision to dump the dead bear in Central Park.\n\n\"This was the little bit of the redneck in me,\" Kennedy quipped.\n\nKennedy predicted that the forthcoming reporting about his handling of the dead bear would be negative.\n\nKennedy is averaging 5.5% in presidential polls compared to former President Donald Trump's 44.6% and Vice President Kamala Harris' 44.8% support in the latest RealClearPolitics aggregate of a five-way national race.", "source": {"uri": "nypost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "New York Post"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_F._Kennedy", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "John F.

He said he pulled over and put the bear in the back of his van to eventually skin the bear \"because it was in very good condition\" and put the meat in his refrigerator.\n\nAfter he put the bear in his van, he went hawking with friends and he didn't have time to go to his home in Westchester and put the bear away. Instead, he was due for dinner in the city. The dinner went late and he had to go to the airport, but the bear was still in his car.\n\n\"I didn't want to leave the bear in the car because that would have been bad,\" he said.\n\nThe presidential candidate said at the time there had been a series of bicycle accidents in Central Park because of the new bicycle lanes. A few people who were with him, who Kennedy said had been drinking, thought Kennedy's \"redneck\" idea to put the bear in Central Park was a good idea, along with an old bike that was also in his car.\n\n\"I said let's go put the bear in Central Park, and we'll make it look like he got hit by a bike.\n\n\"So we went and did that, and we thought it would be amusing for whoever found it or something.\"\n\nKennedy said the next day that the dead bear was on every news station, and according to the news, they were going to have fingerprints on the bike identified. The news eventually died down, and Kennedy was never discovered to be the one who did the deed.\n\n\"There were helicopters flying over it, and I was like, oh, my god, what did I do,\" Kennedy said as people in the background of the video laughed.\n\nAccording to an ABC News article from 2014, a dog walker discovered the 3-foot-tall bear, which had signs of trauma.\n\n\"The news that a dead black bear cub was found in Central Park is beyond upsetting,\" Elizabeth Kaledin, a spokeswoman for the Central Park Conservancy, said in a statement at the time. \"Whenever any wildlife is harmed or injured we at the Conservancy are upset and alarmed. Black bears are not native to Central Park and there are no black bears kept at the Central Park Zoo so this is a highly unusual situation.\"\n\nIn Kennedy's video, he said the New Yorker is planning to run this story soon and he wanted to get ahead of it.\n\n\"It's going to be a bad story,\" Kennedy said at the end of the video.", "source": {"uri": "huffpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "HuffPost"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Park", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Central Park"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_F._Kennedy", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "John F.

Kennedy admitted to putting a a dead bear cub in Central Park in New York City ten years ago.\n\nThe admission finally answered the decade-old mystery as to how the three-foot bear mysteriously appeared in Manhattan on an early October morning in 2014.\n\nKennedy, who is running for president as an Independent, revealed he was responsible for the incident in a video posted to X.\n\nThe admission came Sunday after the New Yorker reportedly contacted him to confirm the story.\n\nIn the 3 minute and 20 second clip, Kennedy is seen telling the story to sitcom actress Roseanne Barr.\n\nHe explained that he first came across the bear after taking a group to go falconing.\n\nDuring the trip, a woman in a van driving in front of him fatally hit the young bear.\n\nInitially, Kennedy said he hoped to take the dead animal home for its fur and meat.\n\n\"So, I pulled over and I picked up the bear and put him in the back of my van because I was going to skin the bear, and it was in very good condition, and I was going to put the meat in my refrigerator,\" the Independent said.\n\n\"And you can do that in New York state. You can get a bear tag for roadkill bear.\"\n\nHowever, Kennedy said he wasn't able to get home right away.\n\nAs the day slipped away, he said he had to go to a dinner at Peter Luger Steakhouse in Brooklyn, New York.\n\nAfter the dinner ran late, Kennedy said he found himself unable to travel home to Westchester before heading to the airport.\n\nWith the bear in his car, he found himself looking for a place to leave it.\n\n\"And the bear was in my car, and I didn't want to leave the bear in the car because that would have been bad,\" Kennedy said.\n\n\"So, then I thought you know at that time this was the little bit of the redneck me.\n\n\"There'd been a series of bicycle accidents in New York they had just put in the bike lanes and so a couple of people were getting killed and it was every day and people badly injured every day it was in the press.\"\n\nKennedy claimed he hadn't been drinking and that he and the others with him came up with an idea.\n\nHe said he had an old bike in his car as well and decided to pose a fake accident with the bear.\n\n\"I said let's go put the bear in Central Park and we'll make it look like it got hit by a bike,\" Kennedy said in the video.\n\nThe fake accident immediately created a media circus across Manhattan, leaving Kennedy wondering about the consequences of his actions.\n\n\"The next day, it was like it was on every television station. It was the front page of every paper and I turned on the TV and there was like a mile of yellow tape and there were 20 cop cars, there were helicopters flying over it,\" he recalled.\n\n\"And I was like, 'Oh my God, what did I do?'

A few people who were with him, who Kennedy said had been drinking, thought Kennedy's \"redneck\" idea to put the bear in Central Park was a good idea, along with an old bike that was also in his car.\n\n\"I said let's go put the bear in Central Park, and we'll make it look like he got hit by a bike.\n\n\"So we went and did that, and we thought it would be amusing for whoever found it or something.\"\n\nKennedy said the next day that the dead bear was on every news station, and according to the news, they were going to have fingerprints on the bike identified. The news eventually died down, and Kennedy was never discovered to be the one who did the deed.\n\n\"There were helicopters flying over it, and I was like, oh, my god, what did I do,\" Kennedy said as people in the background of the video laughed.\n\nAccording to an ABC News article from 2014, a dog walker discovered the 3-foot-tall bear, which had signs of trauma.\n\n\"The news that a dead black bear cub was found in Central Park is beyond upsetting,\" Elizabeth Kaledin, a spokeswoman for the Central Park Conservancy, said in a statement at the time. \"Whenever any wildlife is harmed or injured we at the Conservancy are upset and alarmed. Black bears are not native to Central Park and there are no black bears kept at the Central Park Zoo so this is a highly unusual situation.\"\n\nIn Kennedy's video, he said the New Yorker is planning to run this story soon and he wanted to get ahead of it.\n\n\"It's going to be a bad story,\" Kennedy said at the end of the video.", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Park", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Central Park"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_F._Kennedy", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "John F.

Kennedy Jr. Releases Bizarre Video Telling Roseanne Barr About Finding a Dead Bear and Dumping It in Central Park", "body": "Robert F. Kennedy Jr. posted a video on his X/Twitter account on Sunday, in which he admitted to dumping a dead bear cub in New York City's Central Park a decade ago.\n\nIn the video, which was seemingly released to get ahead of a forthcoming New Yorker article, Kennedy recounted to Roseanne Barr how he had come across the bear in the morning as he was driving to Goshen, N.Y., to go falconing. The video, which runs a little over 3 minutes, appears to show Barr and Kennedy discussing the story over breakfast in a spacious kitchen.\n\nMore from Variety\n\n\"A woman in a van in front of me hit a bear and killed it -- a young bear,\" Kennedy recalled. \"So, I pulled over and I picked up the bear and put him in the back of my van because I was going to skin the bear, and it was in very good condition, and I was going to put the meat in my refrigerator. And you can do that in New York state. You can get a bear tag for roadkill bear.\"\n\nBut the falconing day went longer than anticipated, and instead of returning to his home in Westchester, Kennedy had to go straight to a dinner at Peter Luger Steakhouse in New York City. He then had to catch a flight after the dinner, which also went late.\n\n\"And the bear was in my car, and I didn't want to leave the bear in the car because that would have been bad,\" he said. \"So, then I thought, you know at that time, this was the little bit of the redneck in me. There'd been a series of bicycle accidents in New York. They had just put in the bike lanes and so a couple of people were getting killed and it was every day and people had been badly injured. Every day it was in the press.\"\n\nKennedy said he had an idea that involved an \"old bike in my car that somebody asked me to get rid of.\"\n\n\"I said, 'Let's go put the bear in Central Park and we'll make it look like he got hit by a bike,'\" Kennedy said in the video. He insisted that he hadn't been drinking at the time, but the people he was with were drinking and thought it was a \"great idea.\"\n\n\"The next day, it was, like, it was on every television station. It was the front page of every paper and I turned on the TV and there was like a mile of yellow tape and there were 20 cop cars, there were helicopters flying over it. And I was like, 'Oh my God, what did I do?' And then they were, there was some people on TV in Tyvek suits with gloves on lifting up the bike and they're saying they're gonna take this up to Albany to get it fingerprinted,\" he said. \"And I was worried because my prints were all over that bike.\"\n\nKennedy noted that \"the story died down after a while\" until the New Yorker recently reached out to him to verify details about the bear incident.\n\nVariety has reached out to representatives from the New Yorker for comment.\n\nKennedy's decision to release a video conversation with Barr will also raise eyebrows. Barr, the outspoken blue-collar comedian who starred in the hit 1980s and '90s sitcom \"Roseanne,\" has been on the fringe of entertainment in recent years. In 2018, Barr's comeback with a revival of \"Roseanne\" on ABC was cut short when she made a racist statement on Twitter about former Obama White House advisor Valerie Jarrett.", "source": {"uri": "ca.news.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_F._Kennedy", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "John F.

Kennedy said he picked up the roadkill after it was hit by a van and planned to skin it. The incident became national news after a woman found the bear.\n\nPresidential candidate Robert Kennedy Jr. once claimed that parasitic worms may have eaten his brain -- and yet something even weirder regarding his past has come to light.\n\nIn a video posted to X on Sunday, Kennedy said that ten years ago, he picked up a dead bear cub from the road with the intention of skinning it and storing the meat in his fridge.\n\nIn New York, hunters are allowed to take one bear a year as long as it is appropriately reported to authorities and tagged -- though residents are not allowed to intentionally kill a bear cub.\n\n\"I was driving up really early, and a woman in a van in front of me hit the bear and killed it, a young bear. So I pulled over, and I picked up the bear and put him in the back of my van,\" Kennedy said to actress Roseanne Barr in a video on X.\n\nKennedy later realized, after driving around with the bear in his trunk for hours, that he had to go to the airport.\n\n\"I didn't want to leave the bear in the car because that would have been bad,\" he said in the video.\n\nHe then said his friends, who had been drinking, encouraged him to abandon the carcass in Central Park in New York. Kennedy said he was sober but decided to go along with the plan.\n\nTo dispose of the carcass, Kennedy said he intentionally left the dead bear on the side of the road to make it appear like a car had hit the bear. Kennedy said he had also left a bicycle near the bear.\n\n\"We thought it would be amusing for whoever found it,\" Kennedy said.\n\nKennedy said that he believed the story would go away, but instead, it became national news after a woman walking her dog discovered the animal. \"Luckily, the story died after a while, and it stayed dead for a decade,\" he said.\n\nA 2014 New York Times story appears to detail the incident though the exact timeline is unclear. Per the Times, a woman \"noticed the dead bear cub, which was lying under some bushes, partially concealed by an abandoned bicycle.\"\n\nIronically, the author of the Times story, Tatiana Schlossberg, is John F. Kennedy's granddaughter. This makes Schlossberg and Kennedy, JFK's nephew, cousins.\n\nKennedy said he chose to reveal that he and his friends were behind the dumping to get ahead of a New Yorker story detailing the incident.\n\n\"The New Yorker somehow found out about it, and they're gonna do a big article on me, and that's one of the articles. So they asked me, the fact-checkers. It's gonna be a bad story,\" Kennedy said before he and Barr burst into laughter.\n\nThis isn't Kennedy's first controversy related to a dead animal carcass. The independent presidential candidate recently fought off claims that he barbecued and ate a dog.\n\nA representative for Kennedy's campaign did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nRead the original article on Business Insider", "source": {"uri": "businessinsider.nl", "dataType": "news", "title": "Business Insider Nederland"}, "authors": [{"uri": "hannah_getahun@businessinsider.nl", "name": "Hannah Getahun", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_F._Kennedy_Jr.", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Robert F.

Kennedy confessed Thursday that he left behind the cub after a New Yorker Magazine fact checker called to verify the information for an upcoming story, the outlet reported.\n\nIn a video shared on X, formerly Twitter, Kennedy recounted the incident with the caption, \"Looking forward to seeing how you spin this one, @NewYorker...\"\n\nKennedy said he was driving on his way to go falconing when a woman in a van in front of his struck and killed the bear.

You can get a bear tag for roadkill bear.\"\n\nThe deceased bear remained in his car as he went about his day with friends. After falconing, Kennedy returned to New York City for a dinner reservation that ran late.

He said that he was sharing the 2014 story because the New Yorker's fact-checkers called him and indicated they were doing a story on the event.\n\nThe three-minute video's social media caption reads, \"Looking forward to seeing how you spin this one, @NewYorker...\" It's unclear what there would be to spin about the story that the independent presidential candidate tells, but watch the New Yorker for more.\n\nSitting at a kitchen table, he laid the story out for actress and comedian Roseanne Barr, who he was hanging out with for some reason.\n\n\"I was taking a group of people falconing up in Goshen, New York, up in the Hudson Valley, and I was supposed to meet them there at like maybe 8 or 9,\" Kennedy began. \"I was driving up maybe, you know, really early, like 7, and then a woman in a van in front of me hit a bear and killed it. A young bear.\"\n\n\"So I pulled over and I picked up the bear and put him in the back of my van, because I was going to skin the bear,\" Kennedy said. \"And it was very good condition, and I was going to put the meat in my refrigerator. And you can do that in New York state -- you can get a bear tag for a roadkill bear.\"\n\nThe politician and activist continued his strange tale, adding, \"And so then we went hawking and I had the bear in my car. And then we had a really good day, and we went late. We were catching a lot of game, and the people really loved it, so we stayed late. And instead of going back to my home in Westchester, I had to go right to the city, because there was a dinner at Peter Luger's Steak House.\"\n\n\"And at the end of the dinner, it went late, and I realized I couldn't go home -- I had to go to the airport.\" That's when he had a realization: \"And the bear was in my car, and I didn't want to leave the bear in the car, because, well, that would have been bad.\"\n\nBarr agrees at this point. Kennedy clearly had the good sense to not leave a dead bear in his car for a prolonged period of time while he traveled.\n\n\"So then I thought, you know, at that time -- this was the little bit of the redneck in me. There'd been a series of bicycle accidents in New York, they had just put in the bike lanes,\" Kennedy ominously continued .\"And some people, a couple of people had gotten killed, and it was every day, and people had been badly injured. Every day, it was in the press.\"\n\n\"And so I thought -- I wasn't drinking, of course, but people were drinking with me who thought this was a good idea,\" he continued. Kennedy has long been sober after overcoming a 14-year heroin addiction when he was young, but apparently still thought it was a great idea to take advice from people drinking around him. \"And I said, I had an old bike in my car that somebody had asked me to get rid of, and I said, 'Let's go put the bear in the Central Park, and we'll make it look like he got hit by a bike' -- it would be fun, funny for people.\"\n\n\"So everybody thought, 'That's a great idea,' so we went and did that,\" Kennedy said, continuing his description of the kind of idea that people think is genius while they're drunk. \"And we thought it would be amusing for whoever found it or something.\"\n\n\"The next day, it was like, it was on every television station. It was the front page of every paper,\" Kennedy added. Oops. \"And I turned on the TV and there was like a mile of yellow tape and there were 20 cop cars, there were helicopters flying over it and I was like, oh my God. What did I do?\"\n\n\"And then there were some people on TV in tie-back suits with gloves on, lifting up the bike, and they were saying they were going to take this up to Albany to get it fingerprinted.\"\n\nA smiling Barr added, \"uh oh\" and chuckled as he continued.\n\n\"And I was worried, because my prints were all over that bike,\" Kennedy said. He did not say whether or not he ever came forward to authorities, but the implication was that he did not.\n\n\"And luckily the story died down after a while, and it stayed dead for a decade,\" Kennedy added. \"And the New Yorker somehow found out about it and they're going to do a big article on me, and that's one of the articles. So they asked me, the fact-checkers... and, you know, it's going to be a bad story.\"\n\nIt was unclear from his tone if he meant that the story would be bad journalistically, bad for Kennedy or something else.\n\nThe clip concludes as Barr delivers another \"uh oh\" and laughs again as someone in the background notes, \"I think it's a great story, personally.\" The video then closes with an iris out film effect, narrowing down like the end of a \"Looney Tunes\" cartoon. Which feels vaguely appropriate for the grim yet cartoonish story.\n\nHe was correct that it was widely covered when it happened, including on CNN. You can watch the network's anchors noting that authorities had figured out that someone had brought the dead bear and left it there, as there had been no bears in the park \"for a long, long time. It seems as if someone brought the thing there, which is really sad.\"\n\nAlready polling in the single digits behind former President Donald Trump and President Joe Biden, Kennedy's poll numbers have collapsed since Biden dropped out of the race, with the member of the famed political clan seeming to have little chance of making a significant impact on the 2024 presidential race.", "source": {"uri": "ca.news.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_F._Kennedy", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "John F.

Kennedy, Jr. admitted to dumping the body of a bear cub in New York City's Central Park in 2014 -- an incident that caused a police animal cruelty investigation but was never solved.\n\nIn the video, Kennedy tells comedian Roseanne Barr the incident began when he was driving to meet people to go falconing in Goshen, New York. As he was driving through the Hudson Valley, he saw a woman in front of him hit a \"young bear\" with her van.\n\n\"I pulled over, I picked up the bear and put it in the back of my van. Because I was going to skin the bear, and it was in very good condition. And I was going to put the meat in my refrigerator. You can do that in New York -- you can get a bear tag for a roadkill bear.\"\n\nIn reports from 2014, NYPD investigators described the animal as a \"black bear cub\" that was only about three feet long.\n\nKennedy said he continued with his day -- falconing in the Hudson Valley -- before going straight to dinner at Peter Luger Steak House (he did not specify if he had dinner at the pricey steakhouse's historic Williamsburg, Brooklyn location or the institution's Great Neck, Long Island outpost). He forgot about the bear until later that night -- after he realized he needed to board a flight and couldn't drop the bear off at home.\n\nInstead, Kennedy devised a strange scheme to dump the animal in Central Park.\n\n\"There'd been a series of bicycle accidents in New York, they had just put in the bike lanes,\" Kennedy said. \"I saw a couple of people had gotten killed, and it was every day and people had been badly injured. Every day it was in the press. So I thought -- I wasn't drinking of course, but people were drinking with me who thought this was a good idea... I had an old bike in my car that somebody had asked me to get rid of. I said, let's go put the bear in Central Park and we'll make it look like he got hit by a bike.\"\n\nThe blue-blooded scion of one of America's most prominent political dynasties claimed the plan was inspired by \"the little bit of the redneck in me.\"\n\nLaughing, Kennedy said his companions thought it was a \"great idea,\" and thought it would be \"amusing.\"\n\nMeanwhile, a dog walker in Central Park discovered the bear's corpse near West 69th Street on Monday, October 6, 2014. The dog walker, identified as 79-year-old Florence Slatkin by the New York Daily News, called the discovery \"shocking.\"\n\nThe NYPD opened an investigation and shipped the bear cub's body to a lab in Albany, which determined it died from \"blunt force injuries consistent with a motor vehicle collision,\" according to the New York Times. A bear researcher interviewed by the paper accurately guessed that someone likely brought the cub's body from outside the city.\n\nThe story was quickly picked up by other major papers and television stations in the tri-state area. Kennedy said he saw these reports the next day and thought \"Oh my God, what did I do?\"\n\nIt is not immediately clear why Kennedy decided to come clean about the bear cub almost a decade after the news broke.\n\nThe independent presidential candidate said he was getting ahead of the story after he was contacted by New Yorker fact checkers -- who questioned him about the bear.", "source": {"uri": "thedailybeast.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Daily Beast"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_F._Kennedy", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "John F.

In a New York Times article published on Oct. 7, 2014, it was noted that a dead bear cub was found by a woman walking her dog in Central Park and was lying under some bushes, partially concealed by an abandoned bicycle. It was also reported that the state's Department of Environmental Conservation had announced that necropsy results showed that the cause of death was \"blunt force injuries consistent with a motor vehicle collision.\" However, despite it being concluded how the bear was killed, it was a mystery as to how it ended up in Central Park to begin with.\n\nThough no other context was given for the reason for Kennedy's video, the story follows other claims the independent presidential candidate has made, including that a parasitic worm ate part of his brain as well as sharing some other deemed conspiracy theories.\n\nIn a July 2 Vanity Fair article, a 2010 photo was unearthed of Kennedy and an unidentified woman into the barbequed remains of what resembled a dog. According to Vanity Fair, last year Kennedy texted the picture to a friend who was traveling to Korea, recommending a restaurant there that served canine.

The video, which runs a little over 3 minutes, appears to show Barr and Kennedy discussing the story over breakfast in a spacious kitchen.\n\n\"A woman in a van in front of me hit a bear and killed it -- a young bear,\" Kennedy recalled. \"So, I pulled over and I picked up the bear and put him in the back of my van because I was going to skin the bear, and it was in very good condition, and I was going to put the meat in my refrigerator.

He insisted that he hadn't been drinking at the time, but the people he was with were drinking and thought it was a \"great idea.\"\n\n\"The next day, it was, like, it was on every television station.

Barr, the outspoken blue-collar comedian who starred in the hit 1980s and '90s sitcom \"Roseanne,\" has been on the fringe of entertainment in recent years.

That was until fact checkers from The New Yorker recently contacted him about the allegations about a \"big article\" on him.\n\n\"It's going to be a bad story,\" Kennedy said, while writing on X, \"Looking forward to seeing how you spin this one @NewYorker...\"\n\nThe Hill reached out to The New Yorker for further comment.\n\nSome of the details of Kennedy's story appeared to coincide with an October 2014 incident, in which a woman walking her dog noticed a dead cub lying under the bushes besides a bike in Central Park.\n\nThe state's Department of Environmental Conservation said the necropsy showed the cause of death was \"blunt force injuries consistent with a motor vehicle collision,\" The New York Times reported at the time.\n\nCopyright 2024 Nexstar Media, Inc.

Independent presidential candidate Robert Kennedy Jr. on Sunday confessed that he was behind the incident after a fact checker from the New Yorker called him to verify the story.\n\nIn a video he posted on X, Kennedy said he had come across the bear in the morning when he was going falconing; a woman in a van in front of him hit and killed the bear.\n\n\"So, I pulled over and I picked up the bear and put him in the back of my van because I was going to skin the bear, and it was in very good condition, and I was going to put the meat in my refrigerator,\" Kennedy said. \"And you can do that in New York state. You can get a bear tag for roadkill bear.\"\n\nBut the falconing day went longer than expected, and he had to go straight to a dinner in the city at Peter Luger Steakhouse, he recounted. That, too, ran late, and Kennedy said he realized he had to go to the airport and would not be able to go home to Westchester first.\n\n\"And the bear was in my car, and I didn't want to leave the bear in the car because that would have been bad,\" he said. \"So, then I thought you know at that time this was the little bit of the redneck me. There'd been a series of bicycle accidents in New York they had just put in the bike lanes and so a couple of people were getting killed and it was every day and people badly injured every day it was in the press.\"\n\nHe said, \"I wasn't drinking, of course, but people were drinking with me who thought this was a good idea.\"\n\nKennedy mentioned that in addition to the dead bear cub, he had \"an old bike in my car that somebody asked me to get rid of.\"\n\n\"I said let's go put the bear in Central Park and we'll make it look like it got hit by a bike,\" Kennedy recalled. What he did not expect was the media attention the stunt would attract.\n\n\"The next day, it was like it was on every television station. It was the front page of every paper and I turned on the TV and there was like a mile of yellow tape and there were 20 cop cars, there were helicopters flying over it. And I was like, 'Oh my God, what did I do?' And then they were, there was some people on TV and Tyvek suits with gloves on lifting up the bike and they're saying they're gonna take this up to Albany to get it fingerprinted,\" he said. \"And I was worried because my prints were all over that bike.\"\n\nIn another odd twist, one of the reporters who wrote about the mystery was Kennedy's niece and John F. Kennedy's granddaughter, Tatiana Schlossberg, who was working for the New York Times, a social media user noted. \"So many questions remain unanswered,\" she wrote. \"How did the bear end up in Central Park? Was there foul play involved? Did she die in the park, or was she dumped there?\"\n\nHe said that luckily, the story had died until the New Yorker reported on it and asked him to verify it.

Kennedy said he had also left a bicycle near the bear.\n\n\"We thought it would be amusing for whoever found it,\" Kennedy said.\n\nKennedy said that he believed the story would go away, but instead, it became national news after a woman walking her dog discovered the animal. \"Luckily, the story died after a while, and it stayed dead for a decade,\" he said.\n\nA 2014 New York Times story appears to detail the incident though the exact timeline is unclear. Per the Times, a woman \"noticed the dead bear cub, which was lying under some bushes, partially concealed by an abandoned bicycle.\"\n\nIronically, the author of the Times story, Tatiana Schlossberg, is John F. Kennedy's granddaughter. This makes Schlossberg and Kennedy, JFK's nephew, cousins.\n\nKennedy said he chose to reveal that he and his friends were behind the dumping to get ahead of a New Yorker story detailing the incident.\n\n\"The New Yorker somehow found out about it, and they're gonna do a big article on me, and that's one of the articles. So they asked me, the fact-checkers. It's gonna be a bad story,\" Kennedy said before he and Barr burst into laughter.\n\nThis isn't Kennedy's first controversy related to a dead animal carcass.

The Police Department's Animal Cruelty Investigation Squad began looking into the bear's death, and the cub was taken to Albany for analysis by the conservation department's wildlife health unit.\" Authorities determined that the bear had been hit by a car.\n\nThe Times added, \"But so many questions remain unanswered: How did the bear end up in Central Park? Was there foul play involved? Did she die in the park, or was she dumped there?\"\n\nIn the story, experts surmised that it was the latter, commenting that it would be highly unusual for a bear to travel through the city to the park.\n\nThat said, the story had remained a public mystery until Kennedy's revelation.\n\nHis campaign has had its share of other unusual revelations.

On social media Sunday, Aug. 4, 2024, Independent presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. took responsibility for leaving the cub in New York's Central Park a decade ago.\n\nWILMINGTON, Del. (AP) -- Independent presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. once retrieved a bear that was killed by a motorist and left it in New York's Central Park with a bicycle on top, sparking a mystery that consumed the city a decade ago.\n\nKennedy describes the incident in a video that was posted to social media Sunday, adding it will be included in a forthcoming New Yorker article that he expects to be damaging.\n\nIt's the latest bizarre incident in Kennedy's quixotic campaign that has divided his famous family and left Republicans and Democrats alike concerned about his potential impact on the presidential contest. Kennedy has acknowledged a parasite that lodged in his brain and died. He denied eating a dog after a friend shared a photo with Vanity Fair magazine showing Kennedy dramatically preparing to take a bite of a charred animal; Kennedy said it was a goat.\n\nIn the video, Kennedy recounts the story to actress Roseanne Barr. He says he was heading to a falconry excursion with friends when a woman driving ahead of him hit and killed the young bear with her vehicle. He says he put it in his own vehicle, intending to skin it and eat the meat, but the day got away from him.\n\nEventually, he says, he was in Manhattan and needed to get the bear carcass out of his vehicle. His friends, fueled by alcohol, concocted the Central Park plan as a prank, he said, adding he was not drunk himself. At the time, bicycle accidents were getting significant media attention, so Kennedy and his friends thought it would be funny to make it look like the bear was hit by a bicycle.\n\nTwo women walking their dogs found the dead bear and alerted authorities, touching off a mystery that captivated the city for a few days. Bears are not among the park's known wildlife population.\n\nThe bike was dusted for prints and the animal sent to Albany for a necropsy, which determined the bear was likely hit by a vehicle and was not a victim of animal cruelty. But how the bear ended up in Central Park remained a mystery.\n\n\"I was worried because my prints were all over that bike,\" Kennedy tells Barr in the video.", "source": {"uri": "register-herald.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Beckley Register-Herald"}, "authors": [{"uri": "associated_press@register-herald.com", "name": "Associated Press", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "jonathan_j_cooper@register-herald.com", "name": "Jonathan J.

Kennedy, Jr. admitted to dumping the body of a bear cub in New York City's Central Park in 2014 -- an incident that caused a police animal cruelty investigation but was never solved.\n\nIn the video, Kennedy tells comedian Roseanne Barr the incident began when he was driving to meet people to go falconing in Goshen, New York. As he was driving through the Hudson Valley, he saw a woman in front of him hit a \"young bear\" with her van.\n\n\"I pulled over, I picked up the bear and put it in the back of my van. Because I was going to skin the bear, and it was in very good condition. And I was going to put the meat in my refrigerator. You can do that in New York -- you can get a bear tag for a roadkill bear.\"\n\nIn reports from 2014, NYPD investigators described the animal as a \"black bear cub\" that was only about three feet long.\n\nKennedy said he continued with his day -- falconing in the Hudson Valley -- before going straight to dinner at Peter Luger Steak House (he did not specify if he had dinner at the pricey steakhouse's historic Williamsburg, Brooklyn location or the institution's Great Neck, Long Island outpost). He forgot about the bear until later that night -- after he realized he needed to board a flight and couldn't drop the bear off at home.\n\nInstead, Kennedy devised a strange scheme to dump the animal in Central Park.\n\nTrump Drinks the Anti-Vaxx Kool-Aid in Leaked Chat With RFK. Jr.\n\n\"There'd been a series of bicycle accidents in New York, they had just put in the bike lanes,\" Kennedy said. \"I saw a couple of people had gotten killed, and it was every day and people had been badly injured. Every day it was in the press. So I thought -- I wasn't drinking of course, but people were drinking with me who thought this was a good idea... I had an old bike in my car that somebody had asked me to get rid of. I said, let's go put the bear in Central Park and we'll make it look like he got hit by a bike.\"\n\nThe blue-blooded scion of one of America's most prominent political dynasties claimed the plan was inspired by \"the little bit of the redneck in me.\"\n\nLaughing, Kennedy said his companions thought it was a \"great idea,\" and thought it would be \"amusing.\"\n\nMeanwhile, a dog walker in Central Park discovered the bear's corpse near West 69th Street on Monday, October 6, 2014. The dog walker, identified as 79-year-old Florence Slatkin by the New York Daily News, called the discovery \"shocking.\"\n\nThe NYPD opened an investigation and shipped the bear cub's body to a lab in Albany, which determined it died from \"blunt force injuries consistent with a motor vehicle collision,\" according to the New York Times. A bear researcher interviewed by the paper accurately guessed that someone likely brought the cub's body from outside the city.\n\nThe story was quickly picked up by other major papers and television stations in the tri-state area. Kennedy said he saw these reports the next day and thought \"Oh my God, what did I do?\"\n\nIt is not immediately clear why Kennedy decided to come clean about the bear cub almost a decade after the news broke.\n\nThe independent presidential candidate said he was getting ahead of the story after he was contacted by New Yorker fact checkers -- who questioned him about the bear.\n\nGet the Daily Beast's biggest scoops and scandals delivered right to your inbox.

Kennedy appeared to fess up to being one of the culprits who dumped a dead bear cub in Central Park a decade ago - after abandoning a plan to skin it, the New York Post reports.\n\nSeemingly trying to pre-empt a forthcoming story from the New Yorker magazine, Kennedy, 70, bizarrely recounted in a video posted to social media how some of his buddies were drinking and thought it would be a good idea to dump the dead bear off in the park and \"make it look like he got hit by a bike.\"\n\nThe Kennedy scion insisted that he wasn't drinking when he opted to put an \"old bike in his car\" - that someone asked him to throw away - next to the deceased animal.\n\nThere had been a spate of local biking accidents that were making headlines at the time.\n\n\"Everybody thought that's a great idea. So we went and did that and thought it would be amusing for whoever found it,\" Kennedy recounted in a video posted on X that featured sitcom actor Roseanne Barr.\n\nA media frenzy quickly ensued in 2014 after a woman discovered the dead bear under some bushes concealed in part by a bike.\n\nThe bear was described in reports at the time as a cub, though Kennedy simply called it \"a young bear.\"\n\n\"I turned on the TV and there was like a mile of yellow tape, and there were 20 cop cars,\" he said.\n\n\"There were like helicopters flying over it.

But the falconing trip ran late.\n\nHe then had to dash over to New York City instead of heading back to his home in Westchester County due to a dinner that he needed to attend. At that point, he realised he needed to go to the airport, but had the dead bear in his car.\n\nAll of this prompted his decision to dump the dead bear in Central Park.\n\n\"This was the little bit of the redneck in me,\" Kennedy quipped.\n\nHe predicted the forthcoming reporting about his handling of the dead bear would be negative.\n\nKennedy is averaging 5.5 per cent in presidential polls compared to former President Donald Trump's 44.6 per cent and Vice President Kamala Harris' 44.8 per cent support in the latest RealClearPolitics aggregate of a five-way national race.\n\nFor context, the RCP aggregate had him at 8.7 per cent, President Biden at 39.2 per cent and Mr Trump at 43.4 per cent.", "source": {"uri": "news.com.au", "dataType": "news", "title": "News.com.au"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_F._Kennedy", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Robert F.

He says he was heading to a falconry excursion with friends when a woman driving ahead of him hit and killed the young bear with her vehicle. He says he put it in his own vehicle, intending to skin it and eat the meat, but the day got away from him.\n\nEventually, he says, he was in Manhattan and needed to get the bear carcass out of his vehicle. His friends, fueled by alcohol, concocted the Central Park plan as a prank, he said, adding he was not drunk himself. At the time, bicycle accidents were getting significant media attention, so Kennedy and his friends thought it would be funny to make it look like the bear was hit by a bicycle.\n\nTwo women walking their dogs found the dead bear and alerted authorities, touching off a mystery that captivated the city for a few days. Bears are not among the park's known wildlife population.\n\nThe bike was dusted for prints and the animal sent to Albany for a necropsy, which determined the bear was likely hit by a vehicle and was not a victim of animal cruelty. But how the bear ended up in Central Park remained a mystery. \"I was worried because my prints were all over that bike,\" Kennedy tells Barr in the video.", "source": {"uri": "news18.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "News18"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_F._Kennedy", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "John F.

He says that he was driving through the Hudson Valley when he saw a woman in a van hit and kill a young bear.\n\n\"I pulled over and I picked up the bear and put him in the back of my van because I was going to skin the bear,\" he says. \"It was very good condition and I was going to put the meat in my refrigerator.\"\n\nMr. Kennedy then details how he had to attend a dinner at Peter Luger Steak House in New York City and then head to the airport, which meant he had to get rid of the bear. He decided to leave the bear in Central Park with an old bicycle to make it look like it had been hit by the bike.\n\nMr. Kennedy says that he was worried when officials investigated the crime scene, \"because my prints were all over that bike.\"\n\nMs. Barr listens closely to the story, laughing and looking shocked. Mr. Kennedy tells her that fact checkers from The New Yorker asked him about the story: \"It's going to be a bad story.\"\n\nIndeed, the bear cub caused quite a stir when it was found in the park in 2014, as reported in The New York Times in an article coincidentally written by Tatiana Schlossberg, a reporter for The Times at that time, and the daughter of Mr. Kennedy's first cousin Caroline Kennedy. A woman was walking her dog in Central Park when she noticed it lying under some bushes, partly concealed by an abandoned bicycle. The cub was 6 months old and 44 pounds.\n\nThe state's Department of Environmental Conservation later found through a necropsy that the cause of death was \"blunt force injuries consistent with a motor vehicle collision.\"\n\nMr. Kennedy did not appear to confess that he was behind the incident until now. He tried to explain the unusual circumstances to Ms. Barr: \"This was a little bit of the redneck in me.\"", "source": {"uri": "nytimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New York Times"}, "authors": [{"uri": "emma_g_fitzsimmons@nytimes.com", "name": "Emma G.

Become an Insider and start reading now. Have an account? Log in.\n\nIn New York, hunters are allowed to take one bear a year as long as it is appropriately reported to authorities and tagged -- though residents are not allowed to intentionally kill a bear cub.\n\n\"I was driving up really early, and a woman in a van in front of me hit the bear and killed it, a young bear. So I pulled over, and I picked up the bear and put him in the back of my van,\" Kennedy said to actress Roseanne Barr in a video on X.\n\nKennedy later realized, after driving around with the bear in his trunk for hours, that he had to go to the airport.\n\n\"I didn't want to leave the bear in the car because that would have been bad,\" he said in the video.\n\nHe then said his friends, who had been drinking, encouraged him to abandon the carcass in Central Park in New York. Kennedy said he was sober but decided to go along with the plan.\n\nTo dispose of the carcass, Kennedy said he intentionally left the dead bear on the side of the road to make it appear like a car had hit the bear. Kennedy said he had also left a bicycle near the bear.\n\n\"We thought it would be amusing for whoever found it,\" Kennedy said.\n\nKennedy said that he believed the story would go away, but instead, it became national news after a woman walking her dog discovered the animal. \"Luckily, the story died after a while, and it stayed dead for a decade,\" he said.\n\nA 2014 New York Times story appears to detail the incident though the exact timeline is unclear. Per the Times, a woman \"noticed the dead bear cub, which was lying under some bushes, partially concealed by an abandoned bicycle.\"\n\nIronically, the author of the Times story, Tatiana Schlossberg, is John F. Kennedy's granddaughter. This makes Schlossberg and Kennedy, JFK's nephew, cousins.\n\nKennedy said he chose to reveal that he and his friends were behind the dumping to get ahead of a New Yorker story detailing the incident.\n\n\"The New Yorker somehow found out about it, and they're gonna do a big article on me, and that's one of the articles. So they asked me, the fact-checkers. It's gonna be a bad story,\" Kennedy said before he and Barr burst into laughter.\n\nThis isn't Kennedy's first controversy related to a dead animal carcass. The independent presidential candidate recently fought off claims that he barbecued and ate a dog.\n\nA representative for Kennedy's campaign did not immediately respond to a request for comment.", "source": {"uri": "businessinsider.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Business Insider"}, "authors": [{"uri": "hannah_getahun@businessinsider.com", "name": "Hannah Getahun", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_F._Kennedy", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "John F.

RFK Jr. Tells Bizarre Story About Leaving a Dead Bear in Central Park", "body": "The opinions expressed by contributors are their own and do not necessarily represent the views of RedState.com.\n\nDrama and intrigue have followed around the Kennedy family for many decades, but this has to be one of the strangest stories one of them has ever been involved with.\n\nRFK Jr. posted video to Twitter/X Sunday showing him telling comedienne Roseanne Barr that he knew who was responsible for the dead bear that was found in New York City's Central Park in 2014 -- himself. Really.\n\nThis is what he says happened:\n\n'A woman in the van in front of me hit a bear and killed it, a young bear,' he recalled. 'So I pulled over, and I picked up the bear and put him in the back of my van because I was going to skin the bear, and it was in very good condition, and I was going to put the meat in my refrigerator.\n\n'You can do that in New York state. You can get a bear tag for roadkill bear,' he said.\n\nOk, already an interesting if odd story. But it gets weirder. Much weirder:\n\nThe 70-year-old presidential candidate said he then proceeded to go hawking [a term for falconry] with the dead bear in his car.\n\nHe said they were catching a lot of game and stayed late, so instead of heading home to Westchester, NY he had to go straight to New York City for a dinner.\n\nBut then the dinner also went late, and according to Kennedy, he needed to go to the airport instead of his home.\n\n'The bear was in my car, and I didn't want to leave the bear in the car because that would have been bad,' Kennedy said.\n\nKennedy said there was 'a little bit of the redneck in me' when he explained there had been a series of bicycle accidents in the city and multiple people had gotten killed or badly injured.\n\nKennedy recalled it was in the press every day and that he also had an old bike in his car someone asked him to get rid of.\n\n'I said let's go put the bear in Central Park, and we'll make it look like it got hit by a bike,' Kennedy said as he and Barr laughed. 'So everybody thought that's a great idea.'\n\nKennedy said he had not been drinking when the decision was made but others had been.\n\nMaybe you weren't drinking, RFK, but were you doing something else? Because these are some odd decisions.\n\nWatch:\n\nHe reportedly referenced the New Yorker in the above tweet because they found out about the story and are writing it up, and RFK thinks \"It's going to be a bad article.\" It would appear that he's trying to get ahead of the negative press by telling Barr this wild tale.\n\nMore RFK: RFK Jr.'s Reaction to Trump Conviction? 'You Can't Save Democracy by Destroying It First'\n\nRFK Jr. Offers Wild Deal to Biden: 'Whomever Is Least Likely to Beat Donald Trump Will Withdraw'\n\nThe discovery of the deceased bear caused quite the stir in the Big Apple at the time, but the mystery remained unsolved:\n\nKennedy said in his video that the next day after leaving the dead bear in the park, it was on every television station and in every paper.\n\n'I turned on the TV and it was like, mile of yellow tape, and there were 20 cop cars. There were helicopters flying over it,' Kennedy said. 'I was like \"oh my god. What did I do?\"'\n\nKennedy said he was worried because his prints were all over the bike. But Kennedy said the story died after a while and 'it stayed dead for a decade.'\n\nBut wait -- there's more! Guess who wrote up the story in 2014? You can't make this stuff up.\n\nNow we know why there was a dead bear in Central Park. Unknown: how this will affect his presidential campaign. My guess is -- it won't help.", "source": {"uri": "redstate.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Redstate"}, "authors": [{"uri": "bob_hoge@redstate.com", "name": "Bob Hoge", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_F._Kennedy", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Robert F.

Kennedy Jr. once retrieved a bear that was killed by a motorist and left it in New York's Central Park with a bicycle on top, sparking a mystery that consumed the city a decade ago.\n\nKennedy describes the incident in a video that was posted to social media Sunday, adding it will be included in a forthcoming New Yorker article that he expects to be damaging.\n\nIt's the latest bizarre incident in Kennedy's quixotic campaign that has divided his famous family and left Republicans and Democrats alike concerned about his potential impact on the presidential contest. Kennedy has acknowledged a parasite that lodged in his brain and died. He denied eating a dog after a friend shared a photo with Vanity Fair magazine showing Kennedy dramatically preparing to take a bite of a charred animal; Kennedy said it was a goat.\n\nIn the video, Kennedy recounts the story to actress Roseanne Barr. He says he was heading to a falconry excursion with friends when a woman driving ahead of him hit and killed the young bear with her vehicle. He says he put it in his own vehicle, intending to skin it and eat the meat, but the day got away from him.\n\nEventually, he says, he was in Manhattan and needed to get the bear carcass out of his vehicle. His friends, fueled by alcohol, concocted the Central Park plan as a prank, he said, adding he was not drunk himself. At the time, bicycle accidents were getting significant media attention, so Kennedy and his friends thought it would be funny to make it look like the bear was hit by a bicycle.\n\nTwo women walking their dogs found the dead bear and alerted authorities, touching off a mystery that captivated the city for a few days. Bears are not among the park's known wildlife population.\n\nThe bike was dusted for prints and the animal sent to Albany for a necropsy, which determined the bear was likely hit by a vehicle and was not a victim of animal cruelty.

Kennedy said he picked up the bear and put it in his car with the intention of skinning it and putting its meat in his refrigerator, but had a dinner back in New York City that ran late and had to travel to the airport right after.\n\nSo Kennedy told Barr he and a group of people he was having dinner with hatched an idea to put the bear in Central Park and have it look like it had been hit by a bike.\n\n\"This was the little bit of redneck in me,\" Kennedy said in the video.\n\n\"We thought it would be amusing for whoever found it or something,\" Kennedy said. \"The next day, it was on every television station, it was the front page of every paper.\"\n\nKennedy said police said at the time they were going to take the bicycle up to Albany, New York to get fingerprinted, which would have had his prints on it.\n\n\"Luckily, the story died down after a while and it stayed dead for a decade,\" Kennedy said.\n\nFact check: No, RFK Jr did not end news conference when asked if he was confused\n\nThe video was apparently released to get ahead of a \"bad story\" by the New Yorker, Kennedy said, adding the outlet had found out about the incident.\n\nKennedy captioned the video on X, \"Looking forward to seeing how you spin this one,\" and tagged the publication.\n\nIn a strange twist of events, a reporter who first covered the story for the New York Times when the bear was found in 2014 was Tatiana Schlossberg, Kennedy's second cousin and the daughter of Caroline Kennedy, the outlet reported.\n\nNew York's Department of Environmental Conservation said a necropsy showed that the bear's cause of death was \"blunt force injuries consistent with a motor vehicle collision,\" Schlossberg had reported.\n\nAfter the news broke Sunday, Schlossberg told the New York Times that, \"Like law enforcement, I had no idea who was responsible for this when I wrote the story.\"", "source": {"uri": "ca.news.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Park", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Central Park"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_F._Kennedy", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "John F.

Kennedy Share Wild Story On How Got Rid Of A Bear Cub In A Park", "body": "Are you interested in hearing a wild hunting story? Well buckle up, because Robert F. Kennedy has a doozy.\n\nThe presidential candidate and environmental lawyer released a video earlier today with Roseanna Barr in which he recounted how he came into the possession of a bear cub. In 2014, he was on a falconry trip in Goshen, NY (which means you're learning about or hunting with falcons), when a woman in the car in front of him hit what he called \"A young bear.\"\n\nApparently, you can legally obtain a bear tag and use it on a roadkill bear, which is what Kennedy planned on doing.\n\n\"So I pulled over and I picked up the bear and put him in the back of my van because I was going to skin the bear and it was very good condition and I was going to put the meat in my refrigerator,\" he said.\n\nThe day continued without a hitch, but it ran later than Kennedy expected. As such, Kennedy had to rush to a dinner in Westchester County - with the bear in his truck.\n\nNot a huge deal - unless the dinner runs late and you immediately have to go to the airport right after. That left Kennedy no easy way to deal with the bear, so he took some sketchy advice from a friend on how to get rid of it.\n\nAt the time, there were lots of bicycle crashes happening in the area, so Kennedy decided to use that to his advantage, and he staged an accident of his own.\n\n\"Everybody thought that's a great idea. So we went and did that and thought it would be amusing for whoever found it,\" Kennedy said.\n\nEventually, a woman discovered the dead bear under some bushes concealed in part by a bike. The story immediately made headlines.\n\n\"I turned on the TV and there was like a mile of yellow tape, and there were 20 cop cars. There were like helicopters flying over it. And I was like 'Oh, my God, what did I do?'\" he said. \"I was worried because my [finger]prints were all over that bike. Luckily the story died after a while.\"\n\nHowever, \"The New Yorker\" evidently got word of it, and was reportedly planning on releasing the story. Kennedy wanted to get out ahead of it and get on the offensive in the PR campaign.\n\nI guess the lesson here is that you have to quickly take care of the carcasses you obtain on your falconry trip. Otherwise, you could end up having a bear of an evening.", "source": {"uri": "outkick.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "OutKick"}, "authors": [{"uri": "john_simmons@outkick.com", "name": "John Simmons", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_F._Kennedy", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "John F.

You can get a bear tag for roadkill bear,\" Kennedy, 70, says in a gravelly voice.\n\nBut the falconing field trip ran late, so he could not get the remains back to his home in Westchester County.\n\nSo did a dinner he attended that evening in the Big Apple, and Kennedy realized he would have to go straight to the airport for a flight he was due to take.\n\n\"The bear was in my car, and I didn't want to leave the bear in the car because that would have been bad,\" he says.\n\nAfter Kennedy and company brainstormed, they took the carcass to iconic Central Park and left it under an old bicycle Kennedy had in his car.\n\nKennedy said the plan was to make it look like a cyclist had killed the animal, an admission that drew laughter from people in the video.\n\n\"I wasn't drinking, of course, but people were drinking with me who thought this was a good idea,\" he says.\n\n\"Then I thought, you know, at that time this was the little bit of the redneck in me,\" the son of the late Robert F. Kennedy adds.\n\nWhen the animal's body was eventually found it became a huge news story.\n\n\"And I was like, 'Oh my God, what did I do?'\" Kennedy says, adding: \"I was worried because my prints were all over that bike.\"\n\nHe said the story remained dormant for a decade until a fact-checker from The New Yorker called to verify it for a feature on Kennedy. The piece has yet to be published.\n\n\"It's going to be a bad story,\" Kennedy forecasts with a laugh.\n\ndw/mlm", "source": {"uri": "ccenterdispatch.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Clay Center Dispatch On-Line"}, "authors": [{"uri": "agence_france_presse@ccenterdispatch.com", "name": "Agence France-Presse", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Park", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Central Park"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_F._Kennedy", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "John F.

Kennedy Jr., the independent presidential candidate, confessed on Sunday that he had left a dead bear cub in Central Park in Manhattan in 2014 because he thought it would be \"amusing.\"\n\nMr. Kennedy posted a video detailing the bizarre story on social media apparently ahead of an article in The New Yorker.\n\n\"Looking forward to seeing how you spin this one,\" he said, tagging the magazine.\n\nIn the video, Mr. Kennedy appears to be seated in a kitchen as he casually tells the actress Roseanne Barr about the ordeal. He says that he was driving through the Hudson Valley when he saw a woman in a van hit and kill a young bear.\n\n\"I pulled over and I picked up the bear and put him in the back of my van because I was going to skin the bear,\" he says. \"It was in very good condition and I was going to put the meat in my refrigerator.\"\n\nMr. Kennedy then details how he had to attend a dinner at Peter Luger Steak House in New York City and then head to the airport, which meant he had to get rid of the bear. He decided to leave the bear in Central Park with an old bicycle to make it look like it had been hit by the bike.\n\nHere's the video in which he relates the story to, yes, that Roseanne Barr. The story does appear to have a ring of truth to it. Ten years ago, a dead bear cub was indeed found in Central Park with a bike that had been killed by a car (the. bear, not the bike). So either the story is true or RFK is pulling off one of the best trolls in some time.\n\nHonestly, as riveting as RFK, Jr's story is, he doesn't really have great comedic timing. I much prefer the version of this story told by Woody Allen:\n\nHowever, it does confirm something I have long suspected.

Kennedy has acknowledged a parasite that lodged in his brain and died. He denied eating a dog after a friend shared a photo with Vanity Fair magazine showing Kennedy dramatically preparing to take a bite of a charred animal; Kennedy said it was a goat.\n\nIn the video, Kennedy recounts the story to actress Roseanne Barr. He says he was heading to a falconry excursion with friends when a woman driving ahead of him hit and killed the young bear with her vehicle. He says he put it in his own vehicle, intending to skin it and eat the meat, but the day got away from him.\n\nEventually, he says, he was in Manhattan and needed to get the bear carcass out of his vehicle. His friends, fueled by alcohol, concocted the Central Park plan as a prank, he said, adding he was not drunk himself. At the time, bicycle accidents were getting significant media attention, so Kennedy and his friends thought it would be funny to make it look like the bear was hit by a bicycle.\n\nTwo women walking their dogs found the dead bear and alerted authorities, touching off a mystery that captivated the city for a few days. Bears are not among the park's known wildlife population.\n\nThe bike was dusted for prints and the animal sent to Albany for a necropsy, which determined the bear was likely hit by a vehicle and was not a victim of animal cruelty. But how the bear ended up in Central Park remained a mystery.\n\n\"I was worried because my prints were all over that bike,\" Kennedy tells Barr in the video.", "source": {"uri": "nationalnewswatch.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "National Newswatch"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_F._Kennedy", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "John F.

Kennedy Jr. disclosed that he dumped a dead bear in New York City's Central Park nearly a decade ago. The admission, highlighted by Politico, came in a video released on social media Sunday afternoon, where Kennedy recounted the incident to actress Roseanne Barr.\n\nKennedy's decision to share this story appears to be preemptive, as he suggested in the video that he was addressing the incident ahead of a pending story in the New Yorker, which had inquired about it.\n\nAccording to Kennedy, he did not kill the bear but found it already deceased, hit by another driver, during a falconing expedition in the Hudson Valley.\n\nHe initially planned to take the bear home to skin it but ended up driving directly to a dinner at Peter Luger Steak House in New York City. Faced with the dilemma of what to do with the bear carcass before heading to the airport, Kennedy decided to leave it in Central Park alongside an abandoned bicycle.\n\nThe story aligns with an incident reported by The New York Times in October 2014, where a dead bear was discovered in Central Park near an abandoned bicycle. At the time, the circumstances surrounding the bear's death and its appearance in the park were not publicly known.\n\nKennedy claimed he planted the bear with the bicycle to fit a narrative about a series of bike accidents in the city. He admitted to feeling nervous when the story was featured on \"every television station,\" fearing he might be linked to the incident. \"Luckily the story died after a while, and it stayed dead for a decade, and the New Yorker somehow found out about it,\" Kennedy stated in the video.\n\nThis unusual revelation comes at a time when Kennedy's presidential campaign has been facing challenges, with his poll numbers declining since President Joe Biden's exit from the race last month. It adds to a series of strange stories surrounding Kennedy, including a previous claim made during divorce proceedings that a worm had eaten part of his brain.", "source": {"uri": "alternet.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "Alternet.org"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_F._Kennedy", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "John F.

Now he's back with another doozy: about leaving a dead bear cub in New York's Central Park.\n\nThe independent presidential candidate, conspiracy theorist and anti-vaccine activist made the disclosure in a three-minute video posted Aug 4 on social media as he apparently tried to get out ahead of a New Yorker magazine story that mentions the weird tale of roadkill and stealth from a decade ago.\n\nIn the video shot at what looked like a post-meal chat with people including sitcom actress Roseanne Barr, Mr Kennedy recounts the saga: He and friends were on a falconing excursion in New York state in 2014, Mr Kennedy says, when a van ahead of him hit and killed a six-month-old black bear.\n\nThe scion of America's most prominent political family, eager to salvage the corpse for the meat, put it in the back of his own vehicle.\n\n\"And you can do that in New York state. You can get a bear tag for roadkill bear,\" Mr Kennedy, 70, says in a gravelly voice.\n\nBut the falconing field trip ran late, so he could not get the remains back to his home in Westchester County.\n\nSo did a dinner he attended that evening in the Big Apple, and Mr Kennedy realised he would have to go straight to the airport for a flight he was due to take.\n\n\"The bear was in my car, and I didn't want to leave the bear in the car because that would have been bad,\" he says.\n\nAfter Mr Kennedy and company brainstormed, they took the carcass to iconic Central Park and left it under an old bicycle Mr Kennedy had in his car.\n\nMr Kennedy said the plan was to make it look like a cyclist had killed the animal, an admission that drew laughter from people in the video.\n\n\"I wasn't drinking, of course, but people were drinking with me who thought this was a good idea,\" he says.\n\n\"Then I thought, you know, at that time this was the little bit of the redneck in me,\" the son of the late Robert F. Kennedy adds.\n\nWhen the animal's body was eventually found it became a huge news story.\n\n\"And I was like, 'Oh my God, what did I do?'\" Mr Kennedy says, adding: \"I was worried because my prints were all over that bike.\"\n\nHe said the story remained dormant for a decade until a fact-checker from The New Yorker called to verify it for a feature on Mr Kennedy. The piece has yet to be published.\n\n\"It's going to be a bad story,\" Mr Kennedy forecasts with a laugh.

Kennedy Jr said in a video posted online on Sunday that he dumped a dead bear in New York City's Central Park a decade ago and staged it to look like a bike had hit it.\n\nKennedy suggested in the video, which was posted on social media platform X, that he is trying to get ahead of a not-yet-published story from the New Yorker.\n\n\"Looking forward to seeing how you spin this one, @NewYorker...\" Kennedy posted on his X account with a video of himself at a kitchen table talking to comedian Roseanne Barr.\n\nKennedy said in the video that he was driving to the Hudson Valley in New York state when a woman in a van in front of him hit a young bear and killed it. He put the bear's body into the back of his car because he was going to skin the bear and store its meat at his house, he said.\n\nBut after a late dinner in New York City at the Peter Luger Steak House, he had to go straight to the airport and did not want to leave the bear in his vehicle.\n\n\"I had an old bike in my car that somebody asked me to get rid of. I said, 'Let's go put the bear in Central Park and we'll make it look like he got hit by a bike,'\" he said and then laughed, saying it would be \"amusing\" for whoever found it.\n\nThe Kennedy campaign did not immediately comment further on the incident.\n\nIn October 2014, the body of a black bear cub was found in the bushes of Central Park and police launched a criminal investigation into the death.\n\nFoul play was suspected in the case, Reuters reported at the time, and state wildlife officials later concluded it was likely struck and killed by a vehicle.\n\nKennedy said in the video that the New Yorker had asked him about the incident and was planning on doing a \"big article\" about him.\n\nThe New Yorker did not immediately respond to an emailed request for comment.\n\nIn a recent Reuters/Ipsos poll, Kennedy was favored by 8% of voters. He has yet to qualify for the ballot in many states ahead of the Nov. 5 election.\n\n(Reporting by Stephanie Kelly; Editing by Noeleen Walder and Muralikumar Anantharaman)", "source": {"uri": "usnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "U.S. News & World Report"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Park", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Central Park"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_F._Kennedy", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "John F.

He says he pulled over to put the bear in his vehicle.\n\n\"I was going to skin the bear - and it was in very good condition - and I was going to put the meat in my refrigerator,\" he says. \"And you can do that in New York state: Get a bear tag for a roadkill bear.\"\n\nNew York state does allow people to take bears killed on roads, but the law stipulates that a person has to notify law enforcement or the state's Department of Environmental Conservation to acquire such a tag.\n\nMr Kennedy does not appear to have done that.\n\nInstead, he says he continued to his falconing venture, which went late into the evening. He says he went on to a dinner reservation he had at Peter Luger Steakhouse in New York City, about 75 miles (121km) south of Goshen.\n\n\"At the end of the dinner, it was late and I realised I couldn't go home,\" Mr Kennedy says. \"I had to go to the airport, and the bear was in my car, and I didn't want to leave the bear in my car because that would have been bad.\"\n\nThat is when, he says, it occurred to him that there had been a series of bicycle accidents in New York and that he had an old bicycle in his car.\n\nHe tells Ms Barr that he had the idea of staging a bike accident with the bear carcass in Central Park, which several drunk people with him heartily endorsed. He emphasises that he had not been drinking.\n\n\"So we did that and we thought it would be amusing for whoever found it or something,\" he says. \"The next day... it was on every television station. It was a front page of every paper and I turned on the TV and there was like a mile of yellow tape and 20 cop cars, there were helicopters flying, and I was like, 'Oh my god. What did I do?'\"\n\nHe then notes that a factchecker from The New Yorker had called him and asked whether he was involved in dumping the bear's body, which appears to have prompted him to release this video.\n\nThe bear's corpse was discovered by a woman walking her dog in the famous New York City park where bears are an unusual sight, according to a 2014 story written by the New York Times. It had been placed under some bushes and an abandoned bicycle, the story says.\n\nThe paper noted, at the time, that the New York Police Department's Animal Cruelty Investigation Squad was looking into the bear's death, and the New York Department of Environmental Conservation had concluded that the animal had been killed in a \"motor vehicle collision\" - not a bike accident.\n\nThe New York Police Department and Department of Environmental Conservation did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nThe New York Times story notes how puzzling the 2014 incident was to those who followed the case: \"But so many questions remain unanswered: How did the bear end up in Central Park? Was there foul play involved? Did she die in the park, or was she dumped there?\"\n\nIn a twist, that decade-old newspaper story was coincidentally written by another member of the famous Kennedy family - Tatiana Schlossberg, a former New York Times journalist who is the granddaughter of US President John F Kennedy.\n\nMs Schlossberg did not immediately respond to a request for comment about her relative, though many members of the Kennedy family have disavowed Mr Kennedy's actions and his campaign for president.\n\nMr Kennedy's bizarre confession comes as his 2024 campaign for president appears to be struggling.\n\nWith Vice-President Kamala Harris entering the race after President Joe Biden announced his decision to step aside, polls indicate that Mr Kennedy's support has dwindled to the single digits.\n\nA scion of America's most famous political family, Mr Kennedy has struggled to raise money and slowed his campaigning in recent weeks.\n\nThose issues have coincided with a series of blunders that have fuelled speculation that the US politician might drop out, though he has insisted that he will not exit the race.", "source": {"uri": "the-star.co.ke", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Star"}, "authors": [{"uri": "https@the-star.co.ke", "name": "https", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roseanne_Barr", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Roseanne Barr"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_F._Kennedy", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Robert F.

You can get a bear tag for roadkill bear,\" Kennedy, 70, says in a gravelly voice.\n\nBut the falconing field trip ran late, so he could not get the remains back to his home in Westchester County.\n\nSo did a dinner he attended that evening in the Big Apple, and Kennedy realized he would have to go straight to the airport for a flight he was due to take.\n\n\"The bear was in my car, and I didn't want to leave the bear in the car because that would have been bad,\" he says.\n\nAfter Kennedy and company brainstormed, they took the carcass to iconic Central Park and left it under an old bicycle Kennedy had in his car.\n\nKennedy said the plan was to make it look like a cyclist had killed the animal, an admission that drew laughter from people in the video.\n\n\"I wasn't drinking, of course, but people were drinking with me who thought this was a good idea,\" he says.\n\n\"Then I thought, you know, at that time this was the little bit of the redneck in me,\" the son of the late Robert F.

You can get a bear tag for roadkill bear,\" Kennedy, 70, says in a gravelly voice.\n\nBut the falconing field trip ran late, so he could not get the remains back to his home in Westchester County.\n\nSo did a dinner he attended that evening in the Big Apple, and Kennedy realized he would have to go straight to the airport for a flight he was due to take.\n\n\"The bear was in my car, and I didn't want to leave the bear in the car because that would have been bad,\" he says.\n\nAfter Kennedy and company brainstormed, they took the carcass to iconic Central Park and left it under an old bicycle Kennedy had in his car.\n\nMore from this section Sicily's Catania airport back in service after Etna activity Nintendo first-quarter net profit sinks as Switch sales slow Putin vows support to North Korea after devastating floods\n\nKennedy said the plan was to make it look like a cyclist had killed the animal, an admission that drew laughter from people in the video.\n\n\"I wasn't drinking, of course, but people were drinking with me who thought this was a good idea,\" he says.\n\n\"Then I thought, you know, at that time this was the little bit of the redneck in me,\" the son of the late Robert F.

He says he pulled over to put the bear in his vehicle.\n\n\"I was going to skin the bear - and it was in very good condition - and I was going to put the meat in my refrigerator,\" he says. \"And you can do that in New York state: Get a bear tag for a roadkill bear.\"\n\nNew York state does allow people to take bears killed on roads, but the law stipulates that a person has to notify law enforcement or the state's Department of Environmental Conservation to acquire such a tag.\n\nMr Kennedy does not appear to have done that.\n\nInstead, he says he continued to his falconing venture, which went late into the evening. He says he went on to a dinner reservation he had at Peter Luger Steakhouse in New York City, about 75 miles (121km) south of Goshen.\n\n\"At the end of the dinner, it was late and I realised I couldn't go home,\" Mr Kennedy says. \"I had to go to the airport, and the bear was in my car, and I didn't want to leave the bear in my car because that would have been bad.\"\n\nThat is when, he says, it occurred to him that there had been a series of bicycle accidents in New York and that he had an old bicycle in his car.\n\nHe tells Ms Barr that he had the idea of staging a bike accident with the bear carcass in Central Park, which several drunk people with him heartily endorsed. He emphasises that he had not been drinking.\n\n\"So we did that and we thought it would be amusing for whoever found it or something,\" he says. \"The next day... it was on every television station. It was a front page of every paper and I turned on the TV and there was like a mile of yellow tape and 20 cop cars, there were helicopters flying, and I was like, 'Oh my god. What did I do?'\"\n\nHe then notes that a factchecker from The New Yorker had called him and asked whether he was involved in dumping the bear's body, which appears to have prompted him to release this video.\n\nThe bear's corpse was discovered by a woman walking her dog in the famous New York City park, according to a 2014 story written by the New York Times. It had been placed under some bushes and an abandoned bicycle, the story says.\n\nThe paper noted, at the time, that the New York Police Department's Animal Cruelty Investigation Squad was looking into the bear's death, and the New York Department of Environmental Conservation had concluded that the animal had been killed in a \"motor vehicle collision\" - not a bike accident.\n\nThe New York Police Department and Department of Environmental Conservation did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nThe New York Times story notes how puzzling the 2014 incident was to those who followed the case: \"But so many questions remain unanswered: How did the bear end up in Central Park? Was there foul play involved? Did she die in the park, or was she dumped there?\"\n\nIn a twist, that decade-old newspaper story was coincidentally written by another member of the famous Kennedy family - Tatiana Schlossberg, a former New York Times journalist who is the granddaughter of US President John F Kennedy.\n\nMs Schlossberg did not immediately respond to a request for comment about her relative, though many members of the Kennedy family have disavowed Mr Kennedy's actions and his campaign for president.\n\nMr Kennedy's bizarre confession comes as his 2024 campaign for president appears to be struggling.\n\nWith Vice-President Kamala Harris entering the race after President Joe Biden announced his decision to step aside, polls indicate that Mr Kennedy's support has dwindled to the single digits.\n\nA scion of America's most famous political family, Mr Kennedy has struggled to raise money and slowed his campaigning in recent weeks.\n\nThose issues have coincided with a series of blunders that have fuelled speculation that the US politician might drop out, though he has insisted that he will not exit the race.", "source": {"uri": "ca.news.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roseanne_Barr", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Roseanne Barr"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New York (state)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_F._Kennedy", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "John F.

According to Kennedy, doctors believe that the worm died in his head and it's still in there today. I bring up Kennedy's worm-brain because a minor New York City mystery has been solved. In 2014, a dead bear cub was found in Central Park and no one knew WTF had happened or who put a dead bear cub in the park.

Kennedy Jr., the independent presidential candidate, confessed on Sunday that he had left a dead bear cub in Central Park in Manhattan in 2014 because he thought it would be \"amusing.\" Mr. Kennedy posted a video detailing the bizarre story on social media apparently ahead of an article in The New Yorker. \"Looking forward to seeing how you spin this one,\" he said, tagging the magazine.\n\nIn the video, Mr. Kennedy appears to be seated in a kitchen as he casually tells the actress Roseanne Barr about the ordeal. He says that he was driving through the Hudson Valley when he saw a woman in a van hit and kill a young bear.\n\n\"I pulled over and I picked up the bear and put him in the back of my van because I was going to skin the bear,\" he says. \"It was very good condition and I was going to put the meat in my refrigerator.\"\n\nMr. Kennedy then details how he had to attend a dinner at Peter Luger Steak House in New York City and then head to the airport, which meant he had to get rid of the bear. He decided to leave the bear in Central Park with an old bicycle to make it look like it had been hit by the bike. Mr. Kennedy says that he was worried when officials investigated the crime scene, \"because my prints were all over that bike.\"\n\nMs. Barr listens closely to the story, laughing and looking shocked. Mr. Kennedy tells her that fact checkers from The New Yorker asked him about the story: \"It's going to be a bad story.\"\n\n[From The NYT]\n\nOne morning, I came back home from a hike and someone had hit a deer and the fresh deer corpse was on my property. You know what I did NOT do? I did not try to move the deer myself, nor did I put the deer in my car and take the deer carcass to a second location. I looked up and called wildlife services/animal control and let them handle it. Civilians are not supposed to handle dead wildlife! What the actual f-k is this story?? Why Rosanne Barr? Did Kennedy's worm-brain tell him to pick up a dead bear cub??", "source": {"uri": "celebitchy.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Celebitchy"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Worm", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Worm"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Park", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Central Park"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Brain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ken_Anderson_(wrestler)", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Ken Anderson (wrestler)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_F._Kennedy_Jr.", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Robert F.

Kennedy Jr, Cropped by Resist the Mainstream\n\nRobert F. Kennedy Jr., the 70-year-old presidential candidate, has admitted to his involvement in a decade-old mystery that captivated New York City.\n\nKennedy recently disclosed that he was responsible for placing a dead bear in Central Park in October 2014, a stunt that sparked a massive police response and baffled investigators for years.\n\nSpeaking in a video with comedian Roseanne Barr, Kennedy recounted the bizarre series of events that led to the bear's placement in the park.\n\nThe incident began when he witnessed a woman in a van hit and kill a young bear on the road, according to Kennedy's account.\n\nKennedy, displaying what he described as \"a little bit of the redneck in me,\" decided to load the bear into his own van, initially intending to skin it and keep the meat.\n\n\"You can do that in New York State. You can get a bear tag for roadkill bear,\" Kennedy explained, attempting to justify his initial actions.\n\nThe situation, however, took an unexpected turn when Kennedy's plans changed.\n\nAfter a day of hawking and a late dinner in New York City, he needed to go to the airport with the bear still in his vehicle. Faced with this predicament and influenced by recent news of bicycle accidents in the city, Kennedy and his companions hatched a plan.\n\n\"I said let's go put the bear in Central Park, and we'll make it look like it got hit by a bike,\" Kennedy admitted, laughing alongside Barr.\n\nHe emphasized that while he hadn't been drinking, others involved in the decision had consumed alcohol.\n\nThe next morning, Kennedy awoke to find the story dominating news coverage.\n\n\"I turned on the TV and it was like, a mile of yellow tape, and there were 20 cop cars. There were helicopters flying over it,\" he recalled, expressing shock at the scale of the response.\n\nDaily Mail highlighted that at the time of the incident, the Department of Environmental Conservation (DEC) launched an investigation, concluding that the six-month-old bear had been run over and killed by a vehicle.\n\nThey were unable to determine how it ended up in Central Park, however. The case remained unsolved for a decade until Kennedy's recent confession.\n\nKennedy's admission appears to be preemptive, as he suggested the New Yorker magazine was planning to publish an article about the incident.\n\n\"It's going to be a bad article,\" Kennedy predicted, indicating his decision to come forward with the story himself.\n\nThe revelation raises questions about potential legal consequences. At the time of the incident, the DEC was investigating possible law violations, including illegal possession and disposing of an untagged bear.\n\nAs news of Kennedy's involvement spreads, it adds another layer of complexity to his presidential campaign. For example, Kennedy recently shocked the internet after he revealed doctors had once found a dead worm in his brain.\n\nWhile Kennedy attempts to frame the story with humor, the seriousness of interfering with a crime scene and misleading law enforcement may not be overlooked.", "source": {"uri": "resistthemainstream.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Resist the Mainstream"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jordyn_m@resistthemainstream.com", "name": "Jordyn M.", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_F._Kennedy_Jr.", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Robert F.

Kennedy Jr. is the subject of a forthcoming article in The New Yorker that tells the dead bear story. Steve Marcus/Las Vegas Sun via AP\n\nWILMINGTON, Del. -- Independent presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. once retrieved a bear that was killed by a motorist and left it in New York's Central Park with a bicycle on top, sparking a mystery that consumed the city a decade ago.\n\nKennedy describes the incident in a video that was posted to social media Sunday, adding it will be included in a forthcoming New Yorker article that he expects to be damaging.\n\nIt's the latest bizarre incident in Kennedy's quixotic campaign that has divided his famous family and left Republicans and Democrats alike concerned about his potential impact on the presidential contest. Kennedy has acknowledged a parasite that lodged in his brain and died. He denied eating a dog after a friend shared a photo with Vanity Fair magazine showing Kennedy dramatically preparing to take a bite of a charred animal; Kennedy said it was a goat.\n\nIn the video, Kennedy recounts the story to actress Roseanne Barr. He says he was heading to a falconry excursion with friends when a woman driving ahead of him hit and killed the young bear with her vehicle. He says he put it in his own vehicle, intending to skin it and eat the meat, but the day got away from him.\n\nEventually, he says, he was in Manhattan and needed to get the bear carcass out of his vehicle. His friends, fueled by alcohol, concocted the Central Park plan as a prank, he said, adding he was not drunk himself. At the time, bicycle accidents were getting significant media attention, so Kennedy and his friends thought it would be funny to make it look like the bear was hit by a bicycle.\n\nTwo women walking their dogs found the dead bear and alerted authorities, touching off a mystery that captivated the city for a few days. Bears are not among the park's known wildlife population.\n\nThe bike was dusted for prints and the animal sent to Albany for a necropsy, which determined the bear was likely hit by a vehicle and was not a victim of animal cruelty.

Kennedy Jr. probably won't win the 2024 presidential race, but when it comes to making weird admissions about past run-ins with animals, he continues to set a historic pace. First there was his brain worm. Then there was the dead dog he posed for a photo with but denied eating. Now there's the caper of Central Park's dead black bear cub.\n\nIn case you don't remember, back in October 2014, New Yorkers were shocked to learn that a woman walking her dog in Central Park had come upon the carcass of a fatally traumatized six-month-old bear cub. Per the New York Times at the time:\n\nThe furry black mass lay hidden under a bush near Central Park's main loop, unnoticed, unmoving and partially concealed by an abandoned bicycle. A dog rustling in the brush drew the first eyes to the bush and a sight rarely, if ever, found in modern Manhattan: a baby black bear, dead. A call to 911 followed and soon yellow police tape cordoned off the area near West 69th Street as detectives found themselves facing a mysterious crime scene on a sunny Monday morning. How the animal, a three-foot-long female, got to that spot remained a mystery at day's end: a cub, probably born this year, somehow separated from her mother and from anything resembling a natural habitat. ...\n\nThe police described the bear as having had trauma to her body, but it was not immediately clear how she had died. ... Nearby, New Yorkers increasingly familiar with wildlife sightings -- a coyote in the park, a dolphin off Throgs Neck in the Bronx -- offered theories of their own. Some suspected foul play. Others guessed an accident with a car. One man confidently pronounced the bear old enough to have wandered over from Morris County, N.J.\n\nA necropsy later revealed that the bear had likely been hit by a car, but nobody could have possibly guessed the bizarre sequence of events that led to the bear lying there -- let alone that Robert F. Kennedy Jr. was the one responsible.\n\nRFK Jr. has now admitted that -- via a video of him telling Roseanne Barr what happened -- in what appears to be an attempt to preempt a bombshell report from the New Yorker.\n\nHere's what he said happened: While driving off to do some upstate falconing in Goshen, New York, Kennedy saw a woman run over the bear cub with her van. Kennedy stopped his van and collected the fresh roadkill with the intention of skinning and eating it because \"it was in very good condition.\" But alas, he didn't get back home in time to do that, as he had some dinner plans at Peter Luger Steak House down in the city. Then he had a flight to catch, but still had a dead bear in his van.\n\nSo what's a Kennedy scion to do? He hatched up a \"redneck\" scheme with his dinner companions to plant the dead bear in Central Park, along with a bicycle Kennedy also had in his van, in what was supposed to look like the aftermath of a fatal bike-on-bear accident. And later he got worried when the dead bear was big news and amid the investigation, it appeared as though the bike would be taken to a crime lab so it could be finger printed.\n\nAnd he would have gotten away with it, too, if it hadn't been for that damn New Yorker.\n\nWatch this actual story from an actual presidential candidate for youself:", "source": {"uri": "nymag.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NYMag"}, "authors": [{"uri": "chas_danner@nymag.com", "name": "Chas Danner", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Park", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Central Park"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_F._Kennedy_Jr.", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Robert F.

But the circumstances of the bear's death, or how it got to New York City, were never publicly revealed.\n\nKennedy said he picked up the bear while on a falconing expedition in the Hudson Valley, planning to bring it home, but the day ran long and he went straight to a dinner at Peter Luger Steak House in New York City.

Kennedy Jr. admitted that he was the culprit who left a dead black bear cub in Central Park, solving a ten-year-old mystery.\n\nBack in 2014, authorities were stumped by the discovery of what the New York Times described as a \"furry black mass lay hidden under a bush near Central Park's main loop\" that was the carcass of a six-month-old female bear cub, a rarity in the heart of Gotham.\n\nRFK Jr. fessed up to the act in a video posted to X, beating a left-leaning publication to the punch with the New Yorker set to publish an article fingering him for the act which he predicted was going to be \"a bad story.\"\n\nKennedy may have left the dead bear in the park but he didn't kill it, explaining that he had seen a woman hit the animal with her van to a shocked Roseanne Barr, telling the comedienne that he was on his way to go falconing when he witnessed the incident.\n\n\"So, I pulled over and I picked up the bear and put him in the back of my van because I was going to skin the bear, and it was in very good condition, and I was going to put the meat in my refrigerator,\" he said. \"And you can do that in New York state. You can get a bear tag for roadkill bear.\"\n\nHe said that the falconing took longer than expected and that he then went to dinner at a Big Apple restaurant which ended late leaving him in a pinch for time because he had to go to the airport to make a flight.\n\n\"And the bear was in my car, and I didn't want to leave the bear in the car because that would have been bad,\" Kennedy continued. \"So, then I thought you know at that time - this was the...a little bit of the redneck in me - there'd been a series of bicycle accidents in New York they had just put in the bike lanes and so a couple of people had gotten killed and it was every day and people badly injured every day it was in the press.\"\n\n\"I said let's go put the bear in Central Park and we'll make it look like it got hit by a bike,\" Kennedy said, adding that he had an old bicycle in the car and thought it would be a good idea to leave it as a prop but didn't expect the amount of media coverage that the dead bear got.\n\n(Video Credit: CBS New York)\n\n\"The next day, it was like it was on every television station. It was the front page of every paper and I turned on the TV and there was like a mile of yellow tape and there were 20 cop cars, there were helicopters flying over it,\" he said. \"And I was like 'Oh my God, what did I do?'\"\n\n\"And then they were, there was some people on TV and Tyvek suits with gloves on lifting up the bike and they're saying they're gonna take this up to Albany to get it fingerprinted...And I was worried because my prints were all over that bike,\" he concluded.\n\n\"The mouth was open and it looked bloody,\" said 79-year-old Florence Slatkin who made the grim discovery, the New York Times reported at the time. \"At first, I thought it was a raccoon.\"\n\nKennedy's bizarre tale will likely take some of the steam out of the smear campaign that was ready to be launched after the New Yorker story dropped. Much like when he was falsely accused of displaying the carcass of a BBQ'd dog last month in a picture unearthed by a left-wing media outlet.\n\nA decade-old mystery has been solved at last.\n\nWe have no tolerance for comments containing violence, racism, profanity, vulgarity, doxing, or discourteous behavior.

Kennedy Jr., an independent presidential candidate, admitted in a video posted on X (formerly Twitter) that he was responsible for staging a dead bear cub in New York City's Central Park a decade ago. The bizarre revelation came as Kennedy sought to pre-empt an upcoming story by The New Yorker, which he anticipated would be negative.\n\nIn the video, Kennedy recounts how he and his friends, during a falconry expedition in New York's Hudson Valley, discovered a bear cub that had been hit and killed by a vehicle. Lacking time to take the bear home before catching a flight, Kennedy and his friends decided to stage the scene in Central Park. They placed the bear's carcass near an old bicycle to make it appear as if a cyclist had struck the animal, capitalizing on a series of recent bicycle crashes in the city.\n\n\"We thought it would be amusing for whoever found it,\" Kennedy said. The incident, which took place in 2014, puzzled authorities and residents. Florence Slatkin, a nearby resident, recalled that a friend's dog discovered the bear. Initially mistaking it for a bag of clothes or a dead dog, they soon realized it was a small bear with visible injuries.\n\nKennedy acknowledged his anxiety over the prank once it gained media attention. \"The next day it was on every television station,\" he told Roseanne Barr in the video. \"I was like, 'Oh my god, what did I do?' I was worried because my prints were all over that bike.\" Fortunately for Kennedy, the story eventually faded from the headlines.\n\nThe incident is the latest in a series of unusual events surrounding Kennedy's campaign, which has sparked concerns among both Republicans and Democrats.

The New Yorker had apparently gotten hold of some potential dirt on Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and was preparing to publish it, assuming you believe this qualifies as \"dirt\" in political terms. RFK found out about it somehow and decided to publish a video explaining the situation so he could get out in front of it. But rather than a story about extramarital affairs or potential corruption, this one involved RFK dumping the body of a dead bear in Central Park in New York in 2014. That sentence alone qualifies this as one of the stranger stories to come down the pike, but when you read into the details of what allegedly led to his decision to do this, none of it makes any sense whatsoever and we really have to question the man's judgment. (NY Post)\n\nHe had a bear-y unique experience.\n\nIndependent Presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy appeared to fess up to being one of the culprits who dumped a dead bear cub in Central Park a decade ago -- after abandoning a plan to skin it.\n\nSeemingly trying to preempt a forthcoming story from the New Yorker magazine, Kennedy, 70, bizarrely recounted in a video posted to social media how some of his buddies were drinking and thought it would be a good idea to dump the dead bear off in the park and \"make it look like he got hit by a bike.\"\n\nThe Kennedy scion insisted that he wasn't drinking when he opted to put an \"old bike in his car\" -- that someone asked him to throw away -- next to the deceased animal.\n\nIf Kennedy's story is to be believed (and I honestly don't know what to believe at this point), he was on a falconing trip in upstate New York in an area where I frequently hunted when I was young. While driving along, a woman in the car in front of him struck and killed a young bear. The bear was described by reporters at the time as a \"cub,\" but Kennedy just called it \"a young bear.\" There is a photo of the carcass in the linked article. I would guess that the bear was less than six months old. In any event, it was dead. That's sad, but it happens.\n\nUp until this point, there's nothing all that unusual going on. Black bears are very common in the region and I've seen plenty of them. But inexplicably, RFK decided to pick up the body of the bear, put it in his car, and take it home with him. He said he planned to skin the bear and \"put the meat in the refrigerator.\" Upon returning home, he allegedly went out with some friends who were drinking, though RFK claims that he was not. He realized that he wouldn't have time to deal with the bear, so he and his friends decided it would be \"a great idea\" to ditch the bear's body in Central Park. He supposedly had a damaged bicycle with him that a friend had \"asked him to throw away.\" So they put the bike next to the bear's body thinking that it would look like someone in the park had struck the bear with the bike, killing it. A pedestrian in the park discovered the bear the next day and alerted the authorities, resulting in a brief media surge.\n\nAre you buying any of this story as being remotely plausible? First of all, that bear was so small that the amount of usable meat on it would have been minimal at best, even if you like bear meat. (I don't, personally. Venison is much better.) And the hide would be so small that you couldn't even make a decent-sized rug out of it. There is no need to pick up a road-kill animal in those circumstances. Anyone can contact the New York Wildlife Health Unit ([email protected]) and they will send someone to collect the body.\n\nEven if he realized that he would not have time to process the body and needed to get rid of it, he could just as easily have dumped it by the side of a different rural road and reported it. What possible motivation could RFK and his buddies felt to take it to Central Park? No crime had been committed so there was nothing to cover up. And he just \"happened to have\" a damaged bicycle with him that a \"friend\" asked him to dispose of? I'm sure his friend could have figured out how to dispose of his own bike without tasking a member of the Kennedy clan to go to the dump for him. Also, while an automobile strike could definitely kill a very young bear (though usually not an adult, or at least not immediately), nobody is going to kill a black bear of that size by hitting it with a bicycle. It's simply not going to happen. Black bears are tough and they don't die easily, trust me.\n\nThis story is nonsensical from beginning to end. What this sounds like is a bunch of drunks who happened to wind up with a dead bear in their possession and decided to play a prank. Either Kennedy was drunk also, or he wasn't but he allowed himself to be talked into this moronic stunt by his drunken friends. Either way, this admission definitely calls the man's judgment into question. In the end, I suppose nobody was really hurt as a result of this misadventure (except the bear, of course), but Kennedy did himself no favors by concocting this tale in an effort to short-circuit a potentially embarrassing article in the middle of a national campaign.", "source": {"uri": "hotair.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "HotAir"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jazz_shaw@hotair.com", "name": "Jazz Shaw", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_F._Kennedy", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Robert F.

Kennedy Jr. once retrieved a bear that was killed by a motorist and left it in New York's Central Park with a bicycle on top, sparking a mystery that consumed the city a decade ago.\n\nKennedy describes the incident in a video that was posted to social media Sunday, adding it will be included in a forthcoming New Yorker article that he expects to be damaging.\n\nAlso Read | Bangladesh Unrest: 76, Including 13 Police Officers Killed As Fresh Protests Rock Nation (See Pics).\n\nIt's the latest bizarre incident in Kennedy's quixotic campaign that has divided his famous family and left Republicans and Democrats alike concerned about his potential impact on the presidential contest. Kennedy has acknowledged a parasite that lodged in his brain and died.\n\nHe denied eating a dog after a friend shared a photo with Vanity Fair magazine showing Kennedy dramatically preparing to take a bite of a charred animal; Kennedy said it was a goat.\n\nAlso Read | Nepal Road Accident: Woman Killed, 4 Others Injured As Tractor Carrying Bolbom Festival Pilgrims Returning From India Falls Into Canal in Sarlahi District.\n\nIn the video, Kennedy recounts the story to actress Roseanne Barr. He says he was heading to a falconry excursion with friends when a woman driving ahead of him hit and killed the young bear with her vehicle. He says he put it in his own vehicle, intending to skin it and eat the meat, but the day got away from him.\n\nEventually, he says, he was in Manhattan and needed to get the bear carcass out of his vehicle.\n\nHis friends, fueled by alcohol, concocted the Central Park plan as a prank, he said, adding he was not drunk himself. At the time, bicycle accidents were getting significant media attention, so Kennedy and his friends thought it would be funny to make it look like the bear was hit by a bicycle.\n\nTwo women walking their dogs found the dead bear and alerted authorities, touching off a mystery that captivated the city for a few days. Bears are not among the park's known wildlife population.\n\nThe bike was dusted for prints and the animal sent to Albany for a necropsy, which determined the bear was likely hit by a vehicle and was not a victim of animal cruelty. But how the bear ended up in Central Park remained a mystery.\n\n\"I was worried because my prints were all over that bike,\" Kennedy tells Barr in the video.

As he moves along in the story, he shares that a lot of bicycle accidents had been occurring in the city around this time, which led to the idea of casually disposing of the bear -- which he chanced upon while out on a \"falconing\" excursion in Goshen, N.Y. and put in his van to skin and eat later -- in such a way, as to make it look like another similar accident had occurred because bears are, of course, being taken out by bikes all of the time in New York City.\n\n\"It'll be funny for people,\" Kennedy laughs in the video, regarding his bear death prank.", "source": {"uri": "salon.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Salon.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_politician", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Independent politician"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_F._Kennedy_Jr.", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Robert F.

He says he pulled over to put the bear in his vehicle.\n\nNew York state does allow people to take bears killed on roads, but the law stipulates that a person has to notify law enforcement or the state's Department of Environmental Conservation to acquire such a tag.\n\nMr Kennedy does not appear to have done that.\n\nInstead, he says he continued to his falconing venture, which went late into the evening. He says he went on to a dinner reservation he had at Peter Luger Steakhouse in New York City, about 75 miles (121km) south of Goshen.\n\nThat is when, he says, it occurred to him that there had been a series of bicycle accidents in New York and that he had an old bicycle in his car.\n\nHe tells Ms Barr that he had the idea of staging a bike accident with the bear carcass in Central Park, which several drunk people with him heartily endorsed. He emphasises that he had not been drinking.\n\nHe then notes that a factchecker from The New Yorker had called him and asked whether he was involved in dumping the bear's body, which appears to have prompted him to release this video.\n\nThe bear's corpse was discovered by a woman walking her dog in the famous New York City park where bears are an unusual sight, according to a 2014 story written by the New York Times. It had been placed under some bushes and an abandoned bicycle, the story says.\n\nThe paper noted, at the time, that the New York Police Department's Animal Cruelty Investigation Squad was looking into the bear's death, and the New York Department of Environmental Conservation had concluded that the animal had been killed in a \"motor vehicle collision\" - not a bike accident.\n\nThe New York Police Department and Department of Environmental Conservation did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nThe New York Times story notes how puzzling the 2014 incident was to those who followed the case: \"But so many questions remain unanswered: How did the bear end up in Central Park? Was there foul play involved? Did she die in the park, or was she dumped there?\"\n\nIn a twist, that decade-old newspaper story was coincidentally written by another member of the famous Kennedy family - Tatiana Schlossberg, a former New York Times journalist who is the granddaughter of US President John F Kennedy.\n\nMs Schlossberg did not immediately respond to a request for comment about her relative, though many members of the Kennedy family have disavowed Mr Kennedy's actions and his campaign for president.\n\nMr Kennedy's bizarre confession comes as his 2024 campaign for president appears to be struggling.\n\nWith Vice-President Kamala Harris entering the race after President Joe Biden announced his decision to step aside, polls indicate that Mr Kennedy's support has dwindled to the single digits.\n\nA scion of America's most famous political family, Mr Kennedy has struggled to raise money and slowed his campaigning in recent weeks.\n\nThose issues have coincided with a series of blunders that have fuelled speculation that the US politician might drop out, though he has insisted that he will not exit the race.", "source": {"uri": "tvcnews.tv", "dataType": "news", "title": "TVC News Nigeria"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roseanne_Barr", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Roseanne Barr"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_F._Kennedy", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "John F.

The magazine is about to publish a profile of the independent presidential hopeful.\n\nIt all happened about 10 years ago, he said, detailing the uncompleted exploit in a kitchen as the view panned between him and Barr, and chortling could be heard off-camera. He was supposed to meet friends for a falconing expedition in Goshen, N.Y., when a woman driving a van in front of him \"hit a bear and killed it,\" he said. \"A young bear.\"\n\nRFK Jr. sprang into action, without detailing the condition of the woman or her vehicle.\n\n\"So I pulled over and picked up the bear and put it in the back of my van, because I was gonna skin the bear, because it was in very good condition, and I was gonna put the meat in my refrigerator,\" he said to a nodding Barr. \"You can do that in New York State, you can get a bear tag for a roadkill bear.\"\n\nHe then proceeded to go hawking, bear in car, catching a lot of game and having a much better day than said bear, he said.

He says he went on to a dinner reservation he had at Peter Luger Steakhouse in New York City, about 75 miles (121km) south of Goshen.\n\n\"At the end of the dinner, it was late and I realised I couldn't go home,\" Mr Kennedy says. \"I had to go to the airport, and the bear was in my car, and I didn't want to leave the bear in my car because that would have been bad.\"\n\nThat is when, he says, it occurred to him that there had been a series of bicycle accidents in New York and that he had an old bicycle in his car.\n\nHe tells Ms Barr that he had the idea of staging a bike accident with the bear carcass in Central Park, which several drunk people with him heartily endorsed.

It had been placed under some bushes and an abandoned bicycle, the story says.\n\nThe paper noted, at the time, that the New York Police Department's Animal Cruelty Investigation Squad was looking into the bear's death, and the New York Department of Environmental Conservation had concluded that the animal had been killed in a \"motor vehicle collision\" - not a bike accident.\n\nThe New York Police Department and Department of Environmental Conservation did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nThe New York Times story notes how puzzling the 2014 incident was to those who followed the case: \"But so many questions remain unanswered: How did the bear end up in Central Park? Was there foul play involved? Did she die in the park, or was she dumped there?\"\n\nIn a twist, that decade-old newspaper story was coincidentally written by another member of the famous Kennedy family - Tatiana Schlossberg, a former New York Times journalist who is the granddaughter of US President John F Kennedy.\n\nMs Schlossberg did not immediately respond to a request for comment about her relative, though many members of the Kennedy family have disavowed Mr Kennedy's actions and his campaign for president.\n\nMr Kennedy's bizarre confession comes as his 2024 campaign for president appears to be struggling.\n\nWith Vice-President Kamala Harris entering the race after President Joe Biden announced his decision to step aside, polls indicate that Mr Kennedy's support has dwindled to the single digits.\n\nA scion of America's most famous political family, Mr Kennedy has struggled to raise money and slowed his campaigning in recent weeks.\n\nThose issues have coincided with a series of blunders that have fuelled speculation that the US politician might drop out, though he has insisted that he will not exit the race.", "source": {"uri": "bbc.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "BBC"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New York (state)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_F._Kennedy", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "John F.

Kennedy Jr., the long-shot presidential candidate who is running as an independent, admitted to dumping the carcass of a bear cub in Central Park in 2014 as a joke.\n\nThe discovery of the bear in Manhattan's iconic park made headlines in the fall of 2014. It was found in the bushes under a bicycle. Though it was determined to have died by being hit by a car, how it found its way into the center of the Big Apple has remained a mystery for the last decade.\n\nThat is until Kennedy published a bizarre nearly 3 1/2-minute video to X on Sunday in which he tells actress Roseanne Barr in a large white kitchen the story of how he came in possession of the bear. He said a fact checker at The New Yorker had asked him about it for a yet-to-be-published article.\n\nIn the video, he tells Barr that he was en route to Goshen, N.Y., to meet a group of people to go falconing with when a car in front of him hit and killed the bear.\n\nKennedy said he pulled over and put it in the back of his van with intentions to later skin and butcher it as it was \"in very good condition.\"\n\nAfter falconing, which is a form of hunting with the use of falcons, he returned to Manhattan to attend a dinner that went late. Having to go to the airport afterward and not wanting to leave the bear carcass in his vehicle, he decided to abandon it in the park with a bicycle that had also been in his truck to make it seem as if it had been hit and killed in a bicycle accident.\n\n\"There'd been a series of bicycle accidents in New York -- they had just put in the bike lanes -- and some people, a couple of people had gotten killed. And it was every day and people were badly injured,\" he said.\n\nHe said he had not been drinking but those he was with had been and they thought the joke was a \"great idea.\"\n\n\"So we went and did that and we thought it would be amusing for whoever found it or something. The next day, it was on every television station. It was the front page of every paper,\" he said. And I was like, 'Oh my God! What did I do?'\"\n\nBarr chuckles in reaction to the story.

Kennedy Jr. claims he dumped bear carcass in Central Park in 2014", "body": "CENTRAL PARK (WABC) -- A nearly-decade-old New York City mystery may have been solved.\n\nRobert F. Kennedy Jr. claims it was he who dumped the carcass of a bear cub in Central Park in 2014.\n\nWATCH | Eyewitness News coverage of dead bear cub found in Central Park (2014)\n\nThe next day, it was on every television station and it was the front page of every paper - after all, dead bears don't just turn up in Central Park.\n\nOn Sunday, almost 10 years after that October day in 2014... RFK Jr. is offering an answer.\n\nThe independent candidate posted a video to X tonight explaining that on a 'falconing trip' to Goshen in the Hudson Valley, 'a woman in a van in front of me hit a bear and killed it. A young bear.'\n\nHe goes on to confess to a speechless and incredulous-looking Roseanne Barr that he scooped up the roadkill and put it in his truck, hoping to skin it.\n\n\"And I was gonna put the meat in my refrigerator. And you can do that in New York State. You can get a bear tag for a roadkill bear,\" he added.\n\nHowever, time got away from him that day. After dinner back in the city with friends went late, he tells Barr, he realized it the carcass might start to go bad, so of course he and his pals looked for the next best thing to do with it in the city - and that was to stage an accident.\n\n\"I had an old bike in my car that someone had asked me to get rid of, and I said let's put the bear in Central Park and make it look like he got hit by a bike.\"\n\nSure enough, somebody found the bear and bike in the morning and described it to Eyewitness News.\n\n\"We looked closer we saw something under the back wheel, it could have been a raccoon, I didn't know what it was, but then I thought it was the head of a big dog, that was obviously dead,\" said the witness.\n\nPolice were dusting that bicycle for fingerprints. Neither police nor a state lab would make a connection to Kennedy or anyone else and the case went cold.\n\nSo why come clean about it now? Perhaps one of his friends let the cat- or bear- out of the bag.\n\n\"The New Yorker found out about it and they're going to do a big article on me,\" Kennedy said.\n\nMuch like he claims he scooped that bear, he now claims he wanted to scoop the magazine by posting that recent conversation publicly to acknowledge he does in fact bear responsibility for the incident. His campaign tells ABC News that he is not worried about any legal ramifications.\n\nEyewitness News has reached out to the NYPD to ask if there might be any. The Parks Department is also deferring any questions about the incident to the NYPD.\n\n* Get Eyewitness News Delivered\n\n* More Manhattan news\n\n* Follow us on YouTube\n\nHave a breaking news tip or an idea for a story we should cover?

He explained that he was driving through the Hudson Valley in 2014 when he witnessed a woman accidentally hit and kill a young bear cub with her van. \"I pulled over and I picked up the bear and put him in the back of my van because I was going to skin the bear,\" Kennedy was quoted as saying, adding that the bear was in good condition and he intended to use the meat.\n\nHowever, Kennedy's plans changed when he realized he had to attend a dinner at the famous Peter Luger Steak House in New York City before catching a flight. Faced with a time crunch, he decided to abandon the bear in Central Park, concocting a scene to make it look like the cub had been hit by a bicycle.\n\nKennedy's admission has raised eyebrows, not only for the odd nature of the story but also for his casual tone in recounting the incident. He joked about the situation, saying, \"This was a little bit of the redneck in me,\" while acknowledging that the story might not be well-received by the public or the press.\n\nA grim discovery in Central Park\n\nThe bear cub's discovery in 2014 caused an uproar, with the New York Times reporting on the unusual find. A woman walking her dog in Central Park stumbled upon the cub, partly hidden under some bushes near an abandoned bicycle. The 6-month-old cub, weighing 44 pounds, appeared to have died from \"blunt force injuries consistent with a motor vehicle collision,\" according to a necropsy conducted by the state's Department of Environmental Conservation.\n\nIronically, the New York Times article covering the incident was written by Tatiana Schlossberg, Kennedy's first cousin's daughter, who was unaware of Kennedy's involvement at the time. Schlossberg commented on the revelation, saying, \"Like law enforcement, I had no idea who was responsible for this when I wrote the story.\"\n\nAt TOI World Desk, our dedicated team of seasoned journalists and passionate writers tirelessly sifts through the vast tapestry of global events to bring you the latest news and diverse perspectives round the clock.

Kennedy Jr.'s recent admission that he was behind the dumping of a dead bear cub in New York's Central Park has sparked a deluge of jokes and memes on social media.\n\nThe story originally made headlines in 2014 when a woman found the dead cub while walking her dog. On Sunday, Kennedy shed new light on the case, admitting it was he who left the cub there. He gave an account of the events in a video posted to X, formerly Twitter, ahead of an upcoming New Yorker article he said was going to break the story.\n\nTo add to the bizarreness of the revelation, the 2014 New York Times report of the incident, titled \"Bear Found in Central Park Was Killed by a Car, Officials Say,\" was written by Tatiana Schlossberg-the daughter of Kennedy's first cousin Caroline Kennedy.\n\nKennedy posted a video on Sunday with the caption: \"Looking forward to seeing how you spin this one, @NewYorker.\" In it he told Roseanne Barr that ten years ago, he was on a falconry trip with a woman who ran over and killed a bear cub in New York's Hudson Valley. He put the cub in his van because he wanted to skin it and put the meat in his refrigerator.\n\nBut he said the hunting day went late, and he had to go direct to New York City for a dinner at Peter Luger Steak House, rather than to his Westchester home where he could have dropped off the bear corpse.\n\nAt the end of the dinner, Kennedy said he needed to go to the airport so could not leave the bear in his van. He instead suggested to friends, who he said were drinking alcohol but that he was not, that they dump the corpse in Central Park and make it look like it was hit by a bicycle.\n\n\"Everybody thought that's a great idea to do that, and we thought it would be amusing for whoever found it or something. But the next day it was, like, on every television station. And it was the front page of every paper. And I turned on the TV and there was, like, a mile of yellow tape. And there were helicopters flying over and I was like, oh my God, what did I do?\"\n\nKennedy said he was worried about getting caught through fingerprints. However, the story died down after a while, until, he said in the video, that the New Yorker recently found out it was him. \"It's going to be a bad story,\" he said. The video had been viewed 8.8 million times by Monday morning.\n\nNewsweek contacted Kennedy's campaign for comment by email.\n\n\"An infinite number of monkeys could type for a million years and STILL not predict whatever the next RFK Jr. headline is gonna be,\" user @JudeAtwood wrote on X.\n\nAnother posted a meme of Kermit the Frog talking to a hooded, evil Sith Lord from Star Wars \"RFK Jr.: I should drive past that dead bear. The worm in RFK Jr's brain: Stage a bike accident,\" it said.\n\nUser @HankGreen, a video blogger, wrote \"Trump just absolutely champing at the bit trying to get the news cycle back on him and then RFK jr. pops out of a cake screaming, \"A DECADE AGO I STAGED THE MURDER OF A BEAR CUB IN CENTRAL PARK!!!\"\n\nUser @JoshGondelman wrote \"Kristi Noem: No one will top my bizarre animal killing stories. RFK Jr.: Hold my bear,\" a reference to the South Dakota governor who controversially recalled she shot her pet dog earlier in the year.\n\nUser @DougJBallon, who runs an account making satirical ideas for New York Times articles, pitched a headline about how Kennedy's experiences represent normal American lives: \"In this Ohio town, it was a tradition: morning mass, biscuits and gravy at Bob Evans, then over to Central Park to dump the body of a dead bear cub. But now the woke mob is taking all of that away.\"\n\nThe dead bear is the latest in a series of bizarre stories to have surfaced during Kennedy's campaign. In May, it was revealed that a tape worm ate a portion of his brain and then died, while in July, a photo surface of him eating a carcass that was reportedly a dog. He said the carcass was a goat.\n\nKennedy said in his announcement speech \"I have so many skeletons in my closet that if they could all vote, I could run for king of the world.\"", "source": {"uri": "kansascity.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Kansas City Star"}, "authors": [{"uri": "flynn_nicholls@kansascity.com", "name": "Flynn Nicholls", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_F._Kennedy", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Robert F.

Kennedy Jr.'s bizarre confession to being responsible for a bizarre and infamous mystery dead bear that was found in Central Park a decade ago.\n\nKASIE HUNT: Now there's this story, and I sort of can't believe that this is the story that we were telling. But here it is. It's a ten year old New York cold case. It has been solved. The bearer of the news may surprise you.\n\nCHRISTINE ROMANS (VIDEO CLIP): New York's Central Park. A bear cub I know, dead underneath some bushes. A dog walker stumbled upon the animal Monday morning. Officials at the Central Park Zoo are sure the bear did not belong to them.\n\nJOHN BERMAN (VIDEO CLIP): They didn't have any bears.\n\nCHRISTINE ROMANS (VIDEO CLIP): At the time. Police say the three foot cubs showed signs of trauma and lacerations. Are not sure whether it wandered in the park or someone put it there.\n\nJOHN BERMAN (VIDEO CLIP): It's been no bears in the park for a long, long time. It seems as if someone brought the thing there, which is really sad.\n\nKASIE HUNT: So we now know the person that brought the dead bear cub to Central Park in 2014 was independent presidential candidate Robert F Kennedy Jr.\n\nApparently, he could not bear to hold his confession in any longer. He is now admitting why he put the animal there. He walked through it in great detail.\n\nRFK JR: Maybe, you know, really early, like 7 a.m. and a woman in front of me hit a bear and killed it, a young bear.\n\nSo I pulled over and I picked up the bear and put him in the back of my van because I was going to skin the bear, and it was very bad condition, and it was going on. And with a meat. My refrigerator. And you can do that in New York you can get a bear tag for a roadkill bear.\n\nKASIE HUNT: What in the actual eff is this? What is this? What is this?\n\nEDWARD-ISAAC DOVERE: It's the 2024 presidential election.\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\nMATT GORMAN: Robert F Kennedy freak show candidacy,r because also the hidden, he was going falconing. He was on the way back from falconing-\n\nEDWARD-ISAAC DOVERE: And on his way to a dinner at the Peter Luger steak.\n\nKASIE HUNT: He had a bike in the car. I mean, the whole thing is so bizarre and just screams privilege of in a way that you just can't even-\n\nEDWARD-ISAAC DOVERE: But also look as far as campaign tactics. The reason why we know about this is because Robert F Kennedy's campaign thought it was a great idea to hook him up with Roseanne Barr and video their exchange.\n\nAnd then from whatever else happened in that conversation, that's the part of the video that they clipped, which includes, him saying all the things we talked about.\n\nAlso, that he was doing this as a prank to show the bike lanes didn't work in Central Park. The bear was found in the bushes. It wasn't to be found in a bike lane.\n\nIt also includes him saying that he has a little bit of a redneck in him, which I think would probably be a surprise to the other people that he's hung out with-", "source": {"uri": "mediaite.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Mediaite"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kasie_Hunt", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kasie Hunt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_F._Kennedy", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Robert F.

But none of them is worse than Robert Kennedy Jr. He's a totally deplorable human being.\n\nKnowing The New Yorker was coming with this story, Kennedy reveals the truth of a decade old tale to, weirdly, right wing crackpot and former comedian Roseanne Barr.\n\nWatching this video is jaw dropping, Kennedy recalls a hunting trip in which he loaded a dead bear in his car, had dinner at a steak house, and then intended to go to the airport. Realizing he couldn't leave the bear in the car, he then surreptitiously dumped it in Central Park. He made it seem like a cyclist had killed it.\n\nThis really happened. The mystery bear was reported widely in the news. Now we know who did it. This is not funny or amusing. This is sick. This is a man who cheated on first and second wives, kept a sex diary that was published by the NY Post, and saw his second wife hang herself in the barn.\n\nMore recently Kennedy has conceded that other women may have unsavory stories about him. He's a conspiracy theorist who rails against vaccines. He's surrounded himself with people like Barr who have revolted his uncle, President John Kennedy, and his father, Robert F. Kennedy.\n\nIs this the end? Let's hope so. We're finally on a path with Kamala Harris to normalcy again. Kennedy must be rejected on all levels. His own siblings and cousins have denounced him. Now it's our turn.\n\nPS No kidding. The bear's family should start a civil suit.\n\nKennedy's video, which he's posted to get ahead of the New Yorker story, is below, followed by the report on Channel 4 WNBC in 2011. The youthful prank happened when RFK Jr. was fifth seven years old -- ages his father and uncle didn't get to live to.

Kennedy Jr. (RFK Jr.) released a bizarre video on Sunday in which he admitted to dumping a dead bear cub in New York City's Central Park and staging it to look like it had been hit by a cyclist.\n\nKennedy released the video on X to stay ahead of an upcoming piece in the New Yorker about the incident. As noted by the San Francisco Chronicle, the female black bear was \"discovered in bushes and partially covered by a bicycle in October 2014, prompting an investigation into the circumstances that never revealed answers, at least publicly, until Sunday.\"\n\nIn the video, Kennedy spoke with Roseanne Barr about dumping the bear, saying he scooped the animal up after witnessing a woman hit it with her van. While laughing, Kennedy said he hoped to skin the bear and later eat it. However, as the hours passed, he ran out of time and devised a plan to abandon the bear in Central Park alongside an old bicycle he had in his van. At the time, the city had been dealing with an uptick in bicycle accidents.\n\n\"The next day, it was on every television station,\" Kennedy told Barr. \"Luckily, the story died down after a while.\"\n\nThe bizarre confession follows another bizarre story in which he was alleged to have eaten a barbecued dog. He denied it. Last month, Vanity Fair released a detailed profile on Kennedy, publishing explosive allegations about his personal and political life, chief among them being the claim he ate a dog while visiting South Korea. Per the report:\n\nLast year Robert Kennedy Jr. texted a photograph to a friend. In the photo RFK Jr. was posing, alongside an unidentified woman, with the barbecued remains of what appears to be a dog. Kennedy told the person, who was traveling to Asia, that he might enjoy a restaurant in Korea that served dog on the menu, suggesting Kennedy had sampled dog. The photo was taken in 2010, according to the digital file's metadata -- the same year he was diagnosed with a dead tapeworm in his brain. (A veterinarian who examined the photograph says the carcass is a canine, pointing to the 13 pairs of ribs, which include the tell-tale \"floating rib\" found in dogs.)\n\nThe photo immediately went viral on social media, with many calling it a display of animal cruelty. Robert F. Kennedy Jr. addressed the photo, saying it was actually of a barbecued goat in Patagonia.\n\n\"You know when your veterinary experts call a goat a dog, and your forensic experts say a photo taken in Patagonia was taken in Korea, that you've joined the ranks of supermarket tabloids,\" the candidate wrote in a post tagging Vanity Fair on X. \"Keep telling America that up is down if you want. I'll keep talking about the fact that working families can't afford houses or groceries because our last two presidents went on a $14 trillion debt joyride, paid for by hard-working Americans.\"\n\n\"The DNC media's garbage pail journalism may distract us from President [Joe] Biden's cognitive deficits but it does little to elevate the national debate or reduce the price of groceries,\" he added.\n\nOther parts of the Vanity Fair article alleged that RFK Jr. drove his first wife, Mary Richardson, to suicide and that he would send texts of women's genitalia to his friends, who questioned if the photos were consensual. In another allegation, Eliza Cooney, a former part-time babysitter for his children, claimed that he sexually harassed and groped her on several occasions.", "source": {"uri": "breitbart.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Breitbart"}, "authors": [{"uri": "paul_bois@breitbart.com", "name": "Paul Bois", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_F._Kennedy", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "John F.

Kathleen is a proud alumna of the CUNY Graduate School of Journalism. Here's a shocker; she is from New York City.\n\nAnchor Kasie Hunt and fellow CNN panelists lost their cool Monday morning over a new development in the \"freak show\" that is the 2024 presidential election campaign cycle.\n\nSurprisingly, the story does not involve Donald Trump.\n\n\"I can't believe that this is a story that we're telling,\" Hunt told viewers Monday morning. \"What in the actual ef is this?\"\n\n\"This,\" as Hunt soon reveals, is the news that independent candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. confessed to a decade-old cold case in New York City that centered on a \"possibly murdered\" body of a bear cub found in Central Park.\n\nKennedy revealed it was he who placed the bear in the Manhattan park in a conversation with former television star Roseanne Barr that was filmed and released by his campaign.\n\nAn apparently sympathetic Barr listens in as Kennedy explains what he did when, returning from a falconing trip on his way to Peter Luger's steakhouse, he saw a car in front of him fatally strike the cub.\n\n\"I pulled over and I picked up the bear and put him in the back of my van,\" Kennedy explains. \"Because I was gonna skin the bear and, it was in very good condition, I was going to put the meat in my refrigerator.\"\n\nALSO READ: We asked 10 Republican senators: 'Is Kamala Harris Black?'

New Yorker Take Down of Robert Kennedy Doesn't Go Far Enough, Including the Dead Bear Story - Showbiz411", "body": "The New Yorker's excellent take down of Robert Kennedy Jr. doesn't go far enough.\n\nBut Clare Malone's excellent reporting at least reveals the dreadful and disgusting story of Kennedy -- at age 57 -- putting a dead bear cub in Central Park and making it seem like a cyclist hit it.\n\nMalone also reveals that the New York Times story about the bear was written by Kennedy's cousin, Tatianna Schlossberg, who then worked for the paper. She didn't know he was responsible? Malone says that it was a coincidence.\n\nMalone also reveals, if you didn't know, that Kennedy started an affair with Mary Richardson while he was married to his first wife. Richardson got pregnant, which ended the first marriage. Later, as we all know, Richardson -- after having four children -- committed suicide.\n\nWhat Malone doesn't say is that Kennedy -- whom she does identify as a serial philanderer -- had an affair during the Richardson marriage with a then famous TV star. (Their friendship endures.) Kennedy's children have not fared particularly well as adults. One of them, Kick, was written out of the HBO series, \"Newsroom,\" before she even started.\n\nThere's a lot more. Nearly everyone in New York circles has a bad story about Bobby Kennedy. I was friends with Peter Kaplan, Kennedy's Harvard roommate, in the 80s and 90s until his death from cancer. He was regularly negative about Kennedy in our conversations. If he were alive, he'd be livid at how Kennedy turned out.\n\nThe bear story is disgusting, and seems like a crime that will go unpunished. It's just part of Kennedy's horrible story. Malone almost makes a point that Kennedy's psychosis stems from his father's tragic death. But his other siblings -- Kathleen, Rory, Kerry -- have managed to rise above it and make lives for themselves of value. They've all disowned his presidential candidacy, along with other members of the family.", "source": {"uri": "showbiz411.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Showbiz411"}, "authors": [{"uri": "roger_friedman@showbiz411.com", "name": "Roger Friedman", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karl_Malone", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Karl Malone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_F._Kennedy", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "John F.

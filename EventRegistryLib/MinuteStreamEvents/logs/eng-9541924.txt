This comes after the state retained its title as the world's 5th largest economy and had a population increase, both of which are directly tied to California's nation-leading tourism and entertainment industries.\n\nVIDEO: Gov. Newsom makes announcement at the top of the Golden Gate Bridge\n\nWHAT GOVERNOR NEWSOM SAID: \"From our world-renowned coastline, to the world's tallest trees, to our iconic cities and theme parks, California is the nation's coming attraction. Visitors from all over the world are coming here to experience the wonder of the Golden State, boosting our economy and creating good-paying jobs for years to come.\"\n\nBY THE NUMBERS: The Economic Impact of Travel in California, prepared by Dean Runyan Associates and released by Visit California, detailed spending that is 3.8% higher than 2019 and 5.6% higher than 2022. Spending exceeded 2019 levels in a majority of counties.\n\nWHAT VISIT CALIFORNIA CEO BETETA SAID: \"California tourism is back where it belongs - setting records and providing for the workers, business owners and all Californians who depend on the travel industry as a cornerstone of our state's economy. The industry has once again proved its ability to recover from any challenge, whether it be economic or environmental. California continues to be the largest, most diverse and most resilient tourism economy in the United States.\"\n\nWHAT THIS MEANS: California has the largest market share of tourism in the nation. The new travel-spending record generated $12.7 billion in state and local tax revenue by visitors in 2023, marking a 3% increase over 2019. Tourism created 64,900 new jobs in 2023, bringing total industry employment to 1,155,000.\n\nCalifornia remains the 5th largest economy in the world for the seventh consecutive year, with a nominal GDP of nearly $3.9 trillion in 2023 and a growth rate of 6.1% since the year prior, according to the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis. California's per capita GDP is the second largest among large economies.\n\nIn addition to visiting the state, more people are moving to California. Earlier this week, Governor Newsom announced the state's population is increasing for the first time since the pandemic.\n\nThe Golden State, which has the most equitable tax system in the entire country, is #1 in the nation for new business starts, #1 for access to venture capital funding, and the #1 state for tourism spending, manufacturing, high-tech, and agriculture.", "source": {"uri": "foreignaffairs.co.nz", "dataType": "news", "title": "foreignaffairs.co.nz"}, "authors": [{"uri": "mil_osi_publisher@foreignaffairs.co.nz", "name": "Mil-Osi Publisher", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gavin_Newsom", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gavin Newsom"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tourism", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tourism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Gate_Bridge", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Golden Gate Bridge"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_State_Warriors", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Golden State Warriors"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/County_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "County (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amusement_park", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Amusement park"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bureau_of_Economic_Analysis", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bureau of Economic Analysis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venture_capital", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Venture capital"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gross_domestic_product", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gross domestic product"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_tech", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "High tech"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agriculture", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Agriculture"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Immigration", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Immigration", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Homeowners", "label": "dmoz/Home/Homeowners", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Labor", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Labor", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Consumer", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Consumer", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 83}], "image": null, "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9541924", "eventUri": "eng-9541924", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2862745098039217, "wgt": 210, "relevance": 1}

Despite the challenges posed by the pandemic, the state's tourism industry rebounded remarkably, as revealed by Visit California's latest economic impact analysis.\n\nThe report, \"The Economic Impact of Travel in California,\" compiled by Dean Runyan Associates, underscores a 3.8% surge in spending compared to 2019 figures and a 5.6% rise from 2022. Notably, spending levels outpaced those of 2019 in 34 of the state's 58 counties. Among California's primary international gateways, including San Diego, Orange, and Los Angeles counties, travel expenditures surpassed pre-pandemic levels, with San Francisco nearly reaching full recovery at 97.2%.\n\n\"California tourism is back where it belongs - setting records and providing for the workers, business owners and all Californians who depend on the travel industry as a cornerstone of our state's economy,\" said Caroline Beteta, president and CEO of Visit California, the state's tourism marketing organization. \"The industry has once again proved its ability to recover from any challenge, whether it be economic or environmental. California continues to be the largest, most diverse and most resilient tourism economy in the United States.\"\n\nReleased today to coincide with the commencement of California Tourism Month, an initiative established by the Legislature in 2016, the report underscores the vital role of the state's tourism industry in bolstering both the financial stability and personal welfare of Californians. For a comprehensive view, you can access the complete economic report.\n\nIn 2023, visitors contributed a substantial $12.7 billion in state and local tax revenue, reflecting a 3% increase from 2019. This influx of tax revenue translated to a significant saving of $966 for each California household.\n\nThe tourism sector also saw the creation of 64,900 new jobs in 2023, elevating total industry employment to 1,155,000 -- equivalent to 98% of 2019 levels. This resurgence is particularly remarkable considering the swift downturn brought about by the pandemic, which left over 500,000 travel and hospitality workers unemployed in a matter of days.\n\nWhile international visitors injected $24.3 billion into California's economy in 2023 -- a notable 38% rise from 2022 -- they still fell short of the peak seen in 2018 by 15%. The slow return of travelers from China and other parts of Asia post-pandemic has impeded full recovery in the international sector.\n\nTo revitalize international visitation growth, Visit California has reopened offices in 13 international markets and is proudly hosting IPW, the premier international inbound travel industry trade show, in Los Angeles starting May 4.\n\nThis positive trajectory in travel spending coincides with the launch of Visit California's new global brand platform, The Ultimate Playground, unveiled in March after more than a decade. Rooted in research from the National Institute for Play, which highlights the benefits of travel on physical and mental well-being, the brand celebrates California's playful lifestyle and diverse experiences, positioning the state as the ultimate playground.

Stone spoke with in San Francisco's Fisherman's Wharf.\n\n\"The Wharf is still not back to where it was, I mean half the restaurants have closed,\" said Peter Demarest who is the GM at The Franciscan Crab Restaurant. \"Compared to 2019 we're down 40-50 percent and the Wharf has comeback somewhat, but it is still not where it was before the pandemic so I think that's kind of an erroneous statement by the governor.\"\n\nVisit California says travel spending reached $150.4 billion across the state in 2023, but that number does not factor in inflation. When adjusted for inflation, travel spending in 2023 was down 14 percent compared to before the pandemic in 2019.\n\n\"Back in 2016 this place was mobbed on the weekends, I mean there was a line going down the stairs,\" said Demarest. \"We don't see that at all, even on a Saturday night.\"\n\nNow, there's hope that businesses can hold strong because a previous travel forecast by Visit California put a 2027 estimate on when the numbers would fully recover with inflation factored in.\n\nVIDEO: What doom loop?

It's just the cleanliness is one of the things. First thing we realized, 'Oh yeah we're not in Colorado anymore.'\" said Cz Za from California.\n\nBusiness owners say they have not seen a rebound in visitors from Asia and while Europeans are starting to come back, they aren't coming back in the numbers we have previously seen pre-pandemic.\n\nThis week, there is a big Cybersecurity conference at the Moscone Center in San Francisco, which is good news for businesses.", "source": {"uri": "abc7news.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ABC7 News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gavin_Newsom", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gavin Newsom"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fisherman's_Wharf,_San_Francisco", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Fisherman's Wharf, San Francisco"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KGO-TV", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "KGO-TV"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "San Francisco"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "San Francisco"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor_of_California", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Governor of California"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tourism", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Tourism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Gate_Bridge", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Golden Gate Bridge"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franciscans", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Franciscans"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Motors", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "General Motors"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco_Municipal_Railway", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "San Francisco Municipal Railway"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moscone_Center", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Moscone Center"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asia", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Asia"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Europe"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_District,_San_Francisco", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Financial District, San Francisco"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Financial District, San Francisco"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorado", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Colorado"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Colorado"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belgium", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Belgium"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Belgium"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities/Opposing_Views", "label": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities/Opposing Views", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Animal_Sports/Bullfighting", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Animal Sports/Bullfighting", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 48}], "image": "https://cdn.abcotvs.com/dip/images/14774582_050624-kgo-ca-tourism-img.jpg?w=1600", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9541924", "eventUri": "eng-9541924", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "San Francisco"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.003921568627450966, "wgt": 152, "relevance": 1}

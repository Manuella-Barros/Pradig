Hosts of that tournament will be decided next month in a three-candidate vote.\n\nThe value of the Aramco deal was not disclosed but is likely the richest ever for FIFA by average annual value. The inaugural 32-team Club World Cup being hosted next year in the U.S. was not specified by FIFA though could be part of a separate deal.\n\n\"Through the partnership, Aramco and FIFA intend to leverage the power of football to create impactful social initiatives around the world,\" the soccer body said in a statement.\n\nSaudi sponsorship will help fuel income for FIFA's 2023-26 commercial cycle which was conservatively budgeted to be $11 billion.\n\nRevenue from broadcasting, sponsorship, licensing video games plus sales of tickets and hospitality packages was $7.5 billion for the four-year period tied to the 2022 World Cup in Qatar.\n\nFIFA President Gianni Infantino has built close ties to Saudi Arabia and its Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman since before the 2018 World Cup. That tournament in Russia was sponsored by state energy firm Gazprom.\n\nThe FIFA-Saudi links were maintained through fallout from the 2018 killing of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi and despite critics making claims of \"sportswashing\" by the kingdom to improve its reputation.\n\nThe 2034 World Cup bidding was unexpectedly opened last October in a fast-track process seemingly expressly designed for Saudi Arabia to win, with only FIFA member federations in Asia and Oceania allowed to compete. It was made possible by FIFA brokering a three-continent deal announced the same day for the 2030 World Cup which will be played in Spain, Portugal, Morocco, Argentina, Paraguay and Uruguay.\n\nSaudi Arabia was confirmed as the only 2034 candidate by the end of that month. Both the 2030 and 2034 decisions must be rubber-stamped by FIFA member federations later this year. No date or venue has been announced for the 211-member meeting.\n\nThose members are in line for increased annual payments from FIFA in the decade leading to the Saudi-hosted World Cup.\n\nFIFA's development program pays each federation up to $8 million over four years through 2026 with more available for specific projects such as stadiums, training centers and federation headquarters.\n\nFIFA already had reserves of $4 billion after the 2022 World Cup in Qatar, which also had a top-tier sponsor from the fossil fuel industry: Qatar Energy.\n\nThe Visit Saudi tourist board was a third-tier sponsor of the tournament in Qatar, though a planned deal for the 2023 Women's World Cup was ended after pushback by organizers in Australia and New Zealand.\n\nSoccer officials in those host countries cited the importance of gender equality in a reference to the limits on women's freedoms in traditionally conservative Saudi society.\n\nSaudi soccer officials stress life there is changing fast as part of the Vision 2030 program to modernize society and the economy, directed by the crown prince, widely known as MBS.\n\nSoccer, sports and entertainment have been key elements to the program with headline investments including the breakaway LIV Golf tour and buying English Premier League club Newcastle, which played in the Champions League within two years of a Saudi-backed takeover.\n\nThe Saudi domestic league was boosted with huge salaries to lure a slew of star players including Cristiano Ronaldo and Neymar to clubs which were effectively nationalized last year by the sovereign wealth Public Investment Fund chaired by the crown prince.\n\nAP soccer: https://apnews.com/hub/soccer", "source": {"uri": "idahostatejournal.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Idaho

Aramco has deals in place with motor racing's iconic Formula 1, as well as with the International Cricket Council and the Indian Premier League domestic cricket competition.\n\nFIFA brought on Gazprom, the state-owned Russian energy giant, as a sponsor for the Russia 2018 edition of the World Cup, while Qatar Airways was a commercial partner last year when Qatar hosted the first-ever World Cup to take place in the Middle East.\n\nSaudi Arabia became the sole bidder for the 2034 World Cup in late October when Australia withdrew from the bidding process just before a FIFA deadline (only

Hosts of that tournament will be decided next month in a three-candidate vote.\n\nThe value of the Aramco deal was not disclosed but is likely the richest ever for FIFA by average annual value. The inaugural 32-team Club World Cup being hosted next year in the U.S. was not specified by FIFA though could be part of a separate deal.\n\n\"Through the partnership, Aramco and FIFA intend to leverage the power of football to create impactful social initiatives around the world,\" the football body said in a statement.\n\nSaudi sponsorship will help fuel income for FIFA's 2023-26 commercial cycle which was conservatively budgeted to be $11 billion.\n\nRevenue from broadcasting, sponsorship, licensing video games plus sales of tickets and hospitality packages was $7.5 billion for the four-year period tied to the 2022 World Cup in Qatar.\n\nFIFA President Gianni Infantino has built close ties to Saudi Arabia and its Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman since before the 2018 World Cup. That tournament in Russia was sponsored by state energy firm Gazprom.\n\nThe FIFA-Saudi links were maintained through fallout from the 2018 killing of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi and despite critics making claims of \"sportswashing\" by the kingdom to improve its reputation.\n\nThe 2034 World Cup bidding was unexpectedly opened last October in a fast-track process seemingly expressly designed for Saudi Arabia to win, with only FIFA member federations in Asia and Oceania allowed to compete. It was made possible by FIFA brokering a three-continent deal announced the same day for the 2030 World Cup which will be played in Spain, Portugal, Morocco, Argentina, Paraguay and Uruguay.\n\nSaudi Arabia was confirmed as the only 2034 candidate by the end of that month. Both the 2030 and 2034 decisions must be rubber-stamped by FIFA member federations later this year. No date or venue has been announced for the 211-member meeting.\n\nThose members are in line for increased annual payments from FIFA in the decade leading to the Saudi-hosted World Cup.\n\nFIFA's development program pays each federation up to $8 million over four years through 2026 with more available for specific projects such as stadiums, training centers and federation headquarters.\n\nAlso

in Qatar, which also had a top-tier sponsor from the fossil fuel industry: Qatar Energy.\n\nThe Visit Saudi tourist board was a third-tier sponsor of the tournament in Qatar, though a planned deal for the 2023 Women's World Cup was ended after pushback by organisers in Australia and New Zealand.\n\nFootball officials in those host countries cited the importance of gender equality in a reference to the limits on women's freedoms in traditionally conservative Saudi society.\n\nSaudi football officials stress life there is changing fast as part of the Vision 2030 program to modernise society and the economy, directed by the crown prince, widely known as MBS.\n\nFootball, sports and entertainment have been key elements to the program with headline investments including the breakaway LIV Golf tour and buying English Premier League club Newcastle, which played in the Champions League within two years of a Saudi-backed takeover.\n\nThe Saudi domestic league was boosted with huge salaries to lure a slew of star players including Cristiano Ronaldo and Neymar to clubs which were effectively nationalised last year by the sovereign wealth Public Investment Fund chaired by the crown prince.\n\nLatest on SportstarFIFA seals closer ties to Saudi Arabia with World Cup sponsor deal for oil firm Aramco APSRH vs RCB Live Score updates, IPL 2024: Head falls early in chase for Sunrisers

The Middle Eastern country was effectively handed the rights to host the 2034 World Cup after FIFA quietly altered its rules - and the governing body has now opened up its coffers to Saudi oil money.\n\nAramco - the world's largest fossil fuel company which is 98.5 per cent owned by the Saudi state - has signed a four-year contract to become a major global partner of FIFA, meaning it will be front and centre at the men's 2026 World Cup and women's World Cup in 2027. According to the announcement, the deal sees the two come together to \"build on a shared commitment to innovation and development\".\n\nBut the news has been met by dismay from environmental campaigners, who labelled Saudi Arabia as the world's worst sportswasher in November. Aramco is rated as the dirtiest fossil fuel company in the world, having produced the most emissions of any company since the Paris climate agreement in 2015, while it also lags behind its competitors on its climate pledges. Aramco says it has \"one of the lowest upstream carbon footprints in the industry\".\n\nBut The Centre for Climate Reporting has personally accused Bin Salman of \"overseeing a sweeping global investment program designed to counteract the world's efforts to reduce demand for oil and tackle climate change\". FIFA's deal therefore not only shows its endorsement of Saudi Arabia, but also its disregard for action against climate change.\n\n\"By allowing Saudi Aramco to attach its brand to its showpiece World Cup tournaments, FIFA are granting them the opportunity to normalise dirty fossil fuels to billions of fans at a time when the world needs to stop burning fossil fuels as quickly as possible,\" said Frank Huisingh of Fossil Free Football. \"Fans want FIFA to take serious climate action, rather than sell out to the world's biggest polluters.\"\n\nFreddie Daley, from the Badvertising campaign, added: \"FIFA is responsible for the future of football and its global fanbase, but this deal is a complete dereliction of that duty. It could not be simpler: if Saudi Aramco's production plans go ahead then football faces an increasingly perilous future, where large parts of the planet will be completely inhospitable to the game.\n\nFIFA president Gianni Infantino is close to Saudi Arabia's crown prince Mohammed bin Salman\n\nHAVE YOUR SAY! What do you make of the FIFA sponsorship deal? Comment below.\n\n\"Instead of trying to build a world where football can be a truly global game, FIFA is taking cash from a company that is condemning humanity to more heat, more floods and less football.\"\n\nThe sponsorship deal is the latest in a long list of moves by Saudi Arabia to ingratiate itself in the world of sport.

Hosts of that tournament will be decided next month in a three-candidate vote.\n\nThe value of the Aramco deal was not disclosed but is likely the richest ever for FIFA by average annual value. The inaugural 32-team Club World Cup being hosted next year in the U.S. was not specified by FIFA though could be part of a separate deal.\n\n\"Through the partnership, Aramco and FIFA intend to leverage the power of football to create impactful social initiatives around the world,\" the soccer body said in a statement.\n\nSaudi sponsorship will help fuel income for FIFA's 2023-26 commercial cycle which was conservatively budgeted to be $11 billion.\n\nRevenue from broadcasting, sponsorship, licensing video games plus sales of tickets and hospitality packages was $7.5 billion for the four-year period tied to the 2022 World Cup in Qatar.\n\nFIFA President Gianni Infantino has built close ties to Saudi Arabia and its Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman since before the 2018 World Cup. That tournament in Russia was sponsored by state energy firm Gazprom.\n\nThe FIFA-Saudi links were maintained through fallout from the 2018 killing of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi and despite critics making claims of \"sportswashing\" by the kingdom to improve its reputation.\n\nThe 2034 World Cup bidding was unexpectedly opened last October in a fast-track process seemingly expressly designed for Saudi Arabia to win, with only FIFA member federations in Asia and Oceania allowed to compete. It was made possible by FIFA brokering a three-continent deal announced the same day for the 2030 World Cup which will be played in Spain, Portugal, Morocco, Argentina, Paraguay and Uruguay.\n\nSaudi Arabia was confirmed as the only 2034 candidate by the end of that month. Both the 2030 and 2034 decisions must be rubber-stamped by FIFA member federations later this year. No date or venue has been announced for the 211-member meeting.\n\nThose members are in line for increased annual payments from FIFA in the decade leading to the Saudi-hosted World Cup.\n\nFIFA's development program pays each federation up to $8 million over four years through 2026 with more available for specific projects such as stadiums, training centers and federation headquarters.\n\nFIFA already had reserves of $4 billion after the 2022 World Cup in Qatar, which also had a top-tier sponsor from the fossil fuel industry: Qatar Energy.\n\nThe Visit Saudi tourist board was a third-tier sponsor of the tournament in Qatar, though a planned deal for the 2023 Women's World Cup was ended after pushback by organizers in Australia and New Zealand.\n\nSoccer officials in those host countries cited the importance of gender equality in a reference to the limits on women's freedoms in traditionally conservative Saudi society.\n\nSaudi soccer officials stress life there is changing fast as part of the Vision 2030 program to modernize society and the economy, directed by the crown prince, widely known as MBS.\n\nSoccer, sports and entertainment have been key elements to the program with headline investments including the breakaway LIV Golf tour and buying English Premier League club Newcastle, which played in the Champions League within two years of a Saudi-backed takeover.\n\nThe Saudi domestic league was boosted with huge salaries to lure a slew of star players including Cristiano Ronaldo and Neymar to clubs which were effectively nationalized last year by the sovereign wealth Public Investment Fund chaired by the crown prince.", "source": {"uri": "washingtontimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Washington Times"}, "authors": [{"uri":

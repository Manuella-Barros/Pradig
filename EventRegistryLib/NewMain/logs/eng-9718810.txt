It took awhile for it to sink in.\n\n\"I wasn't fully comfortable with some of the people that were passed over. I have a lot of respect for the people that came before me and people that deserve to be in this position, so that was a heavy thought and moment.\"\n\nOnce Bradley composed himself, he realized he had his own phone call to make. It was to Tiger Woods.\n\n\"I've been grateful -- before I accepted this job I needed to talk to Tiger and I wanted to make sure I -- I wanted to hear from him,\" Bradley said. \"We had a great conversation. I certainly need his input.\"\n\nWoods was widely viewed as the heir to the captaincy, but after considering his current obligations, he decided it was in the PGA's best interest to go with someone else. The PGA read a statement from Woods at Bradley's introductory news conference.\n\n\"With my new responsibilities to the tour and time commitments involved I felt I would not be able to commit the time to Team USA and the players required as a captain,\" Woods said in the statement. \"That does not mean I wouldn't want to captain a team in the future. If/when I feel it is the right time, I will put my hat in the ring for this committee to decide.\"\n\nWith Woods out, the PGA of America had to look in a different direction to succeed Johnson, the previous captain who is on the Ryder Cup committee.\n\nThey decided to go with the 38-year-old Bradley, the youngest U.S. Ryder Cup captain since a 34-year-old Arnold Palmer in 1963.\n\nBradley competed in the Ryder Cup in 2012 and 2014, both losses for the Americans. He has long talked about wanting to redeem those results, famously holding onto his packed 2012 bag and vowing not to open it until he's a Ryder Cup winner.\n\nAfter two PGA Tour victories, a runner-up finish and six top-10s last season, including in the Tour Championship, Bradley was considered a candidate for the 2023 team. But he was not selected by Johnson. That devastated Bradley, whose reaction to being rejected was captured on the Netflix golf documentary series \"Full Swing.\"\n\nNow the team captain, Bradley still believes he's got what it takes to qualify for the team. He is No. 19 in the world ranking, after all. And he was clear in his intention to do just that, a feat that would make him the first U.S. Ryder Cup playing captain since Palmer in '63 if he could pull it off.\n\n\"I feel as though I'm still in the prime of my career and can make this team,\" Bradley said.\n\nBradley is perhaps the most familiar American player with the 2025 course, Bethpage Black on Long Island. He grew up playing there in college, where he attended St. John's University. He even joked about skipping class to play at Bethpage.\n\n\"I'm not going to pick myself,\" Bradley said. \"The only way that would happen is if the team was insisting it but even if they did I don't see that happening. I want to make the team on points, otherwise I'm going to be the captain.\"\n\nAP golf: https://apnews.com/hub/golf", "source": {"uri": "register-herald.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Beckley Register-Herald"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keegan_Bradley", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Keegan Bradley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captain_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Captain (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiger_Woods", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tiger Woods"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryder_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ryder Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zach_Johnson", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Zach Johnson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York (state)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Associated Press"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arnold_Palmer", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Arnold Palmer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional_Golfers'_Association_of_America", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Professional Golfers' Association of America"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PGA_Tour", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "PGA Tour"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Full_Swing_(2023_TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Full Swing (2023 TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tour_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tour Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bethpage_Black_Course", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bethpage Black Course"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._John's_University_(New_York_City)", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "St. John's University (New York City)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Official_World_Golf_Ranking", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Official World Golf Ranking"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long_Island", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Long Island"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Long Island"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Golf"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netflix", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Netflix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bethpage,_New_York", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bethpage, New York"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Bethpage, New York"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Paintball/Teams", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Paintball/Teams", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Robotics/Competitions", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Robotics/Competitions", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Competitions", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Competitions", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/CONMEBOL", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/CONMEBOL", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Golfers", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Golfers", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 58}], "image": "https://bloximages.chicago2.vip.townnews.com/register-herald.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/7/67/767fb0d3-aa33-5cf3-9281-261b28dc859c/668c530b8b5ba.image.jpg?crop=1763%2C926%2C0%2C124&resize=1200%2C630&order=crop%2Cresize", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9718810", "eventUri": "eng-9718810", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.08235294117647052, "wgt": 224, "relevance": 1}

It took a while for it to sink in. I wasn't fully comfortable with some of the people that were passed over. I have a lot of respect for the people that came before me and people that deserve to be in this position, so that was a heavy thought and moment.\"\n\nBradley is widely considered an outside-the-box choice for an American team that was reeling after an ugly 16 \u00bd-11 \u00bd loss to the European team at Marco Simone Golf and Country Club outside Rome last year.\n\nAt 38, Bradley will be the youngest U.S. captain since Arnold Palmer was a 34-year-old playing captain at East Lake Golf Club in Atlanta in 1963.\n\nBradley, a six-time PGA Tour winner, believes he's still in the prime of his career and hopes to make the U.S. team on points. He said he wouldn't use a captain's choice to pick himself.\n\nWhen Johnson and Waugh called Bradley, Waugh told him: \"You know, your number was called, it's time for you to step up.\"\n\n\"When he told me that I sort of, it sort of hit me, you know, that this is a heavy job and this is a group of people that trusted me in this, and it's time to step up to the plate and be the captain of this team,\" Bradley said.\n\nIronically, it was Johnson who had to break the news to Bradley that he'd been left off the 2023 Ryder Cup team. Bradley had been a two-time winner on the PGA Tour last season and finished 11th in the Ryder Cup points standings.\n\nJohnson didn't use one of his captain's picks on Bradley and chose Rickie Fowler and struggling Justin Thomas, who finished below him in points. At the time, Bradley said he'd always felt like an outsider in the sport and had tried to get closer to the golfers who would probably make the team.\n\nGolf fans saw Bradley's disappointment when Netflix's \"Full Swing\" captured the moment when Johnson called to deliver the bad news. Then the golf reality show captured Bradley and his family cheering for the U.S. team about two months later.\n\n\"So, that moment was real,\" Bradley said. \"I was crushed. It took us a while to get over that -- our whole family. We were devastated. But I'm American, I root for the Americans to win the Ryder Cup. I watch, whether I'm playing or whether I'm not. ... I know what a tough decision Zach had. Picking the guys that he picked were great choices. I would have done the same.\"\n\nBradley was chosen by the U.S. Ryder Cup committee only after fifteen-time major champion Tiger Woods declined to take on the role because of his busy schedule as a board member of the PGA Tour and PGA Tour Enterprises, which is continuing to negotiate a potential deal with Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund.\n\nBradley said he has spoken to Woods several times over the past two weeks.\n\n\"We, as players, we all look up to Tiger and his opinion means a lot to us,\" Bradley said. \"Being in team rooms with Tiger, the public doesn't realize how important this is to him. It's everything. He lives and breathes this event. I think it shows you how much he cares by turning this position down, because he didn't feel like he could put in what he needed to do with all of his responsibilities with what's going on with the tour.\"\n\nIn a statement released by the PGA of America on Tuesday, Woods said: \"With my new responsibilities to the tour and time commitments involved, I felt I would not be able to commit the time to Team USA and the players required as a captain. That does not mean I wouldn't want to captain a team in the future. If/when I feel it is the right time, I will put my hat in the ring for this committee to decide.\"\n\nOther potential candidates for the captain's role included Stewart Cink, Webb Simpson, Fred Couples and Davis Love III. Phil Mickelson would have seemed like a natural choice until he helped recruit players to the rival LIV Golf League and was suspended by the PGA Tour.\n\nBradley and Mickelson were past partners in the Ryder Cup -- they were 3-0 in Bradley's first Ryder Cup at Medinah Country Club in 2012. But Bradley doesn't envision the six-time major champion being one of his vice captains.\n\n\"I still have a great relationship with Phil,\" Bradley said. \"I don't think he's interested in being a vice captain, to be honest with you. He's a captain someday, I think. But I haven't spoken to Phil. I don't want to speak for him at all, but I think he's pretty busy with what he's doing. I have nothing but great things to say about Phil and our memories together, and what we did at the Ryder Cup is really my fondest memories in the game.\"\n\nBradley said he wouldn't hesitate to use a captain's pick on a player from the LIV Golf League. Brooks Koepka was the only one from the rival circuit who competed for the U.S. in Rome.\n\n\"I'm going to have the 12 best players on the team,\" Bradley said. \"I don't care where they play. We have a mission to win this tournament. I'm not worried about the LIV stuff. I want the best players on the team. By the time we get to Bethpage in 2025, we have no clue how the layout of the golf world's going to be.\"", "source": {"uri": "espn.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ESPN.com"}, "authors": [],

(PGA CEO) Seth Waugh said to me, 'Your number was called and it's time for you to step up.' \"\n\nBradley, a six-time PGA Tour winner, including the 2011 PGA Championship, has played in two Ryder Cups - none since 2014 - and one Presidents Cup. He has never been an assistant captain or captain for either biennial competition. Bradley, who will be 39 at the time of next year's Ryder Cup, will be the youngest Ryder Cup captain since 34-year-old Arnold Palmer was a playing captain in 1963. Bradley, who is ranked No. 19 in the Official World Golf Ranking and 37th in this season's FedEx Cup standings, said he'd like to make the team as a player but would have to earn enough points to be an automatic qualifier.\n\nBradley's selection is a departure from how the U.S. side has been picking its captain since the Ryder Cup Task Force was formed after its defeat in Scotland in 2014. Phil Mickelson often had talked about his desire to be the captain of the Ryder Cup at Bethpage Black but forfeited that honor when he joined LIV Golf. Tiger Woods, who served as the winning captain of the 2019 Presidents Cup and was an eight-time Ryder Cup participant, was the frontrunner for the job but elected to pass on the position this time around.\n\n\"With my new responsibilities to the Tour and time commitments involved, I felt I would not be able to commit the time to Team USA and the players required as a captain,\" Woods said in a statement. \"It doesn't mean I wouldn't want to captain a team in the future. If, when I feel it is the right time, I will put my hat in the ring for this committee to decide.\"\n\nKeegan Bradley celebrates with the trophy after winning the final round of the Travelers Championship at TPC River Highlands on June 25, 2023 in Cromwell, Connecticut. (Photo by Stacy Revere/Getty Images)\n\nBradley was left off the 2023 U.S. team that lost in Rome in September despite finishing 11th in the point standings and ahead of captain's picks Rickie Fowler and Justin Thomas. The world witnessed his disappointment in the Netflix documentary \"Full Swing,\" when he received a phone call from then-captain Zach Johnson that he didn't make the team.\n\n\"I was crushed,\" Bradley said.\n\nPGA President John Lindert said that the Ryder Cup selection committee held a phone call a little over two weeks ago and that Bradley was the unanimous choice for the job. He didn't even have to interview for the post. Bradley was informed of his selection during a phone call as he was driving home from the Travelers Championship and Johnson delivered the good news this time.\n\nDespite being a diehard New England Patriots and Boston Red Sox fan, Bradley has ties to New York having attended St. John's University in Queens.\n\n\"My New Yorkers only care that you bleed red, white and blue and that you win,\" said two-time Super Bowl winning QB Eli Manning, formerly of the New York Giants.\n\nBradley admitted that he often skipped classes on Monday in college when the course superintendent allowed the team to park near the maintenance area and play hole Nos. 3-14 at Bethpage Black when the course is closed. One day, during his senior year, Bradley slipped on to the famous stretch of 15-18 and it didn't end well.\n\n\"The police were called,\" he said.\n\nBradley, the son of a PGA professional, grew up in Vermont and was 13 when his father took him to the 1999 Ryder Cup in Brookline, Massachusetts, and watched from his father's shoulders as Justin Leonard made a famous putt at the 17thgreen at The Country Club to help lead Team USA to the greatest comeback in Ryder Cup history. Bradley recalled running on the 18th green to join in the celebration.\n\n\"It changed my life,\" he said.\n\nBradley made the U.S side in 2012 and was on the other end of blowing a 10-6 lead to the Europeans. Bradley promised that he wouldn't open his Ryder Cup suitcase until his team won. He was a captain's pick when the U.S. lost in 2014. More than a decade later, the bag remains shut.\n\n\"I hope to open it someday,\" he said.\n\nBradley noted that he would choose the best 12 players regardless of whether they played on the PGA Tour or LIV, and that he would be looking to include some younger vice captains to help set up future choices for captains.\n\n\"I've only been the captain for two weeks,\" Bradley said, \"but I already find myself staring at the ceiling at 2 a.m. thinking about every situation.\"", "source": {"uri": "golfweek.usatoday.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Golfweek"}, "authors": [{"uri":

It took a while for it to sink in. I wasn't fully comfortable with some of the people who were passed over. So that was a heavy thought and moment.\"\n\nBradley, 38, will be the youngest U.S. captain since Arnold Palmer served as a 34-year-old playing captain in 1963 at East Lake, with times having changed considerably since the days when the U.S. routinely beat a team comprised of Great Britain & Ireland.\n\nAlthough the Americans have won two of the last three Ryder Cups over what is now a team from all of Europe, they've not won overseas since 1993. And Bradley's exclusion last year after winning twice during the season, including the Travelers in June, while players such as Justin Thomas and Rickie Fowler made the team led to an outcry that Johnson was playing favorites.\n\nThat narrative became stronger in the aftermath of a Netflix documentary that was released this spring in which Johnson was seen joking around with Thomas and Jordan Spieth, with whom he shared a rental home last year at the British Open. It hit harder when the cameras were there to capture Bradley's reaction as he was called by Johnson to be told he wouldn't be on the team.\n\n\"That moment was real,\" Bradley said. \"I was crushed. It took us a while to get over that. Our whole family. We were devastated. But I root for the Americans to win the Ryder Cup. I know all the guys on the team. I bleed red, white and blue. And I was thrilled to be able to watch these guys. And I was pulling for them.\n\n\"It was weird not being there and thinking I could have maybe helped. I know how hard a decision it was for Zach. I have a different perspective of what he was going through. I've only been the captain for two weeks. And I find myself staring at the ceiling thinking of every situation. I have nothing but admiration and respect for Zach Johnson.\"\n\nBradley's appointment became possible when Tiger Woods turned down the job sometime in late June. The 15-time major champion was mulling a decision on whether to take on the job for months and was given plenty of time to make up his mind.\n\nIn a statement, Woods said his commitments to the PGA Tour Policy Board as a player director ultimately preclude him from doing the job properly. \"That does not mean I wouldn't want to captain a team in the future,\" Woods said. \"If and when I feel it is the right, I will put my hat in the ring for this committee to decide.\"\n\nThe Ryder Cup committee is made up of Waugh, Lindert and PGA vice president Don Rea along with Johnson, Spieth and Thomas. They ultimately decided on the captain and Lindert said it came together quickly.\n\nWoods also quickly got behind Bradley, who said he reached out to him soon after getting the call.\n\n\"I've spoken to Tiger a bunch,\" Bradley said. \"He's been very helpful. He's a great voice to hear. He's been reaching out to me and helping me which has been amazing.\"\n\nAsked about a possible vice-captain role for Woods at Bethpage, Bradley said: \"I told him he can be as involved as he wants to be. We haven't talked about vice captains. We as players, we all look up to Tiger as his opinion means a lot to us. Being in team rooms with Tiger ... the public doesn't realize how important this is to him. I think it shows you how much he cares by turning this position down.\"\n\nBradley also had praise for Phil Mickelson, whom he partnered with in all five of his team Ryder Cup matches in 2012 and 2014. Bradley said he hasn't spoken to Mickelson -- who years was penciled in for the captaincy at Brookline before his move to LIV Golf, but doesn't anticipate the six-time major winner being involved next year.\n\n\"I still have a great relationship with Phil,\" Bradley said. \"I don't think he's interested in being a vice captain. To be honest with you, he's a captain someday. I don't want to speak for him at all. I have nothing but great things to say about Phil and what we did in the Ryder Cup.\"\n\nAs for LIV players, Bradley said he'd attend LIV events if necessary to evaluate them and wanted to put to rest any of the fractures that exist in the game.\n\n\"I'm going to have the 12 best players on the team,\" he said \"I don't care where they play. We have a mission to win this tournament. I'm not worried about the LIV stuff. By the time we get to Bethpage in 2025, we have no clue how the layout is going to be.\"\n\nBradley said he doesn't anticipate any change to the points structure, which has already started with points being offered this year at the majors and the Players Championship.\n\nHe said he will look at the number of captain's picks -- currently six of the 12 players -- but hasn't investigated that thoroughly.\n\nBeing at tournaments regularly and competing with the players who he will captain, he believes, will be a help. And he didn't rule out making the team on his own but wouldn't pick himself if he failed to automatically qualify.\n\nBradley, who was 4-3 in his two Ryder Cup appearances and his six victories on the PGA Tour, spoke passionately about his love for the event and about how much it pained him to lose in his two appearances.\n\nHe told the story again about how a suitcase he took to the 2012 Ryder Cup remains unopened, with a pledge to not do so until he's on a winning team. But he said \"I loved every second of it.\"\n\n\"Being on a Ryder Cup team changes your life forever,\" he said. \"Being in the room with those guys and feeling the extreme pressure of this tournament will change you. The thought of being a Ryder Cup captain is something most of us never even think about. I never knew if I'd get this opportunity. I'm so honored to be the leader of this team and going to Bethpage to win the Ryder Cup back.\"", "source": {"uri": "si.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sports Illustrated"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keegan_Bradley", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Keegan Bradley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zach_Johnson", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Zach Johnson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiger_Woods", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tiger Woods"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryder_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ryder Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PGA_Tour", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "PGA Tour"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Europe"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Lake_Golf_Club", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "East Lake Golf Club"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bethpage_Black_Course", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bethpage Black Course"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York (state)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arnold_Palmer", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Arnold Palmer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travelers_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Travelers Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional_Golfers'_Association_of_America", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Professional Golfers' Association of America"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jordan_Spieth", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jordan Spieth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phil_Mickelson", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Phil Mickelson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Britain", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Great Britain"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rome", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rome"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Rome"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ireland", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ireland"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ireland"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonathan_Rea", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jonathan Rea"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rickie_Fowler", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rickie Fowler"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Vice President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Open_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Open Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netflix", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Netflix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LIV_Golf", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "LIV Golf"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Players_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Players Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Senior_major_golf_championships", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Senior major golf championships"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brookline,_Massachusetts", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Brookline, Massachusetts"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Brookline, Massachusetts"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 57}], "image": "https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_crop,w_6477,h_3643,x_280,y_97/c_fill,w_1440,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/images/ImagnImages/mmsport/si/01j2c9tprhzg8z74jzts.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9718810", "eventUri": "eng-9718810", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-15", "textStart": 2914, "textEnd": 2926}], "sentiment": 0.0980392156862746, "wgt": 220, "relevance": 1}

It was to Tiger Woods.\n\n\"I've been grateful -- before I accepted this job, I needed to talk to Tiger and I wanted to make sure I -- I wanted to hear from him,\" Bradley said. \"We had a great conversation. I certainly need his input.\"\n\nWoods was widely viewed as the heir to the captaincy, but after considering his current obligations, he decided it was in the PGA's best interest to go with someone else. The PGA read a statement from Woods at Bradley's introductory news conference.\n\n\"With my new responsibilities to the tour and time commitments involved, I felt I would not be able to commit the time to Team USA and the players required as a captain,\" Woods said in the statement. \"That does not mean I wouldn't want to captain a team in the future. If/when I feel it is the right time, I will put my hat in the ring for this committee to decide.\"\n\nWith Woods out, the PGA of America had to look in a different direction to succeed Johnson, the previous captain who is on the Ryder Cup committee. They decided to go with the 38-year-old Bradley, the youngest US Ryder Cup captain since a 34-year-old Arnold Palmer in 1963.\n\nBradley competed in the Ryder Cup in 2012 and 2014, both losses for the Americans. He has long talked about wanting to redeem those results, famously holding onto his packed 2012 bag and vowing not to open it until he's a Ryder Cup winner.\n\nAfter two PGA Tour victories, a runner-up finish, and six top-10s last season, including in the Tour Championship, Bradley was considered a candidate for the 2023 team. But he was not selected by Johnson. That devastated Bradley, whose reaction to being rejected was captured on the Netflix golf documentary series, \"Full Swing.\"\n\nNow the captain, Bradley still believes he's got what it takes to qualify for the team. He is No. 19 in the world ranking, after all. And he was clear in his intention to do just that, a feat that would make him the first US Ryder Cup playing captain since Palmer in '63 if he could pull it off.\n\n\"I feel as though I'm still in the prime of my career and can make this team,\" Bradley said.\n\nBradley is perhaps the most familiar American player with the 2025 course, Bethpage Black on Long Island. He grew up playing there in college, where he attended St. John's University. He even joked about skipping class to play at Bethpage.", "source": {"uri": "bostonglobe.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Boston Globe"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bradley_University", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bradley University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiger_Woods", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tiger Woods"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nasdaq", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nasdaq"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York (state)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_England", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New England"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New England"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryder_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ryder Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hopkinton,_Massachusetts", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hopkinton, Massachusetts"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Hopkinton, Massachusetts"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional_Golfers'_Association_(Great_Britain_and_Ireland)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Professional Golfers' Association (Great Britain and Ireland)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional_Golfers'_Association_of_America", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Professional Golfers' Association of America"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tour_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tour Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bethpage_Black_Course", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bethpage Black Course"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._John's_University_(New_York_City)", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "St. John's University (New York City)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arnold_Palmer", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Arnold Palmer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Official_World_Golf_Ranking", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Official World Golf Ranking"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PGA_Tour", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "PGA Tour"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long_Island", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Long Island"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Long Island"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Golf"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netflix", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Netflix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bethpage,_New_York", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bethpage, New York"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Bethpage, New York"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Competitions", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Competitions", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 73}], "image": "https://bostonglobe-prod.cdn.arcpublishing.com/resizer/Su0L1hhe5uhY9CRwjmZ2YH7oa30=/506x0/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/bostonglobe/D22IZZZTYWRGIJCGBUX3SIUW5Y.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9718810", "eventUri": "eng-9718810", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1764705882352942, "wgt": 213, "relevance": 1}

The news came quick, and from Johnson: Bradley was going to be the next U.S. Ryder Cup captain.\n\n\"Some pretty incredible news that I had no clue was coming,\" Bradley said.\n\nNot only did Bradley not expect the news; he didn't interview for the position, which was initially tabbed for Tiger Woods before Woods declined, citing his inability to commit the time to the job. Bradley, who with two Ryder Cups under his belt has the least experience of any previous U.S captain, was also picked over past assistant captains such as Stewart Cink and Matt Kuchar.\n\n\"I wasn't fully comfortable with some of the people that were passed over,\" Bradley said. \"I have a lot of respect for the people that came before me and people that deserve to be in this position, so that was a heavy thought and moment.\"\n\nAdded Lindert: \"We had a couple phone calls and talked about a variety of different attributes that we would want in our next captain. As you start to check off the boxes, and you have a PGA champion, you have somebody who went to school here, is familiar with the New York base, the fan base, is very familiar with Bethpage Black, is the son of a PGA member. There are a lot of boxes that Keegan checked off and his enthusiasm for the Ryder Cup stood out above everything else and we just felt that that was the ah-ha moment. When Keegan's name was mentioned, it was all hands went up and we were a hundred percent behind it.\"\n\nWhen it comes to Woods, Bradley said, \"I have told him he can be as involved as he wants to be.\" But Bradley also vowed to take a fresh approach with selecting who will captain alongside him.\n\nLast year, the U.S. vice captains were Steve Stricker, Davis Love III, Jim Furyk, Fred Couples and Cink.\n\n\"They're going to be a lot younger, closer to playing,\" Bradley said.\n\nWhile Bradley believes the current points system is good, he did hint at the possibility of adding \"a few more automatic qualifiers\" back into the fold. The U.S. changed from four picks to six prior to the 2021 Ryder Cup at Whistling Straits.\n\nBradley also was adamant that he would not pick himself should he fail to qualify for the 12-man U.S. team on points.\n\n\"I want to make the team on points, otherwise I'm going to be the captain,\" Bradley said.\n\nHe's currently No. 24 in the standings, so as of now, Bradley would not be a playing captain. Though he firmly believes that can change.\n\n\"I feel as though I'm still in the prime of my career and can make this team,\" Bradley added.\n\nBradley maintained that he still has a close relationship with Phil Mickelson, but he doesn't believe that Mickelson is interested in accepting a vice captain's role.\n\nBut as for potentially picking LIV players, Bradley didn't shy away from answering.\n\n\"I'm going to have the 12 best players on the team,\" Bradley said. \"I don't care where they play. So, we have a mission to win this tournament. I'm not worried about the LIV stuff. I want the best players on the team. By the time we get to Bethpage in 2025 we have no clue how the layout of the golf world's going to be. As it comes to going to LIV events, if there's guys that are on the fringe, I'm willing to do that.\"\n\nMuch of the past two years on Tour have been documented by Netflix cameras for the \"Full Swing\" docuseries, including Bradley's heartbreaking call from Johnson last year telling Bradley that he did not make the team for Rome. But the cameras were notably absent from the U.S. team room at Marco Simone, a decision made by the players.\n\nBradley was asked Tuesday if that would change next year.\n\n\"I had an unbelievable experience with Netflix,\" Bradley said. \"They were great to me. It was a big decision to put my family on TV. That's not a decision that's for everybody. And I've only been captain for two weeks, I have not broached this subject, I have not even thought about it, I don't know who is going to be on the team, but it's definitely a decision that's going to be based on what's best for the team. It's not something that is for everybody. It's a nerve-wracking process to go through being filmed all the time and that's something that I'll have to cross later on.\"", "source": {"uri": "nbcsports.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NBC Sports"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keegan_Bradley", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Keegan Bradley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zach_Johnson", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Zach Johnson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PGA_Tour", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "PGA Tour"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiger_Woods", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tiger Woods"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryder_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ryder Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stewart_Cink", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stewart Cink"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matt_Kuchar", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Matt Kuchar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bethpage_Black_Course", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bethpage Black Course"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Stricker", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Steve Stricker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whistling_Straits", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Whistling Straits"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Davis_Love_III", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Davis Love III"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Furyk", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jim Furyk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fred_Couples", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fred Couples"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "New York (state)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phil_Mickelson", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Phil Mickelson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Full_Swing_(2023_TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Full Swing (2023 TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Golf"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netflix", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Netflix"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 85}], "image": "https://nbcsports.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/5c1d8b9/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6000x3375+0+312/resize/1440x810!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fnbc-sports-production-nbc-sports.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fe8%2F15%2Ffcddf9dc4753a8a415b5e96e38e7%2Fhttps-delivery-gettyimages.com%2Fdownloads%2F2157492644", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9718810", "eventUri": "eng-9718810", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.0980392156862746, "wgt": 211, "relevance": 1}

Should he turn down the role, those in the know believed the opportunity would fall to somebody chalk-y like Stewart Cink or a former captain like Jim Furyk or Steve Stricker.\n\nThe indication that a current player would get the gig -- a current player snubbed from last year's Ryder Cup team, no less -- was never even a talking point. The selection of Keegan Bradley, who will be 39 when the Ryder Cup begins, was stunning for so many reasons. Among them: Bradley will be the first player in his 30s to helm the Americans in the last 60 years (Arnold Palmer, age 34, 1963).\n\nBradley's captaincy was formally announced Tuesday in New York, and there were some unique revelations -- including that he was never informed he was a candidate for the position before basically being assigned it by the PGA of America. The next year and change will be a wild ride for everyone involved, but this experiment can (and probably will) work for the U.S. side as it attempts to defend home turf at the Ryder Cup for the third consecutive tournament.\n\nCaring matters\n\nThere are a thousand characteristics that make a great Ryder Cup captain, but among the foremost reasons captains have traditionally been picked -- great playing resumes -- is absolutely not one of them. We will see whether Bradley is adept at strategy, logistics, handling media obligations and everything else that comes with a captaincy, but what will not be called into question for the entirety of his term is whether he's all the way in.\n\n\"Being on a Ryder Cup team changes your life forever,\" Bradley said. \"Being in the room with those guys and feeling the extreme pressure of this tournament will change you.\"\n\nIt echoed something he said when he narrowly missed making the team in Rome last year: \"I think about the Ryder Cup every second I'm awake.\"\n\nThat was clear given the way he took answered questions in great detail Tuesday: Bradley must indeed think about the Ryder Cup constantly because only somebody who does exactly that would have answered questions as he did.\n\nCaring is an underrated trait, and while everyone involved with the Ryder Cup as a player or captain or executive has a ton of pride, I'm not sure any of them truly care to the level Bradley does. And now, he has the opportunity to make every major decision as captain.\n\nBradley will not ignore vulnerability\n\nHalf of a captain's job is to lead with vulnerability -- to galvanize your players during an incredibly emotional week and embrace the varied feelings they experience as a group and individuals. Not all captains are willing to do this. Tom Watson would not. Tiger Woods, had he been selected, would not, either.\n\n\"I think the biggest thing is that week all coming together as a team,\" Bradley said. \"It's very difficult ... us golfers are individuals and we celebrate wins by ourselves, losses by ourselves, and that week is about coming together as a team, doing what's best for the team.\"\n\nThere are certain ways to try and make this happen, and Bradley will engage all of the most vulnerable ones.\n\nWhile this is not a prerequisite for winning, it's difficult to look at the Europeans' success -- and their willingness to embrace this emotion -- and not believe those two are somehow related. Others have done this well (Stricker was great at it), and Bradley appears poised to match them.\n\nPlaying captain?\n\nOne risk the PGA took (if you want to call it a risk) is that Bradley could easily be playing well enough in 2025 to either make the team on points or uncontroversially select himself as a captain's pick. Sure, Woods did this at the Presidents Cup, but the Presidents Cup is not the Ryder Cup, and Keegan Bradley is not Tiger Woods.\n\nI'm dubious that someone (really, anyone) can be prepared enough to take on both a Ryder Cup captain role and a playing one. Bradley famously finished 11th in the last Ryder Cup standings a year ago; he's currently 18th in the Presidents Cup standings. He certainly could play his way up to, say, 12th or 10th in the Ryder Cup standings next year.\n\nWhile he stated Tuesday that he will not pick himself, what if he's won three tournaments in a row to get in the top 12 and is playing the best golf of his life. Then what?\n\nVice captains will be paramount\n\nNormally, assistant captains are meaningful positions but not those that hold the utmost importance. They are there to encourage different groups of American players and provide feedback to the captain. Bradley appears poised to lean on them more heavily than recent predecessors. So, while the selection of assistant captains is normally a footnote in the two-year Ryder Cup cycle, this time around, it will be far more important as Bradley begins to put his organization together.\n\n\"I have John Wood, who is the manager of Team USA, which has never been a position for the U.S. Ryder Cup team,\" said Bradley, who also noted he will trend younger with the vice captains. \"He's been in a lot of team rooms; he knows all the guys aren't already has been an amazing help. I'm going to lean on my vice captains, and also some of the older players that -- I think Davis Love and Fred Couples and all these guys that have been in so many team rooms -- I hope that they will be willing to help me and I have a lot of people that are around to help me.\"\n\nEasy to rally around\n\nOne comment stood out from Bradley's reaction to being left off the Ryder Cup team a year ago: \"I love those guys -- [Justin Thomas] and Rickie [Fowler] and Jordan [Spieth] -- so much. I hate saying a negative word or thinking even a negative thought about them.\"\n\nThe New York crowds will not have a problem with anyone -- they would get behind me as captain -- as long as the Europeans are still the target. And Bradley will have them really rocking at Bethpage Black. What's underrated is that Bradley is the type of leader who players will be able to get behind without a second thought.\n\nWould that have always been the case throughout Bradley's career? Probably not, but it is certainly true now as he has matured while maintaining his love for the game and desire to be part of team events.\n\nSurely, at some juncture a year ago, the captain's picks chosen over Bradley felt a level of remorse that they took a spot from someone as passionate about the event Bradley. And their relationships are strong enough that those same guys will be overjoyed to take on the world for him in 2025.\n\nIn some odd way, given those relationships, the snub from 2023 may actually works to Bradley's advantage as captain.\n\nIt certainly does not hurt that ... they had a hand in picking him.\n\nNew era for the PGA\n\nPeople called for the United States to go in a different direction after last year's Ryder Cup debacle in Rome; the PGA of America instead stepped into a new universe. There is risk here, but there is also risk with every Ryder Cup captain.\n\nThe specific risk is that the formula in home matches was working. The U.S. didn't need to skip a generation and go straight to Bradley. They could have played it safe and chosen Stewart Cink, and the Americans likely would won Bethpage handily and then moved onto Ireland in 2027.\n\nInstead, the PGA flipped the script and changed the way a lot of people are going to think about the Ryder Cup, its captains and how building a team should be handled in the future. That's a positive, and this decision has an opportunity to pay off not just next year in New York but reverberate a long time afterward.", "source": {"uri": "cbssports.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CBS Sports"}, "authors": [{"uri": "kyle_porter@cbssports.com", "name": "Kyle Porter", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keegan_Bradley", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Keegan Bradley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional_Golfers'_Association_of_America", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Professional Golfers' Association of America"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiger_Woods", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tiger Woods"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryder_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ryder Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Stricker", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Steve Stricker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stewart_Cink", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stewart Cink"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bethpage_Black_Course", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bethpage Black Course"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Furyk", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jim Furyk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidents_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Presidents Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York (state)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arnold_Palmer", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Arnold Palmer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Watson_(golfer)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tom Watson (golfer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Europe"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rome", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rome"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Rome"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fred_Couples", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fred Couples"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manager_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Manager (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Golf"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bethpage,_New_York", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bethpage, New York"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Bethpage, New York"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ireland", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ireland"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ireland"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jordan", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jordan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Jordan"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Competitions", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Competitions", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/CONMEBOL", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/CONMEBOL", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 77}], "image": "https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/r/2024/07/09/432333e6-95b8-4713-a399-84b1b050e62b/thumbnail/1200x675/e24f43e9957f458fa30c64c8e0b5c03f/keegan-bradley-2024-memorial.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9718810", "eventUri": "eng-9718810", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.192156862745098, "wgt": 209, "relevance": 1}

I'm not worried about the LIV stuff.\"\n\nThe selection of Bradley, who is 38 and still a full-time member on the PGA Tour, is an unexpected change of pace. Recent Ryder Cup captains have typically been older players who are often considered past their playing prime and usually not competing on a weekly basis. Bradley, a two-time U.S. Ryder Cup team member, won the 2011 PGA Championship and is currently ranked No. 19 in the world.\n\nBut Bradley was the first man left off last year's U.S. team, a situation that was captured by Netflix cameras and eventually played out on Season 2 of Full Swing. The golfer's composure and relatability led to rave reviews for his episode of the docuseries. Bradley said he had an \"unbelievable experience\" with the show, but he pushed back on the notion that it led to his unconventional captaincy. \"I couldn't imagine that they would decide based on how Netflix portrayed me in filming,\" he said.\n\nLooking ahead to next fall, when the U.S. will host the Ryder Cup at Bethpage Black in New York, Bradley said it's too early to say whether the U.S. players will allow Netflix cameras to film inside their team room -- something they didn't do last year in Rome.", "source": {"uri": "frontofficesports.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Front Office Sports"}, "authors": [{"uri": "david_rumsey@frontofficesports.com", "name": "David Rumsey", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keegan_Bradley", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Keegan Bradley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PGA_Tour", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "PGA Tour"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captain_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Captain (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiger_Woods", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tiger Woods"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryder_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ryder Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_Investment_Fund", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Public Investment Fund"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Bowl_LIV", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Super Bowl LIV"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LIV_Golf", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "LIV Golf"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional_Golfers'_Association_(Great_Britain_and_Ireland)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Professional Golfers' Association (Great Britain and Ireland)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women's_major_golf_championships", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Women's major golf championships"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._Open_(golf)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "U.S. Open (golf)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Full_Swing_(2023_TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Full Swing (2023 TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bethpage_Black_Course", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bethpage Black Course"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "New York (state)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PGA_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "PGA Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netflix", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Netflix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rome", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rome"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Rome"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Paintball/Teams", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Paintball/Teams", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Competitions", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Competitions", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Organizations", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 96}], "image": "https://frontofficesports.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/PGA.07.09.24.JEP_9231-scaled.jpg?quality=100", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9718810", "eventUri": "eng-9718810", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3176470588235294, "wgt": 206, "relevance": 1}

I want to make the team on points, otherwise I'm going to be the captain.\"\n\nWhether he plays or not, Bradley's captaincy is already tied to Palmer. At 38 years old, Bradley is the youngest U.S. captain since a 34-year-old Palmer led the team in '63.\n\nHe said he will soak in advice from his predecessors, but plans to refresh the staff with a youthful approach.\n\n\"What's personally important to me is I would like the vice captains to set up the future,\" Bradley said.\n\nBradley competed in the Ryder Cup in 2012 and 2014, both losses for the Americans. He has long talked about wanting to make it back to the Ryder Cup to redeem those results.\n\nAP golf: https://apnews.com/hub/golf", "source": {"uri": "eagletribune.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Eagle-Tribune"}, "authors": [{"uri": "ryan_kryska@eagletribune.com", "name": "Ryan Kryska", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keegan_Bradley", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Keegan Bradley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captain_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Captain (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryder_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ryder Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "New York (state)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arnold_Palmer", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Arnold Palmer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional_Golfers'_Association_of_America", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Professional Golfers' Association of America"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bethpage_Black_Course", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bethpage Black Course"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Associated Press"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Golf"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Paintball/Teams", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Paintball/Teams", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Robotics/Competitions", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Robotics/Competitions", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Competitions", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Competitions", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Airsoft/Teams", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Airsoft/Teams", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/CONMEBOL", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/CONMEBOL", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 75}], "image": "https://bloximages.chicago2.vip.townnews.com/eagletribune.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/c/b5/cb5975ad-83b0-5a44-a72d-0859e1cd56c7/668d8c5bc9451.image.jpg?crop=1763%2C926%2C0%2C124&resize=1200%2C630&order=crop%2Cresize", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9718810", "eventUri": "eng-9718810", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1215686274509804, "wgt": 205, "relevance": 1}

I was in complete shock. It was heavy and I was a little bit uncomfortable with some of the guys, my idols, that were looked over for this position and I needed a second to figure that out.\n\n\"But something Seth [Waugh, PGA of America chief executive] said to me was, 'your number was called, it's time for you to step up'.\"\n\nBradley played on losing sides in 2012 - winning his first three matches with Phil Mickelson - and 2014, and was controversially overlooked for a wild card last year having won twice on the PGA Tour.\n\nThe moment he was given the bad news by Johnson was captured on Netflix documentary \"Full Swing\", with Bradley admitting he was \"crushed\".\n\n\"It took me a while to get over that, we were devastated, my whole family,\" Bradley said at a press conference in New York.\n\n\"I bleed red, white and blue and I was thrilled to be able to watch these guys and I was pulling for them. It was a weird feeling knowing that I could have been there and maybe helped the team, but I know what a tough decision Zach had.\n\n\"I've only been the captain for two weeks and I find myself staring at the ceiling at 2am thinking about every single situation, so I have a different perspective now and I have nothing but admiration and respect for Zach Johnson.\"\n\nBradley believes playing on the PGA Tour with his prospective team members will help make up for a lack of captaincy experience but insisted he would not pick himself.\n\n\"I want to play on the team. I feel as though I'm still in the prime of my career,\" Bradley said.\n\n\"I'm not going to pick myself. The only way that would happen is if the team was insisting on it. But even if they did, I don't see that happening.\n\n\"I want to make the team on points, otherwise I'm going to be the captain.\"\n\nWoods gave a short statement which was read out during the press conference and will be a heavy favourite to captain the side at Adare Manor in 2027.\n\n\"With my new responsibilities to the [PGA] Tour, and time commitments involved, I felt I would not be able to commit the time to Team USA and the players required as a captain,\" Woods said.\n\n\"That does not mean I wouldn't want to captain a team in the future. If and when I feel it is the right time, I will put my hat in the ring.\"\n\nBradley said: \"I have told him he can be as involved as he wants to be. We all look up to Tiger and his opinion means a lot to us.\n\n\"The public doesn't realise how important this is to him. He lives and breathes this event and I think it shows you how much he cares by turning this position down because he didn't feel like he could put in what he needed to.\"", "source": {"uri": "aol.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo News"}, "authors": [{"uri": "phil_casey@aol.co.uk", "name": "Phil Casey", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keegan_Bradley", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Keegan Bradley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zach_Johnson", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Zach Johnson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryder_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ryder Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phil_Mickelson", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Phil Mickelson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiger_Woods", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Tiger Woods"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stewart_Cink", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stewart Cink"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bethpage_Black_Course", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bethpage Black Course"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fred_Couples", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fred Couples"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PGA_Tour", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "PGA Tour"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_men's_national_soccer_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States men's national soccer team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Golf"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pennsylvania", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pennsylvania"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Pennsylvania"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Full_Swing_(2023_TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Full Swing (2023 TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "New York (state)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional_Golfers'_Association_of_America", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Professional Golfers' Association of America"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wild_card_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Wild card (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netflix", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Netflix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adare_Manor", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Adare Manor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Paintball/Teams", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Paintball/Teams", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Robotics/Competitions", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Robotics/Competitions", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Online_Writing/Drama", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Online Writing/Drama", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Golfers", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Golfers", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Education_and_Training/Team_Building", "label": "dmoz/Business/Education and Training/Team Building", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 73}], "image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/Bp2E3kUADQef1fKVDh.tBQ--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD02NzU-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/aol_press_association_sport_600/bceec6357d86a3f9b8c4af67bc69ef77", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9718810", "eventUri": "eng-9718810", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1137254901960785, "wgt": 204, "relevance": 1}

At least this time around, the news has nothing to do with fractures, division or defection. This week brought the legitimately shocking news that Keegan Bradley will captain the 2025 Ryder Cup team -- this, just months after Bradley was passed over for the 2023 team and had his heart ripped out of his chest in HD on Netflix's \"Full Swing\" documentary.\n\nBradley is a bold choice for captain, some would say a foolish choice ... but here are 12 reasons why this is the right choice. (Why 12 and not the typical golf-list 18? Read on.)\n\n1. Sometimes the Golf Gods even the scales. Bradley didn't quite perform well enough to earn an automatic slot on the 2023 team, and that meant his fate was in then-captain Zach Johnson's hands. That turned out to be bad news indeed for Bradley, since Johnson opted to go with frequent housemates Rickie Fowler, Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas. On the Ryder Cup points list, Bradley ranked higher than three of the captain's picks, but was left at home. (To be fair, Cam Young ranked higher than four and also wasn't selected.) Bradley has spent most of his pro career focused on the Ryder Cup, and thus, watching him receive Johnson's awkward no-go call on \"Full Swing\" was absolutely gutting.\n\n2. Bradley might be the most passionate player on the American side. While Europe treats the Ryder Cup as a sacred challenge, American players tend to view it as another stop on the calendar. Win, lose, oh well, there's another tournament to be played. Granted, that's an oversimplification, but the Americans give the vibe of a band of lone wolves, while the Europeans always feel like a team. Bradley's passion for the Cup is flat-out European, and if he's able to project that enthusiasm onto his team, good results will follow.\n\n3. There's that famous suitcase. Bradley doesn't have the experience of most Ryder Cup captains -- he's only played in two, and he has a career 4-3 record -- but he's already checked the \"obsessive\" box. After the United States' 2012 collapse at Medinah, a despondent Bradley returned home and just collapsed, to the point that he didn't even open his suitcase from that day. It's sat unopened for 12 years, a time capsule of a moment and a testament to his singular focus. We can only hope, for Bradley's sake, that he didn't leave any dirty clothes in there. Still, it's a sign that Bradley is either absurdly devoted to Ryder Cup success or a little bit off-center, both of which are good qualities in a U.S. captain.\n\n4. The home-field advantage. Look, let's be honest -- the home-field advantage at the Ryder Cup is so substantial that anyone from Judge Smails to Happy Gilmore to could lead the U.S. to victory. The home squad has won 11 of the last 13 Cups, with an average winning margin of five points. If Bradley can't win with the combination of the inherent talent on the U.S. side and the home-court boost, well, the United States has much bigger problems than just the captain.\n\n5. Bradley knows Bethpage. Bradley attended college at St. John's in Queens, only about 30 miles or so from Bethpage Black, the 2025 Ryder Cup host course. While at St. John's, he and teammates would sneak onto the course and play holes thanks to a superintendent who would look the other way. That may or may not help him strategize a way through the three-day Ryder Cup, but at least he'll be on familiar turf, a place where he's already accustomed to taking risks. Plus, even though he's a Boston guy, New York fans will embrace him as one of their own against those damned Europeans.\n\n6. Phil Mickelson wasn't available. There's a line of succession in Ryder Cups that proceeds through a well-defined set of players from every generation. Johnson, Davis Love III, Steve Stricker and Jim Furyk came from golf's Generation X contingent; Stewart Cink was rumored to be in the mix for the job right up until Bradley got it. Mickelson, who loves the Ryder Cup, was the consensus guess for the 2025 captaincy ... right up until the moment he decided to bail on the PGA Tour and burn every bridge in sight by jumping to LIV Golf. Bradley and Mickelson have a history of successful Ryder Cup team-ups; could Bradley bring in Lefty as a vice-captain? Perhaps.\n\n7. Bradley is just 38. Ryder Cup captains tend to be players at the far edge of their competitive careers, in sight of the age-50 Champions Tour if not already on it. Bradley, by contrast, is just 38, making him one of the youngest captains in the event's history. (European captain Luke Donald was 45 at last year's event.) Bradley is the first of his generation to get the job, and the first to truly come of age in a post-Tiger golf world. One day, Spieth and Thomas will almost surely be captains, but for now, Bradley is the one who will be tasked with communicating the gravitas of the Ryder Cup to the millennial generation of players.\n\n8. Bradley isn't one of the Cool Kids. After the Gleneagles debacle in 2014, when an out-of-touch Tom Watson sparked a mutiny led by Mickelson, a new Ryder Cup Task Force sought to establish criteria for creating a winning tradition. The plan was to create a seamless European-style transition between captains, rather than the start-from-scratch-every-two-years routine that had been the norm. The Task Force mutated into a cool kids' table that culminated in last year's buddy trip. Bradley is, by his own admission, an outsider in the insular world at the top of golf right now, and that could work in his favor. You don't win Ryder Cups with attitude and arrogance.\n\n9. Tiger Woods wasn't available. Once Mickelson ejected from a potential captaincy, all eyes turned to Tiger Woods. He doesn't have a stellar Ryder Cup record, but he has the respect of every player on the planet. He's close to many of the next generation of players in a way that Watson, for instance, wasn't. But Woods is also deeply involved in the merger/investment snarl between the PGA Tour and Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund. Plus, the public demands of a captaincy are substantial; it's possible Woods simply didn't want to devote that much time to the endeavor. Regardless, he reportedly took himself out of the running for the slot, opening a pathway for Bradley.\n\n10. Bradley represents a break with the past. If there's anything we've learned over the last two years in golf -- well, besides the fact that everybody is greedy as hell -- it's that the old ways aren't necessarily the best ways. Tradition only works when it doesn't handcuff you to history. The old way of doing business at the Ryder Cup simply wasn't working for the United States; the team didn't learn from its victories, and didn't work to contain its defeats. Bradley may or may not be any better, but at least he'll bring a different perspective, and sometimes that's enough to at least start down the path of a different course.\n\n11. Bradley might be a playing captain. Once upon a time, the Ryder Cup featured playing captains, just like baseball had player-managers. No captain from either side has played in the event since Arnold Palmer in 1963, but that doesn't mean it can't be done. Bradley is still in the heart of his career, ranked 19th in the world. Suppose he qualifies his way in? Even better from a storyline perspective, suppose he's good enough to be one of the captain's picks? Bradley picking himself over Thomas or Fowler would nail the turnaround narrative. In all likelihood, given the intense responsibilities of an impending captain, this will be a moot question, since Bradley's game won't be as sharp as it could be. But it's a fun what-if.\n\n12. Why 12? Easy. At Marco Simone in Rome last fall, the United States thoroughly embarrassed itself. Players allegedly asking to be paid, players pursuing their own agendas, players looking like they were headed for a roadside colonoscopy ... everything about the American team in Rome looked unprepared and overmatched. In that Ryder Cup, the U.S. only managed 11 \u00bd points. So anything better than that counts as a success.", "source": {"uri": "ca.sports.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo Sports Canada"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Meet the latest U.S. hope to retake the Ryder Cup from the Europeans", "body": "Bradley announced as the 31st U.S. Ryder Cup captain for the 2025 matches at Bethpage State Park\n\nThe PGA of America made it official on Tuesday with the announcement that Keegan Bradley will be the U.S. Ryder Cup captain for the matches at Bethpage State Park in Farmingdale, N.Y., Sept. 26-28, 2025.\n\nThe announcement came from the headquarters of the New York Stock Exchange, 25 miles from Bethpage.\n\nIt was a surprise to most that it wasn't Tiger Woods (who is now the odds-on favorite for 2027 at Adare Manor in Ireland) and that Bradley will steer the ship with no prior experience as a captain or vice-captain on an international basis.\n\nBradley is a native of Woodstock, Vt., which makes him the only PGA Tour winner ever from that state. He has won six Tour events, the last coming at the 2023 Travelers Championship.\n\nHere's what else to know about Captain Bradley\n\nHow much Ryder Cup experience does Keegan Bradley have?\n\nBradley is a departure from recent PGA of America philosophy in drawing captains from a list of players who have been vice-captains. Bradley has yet to serve on the staff of a Ryder Cup or Presidents Cup.\n\nHe also has only played in two Ryder Cups, going 4-3 in 2012 and 2013. All four of his victories were doubles matches with Phil Mickelson.\n\nKeegan Bradley has been a quick study\n\nYes, Bradley will be the youngest Ryder Cup captain at 39 years old when the event is played since Arnold Palmer in 1963 (34). But when Bradley won the 2011 PGA Championship, he was the third player in history to win his first major start, after Francis Ouimet in the 1913 U.S. Open and Ben Curtis in the 2003 British Open. Bradley also won on the Hooters Tour in his fifth professional start.\n\nKeegan Bradley is good on the slopes\n\nMany golfers played other sports when they were younger. Most of them gravitated towards baseball and basketball.\n\nBut Bradley would whip any Tour player on the slopes. He was an All-State ski racer in Vermont before his family moved to Massachusetts and he won a state high school title in golf.\n\nKeegan Bradley was a rare star from the Big East\n\nBradley went to St. John's University and won nine college golf tournaments for coach Frank Darby, the second-most in school history. He played in the 2008 NCAA Tournament as an at-large player. Bradley was inducted into the St. John's Hall of Fame in 2020.\n\nBradley became familiar with Bethpage State Park since the Johnnies played an annual tournament there.\n\nWhich relative of Keegan Bradley is in the Hall of Fame?\n\nIn addition to his father Mark Bradley being a career club pro, Bradley is the nephew of World Golf Hall of Fame member Pat Bradley, who won 31 LPGA titles and six major championships. He has another aunt, Peggy, who was a seven-time club champion at the York Golf and Tennis Club in York, Maine.", "source": {"uri": "news-press.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The News-Press"},

Having assumed a role on the PGA Tour Policy Board, Woods has been caught up in the inner dealings of PGA Tour Enterprises' negotiations with Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund. That left the 15-time major champion with little time to add Ryder Cup captain to his list of titles and responsibilities this go-around.\n\n\"With my new responsibilities to the Tour and time commitments involved, I felt like I would not be able to commit the time to Team USA and the players required as a captain,\" Woods shared in a statement to the PGA of America. \"That does not mean I wouldn't want to captain a team in the future. If and when I feel it is the right time, I will put my hat in the ring for this committee to decide.\"\n\nWhile the captaincy may not be in the cards for Woods' 2025, another different role on Bradley's team is certainly open. During his introductory press conference with the PGA of America, Bradley insisted that he wants his vice captains for the competition at Bethpage Black in New York this September to be men who could one day transition into the lead role.\n\nEnter Tiger Woods.\n\n\"I have told him he can be as involved as he wants to be,\" Bradley said of Woods. \"We haven't talked about vice captains. ... We, as players, we all look up to Tiger, and his opinion means a lot to us. Being in team rooms with Tiger, the public doesn't realize how important this is to him. It's everything. He lives and breathes this event.\"\n\nWoods would be the most ideal person for Bradley to bounce ideas off -- not just due to his stature among his peer, but also Woods' own experience as a captain. Bradley insisted that he still hopes to qualify for the U.S. team despite being named captain -- a situation Woods dealt with himself.\n\nServing as a playing captain at the 2019 Presidents Cup at Royal Melbourne in Australia -- the first in that role since Hale Irwin in 1994 -- Tiger went 3-0-0 in the competition and led the visiting U.S. side to a hard-fought victory.\n\nBradley aims to become the first playing captain in the Ryder Cup since Arnold Palmer in 1963. Coincidentally, Bradley (38) is the youngest U.S. Ryder Cup captain since Palmer that year (34).\n\n\"It shows you how much he cares by turning this position down because he didn't feel like he could put in what he needed to do with all of his responsibilities with what's going on with the Tour,\" Bradley said of Woods. \"I've been grateful. Before I accepted this job, I needed to talk to Tiger. I wanted to make sure -- I wanted to hear from him. We had a great conversation. I certainly need his input.\"\n\nShould Bradley extend a vice captaincy to Woods, it would not be the first time the 48-year-old has been a member of the U.S. Ryder Cup leadership room. Tiger served in the same role during the 2016 competition in which the Americans defended home soil at Hazeltine by a score of 17 to 11.", "source": {"uri": "cbssports.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CBS Sports"}, "authors": [{"uri": "patrick_mcdonald@cbssports.com", "name": "Patrick McDonald", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PGA_Tour", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "PGA Tour"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiger_Woods", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tiger Woods"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryder_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ryder Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keegan_Bradley", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Keegan Bradley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional_Golfers'_Association_of_America", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Professional Golfers' Association of America"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saudi_Arabia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Saudi Arabia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Saudi Arabia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bethpage_Black_Course", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bethpage Black Course"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "New York (state)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hale_Irwin", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hale Irwin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidents_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Presidents Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arnold_Palmer", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Arnold Palmer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melbourne", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Melbourne"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Melbourne"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Australia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Competitions", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Competitions", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 91}], "image": "https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/r/2024/07/09/19d03438-ffb4-4620-91b3-84296cad8bcd/thumbnail/1200x675/be98db83db22679c3f8fbf3952856fa6/keegan-bradley-tiger-woods-g.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9718810", "eventUri": "eng-9718810", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2392156862745098, "wgt": 200, "relevance": 1}

But even if they did, I don't see that happening. I want to make the team on points, otherwise I'm going to be the captain.\"\n\nBradley was a surprise pick for the role, given his age, lack of experience as a vice-captain and having played in only two Ryder Cups.\n\nThe six-time PGA Tour winner got the job after the US Ryder Cup committee's first choice, Tiger Woods, declined the role due to his commitments as player director on the PGA Tour Policy Board.\n\nBradley admitted that he was as surprised as anyone else when he was first offered the job two weeks ago, revealing that previous US Ryder Cup captain Zach Johnson broke the news to him.\n\n\"Zach Johnson is the one who told me that I was going to be a Ryder Cup captain in 2025. I think it just speaks to what kind of man and person Zach Johnson is. Just such respect for him. He was one of the idols that I looked up to when I first came up on the tour.\n\n\"I feel terrible for what he's had to go through and I'm so honored that he was the one who called me. I'm going to represent this decision to the best of my abilities and I'm really excited.\"\n\nDespite his relative inexperience compared to past captains, Bradley said he believes he can offer something new to the role.\n\n\"I would say I'm going to take a fresh look at my vice-captains. They're going to be a lot younger, closer to playing. I'm going to be out there with the guys. I'm going to be playing in the same tournaments they're going to be playing in. I'm going to be playing in Majors with them.\n\n\"I'm going to be playing week-to-week alongside these guys, in the locker room, practice rounds, dinners. As opposed to in the past at Ryder Cups, they've got to fly in, they've got to schedule all these things. I'm going to have a year of being with the guys as a peer.\n\n\"It's a great honor that my peers chose me to do this. I don't have the experience that a lot of the other captains had, but I know these guys really well. I'm connected to these guys and I see them every week.\"\n\nHe also opened the door for LIV Golf players to be included in his team: \"I'm going to have the 12 best players on the team. I don't care where they play.\"\n\nUltimately, Bradley said he believes he is capable of leading Team USA to victory at Bethpage Black next year.\n\n\"The dream of being a Ryder Cup captain is something that a lot of us don't even think about because it's such a prestigious honor.

At least this time around, the news has nothing to do with fractures, division or defection. This week brought the legitimately shocking news that Keegan Bradley will captain the 2025 Ryder Cup team -- this, just months after Bradley was passed over for the 2023 team and had his heart ripped out of his chest in HD on Netflix's \"Full Swing\" documentary.\n\n\"The dream of being a Ryder Cup captain is something that a lot of us don't even think about because it's such a prestigious honor,\" Bradley said at his introductory press conference Tuesday. \"I never knew if I'd get this opportunity. I always felt like this is something that I would love to do and be able to handle. I'm so honored to be able to be the leader of this team. And I'm going to Bethpage to win the Ryder Cup back for America.\"\n\nBradley is a bold choice for captain, some would say a foolish choice ... but here are 12 reasons why this is the right choice. (Why 12 and not the typical golf-list 18? Read on.)\n\n1. Sometimes the Golf Gods even the scales. Bradley didn't quite perform well enough to earn an automatic slot on the 2023 team, and that meant his fate was in then-captain Zach Johnson's hands. That turned out to be bad news indeed for Bradley, since Johnson opted to go with frequent housemates Rickie Fowler, Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas. On the Ryder Cup points list, Bradley ranked higher than three of the captain's picks, but was left at home. (To be fair, Cam Young ranked higher than four and also wasn't selected.) Bradley has spent most of his pro career focused on the Ryder Cup, and thus, watching him receive Johnson's awkward no-go call on \"Full Swing\" was absolutely gutting.\n\n\"That moment was real. I was crushed,\" Bradley said. \"It took us a while to get over that. Our whole family, we were devastated. But I'm American. I root for the Americans to win the Ryder Cup. I watch whether I'm playing or whether I'm not. I know all the guys on the team and I bleed red, white, and blue. I was thrilled to be able to watch these guys, and I was pulling for them.\"\n\n2. Bradley might be the most passionate player on the American side. While Europe treats the Ryder Cup as a sacred challenge, American players tend to view it as another stop on the calendar. Win, lose, oh well, there's another tournament to be played. Granted, that's an oversimplification, but the Americans give the vibe of a band of lone wolves, while the Europeans always feel like a team. Bradley's passion for the Cup is flat-out European, and if he's able to project that enthusiasm onto his team, good results will follow.\n\n\"You hear so much about the Ryder Cup, and then when you experience it, it's so much more,\" Bradley said. \"I just loved every second of it. I loved being in the team room. I loved riding to the course with the guys. I loved winning our matches and going out and cheering. I loved every second of it.\"\n\n3. There's that famous suitcase. Bradley doesn't have the experience of most Ryder Cup captains -- he's only played in two, and he has a career 4-3 record -- but he's already checked the \"obsessive\" box. After the United States' 2012 collapse at Medinah, a despondent Bradley returned home and just collapsed, to the point that he didn't even open his suitcase from that day. It's sat unopened for 12 years, a time capsule of a moment and a testament to his singular focus. We can only hope, for Bradley's sake, that he didn't leave any dirty clothes in there. Still, it's a sign that Bradley is either absurdly devoted to Ryder Cup success or a little bit off-center, both of which are good qualities in a U.S. captain.\n\n\"The 2012 Ryder Cup is such a strange feeling to me because for every day but the last day, my fondest memories are on a golf course,\" Bradley said. \"Sunday was the worst day on the golf course and one of the worst days of my life. I got home and I kept staring at the suitcase and I couldn't open it because it was so, it was just, I was so sad. The stuff inside the suitcase was just gonna make it worse. So I put it off, I put it off, and then I kept looking at it and it was just, the memories inside there were so extreme on both sides that I decided, I'm gonna wait, I'm not gonna open this up until I've won a Ryder Cup.\"\n\n4. The home-field advantage. Look, let's be honest -- the home-field advantage at the Ryder Cup is so substantial that anyone from Judge Smails to Happy Gilmore to Lee Carvallo could lead the U.S. to victory. The home squad has won 11 of the last 13 Cups, with an average winning margin of five points. If Bradley can't win with the combination of the inherent talent on the U.S. side and the home-court boost, well, the United States has much bigger problems than just the captain.\n\n5. Bradley knows Bethpage. Bradley attended college at St. John's in Queens, only about 30 miles or so from Bethpage Black, the 2025 Ryder Cup host course. While at St. John's, he and teammates would sneak onto the course and play holes thanks to a superintendent who would look the other way. That may or may not help him strategize a way through the three-day Ryder Cup, but at least he'll be on familiar turf, a place where he's already accustomed to taking risks. Plus, even though he's a Boston guy, New York fans will embrace him as one of their own against those damned Europeans.\n\n\"The fans are gonna be our 13th team member,\" Bradley said. \"I've always been under the impression that Bethpage is New York's home course. Winged Foot and Shinnecock are amazing courses, but you talk to a real New Yorker, they brag about Bethpage. I've always thought of Bethpage as New York's home course, which is now America's home course. And I want the fans to treat it that way.\"\n\n6. Phil Mickelson wasn't available. There's a line of succession in Ryder Cups that proceeds through a well-defined set of players from every generation. Johnson, Davis Love III, Steve Stricker and Jim Furyk came from golf's Generation X contingent; Stewart Cink was rumored to be in the mix for the job right up until Bradley got it. Mickelson, who loves the Ryder Cup, was the consensus guess for the 2025 captaincy ... right up until the moment he decided to bail on the PGA Tour and burn every bridge in sight by jumping to LIV Golf. Bradley and Mickelson have a history of successful Ryder Cup team-ups; could Bradley bring in Lefty as a vice-captain? Perhaps.\n\n7. Bradley is just 38. Ryder Cup captains tend to be players at the far edge of their competitive careers, in sight of the age-50 Champions Tour if not already on it. Bradley, by contrast, is just 38, making him one of the youngest captains in the event's history. (European captain Luke Donald was 45 at last year's event.) Bradley is the first of his generation to get the job, and the first to truly come of age in a post-Tiger golf world. One day, Spieth and Thomas will almost surely be captains, but for now, Bradley is the one who will be tasked with communicating the gravitas of the Ryder Cup to the millennial generation of players.\n\n8. Bradley isn't one of the Cool Kids. After the Gleneagles debacle in 2014, when an out-of-touch Tom Watson sparked a mutiny led by Mickelson, a new Ryder Cup Task Force sought to establish criteria for creating a winning tradition. The plan was to create a seamless European-style transition between captains, rather than the start-from-scratch-every-two-years routine that had been the norm. The Task Force mutated into a cool kids' table that culminated in last year's buddy trip. Bradley is, by his own admission, an outsider in the insular world at the top of golf right now, and that could work in his favor. You don't win Ryder Cups with attitude and arrogance.\n\n\"I'm going to take a fresh look at my vice captains,\" Bradley said. \"They're going to be a lot younger, closer to playing. I think that I'm going to be out there with the guys. I'm going to be playing in the same tournaments they're going to be playing in. I'm going to be playing in majors with them. I'm going to be playing week-to-week ... I'm going to have a year of being with the guys as a peer.\"\n\n9. Tiger Woods wasn't available. Once Mickelson ejected from a potential captaincy, all eyes turned to Tiger Woods. He doesn't have a stellar Ryder Cup record, but he has the respect of every player on the planet. He's close to many of the next generation of players in a way that Watson, for instance, wasn't. But Woods is also deeply involved in the merger/investment snarl between the PGA Tour and Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund. Plus, the public demands of a captaincy are substantial; it's possible Woods simply didn't want to devote that much time to the endeavor. Regardless, he reportedly took himself out of the running for the slot, opening a pathway for Bradley.\n\nWoods released a statement about his own prospects as captain: \"With my new responsibilities to the Tour and time commitments involved, I felt like I would not be able to commit the time to Team USA and the players required as a captain,\" Woods said. \"That does not mean I wouldn't want to captain a team in the future. If and when I feel it is the right time, I will put my hat in the ring for this committee to decide.\"\n\n10. Bradley represents a break with the past. If there's anything we've learned over the last two years in golf -- well, besides the fact that everybody is greedy as hell -- it's that the old ways aren't necessarily the best ways. Tradition only works when it doesn't handcuff you to history. The old way of doing business at the Ryder Cup simply wasn't working for the United States; the team didn't learn from its victories, and didn't work to contain its defeats. Bradley may or may not be any better, but at least he'll bring a different perspective, and sometimes that's enough to at least start down the path of a different course.\n\n\"The Ryder Cup is so important to the game of golf but also to us players, especially if you've played in it and you realize the importance of what goes on that week,\" Bradley said. \"It changes your perspective on what's important in the game and it changes the way you are as a player because you need to be in those rooms after you play in one. And losing Ryder Cups is really, really tough.\"\n\n11. Bradley might be a playing captain. Once upon a time, the Ryder Cup featured playing captains, just like baseball had player-managers. No captain from either side has played in the event since Arnold Palmer in 1963, but that doesn't mean it can't be done. Bradley is still in the heart of his career, ranked 19th in the world. Suppose he qualifies his way in? Even better from a storyline perspective, suppose he's good enough to be one of the captain's picks? Bradley picking himself over Thomas or Fowler would nail the turnaround narrative. In all likelihood, given the intense responsibilities of an impending captain, this will be a moot question, since Bradley's game won't be as sharp as it could be. But it's a fun what-if.\n\n\"I'm not going to pick myself,\" Bradley said. \"I want to make the team on points. Otherwise I'm going to be the captain.\"\n\n12. Why 12? Easy. At Marco Simone in Rome last fall, the United States thoroughly embarrassed itself. Players allegedly asking to be paid, players pursuing their own agendas, players looking like they were headed for a roadside colonoscopy ... everything about the American team in Rome looked unprepared and overmatched. In that Ryder Cup, the U.S. only managed 11 \u00bd points. So anything better than that counts as a success.", "source": {"uri": "aol.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Aol"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jay_busbee@aol.com", "name": "Jay Busbee", "type": "author",

I have just such respect for him. He was one of my idols that I looked up to when I first came out on the PGA Tour and I feel terrible for what he's had to go through, and I'm so honoured that he was the one who called me.\"\n\nA press conference confirming Bradley's appointment included a statement from Woods, read out by PGA of America senior director Julius Mason, where the 15-time major champion explained his reasons and insisted he was still hopeful of captaining Team USA in the future.\n\n\"With my new responsibilities to the [PGA] Tour and time commitments involved, I felt like I would not be able to commit the time to Team USA and the players required as a captain,\" the statement read.\n\n\"That does not mean I wouldn't want to captain a team in the future. If and when I feel it is the right time, I will put my hat in the ring for this committee to decide.\"\n\nBradley said he spoke with Woods before accepting the position, which will make him the youngest USA Ryder Cup captain since Arnold Palmer in the 1960s, while the six-time PGA Tour winner is open to having the former world No 1 as part of his backroom team.\n\n\"I've spoken to Tiger a bunch,\" Bradley added. \"He's been very helpful. Tiger has always been really helpful to me. He's a great voice to hear and he's been reaching out to me helping me, which has been amazing.\n\n\"As it comes to Tiger, I have told him he can be as involved as he wants to be. We haven't talked about vice-captains, I haven't talked to vice-captains with really anybody. We, as players, we all look up to Tiger and his opinion means a lot to us.\n\n\"Being in team rooms with Tiger, the public doesn't realise how important this is to him. It's everything. He lives and breathes this event.\n\n\"I think it shows you how much he cares by turning this position down, because he didn't feel like he could put in what he needed to do with all of his responsibilities with what's going on with the PGA Tour.\"\n\nStewart Cink and Fred Couples, vice-captains under Johnson in 2023, had been viewed as more likely candidates, with former Ryder Cup-winning captain Paul McGinley shocked by Bradley's shock appointment.\n\n\"I think it's a surprise to everybody in the golf game,\" said McGinley, who will serve as strategic adviser to Donald for next year's contest. \"If you'd have given me five or six picks on who the next captain would be, if it wasn't going to be Tiger, I don't think Keegan would have been in those.\n\n\"It's a big leap of faith from them [PGA of America]. He's 38 years of age, so obviously very young to be a Ryder Cup captain - normally people are 10 years older when they choose them, so we'll have to wait and see.\n\n\"He's a very passionate guy, he's a nice guy and he's a popular guy. He's got a huge heart. He's certainly going to bring a lot of vibrancy and energy to the captaincy. That's probably going to fuel the crowd, so I can see the logic behind it.\n\n\"The surprise is the fact that he's so young and inexperienced to jump from being a player and potentially on the team last year, straight into being the captain.\"", "source": {"uri": "skysports.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "SkySports"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keegan_Bradley", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Keegan Bradley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zach_Johnson", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Zach Johnson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiger_Woods", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tiger Woods"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryder_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ryder Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PGA_Tour", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "PGA Tour"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luke_Donald", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Luke Donald"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bethpage_Black_Course", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bethpage Black Course"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_McGinley", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paul McGinley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional_Golfers'_Association_of_America", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Professional Golfers' Association of America"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PGA_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "PGA Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Europe"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rome", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rome"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Rome"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arnold_Palmer", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Arnold Palmer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stewart_Cink", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Stewart Cink"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fred_Couples", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fred Couples"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Golf"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 81}], "image": "https://e0.365dm.com/24/07/1600x900/skysports-keegan-bradley-golf_6622371.jpg?20240709190453", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9718810", "eventUri": "eng-9718810", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1058823529411765, "wgt": 197, "relevance": 1}

I feel as though I'm still in the prime of my career,\" Bradley said.\n\n\"I'm not going to pick myself. The only way that would happen is if the team was insisting on it. But even if they did, I don't see that happening.\n\n\"I want to make the team on points, otherwise I'm going to be the captain.\"\n\nWoods gave a short statement which was read out during the press conference and will be a heavy favourite to captain the side at Adare Manor in 2027.\n\n\"With my new responsibilities to the [PGA] Tour, and time commitments involved, I felt I would not be able to commit the time to Team USA and the players required as a captain,\" Woods said.\n\n\"That does not mean I wouldn't want to captain a team in the future.

And I want the fans to treat it that way. They need to defend this course in the right, appropriate way. But this is where fans and New Yorkers need to come and support this team. These New York fans are going to be pulling for us hard and I love that.\"\n\nMr. Bradley is a surprise choice to lead the American team that is scheduled to challenge the Europeans on September 26-28, 2025, at the famed public course that hosted the 2002 and 2009 U.S. Opens. Phil Mickelson was ticketed to be the captain before leaving the PGA Tour for LIV Golf. After Tiger Woods declined the job due to his responsibilities on the PGA Tour Policy Board and the negotiations with LIV Golf, the PGA of America turned to Mr. Bradley, who has played on two Ryder Cup teams but never served as an assistant captain.\n\nThe president of the PGA America, John Lindert, said Mr. Bradley's New York roots played a large part in the selection. The Ryder Cup is a rowdy event where fans can be partisan and vocal. It's the closest thing to a football crowd that golf gets. Mr. Bradley, a die-hard New England Patriots and Boston Red Sox fan, embraces that. \"Coming to New York, where he is looked on fondly, and his familiarity with Bethpage Black all played in our decision,\" Mr. Lindert said on Golf Channel. \"Keegan brings an intensity that will match the crowd intensity and that should be very beneficial. It's going to be a very passionate fan base and we're going to need a captain that can guide our team through those emotions and Keegan's the man.\"\n\nMr. Bradley won the 2011 PGA Championship as a rookie and has captured five other PGA Tour events. He played on Ryder Cup teams in 2012 at Medinah and 2014 at Gleneagles, Scotland. The U.S. lost both events.\n\nHe was bitterly disappointed when he wasn't one of the six captain's picks made by Zach Johnson to be part of the 2023 U.S. Ryder Cup team that lost in Rome. It's a bitter moment captured in the sixth episode of the second season of Netflix's \"Full Swing\" series. Mr. Bradley discounted the idea his reaction on the show played any part in his selection. \"This is such a huge decision I don't think it will be ever based on how someone was portrayed on TV,\" he said.\n\nWhat resonated was his passion to be part of the Ryder Cup experience. Now he will lead the team. At age 38, he is the youngest U.S. Ryder Cup captain since Arnold Palmer in 1963, breaking the mold of 40- and 50-something captains in recent years.\n\nMr. Bradley grew up in golf. His father Mark is a long-time PGA member and his aunt Pat Bradley is an LPGA Hall of Famer. Still, Mr. Bradley admitted he was in \"complete shock\" and felt \"funny\" when he got the call. \"I don't think I'll ever have a bigger surprise in my life,\" he said, adding, \"It's time for me to step up to the plate and be the captain of this team.\"\n\nAs it stands now, Mr. Bradley must make six captain's picks to add to the six players who qualify on points. It's something to contemplate over the next year while competing for enough points to earn a spot on the team.\n\n\"I look forward to getting to know the younger guys more,\" he said. \"And talking to the studs of the American team. Their enthusiasm for this tournament is very high and I look forward to leading those guys.\"\n\nThat may include players from LIV Golf like the U.S. Open champion, Bryson DeChambeau. \"I'm going to have the 12 best players on the team,\" he insisted. \"I don't care where they play. We have a mission to win this tournament. I'm not worried about the LIV stuff. I want the best players on the team. By the time we get to 2025, we have no clue what the golf world is going to be.\"\n\nYou can guarantee it will be loud at Bethpage Black.", "source": {"uri": "nysun.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

Last year, it was Zach Johnson, captain for the United States in the 2023 Ryder Cup, on the phone letting Bradley know he did not make the team and would not play in Rome. This year, it was the PGA of America informing Bradley he would take Johnson's spot leading the U.S. at Bethpage Black in 2025.\n\nThe other difference between the calls? Bradley had no idea this one was coming.\n\n\"I didn't have one conversation with anybody about this until I was told I was the captain,\" Bradley explained Tuesday while sharing his utter shock during an introductory press conference. \"I got a call from Seth [Waugh, PGA of America CEO] and John [Lindert, PGA of America president] and Zach, and I had trouble talking.\n\n\"When they called me, I felt funny after the call because I don't think I reacted in the way they were expecting me to. I was in complete shock. It was heavy. I was a little bit uncomfortable with some of the guys -- my idols -- that were looked over for this position. I needed a second to figure that out. I don't think I'll ever have a bigger surprise in my life.\"\n\nOne of those idols was Tiger Woods, who turned down the captaincy because he did not feel like he could devote enough time to do the job well enough to lead the Americans to victory. Woods is embroiled in negotiations between the PGA Tour and Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund as those two entities attempt to work out the framework agreement they currently have in place to reunify the golf world.\n\nBradley said he spoke with Woods before he accepted the role as captain with Tiger encouraging and supporting him taking the role. Bradley added that he was almost embarrassed by the caliber of candidates passed over for him to be selected.\n\n\"Something Seth said to me was, 'Your number was called; it's time for you to step up,'\" Bradley shared. \"When he told me that, it sort of hit me that this is a heavy job, and this is a group of people entrusting me in this. It's time to step up to the plate and be the captain of this team.\"\n\nBradley appreciated that the call came from Johnson, the man who snubbed him a year ago in favor of Justin Thomas, Rickie Fowler and Sam Burns -- all captain's picks ranked lower than Bradley. Johnson is on a committee including other PGA executives as well as players like Thomas and Jordan Spieth, who helped make the selection.\n\n\"I feel terrible for what he's had to go through, and I feel so honored that he called,\" Bradley said.\n\nWhen asked why the PGA picked Bradley ahead of other presumed candidates like Stewart Cink and Steve Stricker, Lindert said Bradley ticked a lot of boxes.\n\n\"When Keegan's name was mentioned, it was a slam dunk. ... We had a list. We were kind of bouncing through the list, and we were all looking down the list. Keegan's name kind of jumped out. As soon as it was mentioned, 'Keegan Bradley,' it was, 'Yeah, absolutely, 100%.'\"", "source": {"uri": "cbssports.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CBS Sports"}, "authors": [{"uri": "kyle_porter@cbssports.com", "name": "Kyle Porter", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keegan_Bradley", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Keegan Bradley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zach_Johnson", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Zach Johnson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional_Golfers'_Association_of_America", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Professional Golfers' Association of America"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryder_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ryder Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiger_Woods", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Tiger Woods"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bethpage_Black_Course", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bethpage Black Course"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rome", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rome"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Rome"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_Investment_Fund", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Public Investment Fund"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PGA_Tour", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "PGA Tour"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Golf"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saudi_Arabia", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Saudi Arabia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Saudi Arabia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sam_Burns", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sam Burns"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stewart_Cink", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Stewart Cink"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Stricker", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Steve Stricker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rickie_Fowler", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rickie Fowler"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jordan_Spieth", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jordan Spieth"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Romance", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Romance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 71}], "image": "https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/r/2024/07/09/b01f9b20-cf62-4141-9811-2e9e65ce5a55/thumbnail/1200x675/dde8d1ff1187e8c0560a7452789002ce/keegan-bradley-us-ryder-cup-ss.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9718810", "eventUri": "eng-9718810", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.04313725490196074, "wgt": 194, "relevance": 1}

He brought in Hall of Fame coach Lou Carnesecca and, he said, \"The way Keegan loved basketball, that was the move.\"\n\nNo such tactics were needed when the PGA of America asked him to captain the U.S. team for the 2025 Ryder Cup (Sept. 26-28) at Bethpage Black.\n\nIt's hard to envision anyone matching Bradley's passion for the event and commitment to a U.S. victory over Europe. He played on the 2012 and 2014 teams that lost, but still calls the first two days of the 2012 event \"my fondest memories on a golf course.\" And Bethpage Black has been dear to him since he and his Red Storm teammates snuck on to the closed course each Monday to play all the holes east of Round Swamp Road.\n\n\"I feel like I was made to do this job,\" Bradley said Tuesday after his introductory news conference at the Nasdaq Building in Times Square. Darby and Bradley's college teammates were all in attendance.\n\nBradley, 38, is the youngest U.S. captain since 34-year-old Arnold Palmer in 1963. And he aspires to be the first captain to play on the team since Palmer did it in '63.\n\nThe Bradley captaincy came together quickly after a long courtship of Tiger Woods ended with him turning it down. Woods is on the PGA's committee negotiating a merger with the competing Saudi-backed LIV tour and didn't think he could give the Ryder Cup captaincy the required time.\n\n\"With my new responsibilities to the tour and time commitments involved, I felt I would not be able to [dedicate] the time to Team USA and the players if I were . . . captain,\" Woods said in a statement. \"That does not mean I wouldn't want to captain a team in the future. If, when I feel it is the right time, I will put my hat in the ring.\"\n\nFormer vice-captains such as Stewart Cink, Fred Couples and Davis Love III appeared obvious fallbacks. But Bradley, who won the 2011 PGA Championship and is 4-1 in Ryder Cup matches, stood out to the selection committee.\n\n\"We had a couple of phone calls and talked about a variety of different attributes that we [wanted] in our next captain,\" PGA of America president John Lindert said. \"You start to check off the boxes and you have a PGA champion, you have somebody who went to school here [and] is familiar with the New York fan base, is very familiar with Bethpage Black, is the son of a PGA member. There are a lot of boxes that that Keegan checked off and his enthusiasm for the Ryder Cup stood out above everything else and we just felt like that was the 'aha moment.' When his name was mentioned . . . all hands went up and we were 100% behind it.\"\n\nBradley has hungered to play in another Ryder Cup for a decade. He didn't score enough points on the PGA Tour to be one of the six automatic qualifiers for the 12-member team in 2023, but was in a position to be one of the six \"captain's picks.\" Then-captain Zach Johnson snubbed him in a crushing phone call that was aired in the Netflix docuseries \"Full Swing.\"\n\nIronically, it was Johnson who called to deliver Bradley the news he was the committee's choice to be captain when he didn't even know he was being considered. Bradley said, \"I don't think I'll ever be more surprised than anything in my entire life. I had no idea. And it took it took a while for it to sink in.\"\n\nBadly as he wants to play, Bradley said Tuesday he does not intend to use one of the picks on himself.\n\n\"I'm not going to pick myself,\" he said. \"The only way that would happen is if the team was insisting [on] it. But even if they did, I don't see that happening. I want to make the team on points.

Darby, however, is not surprised at all.\n\n\"We saw all his criteria at St. John's,\" Darby said. \"He's all about winning and his teammates. He loves the course. He loves New York.

I want to make the team on points, otherwise I'm going to be the captain.\"\n\nWhether he plays or not, Bradley's captaincy is already tied to Palmer. At 38 years old, Bradley is the youngest U.S. captain since a 34-year-old Palmer led the team in '63.\n\nHe said he will soak in advice from his predecessors, but plans to refresh the staff with a youthful approach.\n\n\"What's personally important to me is I would like the vice captains to set up the future,\" Bradley said.\n\nBradley competed in the Ryder Cup in 2012 and 2014, both losses for the Americans.

Meet the latest U.S. hope to retake the Ryder Cup from the Europeans", "body": "The PGA of America made it official on Tuesday with the announcement that Keegan Bradley will be the U.S. Ryder Cup captain for the matches at Bethpage State Park in Farmingdale, N.Y., Sept. 26-28, 2025.\n\nThe announcement came from the headquarters of the New York Stock Exchange, 25 miles from Bethpage.\n\nIt was a surprise to most that it wasn't Tiger Woods (who is now the odds-on favorite for 2027 at Adare Manor in Ireland) and that Bradley will steer the ship with no prior experience as a captain or vice-captain on an international basis.\n\nBradley is a native of Woodstock, Vt., which makes him the only PGA Tour winner ever from that state. He has won six Tour events, the last coming at the 2023 Travelers Championship.\n\nHere's what else to know about Captain Bradley\n\nBradley is a departure from recent PGA of America philosophy in drawing captains from a list of players who have been vice-captains. Bradley has yet to serve on the staff of a Ryder Cup or Presidents Cup.\n\nHe also has only played in two Ryder Cups, going 4-3 in 2012 and 2013. All four of his victories were doubles matches with Phil Mickelson.\n\nYes, Bradley will be the youngest Ryder Cup captain at 39 years old when the event is played since Arnold Palmer in 1963 (34). But when Bradley won the 2011 PGA Championship, he was the third player in history to win his first major start, after Francis Ouimet in the 1913 U.S. Open and Ben Curtis in the 2003 British Open. Bradley also won on the Hooters Tour in his fifth professional start.\n\nMany golfers played other sports when they were younger. Most of them gravitated towards baseball and basketball.\n\nBut Bradley would whip any Tour player on the slopes. He was an All-State ski racer in Vermont before his family moved to Massachusetts and he won a state high school title in golf.\n\nBradley went to St. John's University and won nine college golf tournaments for coach Frank Darby, the second-most in school history. He played in the 2008 NCAA Tournament as an at-large player. Bradley was inducted into the St. John's Hall of Fame in 2020.\n\nBradley became familiar with Bethpage State Park since the Johnnies played an annual tournament there.\n\nIn addition to his father Mark Bradley being a career club pro, Bradley is the nephew of World Golf Hall of Fame member Pat Bradley, who won 31 LPGA titles and six major championships. He has another aunt, Peggy, who was a seven-time club champion at the York Golf and Tennis Club in York, Maine.", "source": {"uri": "sports.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo Sports"},

The PGA of America released a statement from the 15-time major champion Tuesday explaining why he turned down the offer.\n\n\"With my new responsibilities to the Tour and time commitments involved, I felt like I would not be able to commit the time to Team USA and the players required as a captain,\" Woods said. \"That does not mean I wouldn't want to captain a team in the future. If and when I feel it is the right time, I will put my hat in the ring for this committee to decide.\"\n\nWoods is serving as a player director on the PGA Tour's policy board, as well as on the so-called \"transaction subcommittee\" focused on getting a merger deal done with Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund.\n\nHis playing commitments have been less time-consuming since a brutal single-car accident in 2021 nearly cost him his leg. Woods has concentrated on playing the four majors and his own tournament, the Genesis Invitational.\n\nThe irony is that Bradley, 38, will be balancing his full-time career as a PGA Tour player with the duties of a Ryder Cup captain. He is ranked No. 19 in the world this week and nearly played his way onto the U.S. team late last cycle.\n\nBradley said he will receive crucial help from his vice captains as well as John Wood, a former caddie and golf broadcaster, who is serving in a newly created \"team manager\" position.\n\n\"Part of me thinks this is going to be a great distraction from playing on the tour and getting away from worrying about my personal what's going on on week-to-week tournaments,\" Bradley told reporters Tuesday. \"I look forward to getting to know the younger guys more that just have come out on tour. There's a great group of young players that I don't know that well that I'm looking forward to learning more about.\n\n\"Also talking to, you know, the studs of the American team, Xander (Schauffele) and (Patrick) Cantlay and Scottie Scheffler, Jordan (Spieth) and JT (Justin Thomas) and all these guys, and their enthusiasm for this tournament is very, very high and I look forward to leading those guys.\"\n\nBradley never interviewed with the PGA of America for the captaincy, and he didn't undersell his surprise that the governing body reached out.\n\n\"I don't think I'll ever be more surprised of anything in my entire life,\" he said. \"I was -- I had no idea. It took a while for it to sink in. I wasn't fully comfortable with some of the people that were passed over.

The next candidates were initially presumed to be fellow PGA Tour veterans Stewart Cink, Fred Couples, and David Love III, per Sports Illustrated. However, Bradley's name emerged as a late-breaking option, according to reports.\n\n\"I am incredibly honored to accept this opportunity to captain the United States team at the 2025 Ryder Cup,\" Bradley said in an official statement. \"I would like to thank the PGA of America Ryder Cup Committee for their trust in me as we embark on this journey to Bethpage Black.\n\n\"My passion and appreciation for golf's greatest team event have never been stronger. The Ryder Cup is unlike any other competition in our sport, and this edition will undoubtedly be particularly special given the rich history and enthusiastic spectators at this iconic course. I look forward to beginning preparations for 2025.\"\n\nFormer World No. 1 Luke Donald is returning to captain the European side after steering them to a dominant 5 1/2-point triumph at Marco Simone Golf & Country Club in Rome last September.\n\nTiger had expressed interest in the captaincy, and recently departed PGA of America CEO Seth Waugh had mentioned the 48-year-old as an ideal option to helm the squad at Bethpage.\n\n\"We're still working on what that might look like, also whether or not I have the time to do it,\" Tiger said at the PGA Championship in May. \"I'm dedicating so much time to what we're doing with the PGA Tour, I don't want to not fulfill the role of the captaincy if I can't do it.\"\n\nTiger is vice president of PGA Tour Enterprises -- a for-profit branch tasked with growing the game -- and serves on the policy board of the PGA Tour and a transaction subcommittee delegated to negotiations with LIV Golf's backer, the Public Investment Fund (PIF) of Saudi Arabia.\n\n\"What that all entails and representing Team USA and the commitments to the PGA of America, the players, and the fans and as I said, all of Team USA. I need to feel that I can give the amount of time that it deserves,\" Tiger continued.\n\nBradley has a 4-2 career Ryder Cup record and has never hid his passion for the event.\n\nDespite kicking off an impressive summer of golf with a win at the 2023 Travelers Championship, Bradley was curiously passed over for (the struggling) Justin Thomas and Rickie Flower by captain Zach Johnson for Rome -- a development that was gut-wrenchingly captured on Netflix's Full Swing.\n\n\"The thing is, those guys are close. They're not just PGA Tour-close, they're close friends,\" Bradley said about Johnson's picks. \"If you take golf out of the equation, they're legit close friends. You have your close friends as a golfer and then you have your close PGA Tour friends, and a lot of the time your close friends aren't on the tour.\"\n\n\"I love these guys, and one of the main reasons I wanted to make this team is I wanted to be around these guys, the energy that they have,\" Bradley added. \"I see the way JT prepares and practices, and if I was a captain, I would want him in my locker room.\"\n\nBradley finished 11th in the Ryder Cup standings -- ahead of Thomas and Fowler.\n\n\"I really was rooting for those guys,\" Bradley told me about the snub. \"That was real. My wife and I -- we both wanted them to win and do well. But, it was important, someday, for my kids to also realize, like, sometimes if you don't get your way or what you want, you still have to do the right thing. And that's what we wanted to do.\"\n\nNow, Bradley gets to make the final picks. At 38, he'll be the youngest U.S. Ryder Cup captain since Arnold Palmer in 1963.\n\nThe 2025 Ryder Cup begins Sept. 26, 2025 at Bethpage Black in New York.

At this juncture, this appointment process can only be seen as yet another hilarious saga in a recent American Ryder Cup history fairly littered with cock-ups.\n\nTelegraph Sport revealed on Monday that, after at least eight months of negotiations, Woods had finally rejected the overtures from the PGA of America, before reporting that at 38 years of age, Bradley has been appointed as the youngest captain since Great Britain and Ireland became Europe 45 years ago.\n\nIt was clearly a left-field choice, but the news was, quite bizarrely, largely welcomed in America with experts calling it a wise choice, despite Bradley not featuring in the biennial showdown for a decade and never having served as a vice captain. This is presumably because Bradley is not a member of the old boy's network and is extremely passionate about the Ryder Cup.\n\nWhatever, it undoubtedly was also plainly an off-the-cuff decision, as Bradley himself revealed at a glitzy press conference at the Nasdaq building in Manhattan. He was called by Zach Johnson (last year's awful US captain in the humiliation in Rome) and Seth Waugh (the departing PGA of America chief executive) without warning. That bungling duo were part of the six-man panel that also included Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas.\n\n\"There were no conversations until Zach phoned me and told me I was going to be captain,\" Bradley said. \"I was in complete shock, especially as some of my golfing idols were overlooked. But I'm so honoured it was Zach who told me. I feel terrible for what happened to him in Rome.\n\n\"After that clip [in a Netflix documentary] that showed I was crushed at not being picked by Zach [as a wildcard], you also saw me and my family cheering on the American team on TV. I love the Ryder Cup and bleed red, white and blue.\"\n\nFamously Bradley has yet to empty the holdall that contains the by now rancid uniform he wore at Medinah in 2012, when he performed valiantly but was ultimately part of a losing team after that unforgettable blue-and-gold fightback. Keegan vowed to open the bag and employ the washing machine only if and when he was on the winning side.\n\nHowever, he was also part of Tom Watson's vanquished dozen two years later at Gleneagles and since then has failed to make the cut. No doubt, the 2011 US PGA champion wears his heart on his sleeve, but that did not make his accession any more of a jaw-dropper, with Xander Schauffele and Rickie Fowler - both established members in the Starred-and-Striped ranks - acknowledging their surprise. This was an appointment of the panic triggered by Woods's late snub.\n\nThe 48-year-old released am explanatory statement on Tuesday, citing his pivotal role in the peace talks between the PGA Tour and the Saudi LIV backers, but it notably did not mention Bradley.\n\n\"With my new responsibilities to the Tour and the time commitments involved, I felt I could not commit the time to Team USA and the players required as captain,\" Woods said, before casting doubt that he will even lead the team in County Limerick in 2027.\n\n\"This does not mean I wouldn't want to captain in the future. If and when I feel it is the right time, I will put my hat in the ring for the committee to decide.\"\n\nIn other words, \"I'll call you\".", "source": {"uri": "aol.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keegan_Bradley", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Keegan Bradley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiger_Woods", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tiger Woods"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryder_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ryder Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zach_Johnson", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Zach Johnson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Europe"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luke_Donald", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Luke Donald"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bethpage_Black_Course", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bethpage Black Course"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional_Golfers'_Association_of_America", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Professional Golfers' Association of America"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rome", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rome"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Rome"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jordan_Spieth", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jordan Spieth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Britain", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Great Britain"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Golf"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manhattan", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Manhattan"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Manhattan"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ireland", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ireland"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ireland"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gleneagles_Hotel", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gleneagles Hotel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Watson_(golfer)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tom Watson (golfer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rickie_Fowler", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rickie Fowler"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PGA_Tour", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "PGA Tour"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wild_card_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wild card (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netflix", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Netflix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xander_Schauffele", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Xander Schauffele"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medinah,_Illinois", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Medinah, Illinois"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Medinah, Illinois"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/County_Limerick", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "County Limerick"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "County Limerick"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ireland"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Competitions", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Competitions", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Crafts/Woodcraft", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Crafts/Woodcraft", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/CONMEBOL", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/CONMEBOL", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Team_Handball/Tournaments", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Team Handball/Tournaments", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Golfers", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Golfers", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 94}], "image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/nl54wIPH7NIRsjvxScqwfQ--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD03NTI-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/aol_the_telegraph_624/4cae26e78ac47ed7c386c3945e031dc7", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9718810", "eventUri": "eng-9718810", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1137254901960785, "wgt": 188, "relevance": 1}

I think a lot of people expected Tiger to do it. He obviously has a lot on his plate. Keegan expressed his love for the Ryder Cup publicly, which we all saw.\"\n\n\"I haven't talked to him or seen him yet but I'm sure he's over the moon and is going to do a great job.\"\n\nTiger, 48, turned down the opportunity to steer his first Ryder Cup squad, citing his various behind-the-scenes duties for the PGA Tour. The 15-time major champion is a vice president of PGA Tour Enterprises, and serves on the PGA Tour policy board and on a special subcommittee tasked with negotiating with LIV Golf's backer, the Public Investment Fund of Saudi Arabia.\n\n'With my new responsibilities to the Tour and time commitments involved, I felt like I would not be able to commit the time to Team USA and the players required as a captain,' Woods said in a statement. 'That does not mean I wouldn't want to captain a team in the future. If and when I feel it is the right time, I will put my hat in the ring for this committee to decide.\"\n\nBradley, 38, will be the youngest U.S. Ryder Cup captain since Arnold Palmer. The six-time PGA Tour winner was curiously snubbed by captain Zach Johnson for the doomed 2023 team -- a storyline gut-wrenchingly captured in Netflix's Full Swing.\n\n\"I really was rooting for those guys,\" Bradley told me in March. \"That was real. My wife and I -- we both wanted them to win and do well. But, it was important, someday, for my kids to also realize, like, sometimes if you don't get your way or what you want, you still have to do the right thing.

He will lead the U.S. team against the Europeans as the United States seeks to avenge its loss last year at Marco Simone near Rome, Italy.\n\nHere are some answers to questions you might have about the upcoming matches and Bradley (click here to read our most recent Ryder Cup 101).\n\nWhen will the 2025 Ryder Cup take place?\n\nThe biennial competition will take place September 26-28 on the Black Course at Bethpage State Park in Farmingdale, New York.\n\nWho is Keegan Bradley?\n\nHe is married (Jillian), a 38-year-old PGA Tour professional and father of two. He was born June 7, 1986 in Woodstock, Vermont and currently resides in Jupiter, Florida. Bradley is an avid Boston sports fan with some ties to New York as he played golf at St. Johns University. His aunt is Pat Bradley, a member of the World Golf Hall of Fame.\n\nProfessionally, he has won six Tour events, most recently at the 2023 Travelers Championship, where he won his hometown major. He also has one true major under his belt. Bradley, while making his Tour debut as a major rookie, won the 2011 PGA Championship at the Atlanta Athletic Club in a playoff over Jason Dufner.\n\nWhat is Bradley's Ryder Cup story?\n\nHe played twice for Team USA, qualifying in 2012 and being a captain's choice in '14. The United States lost both matches in the 12th edition known as the European Miracle at Medinah, in which the visiting team overcame a 10-6 deficit in singles play on Sunday to prevail. Bradley finished 3-1-0 that week, losing his singles match to Rory McIlroy. He finished 1-2-0 in '14 as the United States lost by five points in Gleneagles, Scotland.\n\nRecently, Bradley has become more known as the odd man out. He was considered a serious wild-card candidate last year but didn't get the call he wanted from then-captain Zach Johnson, as seen in the second season of Netflix's Full Swing.\n\nWhy was he chosen to be the next Captain America?\n\nLet's get back to this one and tackle the one below first:\n\nWhy isn't Tiger Woods the Bethpage captain in 2025?\n\nIt seemed logical. Woods, who would be 49 by the time of next year's matches, won the 2002 U.S. Open on the Black Course. Once New York darling Phil Mickelson, who joined LIV Golf a few years ago, was passed over for the captaincy, all eyes were on Tiger. But after publicly wavering in recent months, Woods declined. We'll know more about the reasons in the coming days, as he's scheduled to play the Open and meet with the media, but Woods is entrenched in negotiations between the Tour and the Saudi PIF and trying to make the most of his remaining playing time.\n\nBradley has been named captain of the 2025 U.S. Ryder Cup, a PGA wild-card pick that could prove to be a genius.\n\nSo, back to Bradley: why him?\n\nThe U.S. Ryder Cup team has long been accused of being a boys' club. After Tom Watson's disastrous run to 14th, the leaders were Davis Love III (again), Jim Furyk, Steve Stricker and Johnson. Love and Stricker won (both at home), while Furyk and Johnson lost (both away). All were part of the post-2014 working group, and none were a surprise. Bradley, he admitted, was not one of the boys. But after a disheartening loss in Italy, the PGA wanted someone who would think outside the box, someone with fire and spirit to match New York's intensity. That was Bradley. Ironically, Bradley's main Ryder Cup success came as Mickelson's partner, with a 4-1-0 record together.\n\nWho was removed from the US captaincy?\n\nAmong the leading candidates were Webb Simpson, Matt Kuchar and Stewart Cink. All would have been considered safe choices by the PGA, players slightly older, with more Ryder Cup experience and better connected to the bureaucracy.\n\nWill Woods ever be captain?\n\nThe 2027 matches will be played at Adare Manor in Ireland. Woods, a three-time Open champion, has business dealings with the venue's owner, JP McManus. It would make more sense for Woods to captain there (where he would also be trying to end a U.S. road losing streak dating back to 1993) than in 2029 at Hazeltine, Minnesota.\n\nCould Bradley become player-captain in 2025?\n\nHe has the right to do both, and nothing, other than his own decision, could prevent him from qualifying or choosing himself. Bradley is currently 24th on the U.S. points list, with the qualifying criteria yet to be revealed. While Woods captained the victorious U.S. team in the 2019 Presidents Cup, there hasn't been a Ryder Cup team captain since Arnold Palmer in 1963 (the U.S. won, 23-9).\n\nWhat Are The Main Benefits Of Comparing Car Insurance Quotes Online\n\nLOS ANGELES, CA / ACCESSWIRE / June 24, 2020, / Compare-autoinsurance.Org has launched a new blog post that presents the main benefits of comparing multiple car insurance quotes.

He doesn't plan on excluding LIV Golf members from his selection process.\n\nPer Bob Harig of Sports Illustrated, the six-time PGA Tour winner said he wants the best dozen golfers regardless of their affiliation\n\n\"I don't care about the LIV stuff,\" Bradley said.\n\nBrooks Koepka was the only LIV Golf representative to play for the U.S. last year. No LIV members competed for Europe in Italy.\n\nZach Johnson selected Koepka as one of his captain's picks over Bradley, who played in the 2012 and 2014 Ryder Cups. In a full-circle turn, Johnson called Bradley to tell the 38-year-old that he'll captain the U.S. at Bethpage Black Course.\n\nPer SiriusXM's Jason Sobel, Bradley didn't even realize he was being considered for the role.\n\n\"I didn't have a single conversation about this with anyone until I was told I was captain,\" Bradley said.\n\nSix golfers will automatically qualify for the U.S. Ryder Cup team based on points accumulated through money earned at majors at 2025 PGA Tour events. However, Bradley could choose LIV Golf members when picking the other six participants.\n\nWhile Bradley hopes to earn a spot on the team, he confirmed that he won't select himself with a captain's pick. That could leave space for someone like Koepka or Bryson DeChambeau to represent the U.S. in the Ryder Cup.\n\nRelated: U.S. Ryder Cup Team Names Captain After Tiger Woods Turns Down Offer", "source": {"uri": "postandcourier.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Post and Courier"}, "authors": [{"uri": "andrew_gould@postandcourier.com", "name": "Andrew Gould", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keegan_Bradley", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Keegan Bradley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LIV_Golf", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "LIV Golf"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryder_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Ryder Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zach_Johnson", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Zach Johnson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PGA_Tour", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "PGA Tour"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sports_Illustrated", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sports Illustrated"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brooks_Koepka", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Brooks Koepka"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sirius_XM", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sirius XM"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bethpage_Black_Course", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bethpage Black Course"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Europe"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Italy"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bryson_DeChambeau", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bryson DeChambeau"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Senior_major_golf_championships", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Senior major golf championships"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiger_Woods", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tiger Woods"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Competitions", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Competitions", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/CONMEBOL", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/CONMEBOL", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Rules_and_Etiquette", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Rules and Etiquette", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 51}], "image": "https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/postandcourier.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/1/ae/1aef422d-9094-52f1-9ac5-23eb4c868cde/668d7fed0439c.image.jpg?crop=1200%2C630%2C0%2C85&resize=438%2C230&order=crop%2Cresize", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9718810", "eventUri": "eng-9718810", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.07450980392156858, "wgt": 183, "relevance": 1}

The moment was chronicled in all its brutality in the Netflix series Full Swing as Zach Johnson delivered the news that Bradley had missed out on selection.\n\nJohnson's team, Schauffele included, floundered on the opening day at Marco Simone Golf & Country Club in October and never recovered as Europe regained the trophy. American fans and players alike have called for change in the aftermath.\n\nREAD MORE: Keegan Bradley showed true colours with response to Ryder Cup rejection from Zach Johnson\n\nREAD MORE: Keegan Bradley to capitalise after Tiger Woods snubs Team USA captaincy for Ryder Cup\n\nAnd world No. 3 Schauffele has wasted no time making a suggestion to his new captain that he believes would make a big difference when the USA tries to win back the Ryder Cup at Bethpage Black in New York next year. The 30-year-old has called for ceremonies around the event to be cut back so players can place more focus on the challenge at hand.\n\n\"Taking a bunch of photos all dressed up, I would be the first guy that I need to flee quickly. It just seems like it's all these little, even like team dinners or things of that nature, we can have them sort of quick and inside versus having to go out, dress up and all those things,\" Schauffele said in his press conference ahead of this week's Scottish Open.\n\n\"It's just small things. I think there are two or three dinners that we have to go to that are kind of mandatory-ish, and I think if we cut it down to one or two versus three that would be a really big deal.\"\n\nFor all the latest on news, politics, sports, and showbiz from the USA, go to The Mirror US.\n\nSchauffele, who is almost certain to be on Bradley's team next year, admits the decision to name Bradley as captain caught him off guard. Bradley got the chance after Tiger Woods rejected an offer from the PGA of America due to his commitments with the PGA Tour and negotiating a merger with LIV Golf.\n\n\"Yeah, it's surprising,\" Schauffele said. \"You typically expect someone that's a little bit older to get selected as a captain. I think a lot of people were banking on Tiger to do it. He obviously has a lot on his plate. So Keegan expressed his love for the Ryder Cup publicly, which we all saw. I haven't talked to him or seen him yet, but I'm sure he's over the moon and is going to do a great job.\"\n\n\"He is so laid back off the course,\" Schauffele added. \"If you get him in like a dinner setting or something, he loves sports. He'll talk about sports all night long if you like. He's a very passionate individual. On the course, he's intense. That's just how he competes and how he is. I'm sure as a captain he's going to have sort of a mixed bag.\n\n\"He won't be afraid and will get everyone going. I don't know if he's coached or captained any other teams in his life, whether it's his kids' teams or something like that, but when someone is really passionate about something, they usually do really well.\"", "source": {"uri": "mirror.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Mirror"}, "authors": [{"uri": "sam_frost@mirror.co.uk", "name": "Sam Frost", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keegan_Bradley", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Keegan Bradley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zach_Johnson", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Zach Johnson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captain_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Captain (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryder_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ryder Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xander_Schauffele", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Xander Schauffele"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Full_Swing_(2023_TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Full Swing (2023 TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PGA_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "PGA Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiger_Woods", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tiger Woods"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Europe"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Golf"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netflix", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Netflix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rome", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rome"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Rome"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bethpage_Black_Course", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bethpage Black Course"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "New York (state)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottish_Open_(golf)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Scottish Open (golf)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LIV_Golf", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "LIV Golf"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional_Golfers'_Association_of_America", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Professional Golfers' Association of America"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PGA_Tour", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "PGA Tour"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daily_Mirror", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Daily Mirror"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Competitions", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Competitions", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article33205519.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_untitled-2024-07-09T180457962.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9718810", "eventUri": "eng-9718810", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.0117647058823529, "wgt": 182, "relevance": 1}

If and when I feel it is the right time, I will put my hat in the ring for this committee to decide.\"\n\nHis decision came after he remained coy on the subject when asked about the progression of talks over becoming Team USA captain while he was at the PGA Championship in May. He said: \"We're still talking. There's nothing that has been confirmed yet. We're still working on what that might look like.

I need to feel that I can give the amount of time that it deserves.\"\n\nMeanwhile, newly-installed skipper Bradley spoke with confidence as he looked forward to taking on the role at Bethpage next year. Making a vow over his intended approach to the post, he said: \"I'm going to have the 12 best players on the team. I don't care where they play.\n\n\"We have a mission to win this tournament and I don't care about the LIV stuff. I want the best players on the team. By the time we get to Bethpage in 2025, we don't know how things are going to look. As it comes to going to LIV events, if there's guys that are on the fringe, I'm willing to do that. My biggest concern is having the best players on the team.\"\n\nThe American added: \"Again, I think in 2025, by the time the Ryder Cup comes, maybe the golf world looks totally different. I just want the best players on the team. I think it's silly for the U.S. team to not have the best players.\"", "source": {"uri": "mirror.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Mirror"}, "authors": [{"uri": "tom_beattie@mirror.co.uk", "name": "Tom Beattie", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_national_baseball_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States national baseball team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keegan_Bradley", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Keegan Bradley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captain_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Captain (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiger_Woods", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tiger Woods"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryder_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ryder Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zach_Johnson", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Zach Johnson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PGA_Tour", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "PGA Tour"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Golf"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bethpage,_New_York", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bethpage, New York"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Bethpage, New York"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rome", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rome"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Rome"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women's_major_golf_championships", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Women's major golf championships"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional_Golfers'_Association_of_America", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Professional Golfers' Association of America"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PGA_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "PGA Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daily_Mirror", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Daily Mirror"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Paintball/Teams", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Paintball/Teams", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Robotics/Competitions", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Robotics/Competitions", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Flying_Discs/Ultimate_Frisbee", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Flying Discs/Ultimate Frisbee", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Competitions", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Competitions", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Airsoft/Teams", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Airsoft/Teams", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 96}], "image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article33205633.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_GettyImages-1043404276jpgo.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9718810", "eventUri": "eng-9718810", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2392156862745098, "wgt": 182, "relevance": 1}

stronger,\" Bradley said on Monday.\n\n\"The Ryder Cup is unlike any other competition in our sport, and this edition will undoubtedly be particularly special given the rich history and enthusiastic

At this juncture, this appointment process can only be seen as yet another hilarious saga in a recent American Ryder Cup history fairly littered with cock-ups.\n\nTelegraph Sport revealed on Monday that, after at least eight months of negotiations, Woods had finally rejected the overtures from the PGA of America, before reporting that at 38 years of age, Bradley has been appointed as the youngest captain since Great Britain and Ireland became Europe 45 years ago.\n\nIt was clearly a left-field choice, but the news was, quite bizarrely, largely welcomed in America with experts calling it a wise choice, despite Bradley not featuring in the biennial showdown for a decade and never having served as a vice captain. This is presumably because Bradley is not a member of the old boy's network and is extremely passionate about the Ryder Cup.\n\nWhatever, it undoubtedly was also plainly an off-the-cuff decision, as Bradley himself revealed at a glitzy press conference at the Nasdaq building in Manhattan. He was called by Zach Johnson (last year's awful US captain in the humiliation in Rome) and Seth Waugh (the departing PGA of America chief executive) without warning. That bungling duo were part of the six-man panel that also included Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas.\n\n\"There were no conversations until Zach phoned me and told me I was going to be captain,\" Bradley said. \"I was in complete shock, especially as some of my golfing idols were overlooked. But I'm so honoured it was Zach who told me. I feel terrible for what happened to him in Rome.\n\n\"After that clip [in a Netflix documentary] that showed I was crushed at not being picked by Zach [as a wildcard], you also saw me and my family cheering on the American team on TV. I love the Ryder Cup and bleed red, white and blue.\"\n\nFamously Bradley has yet to empty the holdall that contains the by now rancid uniform he wore at Medinah in 2012, when he performed valiantly but was ultimately part of a losing team after that unforgettable blue-and-gold fightback. Keegan vowed to open the bag and employ the washing machine only if and when he was on the winning side.\n\nHowever, he was also part of Tom Watson's vanquished dozen two years later at Gleneagles and since then has failed to make the cut. No doubt, the 2011 US PGA champion wears his heart on his sleeve, but that did not make his accession any more of a jaw-dropper, with Xander Schauffele and Rickie Fowler - both established members in the Starred-and-Striped ranks - acknowledging their surprise. This was an appointment of the panic triggered by Woods's late snub.\n\nThe 48-year-old released am explanatory statement on Tuesday, citing his pivotal role in the peace talks between the PGA Tour and the Saudi LIV backers, but it notably did not mention Bradley.\n\n\"With my new responsibilities to the Tour and the time commitments involved, I felt I could not commit the time to Team USA and the players required as captain,\" Woods said, before casting doubt that he will even lead the team in County Limerick in 2027.\n\n\"This does not mean I wouldn't want to captain in the future. If and when I feel it is the right time, I will put my hat in the ring for the committee to decide.\"\n\nIn other words, \"I'll call you\".", "source": {"uri": "telegraph.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Telegraph"}, "authors": [{"uri": "james_corrigan@telegraph.co.uk", "name": "James Corrigan", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional_Golfers'_Association_of_America", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Professional Golfers' Association of America"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryder_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ryder Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zach_Johnson", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Zach Johnson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiger_Woods", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Tiger Woods"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Europe"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luke_Donald", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Luke Donald"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bethpage_Black_Course", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bethpage Black Course"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keegan_Bradley", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Keegan Bradley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rome", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rome"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Rome"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jordan_Spieth", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jordan Spieth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Britain", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Great Britain"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Golf"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manhattan", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Manhattan"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Manhattan"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ireland", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ireland"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ireland"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gleneagles_Hotel", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gleneagles Hotel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Watson_(golfer)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tom Watson (golfer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rickie_Fowler", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rickie Fowler"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PGA_Tour", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "PGA Tour"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wild_card_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wild card (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netflix", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Netflix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xander_Schauffele", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Xander Schauffele"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medinah,_Illinois", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Medinah, Illinois"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Medinah, Illinois"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/County_Limerick", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "County Limerick"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "County Limerick"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ireland"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 94}], "image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/golf/2024/07/09/TELEMMGLPICT000384993663_17205501407230_trans_NvBQzQNjv4Bqjj7NJ3YiIjAb1WHq3sE3uv4Xpit_DMGvdp2n7FDd82k.jpeg?impolicy=logo-overlay", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9718810", "eventUri": "eng-9718810", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2470588235294118, "wgt": 181, "relevance": 1}
{"uri": "8217458496", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2024-07-09", "time": "18:20:50", "dateTime": "2024-07-09T18:20:50Z", "dateTimePub": "2024-07-09T18:20:15Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.7098039388656616, "url": "https://golf.com/news/1-ominous-truth-keegan-bradley-ryder-cup-captain/", "title": "1 ominous truth about Keegan Bradley as Ryder Cup captain", "body": "Keegan Bradley is the new American Ryder Cup captain, but one aspect of the job will be particularly tricky for him.\n\nIf we are to take people at their word -- yes, a somewhat foolish approach these days -- then we are to believe that Tiger Woods strongly considered taking the job of American Ryder Cup captain. We are also to believe that Stewart Cink was ready for the gig, too, hoping to be chosen as recently as Monday afternoon. We are to believe that there was plenty of internal discussion for the PGA of America (and its recently departed CEO Seth Waugh) about the commitments and the demands laid upon next year's American leader.\n\nPerhaps that is why we're all stunned by the selection of 38-year-old Keegan Bradley. We never really considered a captain so...young. And so busy.\n\nThere's no way around the shock of it. Bradley called it the most surprising call he'll ever receive, two Sundays ago on his way home from the Travelers Championship. But he knows exactly what you know -- that he merits an opportunity at some point, given his career achievements and passion for the event, but that right now it's a curious one. Namely because he has zero experience as a vice captain, often a prerequisite for learning the role. Players are conditioned for decades to compete exclusively as individuals -- but are suddenly asked to lead, taught how pairing decisions get made, dive into the intricacies of course setup, asked to manage itineraries and minor controversies (and also how to deliver peanut putter sandwiches to hungry players). The last time Bradley posed for Ryder Cup team photos, his hair was fuller, darker and longer. It was 10 years ago. But that might be exactly the point behind his appointment. He's the freshest of faces for a team that might need it.\n\nThe American Ryder Cup Committee has laid out the expectations that every captain fills the role of vice captain at the following Cup. So Bradley's involvement isn't finished with Bethpage. He'll be assisting the squad at Adare Manor in three years, too. In other words, there's your playing career and then there's your captaining career. They're different and they overlap, but only in the most ceremonial way. But Bradley's playing career doesn't seem close to finished.\n\nHis last few seasons have seen some of the best golf of his life. So good that Bradley won in late 2022 and then again in the summer of '23. Good enough for two second-place finishes here in '24. All of it so good that he nearly qualified for Team USA nine months ago, and merits consideration for the Presidents Cup a few months from now. The man always starts his playing calendar in Hawaii, then most of the West Coast swing, three events in Florida and rarely puts the clubs away for more than a week. Add it all up and he's likely to spend 25 of his next 60 weeks competing for himself. He sees that as an asset for team-building. A more pessimistic view would call it distracting.\n\nThe ominous truth hanging over Bradley's next 15 months is simple: time. He was introduced Tuesday and is making an initial site-visit to Bethpage Wednesday. Just in time to fly across the Atlantic for next week's Open Championship. Were the demands of a captain any less, Tiger Woods would have comfortably accepted the job months ago. But Woods has a lot going on, between being a father and trying to be a competitive golfer and also leading the PGA Tour membership as the head of its various policy boards. Woods waffled on the captaincy and all it requires -- the Bethpage visits, the meetings with PGA of America brass, the prep for public speaking engagements, the endless questions from the media, the photos in Ralph Lauren gear, etc. Next week, when Woods is asked why he declined, he won't share a specific detail that took him out of the running. Likely because it's the whole lot.\n\nThis week at the Scottish Open, Ryder Cup Europe is already hosting a team gathering, a reminder that the captaincy is a two-year ordeal (and that Team USA is already about five months behind). A long list of potential teammates will be invited to the soir\u00e9e, a reminder of just how many difficult phone calls captains eventually have to make, letting their peers down. Europe has the Hero Cup in January, too, where all those potential teammates are invited to compete against and alongside each other, hoping to prove their mettle in team golf. The Americans -- 12 Americans, that is -- have the Presidents Cup, but will Bradley be involved there?\n\nThat would be the next step, surely -- Bradley earning one of the final two vice captain roles on Jim Furyk's coaching staff.

He has yet to record a hole-in-one, but he did secure an M.A. in Sports Journalism from St. Bonaventure University.\n\nIn a surprising twist that shocked the golf world -- and even Keegan Bradley himself -- the PGA of America hand-picked Bradley to captain the United States team at next year's Ryder Cup at Bethpage Black.\n\nBefore the announcement, many speculated that Tiger Woods would lead Team USA on the Black Course, where he won the 2002 U.S. Open. But Woods turned down the offer a few weeks ago. He gave his reason why in a statement delivered Tuesday by Julius Mason from the PGA of America:\n\n\"With my new responsibilities to the Tour and time commitments involved, I felt I could not commit the time to Team USA and the players required as a captain,\" Woods said.\n\n\"That does not mean I wouldn't want to captain a team in the future. If/when I feel it is the right time, I will put my hat in the ring for the committee to decide.\"\n\nWhether Woods will have a role on the 2025 U.S. Ryder Cup team remains to be seen.\n\n\"I have told him he can be as involved as he wants to be,\" Bradley said Tuesday in New York.\n\n\"We all look up to Tiger; his opinion means a lot to us. Being in team rooms with Tiger, the public doesn't realize how important this is to him. It's everything. He lives and breathes [the Ryder Cup]. It shows you how much he cares by turning this position down because he didn't feel he could put in what he needed to do with his responsibilities and what's going on with the tour.\"\n\nThe PGA Tour welcomed Woods to its Policy Board last August. Since then, the 15-time major winner has helped the tour secure a $1.5 billion investment from the Strategic Sports Group (SSG), a consortium of American sports owners that includes John Henry of the Boston Red Sox, Arthur Blank of the Atlanta Falcons, and Steve Cohen of the New York Mets, among others.\n\nWoods has also been vital in negotiating a deal with the Saudi Public Investment Fund (PIF) -- LIV Golf's beneficiary. Talks between the PGA Tour and the PIF remain ongoing, which explains why Woods did not want to commit to the captaincy.\n\nThat said, Bradley felt obligated to contact Woods for his mentorship and his approval.\n\n\"I needed to talk to Tiger before accepting the role. I wanted to make sure I [could do it]. I wanted to hear from him,\" Bradley added.\n\n\"[Over the last two weeks,] I've spoken to Tiger a bunch. I talked to him this morning on the phone. He's been very helpful. Tiger has always been really helpful to me. He's a great voice to hear, and he's been nothing but -- he's been reaching out to me and helping me, which has been amazing.\"\n\nEven though Woods will not serve as captain, it sounds as if he will still play a role -- regardless of whether he returns as an official vice-captain. Nobody has a better resume than him, even though his Ryder Cup record is not as strong as it should be. Still, Woods' presence -- on the ground at Bethpage or via phone from Florida -- will consequently help Bradley and the Americans as a whole.", "source": {"uri": "sbnation.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "SB Nation"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jack_milko@sbnation.com", "name": "Jack Milko", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiger_Woods", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tiger Woods"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryder_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ryder Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Golf"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bradley_Braves_men's_basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Bradley Braves men's basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bethpage_Black_Course", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Bethpage Black Course"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_national_baseball_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States national baseball team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional_Golfers'_Association_of_America", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Professional Golfers' Association of America"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Bonaventure_University", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "St. Bonaventure University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keegan_Bradley", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Keegan Bradley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hole_in_one", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hole in one"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_men's_national_soccer_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States men's national soccer team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._Open_(golf)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "U.S. Open (golf)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_Investment_Fund", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Public Investment Fund"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "New York (state)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PGA_Tour", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "PGA Tour"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LIV_Golf", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "LIV Golf"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Cohen_(politician)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Steve Cohen (politician)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_W._Henry", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "John W.

I feel like moving forward I'm going to have to automatically qualify for the Ryder Cup.\"\n\nBradley will officially get the nod with a noon press conference Tuesday in Manhattan.", "source": {"uri": "nypost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "New York Post"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keegan_Bradley", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Keegan Bradley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zach_Johnson", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Zach Johnson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captain_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Captain (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryder_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Ryder Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Full_Swing_(2023_TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Full Swing (2023 TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justin_Thomas_(baseball)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Justin Thomas (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netflix", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Netflix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_national_baseball_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States national baseball team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Europe"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Golf"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf_Channel", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Golf Channel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiger_Woods", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tiger Woods"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manhattan", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Manhattan"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Manhattan"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hartford,_Connecticut", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hartford, Connecticut"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Hartford, Connecticut"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Competitions", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Competitions", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Kidnapping", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Kidnapping", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/CONMEBOL", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/CONMEBOL", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Squash", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Squash", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 68}], "image": "https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/07/newspress-collage-z6op8crgr-1720534818896.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&1720520520&w=1024", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9718810", "eventUri": "eng-9718810", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2, "wgt": 179, "relevance": 1}

He last competed in 2018 with Jim Furyk as captain.\n\n\"With my new responsibilities to the TOUR and time commitments involved, I felt like I would not be able to commit the time to Team USA and the players required as a captain,\" Woods said in a statement released Tuesday by the PGA of America. \"That does not mean I wouldn't want to captain a team in the future. If and when I feel it is the right time, I will put my hat in the ring for this committee to decide.\"\n\nThe five-time Masters Tournament champion took on the role of Vice Chairman for the PGA Tour last year. Woods also has other projects in the works, including a golf simulator league (TGL) that he's putting together with Rory McIlroy. It was set to launch in January of 2024, but the venue was destroyed. The site of the venue is in Florida. The launch is now delayed until 2025. Some of the world's top golfers have committed to play in the league, including Justin Thomas, Collin Morikawa, Xander Schauffele, Max Homa, and Matt Fitzpatrick.\n\nThe winningest golfer on the PGA Tour also has a new sports bar opening up with pop icon Justin Timberlake. The duo recently received approval to convert St. Andrews New Picture House Cinema into the second location of the pair's T-Squared Social sports bar.\n\nInstead of Tiger Woods, Team USA's captain will be former PGA Championship winner Keegan Bradley. Bradley, who competed for Team USA at the Ryder Cup in 2012 and 2014, first as a qualifier, then as a captain's pick, had his rejection from the 2023 team documented on season two of Netflix's Full Swing.\n\n\"I am incredibly honored to accept this opportunity to captain the United States Team at the 2025 Ryder Cup,\" Bradley said on Tuesday. 'I would like to thank the PGA of America Ryder Cup Committee for their trust in me as we embark on this journey to Bethpage Black.\n\n\"My passion and appreciation for golf's greatest team event have never been stronger.

Mandatory Credit: Reinhold Matay-USA TODAY Sports\n\nIf you expect Tiger Woods to return to the Ryder Cup next year, you will be disappointed. Despite rumors to the contrary that he would be the Ryder Cup captain, Woods turned down the gig, according to reports.\n\nOn Monday, Keegan Bradley was unveiled as Team USA's 2025 Ryder Cup captain. Bradley is a six-time Tour champion and was not on the team last year when the Europeans embarrassed the Americans in the 45th edition of the biennial competition at Bethpage Black in Farmingdale, New York.\n\n\"I am incredibly honored to accept this opportunity to Captain the United States Team at the 2025 Ryder Cup,\" 2011 PGA Championship victor Bradley said in a statement to the PGA of America, who decided the captaincy, on Monday.\n\n\"My passion and appreciation for golf's greatest team event have never been stronger. The Ryder Cup is unlike any other competition in our sport, and this edition will undoubtedly be particularly special given the rich history and enthusiastic spectators at this iconic course. I look forward to beginning preparations for 2025.\"\n\nPGA of America President John Lindert seems to be pleased with the pick.\n\n\"I am proud and excited to name Keegan Bradley as Captain of the 2025 United States Ryder Cup Team,\" said Lindert.\n\n\"Keegan's past Ryder Cup experience, strong relationships and unwavering passion for this event will prove invaluable as he guides the U.S. Team over the next year and a half. We are confident that with Keegan at the helm, the 2025 U.S. Ryder Cup Team will compete at Bethpage with the same confidence and determination that has defined his career.\"\n\nIt would have been a huge feather in the American's cap had Woods been announced captain since he is, of course, a 15-time majors champ and helped lead the Americans to the 2019 Ryder Cup victory. However, reports say that Woods turned down the gig because of his busy schedule and trying to help in negotiations between LIV Golf and the PGA.\n\nWoods has even said that he was \"dedicating so much time\" to his involvement in peace talks between the PGA Tour and LIV Golf, adding: \"I don't want to fulfill the role of the captaincy if I can't do it.\"\n\nBesides that, Woods just announced his new venture with Justin Timberlake, where he and the pop star will be opening a sports bar near St. Andrews Golf course, home to several British Open Championships.\n\nHe also has a new golf venture with Rory McIlroy, which will officially kick off in January of 2025, so Woods has a lot on his plate. But, interestingly, the American team would go this route instead of picking another veteran to head the team like Phil Mickelson.\n\nYes, Mickelson plays a heavy role in LIV Golf. Still, it wouldn't hurt to have an experienced guy like him on the team, and it would have shown that the Americans are willing to put politics aside to win.\n\nBut it is quite apparent that the hard feelings between the two tours remain, so don't expect this to change until the merger between them happens.", "source": {"uri": "thecomeback.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Comeback"},

On Monday, however, it was reported by The Telegraph that Woods had turned down the opportunity having received the offer from the PGA of America.\n\nLater that day it was officially announced that Woods' fellow PGA Tour star Keegan Bradley would take on the role, nine months after being snubbed as a player by his predecessor Zach Johnson.\n\nREAD MORE: Keegan Bradley showed true colours with response to Ryder Cup rejection from Zach Johnson\n\nREAD MORE: Keegan Bradley to capitalise after Tiger Woods snubs Team USA captaincy for Ryder Cup\n\nWoods is yet to comment on his decision not to take on the role, but one man who has had his say is one of Team USA's biggest stars in Schauffele. \"I think a lot of people were banking on Tiger to do it,' the US PGA champion claimed ahead of this week's Scottish Open.\n\n\"He obviously has a lot on his plate.\" What Schauffele was referring to was no doubt Woods' current role away from the golf course, representing his players in the negotiations between the PGA Tour and Public Investment Fund (PIF), with the finalised deal expected to end their dispute with LIV Golf.\n\nWoods himself confessed similar when asked at May's PGA Championship whether he was any closer to becoming Ryder Cup captain. \"We're still talking,\" he said at Valhalla. \"There's nothing that has been confirmed yet. We're still working on what that might look like. Also whether or not I have the time to do it.\n\nFor all the latest on news, politics, sports, and showbiz from the USA, go toThe Mirror US.\n\n\"I'm dedicating so much time to what we're doing with the PGA Tour, I don't want to not fulfil the role of the captaincy if I can't do it. What that all entails and representing Team USA and the commitments to the PGA of America, the players, and the fans and as I said, all of Team USA. I need to feel that I can give the amount of time that it deserves.\"\n\nWhilst addressing Woods' snub Schauffele discussed the prospects of working alongside Bradley, who could well act as a player-captain if he finds form on the PGA Tour in the build-up. \"Yeah, it's surprising. You typically expect someone that's a little bit older to get selected as a captain,\" Schauffele claimed.\n\n\"So Keegan expressed his love for the Ryder Cup publicly, which we all saw, and I'm sure -- I haven't talked to him or seen him yet, but I'm sure he's over the moon and is going to do a great job... Knowing Keegan and how good of a job he's going to want to do, he's going to love doing the press and talking about the tournament and the Cup and proud to be an American, all those things. It's going to be really interesting and fun to see.\"", "source": {"uri": "mirror.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Mirror"}, "authors": [{"uri": "joshua_lees@mirror.co.uk", "name": "Joshua Lees", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keegan_Bradley", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Keegan Bradley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PGA_Tour", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "PGA Tour"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captain_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Captain (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiger_Woods", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tiger Woods"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryder_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ryder Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xander_Schauffele", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Xander Schauffele"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zach_Johnson", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Zach Johnson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional_Golfers'_Association_of_America", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Professional Golfers' Association of America"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Daily_Telegraph", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Daily Telegraph"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LIV_Golf", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "LIV Golf"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_Investment_Fund", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Public Investment Fund"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottish_Open_(golf)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Scottish Open (golf)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf_course", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Golf course"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PGA_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "PGA Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valhalla_Golf_Club", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Valhalla Golf Club"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Organizations", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Rules_and_Etiquette", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Rules and Etiquette", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Humor", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Humor", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 95}], "image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article33067753.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_US-Open-Round-Two.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9718810", "eventUri": "eng-9718810", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.03529411764705881, "wgt": 176, "relevance": 1}

He has yet to record a hole-in-one, but he did secure an M.A. in Sports Journalism from St. Bonaventure University.\n\nAfter tying for 39th at the Travelers Championship three weeks ago, Keegan Bradley got in his car with his two young children and made the three-hour drive home. The Travelers defending champion was exhausted from a grueling three-week stretch that included the U.S. Open sandwiched in between.\n\nAdd his parenting duties to that, and Bradley felt drained. All he wanted to do was sit at home, relax, and take some time off to spend with his wife, Jillian, and children. So later that night, after dinner, when he finally got his kids to bed, he sat down in his chair to unwind from the wild month that had been.\n\nWith Waugh and Lindert listening in, Johnson delivered shocking news: Keegan Bradley -- not Tiger Woods, Fred Couples, or Stewart Cink -- will serve as the American Ryder Cup captain in 2025 at Bethpage Black.\n\n\"I don't think I'll ever be more surprised by anything in my entire life. I had no idea... I was in complete shock,\" Bradley said Tuesday.\n\n\"It took a while for it to sink in. I wasn't fully comfortable with some of the people that were passed over. I have a lot of respect for the people who came before me and people who deserve to be in this position, so that was a heavy thought and moment.\"\n\nOf course, this represents a full-circle moment for Johnson and Bradley. Last August, Johnson phoned Bradley and informed him that he had missed out on the 2023 Ryder Cup team. Netflix's Full Swing series even captured the heartbreaking moment live on camera, which aired during one of the episodes. But even without the live shot of Bradley and his wife Jillian in disbelief, golf fans criticized Johnson for leaving the 2011 PGA Championship winner off the team.\n\n\"This is such a huge decision, and I don't think it would ever be based on how someone was portrayed on TV,\" Bradley said when asked if he thought his Netflix appearance played a role.\n\n\"I think that the Ryder Cup committee has a very serious job, especially with the event being at Bethpage in New York, in America, to make a decision that's best for the team. I couldn't imagine that they would decide based on how Netflix portrayed me in filming. I was very grateful for the Ryder Cup's decision, and I would be very surprised if any of that went into that decision.\"\n\nWhat led to the PGA of America's decision is Bradley's immense passion for this competition. Nobody bleeds red, white, and blue more than Bradley, as he has said that he thinks about the Ryder Cup \"every second he is awake.\"\n\nBut he has struggled to sleep lately, which has made him think about his obsession with the Ryder Cup even more. Bradley admitted that he has had numerous sleepless nights over the past two weeks because he has envisioned every possible scenario already -- roughly 14 months from when the Ryder Cup begins. Surely, more insomnia will follow between now and then.", "source": {"uri": "sbnation.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "SB Nation"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jack_milko@sbnation.com", "name": "Jack Milko", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keegan_Bradley", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Keegan Bradley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryder_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Ryder Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Golf"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Bonaventure_University", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "St. Bonaventure University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hole_in_one", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hole in one"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travelers_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Travelers Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._Open_(golf)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "U.S. Open (golf)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Full_Swing_(2023_TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Full Swing (2023 TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stewart_Cink", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Stewart Cink"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bethpage_Black_Course", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bethpage Black Course"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fred_Couples", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fred Couples"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiger_Woods", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tiger Woods"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netflix", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Netflix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "New York (state)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional_Golfers'_Association_of_America", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Professional Golfers' Association of America"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PGA_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "PGA Championship"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Competitions", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Competitions", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 93}], "image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/A8Slwo-dBsOVt5We-AWZLRRLbBA=/0x144:1634x961/fit-in/1200x600/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25524041/Screenshot_2024_07_09_at_3.38.35_PM.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9718810", "eventUri": "eng-9718810", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1450980392156862, "wgt": 175, "relevance": 1}

I was really honoured, it was just such a shock that I needed a little bit of time to just figure out what happened. It took a couple of days for it to set in, really. But I was excited about it from the start.\"\n\nWhile Mickelson is not up for the vice-captain role, and no discussions regarding these positions have occurred, Bradley did announce his intention to adopt a younger approach. Last year, Zach Johnson chose Steve Stricker, Davis Love III, Jim Furyk, Fred Couples and Stewart Cink as his vice-captains.\n\n\"I would say I'm going to take a fresh look at my vice-captains,\" Bradley stated. \"They're going to be a lot younger, closer to playing.\"", "source": {"uri": "mirror.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Mirror"}, "authors": [{"uri": "rich_jones@mirror.co.uk", "name": "Rich Jones", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keegan_Bradley", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Keegan Bradley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phil_Mickelson", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Phil Mickelson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiger_Woods", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tiger Woods"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryder_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ryder Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LIV_Golf", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "LIV Golf"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stewart_Cink", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Stewart Cink"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Stricker", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Steve Stricker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Davis_Love_III", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Davis Love III"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Furyk", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jim Furyk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fred_Couples", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fred Couples"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zach_Johnson", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Zach Johnson"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Romance", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Romance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 70}], "image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/news/article33206066.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_phil-mikelson-keegan-bradley-gettyimages-472260470.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9718810", "eventUri": "eng-9718810", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.09019607843137245, "wgt": 173, "relevance": 1}

Then it became official that afternoon with the PGA's surprise announcement that Keegan Bradley had been named captain of the U.S. squad for 2025.\n\n\"I don't think I'll ever be more surprised of anything in my entire life. I was, I had no idea. It took awhile for it to sink in,\" Bradley said in a press conference announcing his selection on Tuesday in New York City. \"I've spoken to Tiger a bunch. I spoke to him this morning on the phone. He's been very helpful. Tiger has always been really helpful to me. He's a great voice to hear and he's been nothing but -- he's been reaching out to me helping me, which has been amazing.\"\n\nAt the event, the PGA of America also read off a statement from Woods explaining why he turned the job down.\n\n\"With my new responsibilities to the [PGA] Tour and time commitments involved I felt I would not be able to commit the time to Team USA and the players required as a captain,\" Woods said. \"That does not mean I wouldn't want to captain a team in the future. If/when I feel it is the right time, I will put my hat in the ring for this committee to decide.\"\n\nThe last time Woods was asked about captaining the Ryder Cup team was in May at the PGA Championship, where he confirmed talks were ongoing between him and then-PGA of America CEO Seth Waugh. But Waugh stepped down as head of the PGA last month after a six-year run at the helm when his contract was not renewed. Waugh and Woods are known to be close allies.\n\nBut even at Valhalla, Woods seemed wary of his prior commitments interfering with a potential captaincy.\n\n\"I'm dedicating my so much time to what we're doing with the PGA Tour, I don't want to not fulfill the role of the captaincy if I can't do it,\" Woods said at the PGA. \"What that all entails and representing Team USA and the commitments to the PGA of America, the players and the fans and as I said, all of Team USA.\n\n\"I need to feel that I can give the amount of time that it deserves.\"\n\nWoods was appointed to the PGA Tour Policy Board as a player director in August to help re-establish player control of the body. Since that time, he's taken an aggressive role in what ended up being a multi-billion dollar investment by the SSG and the ongoing negotiations with the Saudi PIF.\n\nIn addition to his work with his own company, TGR Ventures, which through his TGR Design firm is working on at least four courses at the moment, and his desire to still compete in major championships, Woods ultimately decided adding the Ryder Cup captaincy was too much for him.\n\nBut Bradley also wouldn't rule out Woods serving as a Ryder Cup vice captain at Bethpage Black as well.\n\n\"I have told him he can be as involved as he wants to be,\" Bradley said. \"We haven't talked about vice captains, I haven't talked to vice captains with really anybody. So we, as players, we all look up to Tiger and his opinion means a lot to us. Being in team rooms with Tiger, the public doesn't realize how important this is to him. It's everything. He lives and breathes this event.\n\n\"I think it shows you how much he cares by not, by turning this position down, because he didn't feel like he could put in what he needed to do with all of his responsibilities with what's going on with the Tour. I've been grateful -- before I accepted this job I needed to talk to Tiger and I wanted to make sure I -- I wanted to hear from him. We had a great conversation.

His elevation to captaincy comes after a heart-wrenching miss for a playing spot in the 2023 team in Italy, just nine months prior.\n\nIt was Johnson, the then-captain, who made the tough call to leave Bradley out, favouring golfing aces like Justin Thomas, Jordan Spieth, Rickie Fowler, Collin Morikawa, Sam Burns, and Brooks Koepka for his six picks.\n\nREAD MORE: Tiger Woods has 'a lot on his plate' amid LIV Golf merger after turning down Ryder Cup captaincy\n\nREAD MORE: Keegan Bradley to capitalise after Tiger Woods snubs Team USA captaincy for Ryder Cup\n\nFast forward to nearly a year later, and it's Johnson who's dishing out the good vibes, as he had the privilege of telling Bradley about his captaincy role. \"Zach Johnson was the one who told me that I was going to be the Ryder Cup captain for 2025,\" Bradley shared with enthusiasm on Tuesday.\n\n\"I think it just speaks as to what kind of person Zach Johnson is. I have such respect for him, he was one of my idols that I first looked up to when I came out on Tour. I feel terrible for what he has had to go through, and I am so honored that he was the one who called. I'm going to represent this decision to the best of my abilities and I am really excited.\"\n\nBradley also opened the door for LIV Golf players to be included and pledged to choose America's strongest squad irrespective of the tours the players are involved in. \"I'm going to have the 12 best players on the team. I don't care where they play. We have a mission to win this tournament and I don't care about the LIV stuff,\" he said.\n\n\"I want the best players on the team. By the time we get to Bethpage in 2025, we don't know how things are going to look. As it comes to going to LIV events, if there are guys that are on the fringe, I'm willing to do that.

I'm definitely not mad about it,\" said Rickie Fowler Tuesday at the Genesis Scottish Open.\n\nBut if player reaction was similar to how the fans processed the news, there was also a measure of optimism among those who will be vying for a spot on next year's team, primarily driven by Bradley's renowned enthusiasm for the event.\n\n\"I love Keegan, he's high-energy, he's very kind, I feel like he's very thoughtful and I think he cares quite a bit about the Ryder Cup as well, so the passion will be there,\" Max Homa said. \"High-energy's not bad, I like rah-rah stuff. I know it's a little corny but corny is not always a bad thing.\"\n\nBradley breaks the mold established for captains in recent years by the PGA of America on multiple fronts, including his age, who at 39 when the matches are contested, will be the youngest captain since Arnold Palmer, 34, in 1963.\n\nThat too, players contend, isn't a problem given the U.S. team's poor record the last few decades against the Europeans, who reclaimed the Ryder Cup last year with a commanding 16 \u00bd-11 \u00bd victory in Rome.\n\n\"It could be a great change,\" Fowler said. \"You can't expect to do the same things and hope for better outcomes.\"\n\nBradley also doesn't follow the formula established by the U.S. Ryder Cup task force, which was created following another lopsided loss in 2014 in Scotland, that laid the groundwork for continuity among captains by creating a pathway via multiple turns as a vice captain. Bradley has never served as a vice captain.\n\nBut it's Bradley's emotion and commitment to the matches, which he has played twice and has a 4-3-0 record, that players said gave them reason to be optimistic.\n\n\"I don't think anyone can doubt his passion or his intensity and fire, which I think as a player I want a captain I'm going to battle for,\" Justin Thomas said. \"I want to feel like they are going to want it as bad as I do. I know Keegan's intensity and he's going to want it.\"\n\nJordan Spieth echoed those comments.\n\n\"Just look at the passion he plays with week in and week out, let alone in Ryder Cups and big moments, he's a guy everybody can get behind,\" Spieth said. \"He cares so much he's going to take whatever necessary steps are needed from a captain to make sure everybody is heard and everybody feels like they're playing a normal tournament and are as best prepared as they can be.\"\n\nBradley's age and his competitive form -- he's currently 24 on the U.S. team standings and was in the mix for a potential pick last year -- was also cited as a potential advantage.\n\n\"I feel like [Steve] Stricker and Zach [Johnson] and Davis [Love III], they all can do it in their own way but I'm closer with Keegan. He's a little closer to my age, so maybe that connection will be really good,\" Homa said.\n\nThat connection could also create another deviation for the U.S. if Bradley were able to play his way onto the team next year. Bradley said during his Tuesday press conference in New York that he would play on the team if he qualified, but would not pick himself.\n\nThe PGA of America's move to a team manager, a role filled by former PGA Tour caddie and NBC Sports analyst John Wood, could help a potential playing captain by taking over normal demands on a captain's time. But Bradley would be the first playing captain for the U.S. team since Palmer in '63.\n\n\"We know how much the Ryder Cup means to Keegan and he can play his way on and be a playing captain,\" Fowler said. \"If you look at our lack of success we've had in the last few years, the addition of a manager, with John Wood being in that role right now, it takes a lot of the day to day a potential captain has to put into it.\"", "source": {"uri": "nbcsports.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NBC Sports"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keegan_Bradley", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Keegan Bradley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryder_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ryder Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rickie_Fowler", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Rickie Fowler"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_Homa", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Max Homa"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bethpage_Black_Course", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bethpage Black Course"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottish_Open_(golf)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Scottish Open (golf)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Berwick", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "North Berwick"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "North Berwick"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arnold_Palmer", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Arnold Palmer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional_Golfers'_Association_of_America", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Professional Golfers' Association of America"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jordan_Spieth", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jordan Spieth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Europe"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rome", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rome"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Rome"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scotland", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Scotland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Scotland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caddie", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Caddie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional_Golfers'_Association_(Great_Britain_and_Ireland)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Professional Golfers' Association (Great Britain and Ireland)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "New York (state)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PGA_Tour", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "PGA Tour"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manager_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Manager (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBC_Sports", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NBC Sports"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 87}], "image": "https://nbcsports.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/ce1aadb/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5527x3109+0+288/resize/1440x810!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fnbc-sports-production-nbc-sports.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F12%2Fac%2F3745ff9643ce9db9597a655f298a%2Fhttps-delivery-gettyimages.com%2Fdownloads%2F1744091617", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9718810", "eventUri": "eng-9718810", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "North Berwick"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.4431372549019608, "wgt": 168, "relevance": 1}

Woods was the firm favorite to lead Team USA at Bethpage Black next September but turned down the role.\n\nInstead, Bradley got the call to lead his country into the prestigious tournament as they look to regain the iconic trophy after last year's thrilling encounter in Rome. Before accepting, Bradley felt compelled to call Woods and get his blessing.\n\nBradley was asked directly about the prospect of selecting Woods as a vice-captain, a role which would be far less strenuous in terms of time commitments, the factor cited by Woods as his reason for turning the position down. And while he says it is far too early to determine who his vice-captains will be, he made it clear he wants and needs Woods to be involved in some capacity.\n\nREAD MORE: Tiger Woods has 'a lot on his plate' amid LIV Golf merger after turning down Ryder Cup captaincy\n\nREAD MORE: Keegan Bradley to capitalise after Tiger Woods snubs Team USA captaincy for Ryder Cup\n\n\"When it comes to Tiger, I have told him he can be as involved as he wants to be,\" Bradley said. \"We haven't talked about vice-captains, I haven't talked vice-captains with really anybody.\n\n\"We as players, we all look up to Tiger and his opinion means a lot to us.

But the greatest golfer of all time has been proactive in offering support and guidance with the pair already in regular contact.\n\n\"I've spoken to Tiger a bunch,\" he said. \"I spoke to him this morning on the phone.

I don't care where they play,\" Bradley said. \"We have a mission to win this tournament. I'm not worried about the LIV stuff. I want the best players on the team.\"\n\nBradley's comments represented a stark difference to the approach of his predecessor, Zach Johnson, who at times sounded dismissive of a LIV player's chances of making the Ryder Cup team. His tone eventually softened last summer once Brooks Koepka finished runner-up at the 2023 Masters and won the PGA Championship. For months, Koepka was among the top points-earners but eventually fell just outside the top-6 qualifying spots and needed a captain's pick.\n\nA similar situation could unfold next year, with Bryson DeChambeau already boasting a strong major record in 2024 that includes his victory at the U.S. Open.\n\nIt remains to be seen, too, whether the PGA Tour and LIV Golf, which is funded by Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund, will still be at odds by fall 2025, with the two sides currently working toward a deal that would unify the sport.\n\nTo be eligible for the Ryder Cup, a U.S. player must be a member of the PGA of America.\n\n\"I'll have to wait and see how everything shakes out,\" Bradley said, \"and my biggest concern is having the best players on the team.\"\n\nBradley was a stunning choice for the appointment but only after the organization's top choices fell through. For years, it was widely assumed that that 2025 captaincy would go to Phil Mickelson, who was a beloved presence in New York during the two U.S. Opens held at Bethpage Black. But Mickelson fell out of favor after he became one of the upstart league's chief recruiters.\n\nBradley successfully partnered with Mickelson, going 4-1 in two cups together, and he was asked Tuesday about Mickelson's possible involvement at Bethpage, either in an official or unofficial capacity.\n\n\"I still have a great relationship with Phil, but I don't think he's interested in being a vice captain - and to be honest with you, he's a captain someday, I think,\" Bradley said. \"I haven't spoken to Phil. I don't want to speak for him at all. But I think he's pretty busy with what he's doing, and I have nothing but great things to say about Phil and our memories together, and what we did at the Ryder Cup is really my fondest memories in the game.\"", "source": {"uri": "nbcsports.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NBC Sports"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keegan_Bradley", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Keegan Bradley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryder_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ryder Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PGA_Tour", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "PGA Tour"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brooks_Koepka", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Brooks Koepka"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York (state)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zach_Johnson", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Zach Johnson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LIV_Golf", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "LIV Golf"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_Investment_Fund", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Public Investment Fund"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bryson_DeChambeau", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bryson DeChambeau"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._Open_(golf)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "U.S. Open (golf)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PGA_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "PGA Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phil_Mickelson", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Phil Mickelson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saudi_Arabia", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Saudi Arabia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Saudi Arabia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bethpage_Black_Course", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bethpage Black Course"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional_Golfers'_Association_of_America", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Professional Golfers' Association of America"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Competitions", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Competitions", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Rules_and_Etiquette", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Rules and Etiquette", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Humor", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Humor", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 64}], "image": "https://nbcsports.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/263062b/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1920x1080+0+0/resize/1440x810!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fhdliveextra-a.akamaihd.net%2FHD%2Fimage_sports%2FNBCU_Sports_Group_-_nbcsports%2F142%2F91%2Fnbc_golf_gt_bradleyintv_240709.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9718810", "eventUri": "eng-9718810", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3411764705882352, "wgt": 166, "relevance": 1}

Last year, despite a strong summer of golf jumpstarted by a win at the Travelers Championship, Bradley was passed over by captain Zach Johnson in favor of past-their-prime stars Justin Thomas and Rickie Fowler.\n\nTeam USA lost by 5 1/2 points to Team Europe at Marco Simone Golf Course in Rome. (Former World No. 1 Luke Donald will be returning as Team Europe captain in 2025.)\n\n\"The thing is, those guys are close. They're not just PGA Tour-close, they're close friends,\" Bradley said about Johnson's picks. \"If you take golf out of the equation, they're legit close friends. You have your close friends as a golfer and then you have your close PGA Tour friends, and a lot of the time your close friends aren't on the tour.\"\n\n\"I really was rooting for those guys,\" Bradley told me about the snub. \"That was real. My wife and I -- we both wanted them to win and do well. But, it was important, someday, for my kids to also realize, like, sometimes if you don't get your way or what you want, you still have to do the right thing. And that's what we wanted to do.\"\n\nBradley -- who will become the youngest captain since Arnold Palmer in 1963 -- said he was in \"complete shock\" to learn of the offer.\n\n\"Yeah, it's surprising,\" Xander Schauffele said Tuesday at Genesis Scottish Open. \"You typically expect someone that's a little bit older to get selected as a captain. I think a lot of people expected Tiger to do it. He obviously has a lot on his plate. Keegan expressed his love for the Ryder Cup publicly, which we all saw.\"\n\nTiger has competed in eight Ryder Cups, spanning from 1997 t0 2018. He was a vice captain at Hazeltine in 2016.

I think a lot of people were banking on Tiger to do it. He obviously has a lot on his plate. So Keegan expressed his love for the Ryder Cup publicly, which we all saw. I haven't talked to him or seen him yet, but I'm sure he's over the moon and is going to do a great job.\"\n\nLast year, Bradley was a potential captain's pick but was one of the first players left off the team. Netflix's \"Full Swing\" captured the moments Bradley, with his wife, Jillian, found out he wasn't selected. As someone who had long been vocal about how much the event meant to him, he was crushed.\n\n\"I think about the Ryder Cup every second I'm awake, basically,\" Bradley said, weeks before the 2023 team was announced. \"My biggest thing right now is trying not to think about it while I'm playing because it's that important to me.\"\n\nBradley, 38, played in two Ryder Cups, both losses in 2012 and 2014, and has a career record of 4-3 in the event. He was a high-energy player in those Cups -- and still is today on Tour -- although Schauffele said he's not always like that outside the ropes.\n\n\"He is so laid back off the course,\" Schauffele said. \"If you get him in like a dinner setting or something, he loves sports. He'll talk about sports all night long if you like. He's a very passionate individual. On the course, he's intense. That's just how he competes and how he is. I'm sure as a captain he's going to have sort of a mixed bag. He won't be afraid and will get everyone going. I don't know if he's coached or captained any other teams in his life, whether it's his kids' teams or something like that, but when someone is really passionate about something, they usually do really well.\"\n\nAlthough, according to Schauffele, there are certain things a captain can do to make life easier on the team. For starters, he said, he hopes Bradley cuts down on all the obligatory Ryder Cup pomp and circumstance.\n\n\"Taking a bunch of photos all dressed up. I would be the first guy that I need to flee quickly. It just seems like it's all these little, even like team dinners or things of that nature, we can have them sort of quick and inside versus having to go out, dress up and all those things,\" Schauffele said. \"It's just small things.

Here's what Keegan Bradley says", "body": "Phil Mickelson and Keegan Bradley at the 2014 Ryder Cup in Gleneagles, Scotland.\n\nKeegan Bradley's Ryder Cup captaincy certainly came as a surprise, which is ironic, because it wasn't long ago that the U.S. captain for the 2025 Bethpage Black Ryder Cup seemed practically a slam dunk to be Phil Mickelson.\n\nMickelson has long been a fan favorite in the Greater New York area. He won his second major, the 2005 PGA Championship, at nearby Baltusrol in New Jersey. But he's also suffered some of his greatest heartbreaks in New York, as four of his six U.S. Open runner-up finishes have taken place in the state.\n\nHe was second to Tiger Woods at Bethpage Black in 2002, the runner-up to Retief Goosen at Shinnecock Hills in 2004, lost to Geoff Ogilvy at Winged Foot in 2006 and, finally, was the runner-up to Lucas Glover at Bethpage in 2009.\n\nIn a way, those losses (and the way in which Mickelson treated and was received by the fans) might have earned Mickelson even more fanfare. He later won his second PGA title at Kiawah Island in 2021, putting yet another feather in his cap to someday captain the U.S. Ryder Cup team (an event run by the PGA of America).\n\nBut much changed in the summer of 2022, when Mickelson joined LIV Golf and, in the time since, has thrown several jabs while airing his grievances with the PGA Tour.\n\nMickelson wasn't even a part of the 2023 Ryder Cup in Rome.\n\nOn Tuesday, at his introductory press conference, Bradley was asked if Mickelson would have a role on his team. Despite Mickelson being 16 years older than Bradley, the two are close. They played those famous Mickelson-led Tuesday money games, teaming up as partners in many of them. In the two Ryder Cups Bradley qualified for, he paired with Mickelson to go 4-1, including a 3-0 record at Medinah in 2012.\n\n\"I still have a great relationship with Phil,\" Bradley said Tuesday. \"I don't think he's interested in being a vice captain. And to be honest with you, he's a captain, someday, I think. I haven't spoken to Phil, I don't want to speak for him at all, but I think he's pretty busy with what he's doing and I have nothing but great things to say about Phil and our memories together, and what we did at the Ryder Cup is really one of my fondest memories in the game.\"\n\nOf course, Mickelson could always qualify or earn a pick for the team, too. (Although, as it stands, the pathway isn't easy for LIV players.) Brooks Koepka was the only LIV player on last year's U.S. Ryder Cup team, but when Bradley was asked about LIV players' future for the 2025 Ryder Cup, he answered so quickly it was almost as if he was ready for it.\n\n\"I'm going to have the 12 best players on the team,\" he said. \"I don't care where they play.\"", "source": {"uri": "golf.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Golf"}, "authors": [],

Would he pick players from the three-season-old, Saudi-backed league that has fought with the PGA Tour? Last year, ahead of the biennial event, his predecessor had. Would Bradley go to LIV events to scout? Last year, his predecessor seemingly hadn't.\n\nBradley said he would, though, and he said he wouldn't shy from LIV selections. Three times in response to a question on how he would handle LIV players, he noted a qualification for his team's makeup.\n\nBest players.\n\n\"I'm going to have the 12 best players on the team,\" Bradley said. \"I don't care what, where they play. So we're, we have a mission to win this tournament. I'm not worried about the LIV stuff.\n\n\"I want the best players on the team.\n\n\"By the time we get to Bethpage in 2025, we have no clue how the layout of the golf world's going to be. As it comes to going to LIV events, if there's guys that are on the fringe, I'm willing to do that. Again, I've only been the captain for two weeks and we haven't really even gotten the real points started, which start next year. So I'll have to wait and see how everything shakes out, and my biggest concern is having the best players on the team.\"\n\nNotably, since LIV's creation, there's been just one other Ryder Cup where this has been also addressed, and there's been only one other U.S. captain who's had to address LIV: last year, when Zach Johnson did so. In the end, he did pick LIV pro Brooks Koepka among his six captain's picks for the 12-player team that went on to lose to the European side in Italy, and last July, Johnson described his LIV protocol this way:\n\n\"When it comes to the Ryder Cup, our system, if you will, was already intact arguably last year even when we decided as a Ryder Cup committee as to how we wanted to navigate the landscape.\n\n\"My point in saying that is that what's transpiring in professional golf from a competitive level, competition level, is PGA Tour; right? It's not PGA of America [which runs the U.S. Ryder Cup team]. So the individuals that are Americans that play on other tours that are not the PGA Tour, they could play, I mean, technically the Latin Tour or the Asian Tour or wherever. More times than not they're going to be members of the PGA of America for a number of reasons. Our liability insurance is number one and some other benefits.\n\n\"These guys that left the PGA Tour that had status and left to play on that other tour, the LIV Tour, they're still members of the PGA of America, so they are still able to garner points. They're able to play in the PGA Championship as a result because that's what the PGA of America runs. Obviously, technically, can still be a part of Team USA.\"\n\nBut would Johnson watch LIV pros at their tournaments? At the time, to determine six automatic picks to the team and to potentially help with the six captain's selections, the U.S. used a ranking system that awarded points based on PGA Tour and major championship play -- and the former was blocked to LIV players. Under this system, Koepka finished seventh in the standings, largely due to a win at the PGA Championship.\n\nThere, in May, Johnson had this exchange, started by a reporter:\n\n\"Earlier in the week, you said you have not witnessed the LIV Golf, you haven't been going out and watching it. Is that something you'll change? We have seen at the Masters, we are seeing it here ...\"\n\n\"Are you expecting me,\" Johnson said, \"to go to LIV events and spectate?\"\n\n\"Yeah. As a captain, it seems logical if these guys ...\"\n\n\"I think the luxury of me being captain,\" Johnson said, \"I'm still relevant and prevalent out on the PGA Tour and that's where my status holds. So for me to abandon that on a week where I could be out there and go where the bulk of my players are certainly going to come from there, I don't know what time will tell, but the bulk are going to come from there would be irresponsible on my behalf and inappropriate if I were to leave what I am trying to do as a competitor and as a leader.\"\n\n\"Would that stand as the whole season? Do you have no plans to go to any?\"\n\n\"Hasn't been discussed,\" Johnson said. \"I'm not one that's ever to say never, but it's not been discussed.\"\n\nLater in the interview, Johnson was asked about watching LIV broadcasts.\n\nDo you get the CW event to watch their broadcast or YouTube?\n\n\"I didn't know that,\" Johnson said. \"I do get to see it -- I have to ask my kids. I think I get the CW.\"\n\n\"The point is, you can still assess and analyze the players without going to watch them?\"\n\n\"Sure, that's what I'm saying,\" Johnson said. \"I don't need to be present. I'm not in the U.S. Open, and given my travel schedule and what I have behind that and in front of that, there's no reason for me to go out there and spectate when I can watch television.\"\n\nOn Tuesday, at Bradley's press conference, one LIV player was specifically brought up.\n\nPhil Mickelson.\n\nIn the two Ryder Cups Bradley qualified for, he paired with Mickelson to go 4-1, including a 3-0 record at Medinah in 2012. Would the embattled 54-year-old then be a consideration for a vice-captain pick?\n\nNo, Bradley said.\n\n\"I still have a great relationship with Phil. I don't think he's interested in being a vice-captain,\" Bradley said. \"And to be honest with you, he's a captain some day, I think.

He's expressed his love for the Cup and being a patriot himself and just a really passionate individual, so I think he's going to do a great job.\n\nTiger Woods was believed to have been in talks for the role.\n\n\"Tiger's been handling a lot of stuff at the Tour level. He was the captain at the Presidents Cup and I'm sure he knows the Ryder Cup's even more responsibilities,\" Schauffele reflected.\n\n\"There's too many things on his plate so I think that's why he passed on that one this time around. Keegan, his passion for it and his love of the game is going to shine through.\"\n\nSpeaking at a press conference ahead of the Genesis Scottish Open, live on Sky Sports Golf from Thursday, Schauffele acknowledged Bradley's appointment was unexpected.\n\n\"It's surprising,\" he said. \"I think a lot of people were banking on Tiger to do it. He obviously has a lot on his plate.\n\n\"Knowing Keegan and how good of a job he's going to want to do, he's going to love doing the press and talking about the tournament and the cup and proud to be an American, all those things. It's going to be really interesting and fun to see.\n\n\"He's very passionate individual. On the course, he's intense. That's just how he competes and how he is. I'm sure as a captain he's going to have sort of a mixed bag. He won't be afraid and will get everyone going.\n\n\"When someone is really passionate about something, they usually do really well.\"\n\nPainful memories of last year's Ryder Cup remain with Schauffele, who was part of the team beaten in Rome last September.\n\n\"I remember getting throttled, that's about it. The atmosphere - if I try and think of the positives from the week - the atmosphere, our team locker room, those are the things that were really fun,\" he said.\n\n\"Just being sort of arm-in-arm with my team-mates was awesome all week. Then the fans were awesome with their chants as always. So from a golf standpoint, getting throttled is never fun, but it is what it is and wore it on the chin there.\n\n\"Us players didn't play well. I haven't watched a lot of cups overseas where both teams played well and it was super competitive and teams got beat. Myself, I felt like I played awful. I felt like I didn't show up until the final round and it was already way too late to play good golf at that point,\" he added.\n\n\"When you lose that many cups overseas, you definitely start to get in your own head.

But he said he always enjoys going back to Europe, where more fans are students of the game.\n\n\"Not that all fans don't appreciate golf but there's a deeper appreciation here,\" Schauffele said. \"They know what a good shot looks like.\"\n\nHe didn't have that much fun in Europe last fall, when the U.S. Ryder Cup lost to the Europeans outside of Rome. But he had lots of thoughts about the selection of Keegan Bradley to captain the U.S. team in 2025, when competition returns stateside to Bethpage Black in New York.\n\nBradley, 38, was named the Ryder Cup captain on Monday after Tiger Woods declined.\n\n\"Yeah, it's surprising. You typically expect someone that's a little bit older to get selected as a captain,\" Schauffele said. \"I think a lot of people were banking on Tiger to do it. He obviously has a lot on his plate.\n\n\"So Keegan expressed his love for the Ryder Cup publicly, which we all saw, and I'm sure -- I haven't talked to him or seen him yet, but I'm sure he's over the moon and is going to do a great job.\"\n\nSchauffele said Bradley, by being younger, can help prepare his contemporaries for the Ryder Cup.\n\n\"I think having someone that's a little bit younger, I'm going to look at it, I'm a glass-half-full guy,\" Schauffele said. \"And I think him playing and knowing sort of the trends on tour, you start to see a lot more recovery centers here. You start to see a lot of things of that nature of how we practice and stuff.\n\n\"I feel like Keegan would understand sort of when we need to get up, when we need to practice, and when you need to do this and hopefully dodge anything you don't have to do and maybe that will help us.\"\n\nBefore Schauffele can start thinking about next year's Ryder Cup or even the Paris Olympics later this month, he must get through the Scottish Open and The Open next week. What's his focus?\n\n\"Overall acclimation,\" the defending Olympic champ said. \"Hitting the putts a little bit harder. When you're playing chips, trying to position yourself on holes, even though you're short-sided, as long as you're into the wind, you have to start thinking that way again.\n\n\"And then the lag putting is really hard. You'll be on the front of the pin and the pin will be on the front, and you have 50 feet, you pace it off, and you're, like, dang. Whereas back home, pin to front of the green you have 15 feet or 18 feet. Getting used to those small things.\"", "source": {"uri": "northernirelandnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Northern Ireland News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xander_Schauffele", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Xander Schauffele"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keegan_Bradley", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Keegan Bradley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captain_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Captain (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryder_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Ryder Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Europe"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tournament_of_Champions_(golf)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tournament of Champions (golf)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottish_Open_(golf)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Scottish Open (golf)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PGA_Tour", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "PGA Tour"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiger_Woods", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tiger Woods"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Orleans", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New Orleans"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New Orleans"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Berwick", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "North Berwick"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "North Berwick"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scotland", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Scotland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Scotland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valhalla_Golf_Club", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Valhalla Golf Club"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bethpage_Black_Course", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bethpage Black Course"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "New York (state)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PGA_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "PGA Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Golf"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rome", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rome"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Rome"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Romance", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Romance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://cdn.bignewsnetwork.com/flm1720544701.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9718810", "eventUri": "eng-9718810", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3725490196078431, "wgt": 125, "relevance": 1}

Just being sort of arm in arm with my team-mates was awesome all week.\n\n\"Then the fans were awesome with their chants as always.

I think there's two or three dinners that we have to go to that are kind of mandatory-ish, and I think if we cut it down to one or two versus three that would be a really big deal.\n\n\"I play 24 events [a season] and I don't think I dress up and go to one dinner in all those 24 events.\"", "source": {"uri": "heraldscotland.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Herald"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiger_Woods", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tiger Woods"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xander_Schauffele", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Xander Schauffele"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marco_Simone_Golf_and_Country_Club", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Marco Simone Golf and Country Club"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bethpage_Black_Course", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bethpage Black Course"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottish_Open_(golf)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Scottish Open (golf)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zach_Johnson", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Zach Johnson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wild_card_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wild card (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryder_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ryder Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PGA_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "PGA Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Golf"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rome", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rome"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Rome"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valhalla_Golf_Club", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Valhalla Golf Club"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PGA_Tour", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "PGA Tour"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bethpage,_New_York", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bethpage, New York"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Bethpage, New York"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Romance", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Romance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 95}], "image": "https://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/18289926/", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9718810", "eventUri": "eng-9718810", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.192156862745098, "wgt": 124, "relevance": 1}

It, of course, is a heavily updated version of the M2 Bradley and it will be even more resistant to hits than its predecessors. Lessons learned in Ukraine are said to have been incorporated into the design of the M2A4E1.\n\nThe defenders of Ukraine use many different infantry fighting vehicles from different countries, but the M2 Bradley is one of their favourites. Maxim Zhorin, deputy commander of the 3rd Assault Brigade of Ukraine, believes that these infantry fighting vehicles are one of the most valuable machines at the frontlines. According to him, the Bradley has proven time and time again that good equipment can save lives and protecting the lives of the soldiers is very important for the Armed Forces of Ukraine. Even after accurate Russian strikes that disabled the machine the tough armour of the Bradley allowed the defenders of Ukraine to retreat safely and live to fight another day.\n\nRussian drones are constantly hunting Bradleys in Ukraine. After one well-aimed drone strike Ukrainian soldiers found that the machine was only slightly damaged and the crew was entirely unharmed. On a different occasion, Bradley ran over a landmine and was still able to continue its combat duties. That, of course, doesn't mean that the M2 Bradley is invincible. Russians destroyed several dozen of these infantry fighting vehicles. Like all weapons always, the Bradley is a permanent work in progress.\n\nThe US has now introduced the M2A4E1 Bradley - an improved infantry fighting vehicle with the Iron Fist active protection system. In addition, the new version of the Bradley has improved sights and an air conditioning system. And many other upgrades.\n\nThe Iron Fist is an active protection system against various threats. The system has several sensors - radars and infrared cameras. When a missile or some other projectile is detected on its approach to the Bradley, the system fires a small charge towards it. It explodes in the air, creating a cloud of shrapnel that destroys the threat. In other words, enemy missiles don't even reach the armour of the Bradley. Therefore, the M2A4E1 Bradley is said to be the best version of this machine in terms of crew protection.\n\nThe Iron Fist system was developed by Israel's Elbit Systems. It can be installed on existing vehicles, but, of course, it can be integrated into production processes as well.\n\nThe M2A4E1 Bradley has many other improvements as well.

Mandatory Credit: Vasha Hunt-USA TODAY Sports / Vasha Hunt-USA TODAY Sports\n\nThe biggest storyline in the Las Vegas Raiders' training camp this summer will be the highly-anticipated quarterback battle between Aidan O'Connell and Gardner Minshew II.\n\nWith all the talk surrounding the quarterback competition, the Raiders other notable quarterbacks have been somewhat overlooked.\n\nOne of those quarterbacks is undrafted free agent Carter Bradley, whom the Raiders acquired after the 2024 NFL Draft.\n\nBradley was one of the best quarterbacks to go undrafted this offseason. The South Alabama native comes off a 2023 campaign in which he was named an All-Sun Belt Honorable Mention. He threw for 2,660 yards and 19 touchdowns on 221 completions in 11 games (13 starts).\n\nThe season prior, his first with the program, Bradley set school records with 3,326 passing yards, 28 passing touchdowns, and 276 completions.\n\nBradley transferred to South Alabama after playing four seasons at Toledo. In his final season with the Rockets, Bradley threw for 972 yards and four touchdowns on 77 completions in eight games.\n\nIn 22 games with Toledo, Bradley posted 2,377 yards and 14 touchdowns on 182 completions.\n\nBradley already has a special tie to the Silver and Black, as he is the son of former Raiders defensive coordinator Gus Bradley. Gus Bradley served as the Raiders' defensive coordinator during the 2021 season, the last time Las Vegas made the playoffs.\n\nRaiders general manager Tom Telesco is quite familiar with Gus Bradley, as he served as the Los Angeles Chargers for four seasons during Telesco's reign. That run preceded Gus Bradley's one-year stint in Las Vegas and succeeded his four seasons as the Jacksonville Jaguars' head coach.\n\nCarter Bradley has the potential to be a solid backup at the NFL level, but he's going to have a tough quarterback room to compete with in training camp. As is the case for any undrafted free agent, training camp is going to be crucial for the young Carter Bradley, as he will be looking to translate his skills from South Alabama to professional competition.\n\nEven if he doesn't make the Raiders' roster, there's a good chance Carter Bradley is picked up elsewhere. With his father's connection, though, the undrafted quarterback already has an edge heading into camp.\n\nEnsure you follow on X (Twitter) @HondoCarpenter and IG @HondoSr and never miss another breaking news story again.\n\nPlease let us know your thoughts when you like our Facebook page WHEN YOU CLICK RIGHT HERE.", "source": {"uri": "si.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sports Illustrated"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gus_Bradley", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gus Bradley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Alabama_Jaguars_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "South Alabama Jaguars football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Quarterback"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Touchdown", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Touchdown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_agent", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Free agent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hancock_Whitney_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hancock Whitney Stadium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Las_Vegas_Raiders", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Las Vegas Raiders"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gardner_Minshew", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gardner Minshew"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Training_camp", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Training camp"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toledo,_Ohio", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Toledo, Ohio"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Toledo, Ohio"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile,_Alabama", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mobile, Alabama"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Mobile, Alabama"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defensive_coordinator", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Defensive coordinator"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Las_Vegas", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Las Vegas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Las Vegas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Chargers", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Chargers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NFL_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NFL playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Telesco", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tom Telesco"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_manager", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "General manager"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacksonville_Jaguars", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jacksonville Jaguars"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_coach", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Head coach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Facebook"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Ten-Pin", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Ten-Pin", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Candlepin", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Candlepin", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_crop,w_2738,h_1540,x_0,y_0/c_fill,w_1440,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/images/ImagnImages/mmsport/raiders_today/01j25825s0fe57xphw10.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9718810", "eventUri": "eng-9718810", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2, "wgt": 96, "relevance": 1}

family.\n\nGrace Bradley has been a paraplegic since the age of 13, but has become more independent over the past few years, her grandfather told WYFF.\n\nShe saved up enough money from her job as a cashier at the local supermarket to travel to Italy in June.\n\nIt was her first opportunity to travel in her entire life.\n\nBut while overseas, Bradley suffered a stroke - and is still stuck in a Venice hospital as her family struggles to raise enough money to transport her back to the United States.\n\nGrace Bradley is stuck in a Venice hospital after suffering a stroke while on her dream Italy vacation\n\nBradley was born with Vodder syndrome - a condition in which there is impairment to normal lymphatic flow\n\n'We need her home,' her grandfather, Tony Bradley, said.\n\n'She's not doing well, and she's not going to get better until she comes home.'\n\nBradley was born with Vodder syndrome - a condition in which there is impairment to normal lymphatic flow.\n\nShe became a paraplegic at the age of 13, and has been in a wheelchair ever since, 'battling numerous illnesses, countless surgeries and the loss of her most valuable asset to her own advocation: her voice,' according to an online fundraiser.\n\nShe was ultimately able to get a job as a cashier at the local Publix and has become more independent, her grandfather, Tony Bradley said.\n\n'The only thing that we really have to help with her sometimes is a little transportation here and there, but she doesn't mind calling an Uber,' he said.\n\nStill, the family was worried about her planned trip.\n\nHer grandfather said the family tried to talk Grace out of going on the trip, but wanted her to be independent\n\n'We tried our hardest to talk her out of going, but at the same time, we don't want to hold her back either because that wouldn't be healthy,' the grandfather said, between tears.\n\n'She wanted to be independent, like anybody else.'\n\nBut on June 26, the family got news that she had a stroke and her grandmother, Juli Bradley, took the first flight she could find to Italy to be by her side.\n\nMore than one week later, Bradley remained in the hospital.\n\nShe cannot fly commercial in her current condition, as doctors say she is stable but can no longer use the left side of her upper body or sit up on her own.\n\n'When she goes home, it has to be medivac must be accompanied by a doctor,' Bradley said.\n\n'So my wife has been in contact with the State Department and the embassy in Italy directly.'\n\nDoctors say she stable but can no longer use the left side of her upper body or sit up on her own\n\nIf her condition does not improve, the International SOS out of Philadelphia has estimated a medivac home could cost up to $195,000.\n\nAnd because the medical emergency happened in a foreign country, her Medicaid will not cover any of the expenses.\n\nHer family has since created an online fundraiser to help with the medical expenses and the costs of getting her back to the United States.\n\nAs of Tuesday morning, it had raised over $48,000.", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Mail Online"}, "authors": [], "concepts":

And I must say - ask me if I've got an MBE. Nah, ain't got one. Ask me if I've got an OBE - nah, ain't got one of them. Ask me if I've got a CBE - no! No. Not a sausage. Not even a member of the RAC any more.\"\n\nBradley ended the bit by dropping to his knees in a humorous \"beg\" as he ran through his career accomplishments.\n\nHis quip was met with laughter from the Prince and Princess of Wales. However, the reaction among television viewers was decidedly mixed, with some finding the moment awkward rather than amusing.\n\nFans swiftly took to social media to share their differing opinions. One viewer tweeted: \"I love Bradley Walsh but he's dying on his arse here.\"\n\nAnother criticised the opener as \"not funny at all\".\n\n\"I do hope @BradleyWalsh whole act isn't going to be about asking for a knighthood, yes I know he's partially joking but still I wish we could go back to the no talking to the royals in your act,\" a third fan complained.\n\nA fourth viewer did not hold back, commenting: \"Could Bradley Walsh be any more embarrassing, begging like that #Cringe.\"\n\nA fifth fan called the segment \"cringe-worthy\" and blasted Bradley for being \"not funny\".\n\nDespite the backlash, Bradley continued with his comic set, including a riff on the royal titles.\n\n\"It doesn't sound right, your royal highnessesses? There's too many 'ssessess', init? Your royal highness... your royal highnessesses? It should be like cactus, cactussess, cacti. Your royal highness, highnessess and highni. That's it. I've got it. Your royal highni,\" he teased.\n\nIn a past interview, the beloved host of The Chase opened up about the impact his father's death had on his life.\n\nBradley's father passed away at 59 from heart disease.

You can check out at any time. More info\n\nDaniel Bradley went out to the New Brogden pub in Porthcawl on the evening of September 8 last year for a carefree night of seeing friends and dancing. He was in full health and appeared to be in good spirits.\n\nUnfortunately he had the misfortune to cross the path of Steven Chappell, a violent and aggressive man who took an unexplainable dislike to him. Both men were seen to leave the pub later that night and once they reached the isolation of a nearby path Chappell unleashed a horrendous attack using fists and feet to leave Mr Bradley crumpled on the floor.\n\nThe victim managed to get up and walk away with the aid of his ex-partner but he would later succumb to an untimely death after weeks of unimaginable pain caused by his injuries. This is the story of the killing of Daniel Bradley at the hands of Steven Chappell.\n\nREAD MORE: Son found out mum had been killed by dangerous driver during cycling event they were both competing in\n\nREAD MORE: Young boy sexually assaulted on double decker bus sees justice 30 years later\n\nThe lead-up to the attack\n\nMr Bradley, who was 32, was a regular at the New Brogden pub and a number of other establishments in Porthcawl. He was known as a chatty person, speaking to people in the pub and helping the barmaid when needed to carry a crate of Budweiser from the local shop.\n\nOn September 8 Mr Bradley was seen in the Picton pub was described as his usual self \"joking around and dancing\". He didn't appear to be in any physical discomfort. He later attended the New Brogden with his ex-partner Cherelle McKay and spent time with her on the dancefloor as karaoke was being sung by regulars.\n\nAt some point during the evening Mr Bradley was stood outside the pub when Chappell, 29, arrived with Carly Chappell. He was wearing a medical boot, holding crutches, and greeted Mr Bradley. There had been a previous incident between the pair on September 2 when Chappell \"snarled\" at Mr Bradley for speaking to his girlfriend.\n\nCCTV later showed Mr Bradley showing an ID card to Chappell after the later accused Mr Bradley of owing him money. Chappell took his top off and later in the evening Mr Bradley, Ms McKay, Ms Chappell, and Chappell himself walked into a lane next to the pub.\n\nThe assault\n\nBetween 12.38am and 12.40am on September 9 Chappell brutally beat Mr Bradley for the first time, knocking him to the ground before punching and kicking him repeatedly. Witnesses who lived nearby heard the defendant to say: \"I gave you f****** money. I gave you \u00a350.\"\n\nChappell lunged across towards Mr Bradley and punched him with a closed fist to the chin causing him to fall backwards and and onto the floor. The defendant then pushed Ms McKay to the floor as she tried to protect Mr Bradley who was then punched to the ground three times. The third time he didn't get back up and sat on the floor with his head in his hands. Chappell was heard to say: \"You're lucky I am on f****** crutches because I'd f****** kill you.\" Witness Jonathan Cosson told Chappell's trial: \"It was very forceful. [Mr Bradley] was on his hands and knees in a vulnerable position... He was defenceless.\"\n\nThe defendant left the scene with Carly Chappell and walked down Nicholls Avenue while shouting back towards Mr Bradley and Ms McKay. But unsatisfied with the damage he had already inflicted upon the victim he returned shouting: \"If I come back down there you're f****** having it\". He walked up to Mr Bradley and kicked him while he was on the floor, his foot connecting with his head or the top of his body. Nearby residents heard blows landing and Mr Bradley crying out in pain with Chappell heard shouting: \"I am going to rip your eye out.\"\n\nMr Bradley remained on the floor curled up in a ball with his hands around his head. Chappell continued to grapple with him on the floor before delivering another kick to his head and walking off, pointing at Mr Bradley and Ms McKay as he did so.\n\nThe defendant walked down the lane and along Nicholls Avenue. He was heard shouting on CCTV footage as Carly Chappell walked on the other side of the road carrying his crutches. Mr Bradley and Ms McKay remained on the floor spending 13 minutes on the grassy area before getting up and walking to Ms McKay's house nearby, both stumbling as they did so.\n\nChappell was later heard to brag about the vicious beating he had inflicted upon Daniel Bradley, saying: \"I filled in Dan last night.\"\n\nThe aftermath\n\nAt around 8.12am on September 9 Mr Bradley was picked up from Ms McKay's home and driven to his home in Willow Close, North Cornelly, by taxi driver Dennis Dladla. He told the driver he was unwell having been beaten up the night before. There was a swelling around the right side of his face and Mr Dladla could see that it was causing him pain to breathe and cough. He said it was obvious his passenger was in pain because he was holding his chest, crouching, and struggling to breathe.\n\nMr Bradley said he had been approached by two people and he was punched to his face. He said he fell to the floor and was hit, kicked, and stamped upon to his body and his head. Mr Dladla asked him if he had called the police or sought medical detention but Mr Bradley had not. Mr Dladla said: \"He complained about pain while breathing. [It] was a concern to me being human. If the pain is in that area it sounds serious. I said: 'What if you go to hospital just to be checked?'. He said: 'I think I'll be okay. I'll promise I'll go tomorrow morning.'\"\n\nOn September 11, 2023, Mr Bradley's mother Sheila Rees went to his home between 9am and 9.30am and found her son lying in bed but awake. Describing the scene Ms Rees said: \"She said: \"I thought Dan would be in bed as usual. I walked up the stairs and his bedroom door was open which was unusual. I walked him and saw him lying in bed... He was awake. I saw his left eye was black and yellow and there were bruises around his right eye. His eyes were bloodshot. He was lying on his back with blood coming down his face from his cheek. I could see blood on his pillow.\n\n\"I noticed ice packs over the bed. I asked him what had happened and Dan said: 'I got beaten up'. I asked him who'd done it and he said: 'I don't know. I don't know who it was.' I told him he needed to get it checked out and at first he refused. He said: 'He hit me from the side. I just went down and he started kicking me in the head and stamping on my chest.'\"\n\nJodie Rees, Mr Bradley's sister, attended the house and along with his mother insisted he go to hospital. They helped him out of bed and into his clothes but he was holding his right arm across his body and it was obvious that he was finding it painful to breathe and talk.\n\nMr Bradley's sister called 111 and he spoke with the call handler. Mr Bradley wasn't having severe breathing difficulties but he was \"pacing\" his breath to stop the pain. He told the call handler he had been hurting since Friday when he was assaulted.\n\nHe was taken to the Princess of Wales Hospital and his injuries were found to include tenderness on the right side of his chest wall and in his axilla (arm pit). There was bruising around the left eye and bleeding to the white of the eye. A chest X-ray was performed which showed a displaced fracture of the fifth rib on the right side of his chest. The decision as made for Mr Bradley to be treated with painkillers to help manage the pain and discomfort from the rib fracture and he was discharged.\n\nOn September 14 Ms Rees returned to see her son. She said Mr Bradley was still upstairs in bed and was too unwell to go downstairs. The next day Ms Rees attended the house again and her son was still in bed and \"couldn't physically get up\".\n\nOn September 15 Ms Rees received a text from Mr Bradley saying he'd had a \"nightmare night\". He asked her to lock the door when she came in, which Ms Rees thought was strange, and he later text her to ask her to come over \"ASAP\" as it was \"all going off again with the kids and I can't physically get up\".\n\nWhen she arrived at his home he shouted down for her to \"lock it now\". She said: \"It seemed as if there was something wrong and he was frightened. I went straight upstairs. He was lying in bed and I could see a hammer next to him on his right-hand side. He said there were people outside his bedroom who were talking about him and they had a machete. He was frantic and believed what he was saying. I calmed him down and said there was nobody outside in the street.\"\n\nHis legs were mottled and his lips were going blue, she said. She called NHS Direct and was put straight through to the ambulance service. At one point in the call Mr Bradley spoke to the call handler directly. He said that he was feeling confused and tired. His breathing was hard.\n\nParamedics attended his address. Mr Bradley was extremely pale, his heart rate was very fast, and he had a very high temperature. One of the paramedics described his appearance as \"looking almost deceased\". Paramedic Jessica Torkington said: \"We came in and the patient was sat on the sofa. His mother guided me into the property. He was sat in the sofa and just from looking at him I knew he was critically unwell because of his colour and how fast his breathing was. I knew he was very high priority... He was a very, very horrible colour is what I can say really.\"\n\nMr Bradley was breathing very rapidly and his oxygen and blood pressure levels were low. On listening to his lungs they found a decreased breath sound on the right side of his chest and dullness on percussion over the same side.\n\nCritical care practitioner Steffan Simpson of EMRTS (Emergency Medical Retrieval and Transfer Service) assessed that Mr Bradley was suffering with \"severe sepsis (systemic infection)\" relating to the right side of his lungs while still at Willow Close. He was taken to A&E and placed into a bed in the hospital's resuscitation area.\n\nMr Bradley went into cardiac arrest. He was given CPR both manually and using a mechanical device and he was resuscitated. A chest X-ray showed a \"complete white-out\" on the right side of the chest, which required a chest tube to be inserted to drain his chest of fluid. The chest drain drained approximately two to three litres of pus.\n\nCT scans were undertaken of Mr Bradley's head, neck, and chest. The clinical impression was recorded as \"sepsis with right emphysema secondary to potential haemothorax post alleged assault one week ago with superimposed infection with multi-organ failure with cardiac arrest secondary to sepsis and multiorgan failure\".\n\nThe clinical impression was \"of pus within the right lung due to a collection of blood within the right lung from a previous injury [one week ago] causing a widespread infection of the body (sepsis) which caused multiple organ failure and the heart to stop beating (cardiac arrest)\". Medics also found fluid within the right side of Mr Bradley's chest was infected blood from the rib injury. A small amount of air (pneumothorax) in the right side of his chest was noted.\n\nOn September 17 Mr Bradley's medical records noted: \"X-ray chest rib fracture right side, punctured right lung with fluid in right side of chest cavity likely due to infected blood from rib injury.\" The following day it was recorded that a chest drain culture was positive for invasive Group A Streptococcus.\n\nBy September 23 it was clear Mr Bradley was unlikely to recover neurological function and that he had bilateral pneumonia and renal failure secondary to sepsis. It was agreed that continuation of treatment would not continue and end of life care was to be prioritised. He was pronounced dead at 5.53pm on September 23, 2023. The provisional cause of death was given as hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy caused by multiple organ dysfunction, cardiac arrest, and sepsis.\n\nThe arrest\n\nSteven Chappell was first arrested on September 16 on suspicion of assaulting Daniel Bradley on September 9 and leaving him with life-changing injuries. Chappell lied when cautioned, saying: \"He hit me first. It was self-defence.\"\n\nChappell's clothing and crutches from September 9 were seized and blood matching the DNA profile of Mr Bradley was subsequently recovered on Chappell's black medical boot and from Chappell's top. As the defendant was arriving at Bridgend police station he called over to Carly Chappell, who was also at the station, and said: \"Don't tell them anything.\" Chappell, who had a small cut to his left shin area, was interviewed twice on September 17. He showed officers a small cut on his leg and claimed Mr Bradley was grabbing and biting his leg when they were on the grass. He said that he was just trying to get Mr Bradley off his leg and that he was trying to \"shake him off\".\n\nThe defendant claimed he had given Mr Bradley money to buy drugs and Mr Bradley had \"basically pinched some money off me\". He said they were \"down the side\" when he had given Mr Bradley the money. He said he gave him \u00a350 but he never received the cocaine he claimed he was due from Mr Bradley.\n\nChristopher Rees KC, prosecuting at Chappell's Cardiff Crown Court trial, told jurors: \"He was shown the footage of his attack on Mr Bradley at the grassy area and he confirmed that he could see it. It was put to him that the footage showed Chappell throw a number of punches at Mr Bradley and Chappell simply said: 'Don't know.'\"\n\nChappell said he was looking in Mr Bradley's pockets for his money when Mr Bradley was on the ground but he didn't take anything from him. Chappell said he had nothing in his hands and the \"second kick\" on the footage was the point at which he kicked Mr Bradley to stop him grabbing and biting his leg.\n\nA police officer asked him: \"So you are saying that is done in sort of self-defence?\" Chappell replied: \"'Get off me' like. Couldn't get my money back so I thought: 'F*** it.'\"\n\nChappell was asked if he had sustained the injury to his leg while kicking Mr Bradley with his left leg. Chappell said: \"No because he bit my leg so I kicked him to get off me.\"\n\nThe accused claimed he didn't hit or kick Mr Bradley in the ribs and maintained Mr Bradley had come onto him. He said: \"I asked where my money is. He came onto me. F****** he came on to me.\" To the remainder of the questions Chappell reverted to no comment or silence.\n\nOn September 20 Chappell met with his probation officer. He told her he was very emotional and he didn't want Mr Bradley to die.\n\nOn September 23, following Daniel Bradley's death, police returned to Chappell's address to arrest him on suspicion of murder. They located the defendant hiding in the loft area. He was interviewed for a third time and gave \"no comment\" replies. The defendant was charged with murder on September 24 and was cautioned and made no reply.\n\nOn September 25 Chappell was being transported to Cardiff Magistrates' Court and was heard by another detainee in the van, Ashley Trezise, saying he was \"looking at a murder charge\". He said that even though he had a cast on his foot he had \"still done him\". Mr Trezise claimed Chappell said the person was from Porthcawl and had died later on in hospital from sepsis. Chappell said he \"might get off with manslaughter because the person had got sepsis\".\n\nThe trial\n\nFollowing a three-week trial at Cardiff Crown Court Chappell was found guilty of manslaughter but not guilty of Mr Bradley's murder. The Recorder of Cardiff, Judge Tracey Lloyd-Clarke, referred to the defendant's antecedence of violent offences. She adjourned sentencing until August 19 for assessment to be made in respect of the defendant's dangerousness.

(WCSC) - The Cross Community Center which was once an event space is now an internet resource center by the Berkeley Chamber of Commerce.\n\nThe Berkeley Chamber of Commerce is unveiling the second resource hub in the county at 1690 Old Highway 6 in Cross Tuesday. Visitors can check out the new hub at the 10 a.m. event.\n\nThe community center now offers over 15 industries to residents in one location. The chamber donates resources like laptops for wider internet access to medical care and employment help.\n\nThe chamber will have different resources each day of the week with volunteers called navigators to help people get what they need. Officials say help is as simple as getting an email address to get started with resources.\n\nOfficials say whether a resident is looking for help or looking to help, the center is open to anyone and everyone.\n\n\"We want the student at the local elementary school, middle or high school,\" Bradley says. \"We want the young man or young woman who is out of a job that needs some assistance. We're looking for those seniors who have time who want to provide resources to those that come in. So anyone, everyone, the door is open.\"\n\nTrident Medical Center, the Medical University of South Carolina and Roper St. Francis partnerships support telehealth access at the center. Google's Applied Digital Skills program gives employment resources.\n\nMember of the community center and Berkeley County School Board member Yvonne Bradley says the goal is to bring resources to rural communities that residents would otherwise not have access to. Officials say transportation, childcare, workforce help and food insecurity are some barriers rural residents face.\n\nBradley says this work pushes education forward into the community. Community members no longer have to make out-of-the-way commutes to get information that can be received through the Internet.\n\n\"We work hard, I have a committee with me so we work hard to make sure that my community does not get left out,\" Bradley says. \"Every community should have a hub. One central location that will service the purposes they need, right then and there.\"\n\nBradley says the community can access a wealth of knowledge with the hub's opening. The hub partners with state and county agencies to offer mental health services, veterans administration and vocational rehabilitation. Bradley says the massive access to information will help residents make informed choices this election year as well.\n\n\"We leave you with a wealth of knowledge that you did not have before,\" Bradley says. \"With this being a political season, you now have access to the candidates' information, their web pages, you can go and find out what they're all about so you can be an informed voter when November comes around.\"\n\nBradley says an expansion is in the works for the hub. The board member is working on grant funding to give the navigators stipends for their service as well as summer programs for hub users.

You can check out at any time. More info\n\nBob MacIntyre will go head-to-head again with Rory McIlroy for the opening two days of the Genesis Scottish Open.\n\nThe Scottish star was pipped at the post 12 months ago by his European Ryder Cup colleague in a dramatic last-day shootout at The Renaissance. MacIntyre and McIlroy are joined by another Rome hero Viktor Hovland for the opening two days going out as a threeball on day-one at 8.28am and 1.43pm on Friday.\n\nXander Schauffele, who won the title two years ago, has been paired alongside Wyndham Clark and Tommy Fleetwood. Scotland has a total of eight competitors aiming to become the first home winner since Colin Montgomerie in 1999 at Loch Lomond. David Law is the first Scot on the first tee on the opening day at 7.44am, but Connor Syme starts earlier from the 10th at 7.11am. Scott Jamieson starts on the first at 12.37pm before Ewen Ferguson and Calum Hill at 1.54pm and 2.05pm. Richie Ramsay goes from the 10th at 12.48pm and Grant Forrest at 1.43pm.\n\nMeanwhile, Xander reckons shock choice Keegan Bradley needs to ditch the dinners to stop America being choked by Europe. Schauffele is back for another crack at the Renaissance title. He's also looking to tune up for The Open with a Major already under his belt this term having won the PGA Championship. But, despite the massive fortnight ahead, American attention was centred on the Ryder Cup skipper choice for next year at Bethpage.\n\nSchauffele admitted Bradley's appointment was \"surprising\" due to age, but hopes that can bring changes which he says are needed after Rome. He said: \"I remember getting throttled, that's about it. Getting throttled is never fun. I feel like Keegan would understand sort of when we need to get up, when to practise, when you need to do this and, hopefully, dodge anything you don't have to do and maybe that will help us. There's so many things I don't want to do. Taking a bunch of photos all dressed up. I would be the first guy that I need to flee quickly. Even like team dinners or things of that nature, we can have them sort of quick and inside versus having to go out, dress up and all those things. I think there's two or three dinners that we have to go to that are kind of mandatory-ish, and I think if we cut it down to one or two versus three that would be a really big deal.\n\n\"I don't dress up and go out to dinner. I play 24 events and I don't think I dress up and go to one dinner in all those 24 events. Plus my wife, she's amazing, maybe for an anniversary or something like that. She knows when I'm here, it's to keep my head down and compete and that's what I try to do.\n\n\"Just take everything off your plate. Player pictures and certain mandatory things that you have to do. But, in terms of sort of the nicknacky stuff, just try and take away as much as possible for the player. When you get to the team things, it's the same for both teams, don't get me wrong, but a good captain will try and cut back that stuff as much as possible and make the week as easier as possible. Along with the rest of the US side, we're nitpicking. When you lose that many Cups overseas, you definitely start to get in your own head, you look in the mirror and start going, what's wrong here?\n\n\"At the end of the day us players didn't play well. I'm a glass-half-full guy. And I think him playing and knowing sort of the trends on tour, you start to see a lot more recovery centres here. You start to see a lot of things of that nature of how we practise and stuff.\n\n\"I think the most important thing to take away from what I said here is that we're going to have to prepare differently, that's maybe heading over earlier as a team together. Not three months earlier or one month earlier. Just a week early or five days earlier, whatever we can agree to.

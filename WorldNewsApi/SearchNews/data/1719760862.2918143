The musical is scheduled to hit theaters on Nov. 27. You can dive into the teaser trailer above. According to Disney, Moana 2 takes place three years after the eponymous character's first voyage. Moana receives \"an unexpected call from her wayfinding ancestors,\" according to a synopsis from the entertainment giant, and \"must journey to the far seas of Oceania and into dangerous, long-lost waters for an adventure unlike anything she's ever faced.\" Moana fans have more to look forward to, as a live-action version of the first film is also on the way.

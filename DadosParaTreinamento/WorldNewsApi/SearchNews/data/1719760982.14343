Here&#8217;s a look at the communities.", "text": "South Florida now has a larger number of \u201cmillionaire cities.\u201d There are 17 cities in South Florida where the typical home is worth at least $1 million, according to an analysis done by Zillow, in which it identified its millionaire cities across the country. That\u2019s compared with 16 last year. Newly on the list this time: Palmetto Bay, a village that\u2019s 8 square miles and has 25,000 residents. \u201cIt just confirms what the people who live in Palmetto Bay already know: It\u2019s a great place to live, work and play,\u201d said Mayor Karyn Cunningham. \u201cIt is exciting.\u201d The village isn\u2019t far from Cutler Bay and Pinecrest, just nine miles from Coral Gables. (Pinecrest and Coral Gables are both millionaire cities, too.) Of the rising values, Cunningham said: \u201cThere\u2019s not a lot of inventory (and) folks who live there stay there.\u201d The mayor, 60, is among those who\u2019ve enjoyed staying, living there for 30 years. \u201cWe have a tendency to want to age in place.\u201d Nationwide, the number of affluent towns is growing. There are currently 550 U.S. cities where the typical home value is $1 million or more, up from 491 a year ago. Here are the 17 \u201cmillionaire\u201d cities across South Florida, according to Zillow. The typical home values are Zillow estimates, as of February: Palm Beach County \u2014 Gulf Stream, where the typical home is worth more than $2.71 million. \u2014 Jupiter Inlet Colony, where the typical home is worth nearly $3.66 million. \u2014 Manalapan, where the typical home is worth about $4.08 million. \u2014 Ocean Ridge, where the typical home is worth about $1.43 million. \u2014 Palm Beach, where the typical home is worth almost $2.11 million. \u2014 Golf, where the typical home is worth about $2.82 million. Broward County \u2014 Parkland, where the typical home is worth about $1.08 million. \u2014 Sea Ranch Lakes, where the typical home is worth about $1.84 million. \u2014 Southwest Ranches, where the typical home is worth nearly $1.32 million. Miami-Dade County \u2014 Bal Harbour, where the typical home is worth about $1.85 million. \u2014 Coral Gables, where the typical home is worth about $1.41 million. \u2014 Fisher Island, where the typical home is worth about $5.91 million. \u2014 Golden Beach, where the typical home is worth about $1.02 million. \u2014 Key Biscayne, where the typical home is worth about $1.62 million. \u2014 Pinecrest, where the typical home is worth nearly $2 million. \u2014 Surfside, where the typical home is worth about $1.2 million. \u2014 Village of Palmetto Bay, where the typical home is worth about $1.02 million. Rising values Low inventory is keeping competition high and home values rising, according to Zillow. \u201cIf mortgage rates drop later this year, as many expect, we may see a surge in million-dollar cities as even more buyers jump in and drive prices higher,\u201d said Anushna Prakash, an economic research data scientist at Zillow, in a statement. Amid the changes, there were three states \u2014 Florida, as well as Texas and Delaware \u2014 that had fewer \u201cmillionaire cities\u201d in total over the past year. Florida had 34 millionaire cities last year, and it now has 32. Three cities were excluded on the Gulf Coast (Siesta Key, Santa Rosa Beach and Sanibel), but now included is the village of Palmetto Bay, according to Zillow. Lisa J.

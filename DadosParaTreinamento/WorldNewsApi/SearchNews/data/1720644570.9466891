Speaking from a concrete bunker where the US troops sought to dismantle German artillery, Biden said those men \u2013 none of whom are still alive today \u2013 would want their modern day fellow citizens to do their part to protect against autocrats. \u201cThey\u2019re not asking us to scale these cliffs,\u201d Biden said in his 15-minute speech. \u201cBut they\u2019re asking us to stay true to what America stands for. They\u2019re not asking us to give or risk our lives. But they are asking us to care for others in our country more than ourselves.\u201d \u201cThey\u2019re asking us to do our job, to protect freedom in our time, to defend democracy, to stand up to aggression abroad and at home to be part of something bigger than ourselves,\u201d he went on. The clear skies and azure Atlantic water Biden spoke in front of was a distant cry from the harrowing day he was describing in his speech. But with war once more on Western Europe\u2019s doorstep and a rival in the United States who has vowed to act as a dictator on his first day in office should he win in November, Biden sought to use D-Day as a call to modern vigilance. \u201cAs we gather here today, it\u2019s not just to honor those who showed such remarkable bravery that day, June 6, 1944. It\u2019s to listen to the echo of their voices. To hear them. Because they are summoning us,\u201d he said. In a week filled with poignant images featuring America\u2019s Greatest Generation, the speech stood out as a call to modern-day action against an isolationist streak seeping into American politics and a rise of authoritarianism around the world. Not lost on White House aides planning the speech was the one delivered on the same spot 40 years ago by Ronald Reagan, a Republican who issued warnings against isolationism in the face of tyranny. Eighty years after the allied landings, the president drew a \u201cthroughline\u201d from World War II to today. He didn\u2019t mention Trump by name, but the contrast was clear.

Evan Vucci/AP Biden has repeatedly cast Trump\u2019s embrace of authoritarian leaders \u2013 including Russian President Vladimir Putin and North Korea\u2019s Kim Jong Un \u2013 as a threat to democracy. The president, Sullivan continued, will \u201creally be drawing a throughline from World War II through the Cold War and the stand up of the greatest military alliance the world has ever known, the NATO alliance, to today, where we face once again war in Europe, where NATO has rallied to defend freedom and sovereignty in Europe.\u201d Biden, a senior administration official told CNN, will \u201cfocus on the veterans of World War II and what we owe them and how we have to live up to their example \u2013 and the power of democracy.\u201d It comes as Biden is facing duel international crises: In Ukraine, where the US is hoping to turn the tide of Russia\u2019s offensive, and in the Middle East, where the Biden administration is calling on Hamas to accept an agreement on a ceasefire and hostage proposal. A monthslong delay in providing additional American assistance to Ukraine, prompted in part by resistance from Republicans aligned with Trump, led to setbacks on the battlefield and momentum for Russia. The strain of isolationism has led to concerns in Europe and elsewhere about what a return by Trump to the White House might portend. Biden announced a new aid package for Ukraine in a bilateral meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky on Friday, touting the new funding for the war-torn region while apologizing for the delay.

Elizabeth Frantz/Reuters \u201cYou know, you haven\u2019t bowed down, you haven\u2019t yielded at all, you continue to fight in a way that is just remarkable, is just remarkable \u2013 and we\u2019re not going to walk away from you,\u201d Biden told the Ukrainian president. \u201cI apologize for the weeks of not knowing what\u2019s going to pass, in terms of funding, because we had trouble getting the bill that we had to pass that had the money from some of our very conservative members who were holding it up, but we got it done.\u201d Still, he took the opportunity to tout Friday\u2019s funding announcement, as well as the additional funding sent to Ukraine since he signed the bill in April. \u201cSince then, including today, I\u2019ve announced six packages of significant funding today Including today \u2013 today I\u2019m also signing an additional package for $225 million to reconstruct the electric grid,\u201d he said. By speaking at Pointe du Hoc, Biden is harkening back to one of the most famous presidential speeches ever delivered, the 40th anniversary D-Day address by Reagan. Reagan delivered a forceful rebuke of authoritarianism framed through the lens of the bravery of \u201cthe boys of Pointe du Hoc.\u201d The senior administration official said: \u201cThere\u2019s no way there\u2019s not going to be comparisons.\u201d That speech, like Biden\u2019s, occurred at a moment of contention with Russia. Flanked by the men who fought there, Reagan, another aging president running for reelection, made a forceful call for the power of democracy. \u201cYou all knew that some things are worth dying for. One\u2019s country is worth dying for, and democracy is worth dying for, because it\u2019s the most deeply honorable form of government ever devised by man. All of you loved liberty. All of you were willing to fight tyranny, and you knew the people of your countries were behind you,\u201d Reagan said. Like Biden, he also warned about American withdrawal from the world. \u201cWe\u2019ve learned that isolationism never was and never will be an acceptable response to tyrannical governments,\u201d Reagan said then.", "summary": "<p>Normandy, France CNN \u00a0\u2014\u00a0 President Joe Biden on Friday summoned Americans to a defense of democracy, calling on the ideals of the Army Rangers who scaled the cliffs of Pointe du Hoc 80 years ago to warn against a drift toward authoritarianism and drawing an implicit contrast with rival Donald Trump.

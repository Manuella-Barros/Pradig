Camilla famously battled the wind to keep her headpiece in place as she and Prince Charles emerged from their civil marriage ceremony at Windsor Guildhall. MailOnline can now disclose that she had frantic words with Charles on the steps of the hall, telling him of her fears that her feathers might fly away. Details of their conversation emerged after a MailOnline lipreader viewed film of the couple's wedding on April 9, 2005, and worked out what they were saying. Analysis of the footage also revealed for the first time that the late Queen waded into the discussion and told her son: 'I did warn her, wearing feathers.' Camilla who was plain Mrs Parker-Bowles before her marriage to Charles which led to her becoming the Duchess of Cornwall, fortunately kept her headpiece in place. She and Prince Charles then chatted briefly to members of the public outside the Guildhall before heading off to have their marriage blessed by the Archbishop of Canterbury at St. George's Chapel in Windsor Castle. The footage taken outside the Guildhall showed the couple smiling as they emerged happily from their civil marriage ceremony as husband and wife. But as they talked to one another and waved at the cheering crowd, they were battered by big gusts of wind. The lipreader's analysis revealed Charles told his bride: 'Hold on tight', only for a worried Camilla to reply: 'I need you/too.' Four seconds later, Charles apparently believes all will be well and exclaims: 'All well done.' Then, in a remark about the crowd, he says: 'Everyone is coming; they are very curious.' Camilla says: 'Are they?', and Charles replies reassuringly: 'You made it down/now' before sounding a note of caution due to the high wind, saying: 'I'm not sure we should've.' In a comment based on her apparent observation of the crowd, Camilla then exclaims: 'They're carrying on regardless.' Charles tries to reassure her, saying 'We can have a long chat' and Camilla replies: 'Yes.' The Queen is seen on footage joining the newlyweds and is greeted by Charles as she stands behind to Camilla's left and speaks to her. As the flustered bride tries to hold down her hairpiece, she turns to speak to The Queen, saying something like: 'Oh my hair. I think the feathers are flying!' The bemused Queen makes a quick response and then moves to stand directly behind her son and talks to him, as Charles says: 'Oops'. Camilla then says: 'I wish I hadn't had feathers', and Charles jokes: 'They look awful.' It is at this point that the Queen interjects into the conversation, saying: 'Feathers?' Charles gently ribs his mother, saying: 'Now you want to talk' and the Queen joins in the humorous exchange, telling her oldest son: 'Stop being so weak.' But Charles is still intent on ribbing Camilla about her feathers and tells her: 'You're only going to poke my eye.' Camilla replies: 'If only they'd blow away\u2026 It really wasn't a very good idea.' Charles then tries to get things moving by telling his bride: 'Let's proceed', just moments before the Queen tells him: 'I did warn her, wearing feathers.' Acting as if it was the first time he had learned that Camilla had ignored the Queen's advice about headwear, Charles replies: 'You did?' Camilla was still clutching her feathered headpiece in the blowy weather as Charles said: 'Let's walk down' and they made their way towards the crowd. The lipreader analysis shows that the Queen turned to talk to Prince Philip, who was now standing beside her, saying: 'We're leaving immediately, it's so windy.' Meanwhile a beaming Camilla, wearing a pale blue chiffon gown with a golden embroidered long-sleeved coat over the top, chatted to well-wishers and shook some of their hands. She and Charles continued happily talking to fans as The Queen and Prince Philip departed in their official car. Camilla told one well-wisher: 'Thank you very much' and was told by a woman: 'Oh, congratulations, Camilla, oh wonderful.' But Camilla may still have been concentrating on the risk posed by the wind as she remarked: 'Hold on.' More lipreader analysis showed both Charles and Camilla repeatedly saying: 'Thank you very much' as they greeted more spectators with conversation and laughter. Camilla asks one fan: 'Hello, how far did you come?', while Charles inquires: 'How are you?' A few moments later, Charles reveals he is need of a post-wedding tipple, saying 'More' and tilting his hand as if to drink. He adds: 'I could do with a drink, aww bless you.' The couple continue to chat to one another, and the crowd as Prince Harry and Princess Anne start boarding a fleet of 'Windsorian' coaches. Charles and Camilla look animated as they greeted an elderly silver-haired male well-wisher. Camilla says: 'Ah lovely, afternoon', and Charles replies: 'It was wonderful, very fitting, I must say it was something special.' Charles adds: 'Tell me something about yourself? Well\u2026 hope you rest after your operation; all the best.' Camilla then wishes the man: 'Goodbye'. Camilla who is now Queen Camilla has suffered a string of problems with high winds interfering with her headgear during public appearances. Last September she had to hold on to her beret-shaped Philip Treacy hat when it almost blew off on her arrival at Orly airport in Paris at the start of her and Charles' official visit to France. There were more problems when she braved blustery conditions outside Westminster Abbey for the Commonwealth Day Service in March last year. Two hands were also needed to protect her headgear on a visit to the East Midlands in 2020. Camilla was wearing another Philip Treacy hat matching her white outfit when she had to stop it flying off her head while welcoming President Donald Trump to Buckingham Palace in June 2019. She had to hold on to her hat again at the Trooping the Colour ceremony in the same year. Camilla also had to battle the wind and hold on to her hat twice in 2015, once at Royal Ascot and again at Princess Charlotte's christening at St Mary Magdalene church, Sandringham. She had similar problems at the Royal Hospital, Chelsea, in 2013, and while marking Armistice Day in Auckland, New Zealand, in 2012, as well as during President Obama's Visit to the UK in 2011, and at Portsmouth in 2009. Camilla even had to hold on to her feathered beret on her first ever public engagement at Crathie Kirk, Balmoral, after marrying Prince Charles.", "summary": "Camilla famously battled the wind to keep her headpiece in place as she and Prince Charles emerged from their civil marriage ceremony at Windsor Guildhall.", "url": "https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/royals/article-13508289/Lip-reader-warning-Queen-Camilla-wedding-Charles.html?ns_mchannel=rss&ns_campaign=1490&ito=1490", "image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2024/06/08/10/85869955-0-image-m-37_1717837705829.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-08 13:14:20", "author": "Andy Young,Editor", "authors": ["Andy Young", "Editor"], "language": "en", "source_country": "gb", "sentiment": -0.021}

Reuters\n\nChelsea's Belgian winger Eden Hazard wants to leave the club and join Real Madrid. Reportedly, he has told Real Madrid boss Zinedine Zidane that he wants to play for the European champions.\n\nThe Belgium international, a key member of Chelsea's Premier League winning side last season, has been a priority this summer for a lot of top clubs across Europe, including Real's rivals Barcelona being frontrunners to land him.\n\nIn the wake of Neymar's \u00a3200m move to Paris Saint-Germain, Barcelona had been backed to use the funds on the Blues' winger.\n\nHowever, Real Madrid are also in the market for a marquee name despite having Cristiano Ronaldo and Gareth Bale at their disposal.\n\nHazard has won the Premier League twice with the Blues but has long harboured hopes of plying his trade at La Liga's biggest club.\n\nThe 2015/16 PFA Player of the Year was seen as the best player at Chelsea and had been tagged untouchable at Stamford Bridge.\n\nBut despite starring for the Blues under Conte last season, Hazard is facing an uncertain future at Stamford Bridge, as reported by The Express.\n\nChelsea have themselves been looking to add more new players to their squad, including a possible transfer for Wales international Gareth Bale from Real. Which could be another reason why Hazard feels that a move would be ideal for him at this stage.\n\nAnd according to recent developments, he is willing to do everything to ensure he moves to Real.\n\nThe former Lille winger also feels that his determination to move could force Real to abandon their pursuit of Mbappe.\n\nMonaco youngster Kylian Mbappe had earlier been tipped to move to the Bernabeu - but PSG's sudden interest has reportedly turned his head.\n\nThe Monaco striker has so far proved unattainable and, knowing Hazard is willing to do whatever it takes to get a transfer, Madrid might take the plunge and opt for the 26-year-old.\n\nThe Daily Star reports that Hazard has now supposedly told Real that, if they focused on signing him instead, he would force a move away from Stamford Bridge. The player has supposedly even told Zinedine Zidane he wants to swap Chelsea for Real Madrid.\n\nHe supposedly communicated this message in his last talk with Real boss Zidane, who is known to be an admirer. Zidane himself having earmarked him as a good addition to the club.", "time": "17:50:00"}

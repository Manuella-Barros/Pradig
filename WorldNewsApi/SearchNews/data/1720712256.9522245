Last week, Pyongyang released more than 1,000 balloons carrying garbage and manure over the DMZ in retaliation after balloons launched by anti-regime activists in the South. Balloon flights from the South are a rare example of information warfare \u2014 waged by private groups, not the government in Seoul \u2014 aimed at Mr. Kim and his elites. Pyongyang has maintained a near-total control over information domestically via a triple-tier system of human surveillance. But now it appears Mr. Kim\u2019s regime is trying to buttress this with a high-tech, Chinese-style spyware system to keep unwanted messages out. North Korea operates a localized intranet unconnected to the global internet. It has run its own cellular services since 2002, installed by the Egyptian telecommunications firm Orascom, which has reportedly been unable to collect on its contract due to foreign exchange controls. But the North\u2019s attempts to install digital surveillance networks so far have been hobbled by an inconsistent power supply, limited network capacities and lack of hardware, experts say. Digital networks and networked devices offer authoritarian states not restrained by privacy laws a wide range of methods to keep tabs on their own citizens. \u201cOne of the things that is impossible to ignore in the last few years is how China has developed into a society that has used digital surveillance to monitor and control its citizens,\u201d Martyn Williams, a senior fellow with the Stimson Center\u2019s North Korea-focused media 38 North, told Seoul-based reporters. \u201cSo, it is natural to assume that North Korea would adopt the digital technologies that China is using.\u201d Mr. Williams\u2019 team uses open-source intelligence, state media, trade show products, North Korean academic research, defector interviews and even Chinese social media to gauge the state of Pyongyang\u2019s digital repression. The North\u2019s cellular network boasts a new 4G service \u2014 detectable even in parts of northern South Korea. All indications are that cellular service is widely used. \u201cThere is no reason to think they have a low cell phone penetration rate,\u201d Mr. Williams said. \u201cWe have identified over 100 base stations \u2014 just the ones we have found via satellite imagery \u2014 and assumed [three-mile] coverage,\u201d though mountainous areas of the country remain without service. Despite its isolation and poverty, \u201cNorth Korea has a really high level of aptitude when it comes to software engineering, but it does not have a large hardware industry,\u201d Mr. Williams said. \u201cAll its smartphones come from Chinese companies, but the security software on them is all developed domestically.\u201d Devices exported to North Korea are manufactured by non-branded Chinese companies, rather than by major exporters who could face global sanctions. Ten separate North Korean companies sell imported phones to the public. Expanding opportunities There are expanding opportunities for the regime to monitor the population for suspect activities or opinions. Pyongyang has introduced digital ID card, while QR payment codes have been synced with digital markets. Smartphones contain in-built screen-capture software, allowing authorities to scrutinize users\u2019 viewing habits. Phones are locked for non-North Korean users: Engineers have failed to hack phones taken outside the country with USB sticks, Mr. Williams said. Biometric techniques \u2014 fingerprint and facial recognition \u2014 date back to the 1990s. And a network of Chinese-made closed-circuit TV cameras, backed by local algorithms, is being rolled out nationwide, from farms to factories. \u201cNorth Korea has been devoting a lot of resources to facial recognition technology,\u201d Mr. Williams said. \u201cIt can tell the state who is in a particular place at a particular time.\u201d On streets and highways, cameras monitor traffic. On the frontier with China, border guards can be watched by closed-circuit TV. \u201cThis might go some way to explain why the northern border is so tightly closed,\u201d Mr. Williams said. \u201cIt is not just additional security; security services themselves are being monitored \u2026 and have to watch what they are doing.\u201d Similarly, cameras positioned in classrooms over the last four years monitor teachers as well as students, he noted. Six cameras on one state farm scrutinize not only work areas, but monuments celebrating the achievements of the regime. \u201cIt\u2019s interesting that they seem to keep those under surveillance,\u201d Mr. Williams said. \u201cIncreased surveillance in North Korea is not necessarily against individual citizens but against all levels of society, to make sure they are doing the jobs they are meant to be doing,\u201d he said. Television is delivered to the home over internet protocol networks, offering new snooping opportunities. The state IPTV system carries Pyongyang\u2019s four TV channels to rural areas that only have one. \u201cNetflix tracks what you watch, but in the North Korean context, you can find out what people do not watch,\u201d Mr. Williams said. \u201cThat starts to become scary \u2014 if you decided to change channels when Kim\u2019s speech came on.\u201d Still, North Korea\u2019s digital surveillance systems are \u201cnowhere near\u201d China\u2019s capabilities, Mr. Williams said, hampered by a lack of funds to upgrade its systems. North Korea, \u201cwants to emulate the Chinese police state, but will have trouble doing it because it lacks the foreign currency needed to purchase advanced systems,\u201d said Geoffrey Cain, who heads NGO The Tech Integrity Project. \u201cMost of the [state\u2019s] technological capabilities rest with its skilled hackers, and that\u2019s it.\u201d Another issue is power supply: \u201cNorth Korea does not consistently have 24-hour electricity all over the country,\u201d Mr. Williams said. \u201cDigital surveillance and QR codes are useless if you don\u2019t have electricity.\u201d Puny computing power is yet another limiting factor. Pyongyang currently lacks \u201ca sophisticated data center and good networking back to the data center,\u201d Mr. Williams said. Most of North Korea runs technically limited 3G services which are \u201creally slow, these days,\u201d he said. Still, upgrades are underway. Surveillance cameras may be able to run off solar panels, and the new 4G service enables nationwide networking of television footage to a national data center. A three-tiered surveillance state Even without the upgrades, the three-tiered surveillance system now in place is formidable, said Kim Kwan-jin, a North Korean defector and senior analyst at Seoul\u2019s Institute for National Security Strategy. Two key tiers are the State Security Bureau, a domestic spy agency, and the National Police. Both operate with little oversight or restraint from courts, media or human rights groups. Security professionals are expected \u201cto hear a pin dropping,\u201d Mr. Kim said. The third tier is the most intrusive: The Immin Ban \u2014 \u201cPeople\u2019s Class Unit,\u201d or \u201cNeighborhood Unit\u201d \u2014 groups 10 to 20 nearby households together, tasking them to spy upon one another for anti-regime activity. All units are required to report to higher authorities. All are motivated by fear. \u201cIt is not like they are influenced by rules. They are more influenced by punishment if they don\u2019t report properly,\u201d Mr. Kim said. \u201cIf a stranger appears, it\u2019s a citizen\u2019s responsibility to report it.\u201d Mr. Kim calls it \u201ca perfect totalitarian regime.\u201d It has proven incredibly effective over time: The only three serious challenges to 76 years of rule by the Kim family originated from within the military, not the general population. So while Pyongyang may want Beijing-style digital surveillance, it may not need it. \u201cChina is a beacon of freedom compared to North Korea,\u201d Mr. Williams said.", "summary": "North Korea's recent \"filth balloon\" offensive against South Korea highlighted the depth of the paranoia in the regime of Kim Jong Un about information infiltration.", "url": "https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2024/jun/9/north-korea-floats-garbage-balloons-retaliation-so/", "image": "https://media.washtimes.com/media/image/2024/06/09/South_Korea_Koreas_Tensions_35617.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-09 13:17:36", "author": "Andrew Salmon", "authors": ["Andrew Salmon"], "language": "en", "catgory": "politics", "source_country": "US", "sentiment": -0.067}

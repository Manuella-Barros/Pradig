Over the years, the Haiti-born multidisciplinary artist has showcased a distinctive blend of storytelling and visual exploration that engages audiences across cultural boundaries. Now, at 37, Mathieu is arriving at yet another significant milestone in his career: two solo exhibits at the Museum of Contemporary Art North Miami (MOCA Nomi). The dual showcase projects Mathieu\u2019s celebrated ability to intertwine vibrant aesthetics with profound themes. It is also in the representation of Haitian art on a global stage. \u201cThese exhibitions are a culmination of my lifelong journey,\u201d Mathieu in an exclusive conversation with The Haitian Times. \u201cThey capture the essence of my explorations\u2014both within Haiti\u2019s history and within myself.\u201d The MOCA Nomi exhibitions \u2014 \u201cWorld Discovered Under Other Skies\u201d and \u201cDwelling on the Invisible\u201d \u2014 feature a captivating array of paintings, drawings and ceramics. They are particularly groundbreaking because of Mathieu\u2019s deep dive into Haiti\u2019s complex and often turbulent history. In addition to displaying Mathieu\u2019s artistic prowess, the collections\u2019 profound narratives aim to guide viewers through the landscapes of Haiti\u2019s past and present. Each piece also reflects Mathieu\u2019s unique perspective, informed by his personal experiences and the collective memory of his homeland. The MOCA exhibitions are available until October 6. Meanwhile, Mathieu continues to seek and explore new avenues, both within and beyond visual art. His recent ventures into perfume making and documentary filmmaking are a testament to his boundless curiosity and innovative spirit. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t change a day in my life.\u201d Mathieu expressed. \u201cI want it all.\u201d In an exclusive conversation with The Haitian Times, Mathieu offers a glimpse into the experiences that shaped his artistic vision. Discussing his childhood surrounded by art and a near-fatal accident, self-discovery and creating with urgency, to becoming an entrepreneur, Mathieu invites us into his world. The interview has been lightly edited for clarity. The beginning: Influences at a young age Growing up in Port-au-Prince, Mathieu was surrounded by a rich artistic influence. He was born into a low to middle-class family just months after the fall of Jean-Claude Duvalier\u2019s regime and was the eldest of three children. His mother\u2019s extensive collection of Haitian art and the mentorship of his cousin, Mario Benjamin, played pivotal roles in shaping his early creative aspirations. The Ha\u00eftian Times: How would you describe your upbringing growing up in Port-au-Prince? What was your childhood like? Manuel Mathieu: I grew up in a gingerbread house, surrounded by paintings and sculptures. My cousin, Mario Benjamin, introduced me to western artists and artists from the country. These introductions to the world of art led me to create art installations in my room and to pick up photography in my late teens, eventually leading me to being accepted into an undergraduate program at Goldsmiths, University of London. While my younger years were immersed in art, I hadn\u2019t yet fully accepted the calling to become an artist. The decision to become one was predicated on the idea of living forever. THT: You mentioned that you were called to be an artist. Was there ever a point in your life where you denied that calling? MM: I think what called me first was the freedom and excitement of being an artist. At first, it didn\u2019t make any sense to me to be an artist. What did I know about being an artist when I was 15 years old? The artists I discovered through the catalogs and books that Mario shared with me were leaving behind what they had in their souls, and I found that fascinating. I wanted to live like that forever. It wasn\u2019t that I wanted to be an artist; it was more like I wanted to live like that forever. THT: During the conversation at MOCA, you described your teen years as being a \u201cdifficult teenager with an \u201cI don\u2019t care\u201d attitude. What did that look like for you? MM: I was a \u201cdifficult teenager\u201d with an \u201cI don\u2019t care\u201d attitude who didn\u2019t take much heed of my parents\u2019 discipline. They couldn\u2019t tell me what to do, but I was still good at school, so it wasn\u2019t really an issue when it came to that. But, I can only imagine in a country like Haiti how hard that could be. THT: You mentioned that your grandmother taught you pure love and acceptance, and I wanted to know, experiencing your grandmother\u2019s love, how would you, now, define love? MM: I think pure love is about accepting people. Accepting the person that you love. It\u2019s hard to do that because we\u2019re like uneven rocks. We\u2019re full of flaws. And we\u2019re hiding a lot of it, which is fair, because we don\u2019t want to be exposed. Because when they see you, you cannot unsee people. I don\u2019t think she saw me, but she accepted me before seeing me \u2014 which is the most beautiful kind of love. THT: How has your rebellious spirit and your idea of love shaped your perspective and how does that translate into your art? MM: The rebellious side of me taught me to always build the courage to do whatever I want to do. You know, it is hard to live the life of an artist. But if you have the courage to get to the bottom of it, it\u2019s really beautiful. I think I brought that courage into my work because I can decide to embrace difficult subjects, subjects that are very hard to deal with, to engage with, or that some people would argue are impossible to talk about. I like to go there and not be afraid to get lost. When I was recovering from the accident, I spent a lot of time alone. There are some roads that are lonely. The road that is yours can be lonely. But you have to learn to be with yourself and embrace your destiny to a certain point. The crash: A turning point In 2015, Mathieu\u2019s life took a dramatic turn during his studies at Goldsmiths, University of London. A hit-and-run motorbike accident left him with a severe concussion and short-term memory loss. This traumatic event not only halted his physical capabilities but also forced a profound period of introspection. To complete his studies and obtain his master\u2019s degree in Fine Arts, it was required of him to hold a conversation for a minimum of an hour and take notes about those meetings. And while he was mostly tired during this time, he persisted and often found himself in a state of deep reflection. THT: Can you go through that experience with me? I read that that moment allowed you to be more self-reflective and allowed you to pause a little bit more. MM: I didn\u2019t have a choice because I couldn\u2019t do anything; I had to stop. I couldn\u2019t see well, I couldn\u2019t hear well. I couldn\u2019t hold a conversation for longer than 20 minutes. I couldn\u2019t sleep well, I was tired all the time. But I did what I had to do for the school because I wanted to be done with it. And during that time, I wasn\u2019t painting a lot, but I was thinking a lot because I couldn\u2019t go out or be active. So I spent a lot of time reflecting on all these ideas which gave the subject for my final show. THT: Was that difficult for you? To be in solitude in that way? MM: People would say that I was bored and that\u2019s why I got lonely. Art was a way to keep my mind focused because it never ends. It\u2019s like a circle that keeps going and going and you can dig in as much as you want and there\u2019s more. Creating: The philosophy of discovery For Mathieu, art is less about creation and more about discovery. This perspective drives him to constantly seek and explore new avenues, both within and beyond the traditional realms of visual art. His recent ventures into perfume making and documentary filmmaking on the corruption and impunity in Haiti and a video installation that\u2019ll be featured at Toronto Biennial of Arts in September are testaments to his boundless curiosity and innovative spirit. And while he\u2019s on the pursuit of living his life to the fullest, it begs the question of balance. THT: You said that you do not create art, you discover it. What has this discovery taught you about yourself and the world around you? MM: It taught me first that we\u2019re all connected, that we\u2019re all trying to live a life with love and dignity, that we\u2019re trying to find peace. And it also taught me to stay curious because when you cultivate the muscle of discovery or seeking, then it\u2019s kind of ingrained in you. So I think it affects the way I approach my life every day. There\u2019s always something pushing me forward. And I think that\u2019s very precious. Because there\u2019s always something to discover. And I\u2019m always producing something new. I\u2019m trying new stuff. THT: Tell me about something new that you\u2019ve recently discovered or that you\u2019ve done recently. MM: I\u2019m making perfumes right now. I didn\u2019t know anything about that. We\u2019re putting out the brand by fall of next year. So that\u2019s kind of cool. I already did three perfumes. I did the bottle. I\u2019m learning a lot about being an entrepreneur. It\u2019s a big learning curve. THT: How do you find balance with all of these different projects? What are some practices that you maintain? MM: I don\u2019t know. I think there\u2019s something in me that self-regulates. When I\u2019m tired, I sleep. There was a point where I used to understand us, as animals, that you just do what you want to do \u2013 all the time. If you want to eat you eat, if you want to [redacted] you [redacted], if you want to sleep, you sleep. And you just keep going like that. But I guess I am so passionate about what I do that I guess it brings me a certain joy that balance is it for me, you know? THT: With having two solo exhibitions here in Miami for the first time, what is your hope for attendees who experience it? MM: I hope that this show helps them connect with hidden parts of themselves \u2014 parts that they didn\u2019t know existed. I gave about seven tours when I was in Miami. And I could tell how the show got under people\u2019s skins. If it\u2019s not historically then it\u2019s emotionally, and if it\u2019s not emotionally, it\u2019s physically. I hope they leave carrying something inside of themselves that will accompany them for the rest of their lives.", "summary": "<figure><img width=\"1024\" height=\"768\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/haitiantimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/IMG_1286-scaled.jpeg?fit=1024%2C768&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"attachment-rss-image-size size-rss-image-size wp-post-image\" alt=\"\" decoding=\"async\" fetchpriority=\"high\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/haitiantimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/IMG_1286-scaled.jpeg?w=2560&amp;ssl=1 2560w, https://i0.wp.com/haitiantimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/IMG_1286-scaled.jpeg?resize=300%2C225&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/haitiantimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/IMG_1286-scaled.jpeg?resize=1024%2C768&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/haitiantimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/IMG_1286-scaled.jpeg?resize=768%2C576&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/haitiantimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/IMG_1286-scaled.jpeg?resize=1536%2C1152&amp;ssl=1 1536w, https://i0.wp.com/haitiantimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/IMG_1286-scaled.jpeg?resize=2048%2C1536&amp;ssl=1 2048w, https://i0.wp.com/haitiantimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2", "url": "https://haitiantimes.com/2024/06/09/haitian-artist-manuel-mathieu-exhibition-miami/", "image": "https://haitiantimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/IMG_1286-scaled.jpeg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-09 14:05:59", "author": "Meline Rose,The Haitian Times", "authors": ["Meline Rose", "The Haitian Times"], "language": "en", "source_country": "us", "sentiment": 0.822}

Fan favourites including Sam Heughan, Caitriona Balfe, Sophie Skelton, Lauren Lyle, Richard Rankin and executive producer Maril Davis were among the well-kent crew from the hit Starz show in attendance at the VIP box at the US superstar's second night in her three-day run at Murrayfield Stadium. Proving they were real 'Swifties' just like the rest of the 73,000 strong crowd, the delighted stars shared a slew of snaps and footage of them dressed up as different 'Eras' and having a ball at the show. After the gig, Sam, 44, shared his gratitude to be attending the concert - officially the most ticketed event to ever take place in Scotland as he posted on Instagram: \"Wonderful evening back @murrayfield_stadium with the @outlander_starz family!! Thanks @louisamcculloch3 @nightmaril for organising and to @taylorswift for an incredible evenings entertainment!\" Sophie Skelton said: \u201cLong live all the magic we made. Had the time of my life\u2026 with you! Thank you @outlander_starz, @taylorswift and her team for making this night happen. Adding more Swifties to the clan. Hoodie by TTPD. And we got \u201cCrazier\u201d x\" Fans were over the moon at the meeting of two great entertainment institutions. They took to the comments on Sophie's Instagram post, with one saying: \"Imagine you get tickets to Taylor and then you also see the outlander cast there. I\u2019d have imploded.\" One added: \"Taylor and Outlander? It\u2019s too good to be true.\" One said: \"Seeing you all so happy yesterday made me tear up. Outlander and Taylor\u2019s music are two of the things I love the most in the world. My Sassenach swiftie heart is very happy it happened. I wish I was there to live it with you. Sending you much love from Brazil. And one said: \" The crossover we all needed. Earlier this week we reported how Jamie Fraser star Sam had revealed to fans he was a huge Swiftie - and he was hoping to woo her off other half Travis Kelce this weekend when he downed tools to attend the gig along with his colleagues. Sam confessed he has a huge celebrity crush on Taylor as he revealed he had tickets to see the Love Story singer. He then went on about his plan to make Taylor fall in love with him when she hopefully spies him in the audience at Murrayfield. The actor, who hails from Balmaclellan in Dumfries and Galloway, took to Instagram earlier this week to share an interview clip from the Outlander set where he spoke about his crush on Swift, 34. In the footage, which features Swift's track, 'Are You Ready For It?' in the background, Sam says: \"We're gonna go see Taylor Swift play in Scotland and I think most of the cast are going.\" He adds: \"She obviously doesn't know this but when she comes to Scotland and sees me in the audience, she's gonna forget all about... him,\" with a cheeky grin, referring to Swift's current boyfriend, Kansas City Chiefs player Travis Kelce before confidently adding she will \"fall in love in with a man in a ginger wig.\" He continued: \"How could she resist? You know, she's gonna shake him off and take me out instead. I'm really excited.\" He ended the clip by creating a heart shape with his hands, a known Swiftie symbol which fans make throughout the Fearless Era of Swift's show.

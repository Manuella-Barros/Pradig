Sister Mary T Barron, originally from Galdonagh, has been appointed by the Pope as a Member of the Dicastery for Evangelization, Section for First Evangelization and New Particular Churches. The role is a huge honor for Sr Barron, who is currently also the congregational leader of the Missionary Sisters of Our Lady of the Apostles in Rome. Members of the different Catholic Church dicasteries are responsible for a range of matters including directing the matters of the church doctrine, and how faith is spread by the church. \u201cThe appointment is a great honour for our Congregation at this moment in our history as we journey towards marking 150 years since our Foundation in 2026,\u201d said the Rome Missionary Sisters of Our Lady of the Apostles in a statement on social media. \u201cBack in 1876, at the foundations, Fr. Augustin Planque, SMA, OLA Founder, communicated frequently with this dicastery, then known as Propaganda Fide, as he set his new Congregation on solid Foundations. We wish Sr Mary and all the newly appointed members a fruitful mission.\u201d", "summary": "<p>A Donegal woman has been appointed to a role within the Vatican by Pope Francis.

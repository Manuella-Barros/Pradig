Cryer admitted he was \u201cblissfully unaware\u201d that his ex strugglee with addiction during their time together in an interview with People published Saturday. \u201cWe dated for a short time while we were working on \u2018No Small Affair,\u2019 but I guess our particular affair was, in fact, pretty small,\u201d he explained. \u201cShe was already struggling with a drug problem. One that I was blissfully unaware of until a couple of weeks before the movie ended.\u201d Cryer also recalled that unlike himself, Moore was a lot more sure-footed in Hollywood. Cryer spoke with the outlet promoting the new documentary \u201cBrats,\u201d which explores the world of the 1980s \u201cBrat Pack\u201d actors. \u201cShe was incredibly charismatic and had a much better grasp of the business than I did. She knew everyone in town, but we were both really nervous about being leads in a movie for the first time,\u201d he said. Moore would go on to star in 1985\u2019s \u201cSt. Elmo\u2019s Fire,\u201d which proved to be her biggest film to date, before she checked herself into rehab. Joel Schumacher, who directed the movie, told the actress he would fire her if she didn\u2019t get clean. Schumacher was speaking from a place of experience and previously overcame his own battle against substance abuse. \u201cI told her I was firing her,\u201d Schumacher told People in 1997. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to do what they had done with John Belushi, which was just give her the money to kill herself.\u201d His help didn\u2019t end once Moore began rehab. \u201cWhen she came out, we hired a counselor to live with Demi during filming,\u201d he added. \u201cShe\u2019s been sober ever since.\u201d Moore revisited her relationship with Cryer in her 2019 memoir \u201cInside Out.\u201d The actress wrote that she believed she was the first person Cryer had sex with \u2014 something he disputed weeks later. He tweeted, \u201cWell, the good thing about this is she doesn\u2019t have to feel bad about it anymore, because while I\u2019m sure she was totally justified making that assumption based on my my skill level (and the stunned look on my face at the time), I had actually lost my virginity in high school.\u201d \u201cBut she\u2019s right [about] the other part, I was over the moon for her during a very troubled time in her life. I have nothing but affection for her and not a regret in the world,\u201d Cryer added.", "summary": "<p>The actress checked herself into rehab in 1985</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.thewrap.com/jon-cryer-unaware-demi-moore-addiction/\">Jon Cryer Admits Being \u2018Blissfully Unaware\u2019 Demi Moore Was Fighting Addiction While They Dated</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.thewrap.com\">TheWrap</a>.</p>", "url": "https://www.thewrap.com/jon-cryer-unaware-demi-moore-addiction/", "image": "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/jon-cryer-demi-moore.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-08 17:29:36", "author": "Stephanie Kaloi", "authors": ["Stephanie Kaloi"], "language": "en", "source_country": "US", "sentiment": -0.141}

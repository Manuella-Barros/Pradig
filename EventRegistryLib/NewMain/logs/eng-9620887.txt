The sources did not say what charges Heuermann is facing or which victim they pertain to.\n\nThe Suffolk County District Attorney's office confirmed to The Independent that Heuermann will appear in court on Thursday.\n\nHeuermann has been charged with the 2009 and 2010 murders of Megan Waterman, Melissa Barthelemy, Amber Lynn Costello and Maureen Brainard-Barnes -- known as the \"Gilgo Four\" -- whose bodies were the first of 10 found along a remote beach parkway on Long Island between late fall 2010 and early spring 2011. All four women were sex workers, authorities have said.\n\nThe Manhattan architect, who has been held without bail since his arrest on July 13, has pleaded not guilty to the four murder charges. He was previously due back in court for a status hearing on June 18.\n\nThe arraignment comes just days after Gilgo Beach Task Force investigators completed a second search of Heuermann's home in Massapequa Park and a search of an area of Manorville where the partial remains of two Gilgo Beach victims -- Jessica Taylor and Valerie Mack -- were found more than two decades ago.\n\nA first search of the house back in July lasted 12 days and turned up more than 200 firearms, including dozens stored in a basement vault. Investigators also tore up a wooden deck, used an excavator to dig up the backyard and scanned for buried objects with specialized equipment, according to Suffolk County District Attorney Ray Tierney, who is prosecuting the case.\n\nHe briefly visited the house last month for the second search as investigators photographed the front porch, collected paint chips and other materials and placed them into evidence bags.\n\nRobert Macedonio, who represents Heuermann's estranged wife, Asa Ellerup, talked to Newsday after inspecting the condition of the Massapequa Park property following the search.\n\n\"It seems to be that the focus was in the basement,\" Macedonio said. \"There doesn't seem to be much disturbance in the bathrooms [and] bedrooms.\" But details of what exactly the investigators were looking for in the basement remains a mystery.\n\nThe case began back in May 2010 when Shannan Gilbert, a young woman working as a sex worker, vanished after leaving a client's house on foot near Gilgo Beach. She called 911 for help saying she feared for her life and was never seen alive again.\n\nDuring a search for Gilbert in a dense thicket close to the beach, police discovered human remains. Within days, four victims had been found. By spring 2011, the number of victims rose to 10.\n\nGilbert's body was then found in December 2011. Her cause of death is widely contested with authorities long claiming that it is not connected to the serial killer or killers but that she died from accidental drowning as she fled from the client's home.\n\nHowever, an independent autopsy commissioned by her family ruled that she died by strangulation and her family continues to believe she was murdered.\n\nCourt records show that Heuermann was linked to the \"Gilgo Four\" murders through a tip about his pickup truck, a stash of burner phones, \"sadistic\" online searches and phone calls taunting victims' families.\n\nEmail accounts allegedly used by Heuermann were used \"to access and/or conduct searches related to pornography, rape, torture, and sex workers several thousand times,\" prosecutors said.\n\nAmong the harrowing searches were: \"autopsy photos of female\", \"stories of rape audio\", \"escorts manhattan\", and \"very skinny white teen tied up porn.\"\n\nHis DNA was also found on one of the victims, while his wife's hair was found on three of the four women he is connected to, according to prosecutors.\n\nInvestigators are continuing to work to determine if Heuermann is also linked to any of the other victims - while law enforcement officials across the country are probing cold case murders for any potential ties.\n\nHe has not been charged in the killings of any of the other victims whose remains were found along Gilgo Beach.", "source": {"uri": "uk.news.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo News UK"}, "authors": [{"uri": "andrea_cavallier@uk.news.yahoo.com", "name": "Andrea

He was later charged with the murder of a fourth woman, Maureen Brainard-Barnes, completing the so-called Gilgo four.\n\nJohn Ray, an attorney for the family of Shannon Gilbert, whose remains were found near Gilgo beach, has said that Taylor and Mack were tied up in a manner a hunter might use. Heuermann was a hunter, and police recovered about 200 guns from his home in the suburb of Massapequa park.\n\nHeuermann has already pleaded not guilty to murdering four women whose remains were found along Gilgo beach in late 2010 and early 2011 while police were investigating Gilbert's disappearance.\n\nAll of the women who went missing are believed to have been sex workers.

(Scripps News)\n\nThe New York architect previously accused of killing four women and leaving their corpses scattered along a coastal highway was charged Thursday in the deaths of two more after prosecutors said they gathered new DNA evidence and found a computer document he had used to \"blueprint\" his crimes.\n\nRex Heuermann, 60, appeared before a judge on the eastern end of Long Island to face charges that he killed Jessica Taylor and Sandra Costilla, two young women who were long suspected of being the victims of men preying on sex workers.\n\nTaylor disappeared in 2003. Costilla was killed in 1993. The new charges came just days after police finished extensive searches of Heuermann's Massapequa Park home and a wooded area on Long Island tied to the investigation of a string of deaths known as the Gilgo Beach serial killings.\n\nIn a court filing, prosecutors said they were able to use new forensic testing methods to match hairs found on or near the vicinity of both victims to a DNA profile that is a likely match to Heuermann. Additionally, prosecutors say they discovered a \"planning document\" on the hard drive found in his basement used to \"methodically blueprint\" his killings.\n\nThe document includes Heuermann's concerns about leaving behind forensic evidence, guidance for cleaning and washing bodies, and notes on how to improve \"next time,\" according to the bail application.\n\nHeuermann pleaded not guilty at the court hearing and was ordered held without bail.\n\nSuffolk County District Attorney Ray Tierney planned to hold a news conference following the court hearing.\n\nThe charges involving Costilla, who was killed 30 years ago, indicate that prosecutors believe Heuermann was killing victims for much longer than previously thought. Prosecutors say one entry in the planning documents suggested he was involved in the death of another woman, Valerie Mack, who was found dismembered in the same vicinity as Taylor. Heuermann has not been charged in the death of Mack, who disappeared in 2000.\n\nCrime\n\nPolice identify 7th victim in Gilgo Beach murder investigation Scripps News Staff 10:02 AM, Aug 04, 2023\n\nSince late 2010, police have been investigating the deaths of at least 10 people -- mostly female sex workers -- whose remains were discovered along an isolated highway not far from Gilgo Beach on Long Island's south shore.\n\nThe victims had disappeared over a span of at least 14 years. Vexed police officers made only halting progress in identifying possible suspects. Investigators long said it was likely that not all of the deaths were the work of the same killer. Some of the victims disappeared in the mid-1990s. Investigators concluded that an 11th person who disappeared in 2010 from the barrier island community of Oak Beach had accidentally drowned.\n\nHeuermann, who lived across a bay from where the bodies were found, was arrested last July. Prosecutors said a new investigative task force used mobile phone location data and DNA samples to link the architect to some of the victims. He was charged with killing four of the women: Megan Waterman, Melissa Barthelemy, Amber Lynn Costello and Maureen Brainard-Barnes.\n\nInvestigators who had searched Heuermann's home extensively and dug up his yard last summer returned to the house again last month and spent nearly a week searching it again. They focused their efforts mostly in the basement, according to a lawyer for Heuermann's wife.\n\nThat followed a search in April of a wooded area in Manorville, about 40 miles east of Heuermann's home, linked to another Gilgo Beach victim.\n\nJessica Taylor, 20, vanished in 2003 while working as an escort in New York City. Some of her remains were discovered in Manorville that year. Other remains were found in a 2011 search of the beach scrub by the side of Ocean Parkway, the road where the other Gilgo Beach victims were found.\n\nInvestigators in April also spent days searching a property in the eastern Long Island hamlet of North Sea, where the Costilla's body was discovered in 1993. Costilla was 28 when she was killed and had lived in New York City.\n\nCrime\n\nThe family of the Gilgo Beach suspect speaks out Axel Turcios 7:22 PM, Aug 11, 2023\n\nA decade ago, Suffolk County prosecutors said publicly that they believed Costilla had been killed by a carpenter who lived in the area, John Bittrolff, who was convicted of murdering two other women whose bodies had been found on the same part of Long Island. But Bittrolff was never charged with Costilla's death due to lack of evidence. He insists he is innocent of any murders.\n\nHeuermann's lawyer and the lawyers separately representing his wife and two adult children declined to comment.\n\nHeuermann, who has been in custody since his arrest, has pleaded not guilty. He had been set to return to court on July 30 for a status hearing.

Heuermann is expected back in court later this week on a new indictment charging him with an additional killing, multiple sources told Newsday.\n\nHeuermann, 60, will appear for arraignment before State Supreme Court Justice Timothy Mazzei in Riverhead on Thursday, the sources said.\n\nThe new indictment comes within weeks of a search by Gilgo Beach Task Force investigators in an area of Manorville where the partial remains of two Gilgo Beach victims -- Jessica Taylor and Valerie Mack -- were found more than two decades ago and days after Gilgo investigators completed a second search of Heuermann's home in Massapequa Park.\n\nSources declined to say what new charges Heuermann is facing. Suffolk County District Attorney Ray Tierney and Heuermann defense attorney Michael J. Brown declined to comment.\n\nHeuermann previously pleaded not guilty in the deaths of four women -- Megan Waterman, Melissa Barthelemy, Amber Lynn Costello and Maureen Brainard-Barnes -- who were the first of 10 sets of remains found within proximity of each other along Ocean Parkway between late fall 2010 and early spring 2011.\n\nHeuermann, an architect who had an office on Fifth Avenue in Manhattan, has been held without bail since his July 13 arrest on first- and second-degree murder charges in the killings of Waterman, Barthelemy and Costello. He was charged in January with second-degree murder for the killing of Brainard-Barnes. He was previously due back in court for a conference June 18.\n\nAll four women worked as sex workers, authorities have said.\n\nProsecutors have said they believe Heuermann acted alone in the first four killings he was charged with and that the cause of each woman's death was \"homicidal violence.\" Their bodies were found nude and bound, and they were contacted by burner phones consistent with Heuermann's locations, prosecutors have said. Five hairs connected to Heuermann or a family member were recovered from three of the four sets of remains, according to prosecutors.\n\nThe investigation into six additional sets of remains discovered near Gilgo Beach in March and April 2011 have remained active, Tierney has said.\n\n\"The thing that allows prosecutors to speak is indictments,\" Tierney said April 29.\n\nUnlike the four killings Heuermann was previously charged with, both Taylor, a sex worker who had lived for a time in New York City, and Mack, a sex worker from New Jersey, were dismembered with their remains scattered about a mile apart along the same road in Manorville and at Gilgo Beach. The earlier discovery of Taylor's remains along Halsey Manor Road dates to July 2003. Mack was found there in November 2000.\n\nKaren Vergata, a sex worker from New York City, also was dismembered in 1996 with her remains found near Gilgo Beach and Fire Island.\n\nThree other individuals whose remains were found along Ocean Parkway have not been identified, including a woman and toddler whose DNA shows are related, and an Asian male.\n\nEach of the discoveries was made as Suffolk police searched for Shannan Gilbert, whose body also was found in the area in December 2011, but who police have said they do not believe connects to what has become known as the Long Island Serial Killer case.\n\nProsecutors have said Heuermann had hundreds of contacts with sex workers in the years before he was arrested.\n\nHe was connected to the crime primarily through cell site data, burner phone records and DNA evidence linking him to the women and the location where the bodies were found, prosecutors have said. A witness in Costello's disappearance also provided a description of a truck linked to Heuermann, which helped establish him as a suspect and was later recovered from his brother's property in South Carolina, prosecutors have said.\n\nA cheek swab, obtained from Heuermann by court order since he's been in custody, matched a mitochondrial DNA profile that authorities who were surveilling Heuermann developed from a pizza crust and used napkin that allegedly were discarded in Manhattan, prosecutors have said.\n\nThe mitochondrial DNA profile developed from the pizza and napkin could not be excluded as a match to a hair found at the bottom of burlap used to \"restrain and transport\" the remains of Waterman, according to prosecutors.\n\nProsecutors said in court papers filed in March they had turned over 12 terabytes of data to Heuermann's defense, including a transcript of the grand jury presentation, 85 grand jury exhibits, autopsy reports, photographs from the crime scene and the medical examiner's office, search warrants and affidavits. Prosecutors said the defense also has been given paperwork from the Suffolk County Police Department and its crime lab, as well as outside laboratory documentation.\n\nAt Heuermann's most recent court appearance in April, Tierney and Suffolk Assistant District Attorney Nicholas Santomartino said prosecutors also recently turned over nearly 400 complete leads, a total of more than 7,000 other persons of interest in the 13-year investigation.\n\nPolice used K-9 dogs during their nine-day search of thousands of acres of Manorville woodlands in April and early May. The recent search of Heuermann's home, which an attorney for his family said focused on the basement area, concluded after six days May 26. A July search of his home lasted 12 days.\n\nMazzei has said he would like to have discovery in the case completed by the end of July.", "source": {"uri": "newsday.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

Please try again later{{ /verifyErrors }}\n\nSuspected Gilgo Beach serial killer Rex Heuermann is expected to be back in court this week to face a new charge on yet another killing just days after investigators conducted a second search of his Massapequa Park home.\n\nHeuermann, 60, will appear in a Riverhead courtroom on Thursday for the arraignment before State Supreme Court Justice Timothy Mazzei, multiple sources told Newsday. The sources did not say what charges Heuermann is facing or which victim they pertain to.\n\nHeuermann has been charged with the 2009 and 2010 murders of Megan Waterman, Melissa Barthelemy, Amber Lynn Costello and Maureen Brainard-Barnes -- known as the \"Gilgo Four\" -- whose bodies were the first of 10 found along a remote beach parkway on Long Island between late fall 2010 and early spring 2011. All four women were sex workers, authorities have said.\n\nThe Manhattan architect, who has been held without bail since his arrest on July 13, has pleaded not guilty to the four murder charges. He was previously due back in court for a status hearing on June 18.\n\nThe arraignment comes just days after Gilgo Beach Task Force investigators completed a second search of Heuermann's home in Massapequa Park and a search of an area of Manorville where the partial remains of two Gilgo Beach victims -- Jessica Taylor and Valerie Mack -- were found more than two decades ago.\n\nA first search of the house back in July lasted 12 days and turned up more than 200 firearms, including dozens stored in a basement vault. Investigators also tore up a wooden deck, used an excavator to dig up the backyard and scanned for buried objects with specialized equipment, according to Suffolk County District Attorney Ray Tierney, who is prosecuting the case.\n\nHe briefly visited the house last month for the second search as investigators photographed the front porch, collected paint chips and other materials and placed them into evidence bags.\n\nRobert Macedonio, who represents Heuermann's estranged wife, Asa Ellerup, talked to Newsday after inspecting the condition of the Massapequa Park property following the search.\n\n\"It seems to be that the focus was in the basement,\" Macedonio said. \"There doesn't seem to be much disturbance in the bathrooms [and] bedrooms.\" But details of what exactly the investigators were looking for in the basement remains a mystery.\n\nThe case began back in May 2010 when Shannan Gilbert, a young woman working as a sex worker, vanished after leaving a client's house on foot near Gilgo Beach. She called 911 for help saying she feared for her life and was never seen alive again.\n\nDuring a search for Gilbert in a dense thicket close to the beach, police discovered human remains. Within days, four victims had been found. By spring 2011, the number of victims rose to 10.\n\nGilbert's body was then found in December 2011. Her cause of death is widely contested with authorities long claiming that it is not connected to the serial killer or killers but that she died from accidental drowning as she fled from the client's home.\n\nHowever, an independent autopsy commissioned by her family ruled that she died by strangulation and her family continues to believe she was murdered.\n\nCourt records show that Heuermann was linked to the \"Gilgo Four\" murders through a tip about his pickup truck, a stash of burner phones, \"sadistic\" online searches and phone calls taunting victims' families.\n\nEmail accounts allegedly used by Heuermann were used \"to access and/or conduct searches related to pornography, rape, torture, and sex workers several thousand times,\" prosecutors said.\n\nAmong the harrowing searches were: \"autopsy photos of female\", \"stories of rape audio\", \"escorts manhattan\", and \"very skinny white teen tied up porn.\"\n\nHis DNA was also found on one of the victims, while his wife's hair was found on three of the four women he is connected to, according to prosecutors.\n\nInvestigators are continuing to work to determine if Heuermann is also linked to any of the other victims - while law enforcement officials across the country are probing cold case murders for any potential ties.\n\nHe has not been charged in the killings of any of the other victims whose remains were found along Gilgo Beach.", "source": {"uri": "independent.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Independent"}, "authors": [{"uri": "andrea_cavallier@independent.co.uk", "name": "Andrea

Heuermann, the New York architect accused of killing four women and leaving their bodies near Long Island's Gilgo Beach, has been accused in the deaths of two more women.\n\nRIVERHEAD, N.Y. (AP) -- The New York architect previously accused of killing four women and leaving their corpses scattered along a coastal highway was charged Thursday in the deaths of two more after prosecutors said they gathered new DNA evidence and found a computer document he had used to \"blueprint\" his crimes.\n\nRex Heuermann, 60, appeared before a judge on the eastern end of Long Island to face charges that he killed Jessica Taylor and Sandra Costilla, two young women who were long suspected of being the victims of men preying on sex workers.\n\nTaylor disappeared in 2003. Costilla was killed in 1993. The new charges came just days after police finished extensive searches of Heuermann's Massapequa Park home and a wooded area on Long Island tied to the investigation of a string of deaths known as the Gilgo Beach serial killings.\n\nIn a court filing, prosecutors said they were able to use new forensic testing methods to match hairs found on or near the vicinity of both victims to a DNA profile that is a likely match to Heuermann. Additionally, prosecutors say they discovered a \"planning document\" on the hard drive found in his basement used to \"methodically blueprint\" his killings.\n\nThe document includes Heuermann's concerns about leaving behind forensic evidence, guidance for cleaning and washing bodies, and notes on how to improve \"next time,\" according to the bail application.\n\nHeuermann pleaded not guilty at the court hearing and was ordered held without bail.\n\nSuffolk County District Attorney Ray Tierney planned to hold a news conference following the court hearing.\n\nThe charges involving Costilla, who was killed 30 years ago, indicate that prosecutors believe Heuermann was killing victims for much longer longer than previously thought. Prosecutors say one entry in the planning documents suggested he was involved in the death of another woman, Valerie Mack, who was found dismembered in the same vicinity as Taylor. Heuermann has not been charged in the death of Mack, who disappeared in 2000.\n\nSince late 2010, police have been investigating the deaths of at least 10 people -- mostly female sex workers -- whose remains were discovered along an isolated highway not far from Gilgo Beach on Long Island's south shore.\n\nThe victims had disappeared over a span of at least 14 years. Vexed police officers made only halting progress in identifying possible suspects. Investigators long said it was likely that not all of the deaths were the work of the same killer. Some of the victims disappeared in the mid-1990s. Investigators concluded that an 11th person who disappeared in 2010 from the barrier island community of Oak Beach had accidentally drowned.\n\nHeuermann, who lived across a bay from where the bodies were found, was arrested last July. Prosecutors said a new investigative task force used mobile phone location data and DNA samples to link the architect to some of the victims. He was charged with killing four of the women: Megan Waterman, Melissa Barthelemy, Amber Lynn Costello and Maureen Brainard-Barnes.\n\nInvestigators who had searched Heuermann's home extensively and dug up his yard last summer returned to the house again last month and spent nearly a week searching it again. They focused their efforts mostly in the basement, according to a lawyer for Heuermann's wife.\n\nThat followed a search in April of a wooded area in Manorville, about 40 miles (65 kilometers) east of Heuermann's home, linked to another Gilgo Beach victim.\n\nJessica Taylor, 20, vanished in 2003 while working as an escort in New York City. Some of her remains were discovered in Manorville that year. Other remains were found in a 2011 search of the beach scrub by the side of Ocean Parkway, the road where the other Gilgo Beach victims were found.\n\nInvestigators in April also spent days searching a property in the eastern Long Island hamlet of North Sea, where the Costilla's body was discovered in 1993. Costilla was 28 when she was killed and had lived in New York City.\n\nA decade ago, Suffolk County prosecutors said publicly that they believed Costilla had been killed by a carpenter who lived in the area, John Bittrolff, who was convicted of murdering two other women whose bodies had been found on the same part of Long Island. But Bittrolff was never charged with Costilla's death due to lack of evidence. He insists he is innocent of any murders.\n\nHeuermann's lawyer and the lawyers separately representing his wife and two adult children declined to comment.\n\nHeuermann, who has been in custody since his arrest, has pleaded not guilty. He had been set to return to court on July 30 for a status hearing. No trial date has been set.\n\nFollow Philip Marcelo at twitter.com/philmarcelo.", "source": {"uri": "eagletribune.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Eagle-Tribune"}, "authors": [{"uri":

Vexed police officers made only halting progress in identifying possible suspects. Investigators long said it was likely that not all of the deaths were the work of the same killer.

Some of her skeletal remains were discovered that same year in the Manorville woods. More of her remains were found in 2011 in the search around Gilgo Beach.\n\nInitially known as \"Jane Doe No. 6,\" Mack's remains had been unidentified for years until genetic testing revealed her identity in 2020.\n\nJessica Taylor, 20, vanished in 2003 while working as an escort in New York City.

Costilla was killed in 1993. The new charges came just days after police finished extensive searches of Heuermann's Massapequa Park home and a wooded area on Long Island tied to the investigation of a string of deaths known as the Gilgo Beach serial killings.\n\nIn a court filing, prosecutors said they were able to use new forensic testing methods to match hairs found on or near the vicinity of both victims to a DNA profile that is a likely match to Heuermann. Additionally, prosecutors say they discovered a \"planning document\" on the hard drive found in his basement used to \"methodically blueprint\" his killings.\n\nThe document includes Heuermann's concerns about leaving behind forensic evidence, guidance for cleaning and washing bodies, and notes on how to improve \"next time,\" according to the bail application.\n\nHeuermann pleaded not guilty at the court hearing and was ordered held without bail.\n\nSuffolk County District Attorney Ray Tierney planned to hold a news conference following the court hearing.\n\nThe charges involving Costilla, who was killed 30 years ago, indicate that prosecutors believe Heuermann was killing victims for much longer longer than previously thought. Prosecutors say one entry in the planning documents suggested he was involved in the death of another woman, Valerie Mack, who was found dismembered in the same vicinity as Taylor. Heuermann has not been charged in the death of Mack, who disappeared in 2000.\n\nSince late 2010, police have been investigating the deaths of at least 10 people -- mostly female sex workers -- whose remains were discovered along an isolated highway not far from Gilgo Beach on Long Island's south shore.\n\nThe victims had disappeared over a span of at least 14 years.

Costilla was 28 when she was killed and had lived in New York City.\n\nA decade ago, Suffolk County prosecutors said publicly that they believed Costilla had been killed by a carpenter who lived in the area, John Bittrolff, who was convicted of murdering two other women whose bodies had been found on the same part of Long Island. But Bittrolff was never charged with Costilla's death due to lack of evidence. He insists he is innocent of any murders.\n\nHeuermann's lawyer and the lawyers separately representing his wife and two adult children declined to comment.\n\nHeuermann, who has been in custody since his arrest, has pleaded not guilty.

In total, New York authorities have now charged Heuermann in the killings of six women that occurred over the course of three decades.\n\nThe new charges come after police investigators conducted searches of Heuermann's Long Island home and a wooded area tied to the Gilgo Beach serial killings.\n\n\"The investigation continues, and that investigation has been expanded both to the bodies that have been found on Gilgo [Beach] and beyond,\" Suffolk County District Attorney Ray Tierney told reporters Thursday. \"This case continues.\"\n\nThe latest charges against the suspected serial killer\n\nHeuermann, a 60-year-old married father and former architect, was charged Thursday with second-degree murder in the 2003 death of Jessica Taylor, 20, and the 1993 death of Sandra Costilla, 28, according to prosecutors.\n\nIn July 2003, some of Taylor's bodily remains were discovered in Manorville, N.Y., her skull, hands and forearms were found along a highway near Gilgo Beach.\n\nAccording to investigators, phone records showed that Heuermann's wife and children were out of town at the time Taylor was killed.\n\n\"[This] would have allowed Defendant Heuermann unfettered time to execute his plans for Ms. Taylor, which included the decapitation, dismemberment, and transportation of her remains, without any fear that his family would uncover or learn of his involvement in these crimes,\" .\n\nThe killing of Costilla was long thought to have been by another person. Costilla's remains were found in Southampton, N.Y., in 1993.\n\nHair remains found on Taylor and Castillo's bodies were linked to Heuermann through DNA testing, forensic experts said.\n\nAs a result of investigators searching Heuermann's home, they seized hundreds of electronic devices.

Prosecutors are planning a major announcement in the case as Heuermann is set to appear in criminal court on Long Island on Thursday, June 6, 2024. (James Carbone/Newsday via AP)RIVERHEAD, N.Y. (AP) - The New York architect accused of murdering multiple women and leaving their corpses scattered along the Long Island coast kept a \"blueprint\"\u009d of his crimes on his computer, prosecutors revealed Thursday as they brought charges against Rex Heuermann in two more killings. Heuermann, 60, appeared before a judge to be arraigned in the deaths of Jessica Taylor and Sandra Costilla, two young women who were long suspected of being the victims of men preying on sex workers. He had previously been charged with murdering four other women in a string of deaths known as the Gilgo Beach serial killings. Taylor disappeared in 2003. Costilla was killed 30 years ago, in 1993, and her inclusion in the case indicates that prosecutors now believe Heuermann was killing women for much longer than previously thought. The new charges came just days after police finished extensive searches of Heuermann's Massapequa Park home and a wooded area on Long Island tied to the investigation. In a court filing, prosecutors said they were able to use new forensic testing methods to match hairs found on or near the vicinity of both victims to a DNA profile that is a likely match to Heuermann. Additionally, prosecutors say they recovered a file on a hard drive in his basement used to \"methodically blueprint\"\u009d his killings. The all-caps document features a series of checklists with tasks to complete before, during and after the killings, as well as practical lessons for \"next time.\" Among the dozens of entries written are reminders to clean the bodies and destroy evidence, to \"get sleep before hunt\"\u009d and to \"have story set.\" One section, titled \"things to remember,\"\u009d appears to highlight lessons from previous killings, prosecutors said, such as using heavier rope and limiting noise in order to maximize \"play time.\"\u009d A \"body prep\"\u009d checklist includes, among other items, a note to \"remove head and hands.\" Prosecutors believe that entry may connect Heuermann to yet another victim, Valerie Mack, whose partial skeletal remains were discovered near the body of Taylor after her disappearance in 2000. Heuermann has not been charged in the death of Mack. But asked during a news conference after Thursday's hearing if he was a suspect, District Attorney Ray Tierney replied, \"That's fair to say.\"\u009d Heuermann pleaded not guilty to killing Taylor and Costilla during the hearing and was ordered held without bail. His lawyer, Michael Brown, said outside court that Heuermann is \"obviously in a bad place in terms of the new charges.\"\u009d Afterward, Tierney said the additional charges provide \"some small measure of closure\"\u009d for the victims' families. Since late 2010, police have been investigating the deaths of at least 10 people - mostly female sex workers - whose remains were discovered along an isolated highway not far from Gilgo Beach on Long Island's south shore. Those victims had disappeared over a span of at least 14 years. Vexed police officers made only halting progress in identifying possible suspects. Investigators long said it was likely that not all of the deaths were the work of the same killer. Some of the victims disappeared in the mid-1990s. Investigators concluded that an 11th person who disappeared in 2010 from the barrier island community of Oak Beach had accidentally drowned. Heuermann, who lived across a bay from where the bodies were found, was arrested last July. Prosecutors said a new investigative task force used mobile phone location data and DNA samples to link the architect to some of the victims. He was charged with killing four of the women: Megan Waterman, Melissa Barthelemy, Amber Lynn Costello and Maureen Brainard-Barnes. Investigators who had searched Heuermann's home extensively and dug up his yard last summer returned to the house again last month and spent nearly a week searching it again. They focused their efforts mostly in the basement, according to a lawyer for Heuermann's wife. That followed a search in April of a wooded area in Manorville, about 40 miles (65 kilometers) east of Heuermann's home, and in the Southampton hamlet of North Sea, where Costilla's remains were discovered decades ago. Tierney said the planning document was recovered in March of this year, providing the impetus for the recent searches. Prosecutors also said they found a book in Heuermann's possession by the retired FBI agent John Douglas, \"The Cases That Haunt Us.\"\u009d They say the planning document referenced specific pages in another work by Douglas, \"Mind Hunter,\"\u009d that allude to the personality types of serial killers and profiles of those who use mutilation and sexual violence. Jessica Taylor, 20, vanished in 2003 while working as an escort in New York City. Some of her remains were discovered in Manorville that year. Other remains were found in a 2011 search of the beach scrub by the side of Ocean Parkway, the road where the other Gilgo Beach victims were found. Taylor's mother, Elizabeth Baczkiel, was at the courthouse for Thursday's court hearing. She held up childhood photos of her daughter but didn't speak to reporters. Her lawyer, Gloria Allred, read a statement from Baczkiel in which she described her daughter as \"loving, compassionate and so funny,\" and said she would have made a great mother. \"My darling daughter, you will never be forgotten,\"\u009d the statement said. \"You will forever be in our hearts.\" Valerie Mack, 24, who had been working as an escort in Philadelphia, disappeared in 2000 and was last seen by her family in Port Republic, New Jersey, near Atlantic City. Some of her skeletal remains were discovered that same year in the Manorville woods. More of her remains were found in 2011 in the search around Gilgo Beach. Initially known as \"Jane Doe No. 6,\"\u009d Mack's remains had been unidentified for years until genetic testing revealed her identity in 2020. Costilla was 28 when she was killed and had lived in New York City. A decade ago, Suffolk County prosecutors said publicly that they believed Costilla had been killed by a carpenter who lived in the area, John Bittrolff, who was convicted of murdering two other women whose bodies had been found on the same part of Long Island. But Bittrolff was never charged with Costilla's death due to lack of evidence. He insists he is innocent of any murders. Heuermann's lawyer, Brown, said he planned to request the prosecution's files on Bittrolff. \"Quite frankly, the police department and the district attorney's office all had the finger pointed at Bittrolff for that murder,\"\u009d he said. ___ Follow Philip Marcelo at twitter.com/philmarcelo.", "source": {"uri": "medicinehatnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Medicine Hat News"},

Heuermann was previously scheduled to appear next in court on June 18.\n\nWord of Heuermann's hearing, which was reported by Newsday and CNN, comes weeks after authorities searched his home in New York's Massapequa Park again, as well as a wooded area on Long Island where human remains were previously discovered.\n\n\"There were a number of investigative steps that were taken,\" Suffolk County District Attorney Ray Tierney told reporters Monday at a news conference scheduled for a separate matter. \"Thursday you'll see the fruits of that investigation.\"\n\nHeuermann, 60, has so far been charged with the murder of four sex workers whose bodies were discovered along a stretch of Gilgo Beach in Long Island.

Mazzei's courtroom with his attorney Michael Brown at Suffolk County Court in Riverhead, New York on Jan. 16, 2024. (James Carbone/Newsday via AP)\n\nProsecutors plan to announce a \"significant development\" Thursday in the case of a New York architect accused of killing four women and leaving their corpses scattered in the scrub along a coastal highway.\n\nRex Heuermann, 60, will appear before a judge days after police finished new, extensive searches of his Massapequa Park home and a wooded area on Long Island tied to the investigation of a string of deaths known as the Gilgo Beach serial killings.\n\nSuffolk County District Attorney Ray Tierney hasn't said what development he plans to announce or discuss the purpose of Thursday's court hearing.\n\nSince late 2010, police have been investigating the deaths of at least 10 people -- mostly female sex workers -- whose remains were discovered along an isolated highway not far from Gilgo Beach on Long Island's south shore.\n\nThe victims had disappeared over a span of at least 14 years. Vexed police officers made only halting progress in identifying possible suspects. Investigators long said it was likely that not all of the deaths were the work of the same killer. Some of the victims disappeared in the mid-1990s. Investigators concluded that an 11th person who disappeared in 2010 from the barrier island community of Oak Beach had accidentally drowned.\n\nMr. Heuermann, who lived across a bay from where the bodies were found, was arrested last July. Prosecutors said a new investigative task force used mobile phone location data and DNA samples to link the architect to some of the victims. He was charged with killing four of the women: Megan Waterman, Melissa Barthelemy, Amber Lynn Costello, and Maureen Brainard-Barnes.\n\nInvestigators who had searched Mr. Heuermann's home extensively and dug up his yard last summer returned to the house again last month and spent nearly a week searching it again. They focused their efforts mostly in the basement, according to a lawyer for Mr. Heuermann's wife.\n\nThat followed a search in April of a wooded area in Manorville, about 40 miles (65 kilometers) east of Mr. Heuermann's home, linked to two other Gilgo Beach victims.\n\nValerie Mack, 24, who had been working as an escort in Philadelphia, disappeared in 2000 and was last seen by her family in Port Republic, New Jersey. Some of her skeletal remains were discovered that same year in the Manorville woods. More of her remains were found in 2011 in the search around Gilgo Beach.\n\nInitially known as \"Jane Doe No. 6,\" Mack's remains had been unidentified for years until genetic testing revealed her identity in 2020.\n\nJessica Taylor, 20, vanished in 2003 while working as an escort in New York City. Some of her remains were discovered in Manorville that year. Other remains were found in a 2011 search of the beach scrub by the side of Ocean Parkway, the road where the other Gilgo Beach victims were found.\n\nRelatives for Mack and Taylor declined to comment Wednesday.\n\nMr. Heuermann's lawyer and the lawyers separately representing his wife and two adult children declined to comment.\n\nMr. Heuermann, who has been in custody since his arrest, has pleaded not guilty. He had been set to return to court on June 18 for a status hearing.

Prosecutors are planning a major announcement in the case as Heuermann is set to appear in criminal court on Long Island on Thursday, June 6, 2024. (James Carbone/Newsday via AP)\n\nProsecutors plan to announce a \"significant development\" Thursday in the case of a New York architect accused of murdering four women and leaving their corpses scattered in the scrub along a coastal highway.\n\nRex Heuermann, 60, will appear before a judge days after police finished new, extensive searches of his Massapequa Park home and a wooded area on Long Island tied to the investigation of a string of deaths known as the Gilgo Beach serial killings.\n\nSuffolk County District Attorney Ray Tierney hasn't said what development he plans to announce or discuss the purpose of Thursday's court hearing.\n\nSince late 2010, police have been investigating the deaths of at least 10 people -- - mostly female sex workers -- whose remains were discovered along an isolated highway not far from Gilgo Beach on Long Island's south shore.\n\nThe victims had disappeared over a span of at least 14 years. Vexed police officers made only halting progress in identifying possible suspects. Investigators long said it was likely that not all of the deaths were the work of the same killer. Some of the victims disappeared in the mid-1990s. Investigators concluded that an 11th person who disappeared in 2010 from the barrier island community of Oak Beach had accidentally drowned.\n\nHeuermann, who lived across a bay from where the bodies were found, was arrested last July. Prosecutors said a new investigative task force used mobile phone location data and DNA samples to link the architect to some of the victims. He was charged with killing four of the women: Megan Waterman, Melissa Barthelemy, Amber Lynn Costello and Maureen Brainard-Barnes.\n\nInvestigators who had searched Heuermann's home extensively and dug up his yard last summer returned to the house again last month and spent nearly a week searching it again. They focused their efforts mostly in the basement, according to a lawyer for Heuermann's wife.\n\nThat followed a search in April of a wooded area in Manorville, about 40 miles (65 kilometers) east of Heuermann's home, linked to two other Gilgo Beach victims.\n\nValerie Mack, 24, who had been working as an escort in Philadelphia, disappeared in 2000 and was last seen by her family in Port Republic, New Jersey. Some of her skeletal remains were discovered that same year in the Manorville woods. More of her remains were found in 2011 in the search around Gilgo Beach.\n\nInitially known as \"Jane Doe No. 6,\" Mack's remains had been unidentified for years until genetic testing revealed her identity in 2020.\n\nJessica Taylor, 20, vanished in 2003 while working as an escort in New York City. Some of her remains were discovered in Manorville that year. Other remains were found in a 2011 search of the beach scrub by the side of Ocean Parkway, the road where the other Gilgo Beach victims were found.\n\nRelatives for Mack and Taylor declined to comment Wednesday.\n\nHeuermann's lawyer and the lawyers separately representing his wife and two adult children declined to comment.\n\nHeuermann, who has been in custody since his arrest, has pleaded not guilty. He had been set to return to court on June 18 for a status hearing. No trial date has been set.\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

(AP) -- The New York architect previously accused of killing four women and leaving their corpses scattered along a coastal highway was charged Thursday in the deaths of two more women.\n\nRex Heuermann, 60, was set to appear before a judge to face charges that he killed Jessica Taylor and Sandra Costilla, two young women who were long suspected of being the victims of men preying on sex workers.\n\nTaylor disappeared in 2003. Costilla was killed in 1993. The new charges came just days after police finished extensive searches of Heuermann's Massapequa Park home and a wooded area on Long Island tied to the investigation of a string of deaths known as the Gilgo Beach serial killings.\n\nIn a court filing, prosecutors said were able to use new forensic testing methods to match hairs found on or near the vicinity of both victims to a DNA profile that is a likely match to Heuermann. Additionally, prosecutors say they discovered a \"planning document\" on the hard drive found in his basement used to \"methodically blueprint\" his killings.\n\nThe document includes Heuermann's concerns about leaving behind forensic evidence, guidance for cleaning and washing bodies, and notes on how to improve \"next time,\" according to the bail application\n\nSuffolk County District Attorney Ray Tierney planned to hold a news conference following the court hearing.\n\nThe charges involving Costilla, who was killed 30 years ago, indicate that prosecutors believe Heuermann was killing victims for much longer longer than previously thought.\n\nSince late 2010, police have been investigating the deaths of at least 10 people -- mostly female sex workers -- whose remains were discovered along an isolated highway not far from Gilgo Beach on Long Island's south shore.\n\nThe victims had disappeared over a span of at least 14 years.

They focused their efforts mostly in the basement, according to a lawyer for Heuermann's wife.\n\nThat followed a search in April of a wooded area in Manorville, about 40 miles (65 kilometers) east of Heuermann's home, linked to another Gilgo Beach victim.\n\nJessica Taylor, 20, vanished in 2003 while working as an escort in New York City. Some of her remains were discovered in Manorville that year. Other remains were found in a 2011 search of the beach scrub by the side of Ocean Parkway, the road where the other Gilgo Beach victims were found.\n\nInvestigators in April also spent days searching a property in the eastern Long Island hamlet of North Sea, where the Costilla's body was discovered in 1993. Costilla was 28 when she was killed and had lived in New York City.\n\nA decade ago, Suffolk County prosecutors said publicly that they believed Costilla had been killed by a carpenter who lived in the area, John Bittrolff, who was convicted of murdering two other women whose bodies had been found on the same part of Long Island. But Bittrolff was never charged with Costilla's death due to lack of evidence. He insists he is innocent of any murders.\n\nHeuermann's lawyer and the lawyers separately representing his wife and two adult children declined to comment.\n\nHeuermann, who has been in custody since his arrest, has pleaded not guilty. He had been set to return to court on June 18 for a status hearing. No trial date has been set.\n\nFollow Philip Marcelo at twitter.com/philmarcelo.", "source": {"uri": "register-herald.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Beckley Register-Herald"}, "authors": [{"uri":

He has been held without bail.\n\nRELATED: Revisiting old clue leads investigators to big break in Gilgo Beach murders\n\nLaw enforcement officials say the new murder charges are related to two additional victims, and come from a sweeping expansion of the investigation into Heuermann following his arrest last summer.\n\nHeuermann's arrest kicked off a media frenzy, with many wondering whether police had finally caught what the Gilgo Beach community had long feared was a serial killer responsible for a string of unsolved killings that took place over decades.\n\nAt least 11 sets of human remains have been found on Long Island's Suffolk County, including the four women Heuermann has been charged with killing.\n\nRecent searches in the woods in Manorville and the North Sea, and in Heuermann's Massapequa Park home, where evidence is believed recovered from the basement, have resulted in the expected new charges.\n\nRELATED: Investigators return to home of suspected Gilgo Beach serial killer Rex Heuermann for 2nd day\n\nManorville, a community in eastern Long Island, is about 40 miles northeast of where the bodies of the \"Gilgo Four\" were discovered.\n\n\"They do a nine-day search and then they go back to his house the last week of May and do a six-day search as the Massapequa Park house, so now 10 days later, here we got with an indictment -- a sealed indictment to hopefully be opened Thursday,\" said ABC News contributor Robert Boyce.\n\nHis attorney, Michael Brown, told reporters in January that Heuermann maintains his innocence and is looking forward to fighting the charges.\n\nSuffolk County District Attorney Ray Tierney is expected to discuss the new charges further following court.\n\n\"There were a number of investigative steps that were taken. Thursday you'll see the fruits of that investigation,\" Suffolk County District Attorney Ray Tierney said.\n\nRELATED: Gilgo Beach investigation: Police expand search area linked to man convicted of killing 2 women\n\nAccording to officials briefed on the investigation, detectives believe there may have been more killings - a belief that spurred investigators to expand their case, re-examine dump sites and conduct further searches at Heuermann's home, as well as go over unsolved missing persons cases.\n\n\"We are not near the end of this investigation,\" said one law enforcement official involved in the sweeping case. \"We are very much at the beginning.\"\n\nAfter Heuermann's arrest last summer, police said the investigation was far from over. They zeroed in on the Massapequa home where he had lived quietly for years with his wife, daughter and stepson.\n\nInvestigators used police dogs and ground-penetrating radar to search the home in July, uncovering over 280 firearms, more than 40 of which were possessed illegally, police said.\n\nAuthorities also looked into areas in Las Vegas and South Carolina where Heuermann owned property.\n\nTierney told reporters last summer that investigators were working with \"a flood of evidence.\"\n\nA few weeks ago, police once again searched the Massapequa home and were seen carrying boxes out of the house. Robert Macedonia, the attorney of Heuermann's estranged wife Asa Ellerup, confirmed that police had a warrant for the search.\n\nEllerup filed for divorce days after Heuermann's arrest last year, but still visits him weekly, according to a statement released by her attorneys in March.\n\nShe maintains that Heuermann is not capable of the crimes he's accused of, the statement said, adding that her sympathies go out to the victims and their families.\n\n\"Nobody deserves to die in that manner,\" Ellerup said in the statement.", "source": {"uri": "abc30.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ABC30

Heuermann appears in Judge Tim Mazzei's courtroom next to his attorney Michael Brown at Suffolk County Court in Riverhead on Wednesday, April 17, 2024.\n\nSuspected Gilgo Beach serial killer Rex Heuermann will reportedly face a new charge Thursday following a recent weeklong search at his Massapequa Park home.\n\nMultiple news outlets have reported that the 60-year-old suspect is set to face a new murder charge, but it was not immediately clear who the victim was.\n\nHeuermann was arrested in July 2023 and charged with the murders of three of the Gilgo Four: Megan Waterman, Melissa Barthelemy, and Amber Lynn Costello - and named a suspect in the murder of the fourth, Maureen Brainard-Barnes. He was charged with the murder of Maureen Brainard-Barnes in January. He pleaded not guilty to all four murders.\n\nFollowing the fourth indictment, Suffolk County District Attorney Ray Tierney told reporters that the grand jury investigation would be continuing into the other unsolved murders on Gilgo Beach.\n\nThe Gilgo Four were all discovered bound and fully intact on Ocean Parkway in December 2010 while searching for Shannan Gilbert, a woman who went missing on Oak Beach in 2010, was found dead in December 2011 and whose cause of death is unclear, but her family believes she was killed.\n\nThe rest of the victims were found in spring of 2011.\n\nThey include \"Fire Island Jane Doe\" Karen Vergata, whose dismembered partial remains had been found on Fire Island in 1996 and turned up on Tobay Beach in 2011, \"Peaches,\" whose torso was found at Hempstead Lake State Park in 1997 and whose additional remains were found on Jones Beach in 2011, \"Baby Doe,\" a toddler confirmed to be Peaches' daughter who was found on Gilgo Beach, an unidentified Asian male, and Jessica Taylor and Valerie Mack, whose dismembered partial remains were found in 2003 and 2000 in Manorville, respectively, and found on Gilgo in 2011.\n\nThe difference in modus operandi between the Gilgo Four and the dismembered victims caused many people through the years to speculate if the bodies on Gilgo Beach were the work of more than one serial killer. Notably, however, former Suffolk Police Commissioner Richard Dormer, the top cop at the time of discovery, repeatedly said he believed it was all the work of one killer.\n\nIt is currently not known which murder Heuermann will be charged with. However, this comes after a multi-agency search in the Manorville woods, where Taylor and Mack's partial remains had both been found. That search, which included Suffolk police, state police, and New York City police, also extended to North Sea, where the remains of Sandra Costilla were found in 1993. Costilla is typically thought of as a victim of convicted double-murderer John Bittrolff - who was from Manorville - but no one was ever charged with her murder.\n\nIt was not confirmed what police were searching for in Manorville, nor what was found. Mere weeks after that search, police once again descended on Heuermann's Massapequa Park home. It was, again, not confirmed what they were looking for, although the Press observed many items being taken out of the home. The Suffolk County Medical Examiner, as well as Tierney himself, were both spotted on the scene.", "source": {"uri": "longislandpress.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "LI Press"}, "authors":

At least half a dozen law enforcement agents were spotted in Heuermann's driveway on May 20. Cars, including state trooper vans, lined the street along the Massapequa Park neighborhood.\n\nRobert Macedonio, who represents Heuermann's estranged wife, told Newsday the inspection seemed to focus in the basement of the Long Island house.\n\nThe New York State Police previously told Newsweek it would not comment on the situation.\n\nThe Suffolk County District Attorney's Office did not respond immediately to Newsweek's request for comment.\n\nWho is Rex Heuermann?\n\nHeuermann graduated from the same local high school as actor Billy Baldwin who tweeted after the news broke about his 1981 classmate's arrest, describing it as \"mind-boggling.\"\n\nAfter getting a bachelor's degree from the New York Institute of Technology, Heuermann started his architecture firm RH Consultants in 1994. He did most of his architectural work in New York City, according to a company biography and the firm's website.\n\nHeuermann is currently being held at the Riverhead Correctional Facility in Suffolk County, about 50 miles from his home.\n\nThe Gilgo Four\n\nThe hunt for a possible serial killer started in 2010 when 11 sets of human remains were discovered along a property on Gilgo Beach in Suffolk County. Law enforcement first started searching along Ocean Parkway after Shannan Gilbert, a 24-year-old sex worker from New Jersey, vanished in 2010.\n\nThe search first turned up the remains of Barthelemy, Waterman, Lynn Costello and Brainard-Barnes. All the women were in their mid-20s.\n\nPolice found additional remains, including those belonging to Jessica Taylor and Valerie Mack as well as a female toddler, Asian male, and an unidentified woman who is believed to be the toddler's mother.\n\nThe case has long mystified police, and it captured the public's attention when Netflix released a film in 2020 called Lost Girls that was based on the murders.\n\nDetectives finally nabbed Heuermann in 2023 after he tossed a pizza box with leftover crust into a Manhattan trash can. The DNA from the crust matched genetic material found on the women's remains.\n\nHeuermann's allegations go beyond killing these women. He apparently also tormented their families. Prosecutors have revealed he used a victim's cellphone to taunt her family. In one case, he admitted to the murder. Heuermann also tried to conceal his identity online, even once searching \"Why hasn't the Long Island serial killer been caught?\"", "source": {"uri": "newsweek.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

(AP) -- The New York architect accused of murdering multiple women and leaving their corpses scattered along the Long Island coast kept a \"blueprint\" of his crimes on his computer, prosecutors revealed Thursday as they brought charges against Rex Heuermann in two more killings.\n\nHeuermann, 60, appeared before a judge to be arraigned in the deaths of Jessica Taylor and Sandra Costilla, two young women who were long suspected of being the victims of men preying on sex workers. He had previously been charged with murdering four other women in a string of deaths known as the Gilgo Beach serial killings.\n\nTaylor disappeared in 2003. Costilla was killed 30 years ago, in 1993, and her inclusion in the case indicates that prosecutors now believe Heuermann was killing women for much longer than previously thought.\n\nThe new charges came after recent police searches of Heuermann's Massapequa Park home and a wooded area on Long Island tied to the investigation.\n\nIn a court filing, prosecutors said they were able to use new forensic testing methods to match hairs found on or near the vicinity of both victims to a DNA profile that is a likely match to Heuermann. Additionally, prosecutors say they recovered a file on a hard drive in his basement used to \"methodically blueprint\" his killings.\n\nThe all-caps document features a series of checklists with tasks to complete before, during and after the killings, as well as practical lessons for \"next time.\" Among the dozens of entries written are reminders to clean the bodies and destroy evidence, to \"get sleep before hunt\" and to \"have story set.\"\n\nOne section, titled \"things to remember,\" appears to highlight lessons from previous killings, prosecutors said, such as using heavier rope and limiting noise in order to maximize \"play time.\" A \"body prep\" checklist includes, among other items, a note to \"remove head and hands.\"\n\nProsecutors believe that entry may connect Heuermann to yet another victim, Valerie Mack, whose partial skeletal remains were discovered near the body of Taylor after her disappearance in 2000.\n\nHeuermann has not been charged in the death of Mack. But asked during a news conference after Thursday's hearing if he was a suspect, District Attorney Ray Tierney replied, \"That's fair to say.\"\n\nHeuermann pleaded not guilty to killing Taylor and Costilla during the hearing and was ordered held without bail. His lawyer, Michael Brown, said outside court that Heuermann is \"obviously in a bad place in terms of the new charges.\"\n\nAfterward, Tierney said the additional charges provide \"some small measure of closure\" for the victims' families.\n\nSince late 2010, police have been investigating the deaths of at least 10 people -- mostly female sex workers -- whose remains were discovered along an isolated highway not far from Gilgo Beach on Long Island's south shore.\n\nThose victims disappeared over a span of at least 14 years. Vexed detectives made only halting progress in identifying possible suspects. Investigators long said it was likely that not all of the deaths were the work of the same killer. Some of the victims vanished in the mid-1990s. Investigators concluded that an 11th person who disappeared in 2010 from the barrier island community of Oak Beach had accidentally drowned.\n\nHeuermann, who lived across a bay from where the bodies were found, was arrested last July. Prosecutors said a new investigative task force used mobile phone location data and DNA samples to link the architect to some of the victims. He was charged with killing four of the women: Megan Waterman, Melissa Barthelemy, Amber Lynn Costello and Maureen Brainard-Barnes.\n\nInvestigators who searched Heuermann's home extensively and dug up his yard last summer returned to the house last month and spent nearly a week searching it again. They focused their efforts mostly in the basement, according to a lawyer for Heuermann's wife.\n\nThat followed a search in April of a wooded area in Manorville, about 40 miles (65 kilometers) east of Heuermann's home, and in the Southampton hamlet of North Sea, where Costilla's remains were discovered decades ago.\n\nTierney said the planning document was recovered in March, providing the impetus for the recent searches.\n\nProsecutors also said they found a book in Heuermann's possession by the retired FBI agent John Douglas, \"The Cases That Haunt Us.\" They say the planning document referenced specific pages in another work by Douglas, \"Mind Hunter,\" that allude to the personality types of serial killers and profiles of those who use mutilation and sexual violence.\n\nJessica Taylor, 20, vanished in 2003 while working as an escort in New York City. Some of her remains were discovered in Manorville that year. Other remains were found during a 2011 search of the beach scrub by the side of Ocean Parkway, the road where the other Gilgo Beach victims were found.\n\nTaylor's mother, Elizabeth Baczkiel, was at the courthouse for Thursday's hearing. She held up childhood photos of her daughter but didn't speak to reporters. Her lawyer, Gloria Allred, read a statement from Baczkiel in which she described her daughter as \"loving, compassionate and so funny,\" and said she would have made a great mother.\n\n\"My darling daughter, you will never be forgotten,\" the statement said. \"You will forever be in our hearts.\"\n\nValerie Mack, 24, who had been working as an escort in Philadelphia, disappeared in 2000 and was last seen by her family in Port Republic, New Jersey, near Atlantic City. Some of her skeletal remains were discovered that year in the Manorville woods. More of her remains were found in 2011 during the search around Gilgo Beach.\n\nInitially known as \"Jane Doe No. 6,\" Mack's remains went unidentified until 2020, when genetic testing revealed her identity.\n\nCostilla was 28 when she was killed and had lived in New York City.\n\nA decade ago, Suffolk County prosecutors said publicly that they believed Costilla had been killed by John Bittrolff, an area carpenter who was convicted of murdering two other women whose bodies were found in the same part of Long Island.\n\nBut Bittrolff was never charged with Costilla's death due to lack of evidence. He insists he didn't kill anyone and his lawyers didn't immediately respond to phone and email messages seeking comment Thursday.\n\nHeuermann's lawyer, Brown, said he planned to request the prosecution's files on Bittrolff.\n\n\"Quite frankly, the police department and the district attorney's office all had the finger pointed at Bittrolff for that murder,\" he said. ___", "source": {"uri": "ktar.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "KTAR News"}, "authors": [{"uri": "associated_press@ktar.com", "name": "Associated Press", "type": "author", "isAgency": true}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jessica_Taylor", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jessica Taylor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long_Island", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Long Island"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Long Island"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Costilla_County,_Colorado", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Costilla County, Colorado"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Costilla County, Colorado"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gilgo,_New_York", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Gilgo, New York"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex_worker", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Sex worker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riverhead_(town),_New_York", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Riverhead (town), New York"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Riverhead (town), New York"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serial_killer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Serial killer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forensic_science", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Forensic science"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA_profiling", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "DNA profiling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arraignment", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Arraignment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawyer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lawyer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massapequa_Park,_New_York", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Massapequa Park, New York"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Massapequa Park, New York"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Press_conference", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Press conference"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barrier_island", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Barrier island"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bay", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bay"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acquittal", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Acquittal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Task_force", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Task force"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brown_University", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Brown University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/District_attorney", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "District attorney"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bail", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bail"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_phone", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mobile phone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oak_Beach,_New_York", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Oak Beach, New York"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Oak Beach, New York"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manorville,_New_York", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Manorville, New York"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Manorville, New York"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Bittrolff", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "John Bittrolff"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Administrative_divisions_of_New_York_(state)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Administrative divisions of New York (state)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_E._Douglas", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "John E.

(AP) -- The New York architect previously accused of killing four women and leaving their corpses scattered along a coastal highway was charged Thursday in the deaths of two more, after prosecutors said they gathered new DNA evidence and found a planning document he had used to \"blueprint\" his crimes.\n\nRex Heuermann, 60, appeared before a judge on the eastern end of Long Island to face charges that he killed Jessica Taylor and Sandra Costilla, two young women who were long suspected of being the victims of men preying on sex workers.\n\nTaylor disappeared in 2003. Costilla was killed in 1993. The new charges came just days after police finished extensive searches of Heuermann's Massapequa Park home and a wooded area on Long Island tied to the investigation of a string of deaths known as the Gilgo Beach serial killings.\n\nIn a court filing, prosecutors said they were able to use new forensic testing methods to match hairs found on or near the vicinity of both victims to a DNA profile that is a likely match to Heuermann. Additionally, prosecutors say they recovered a \"planning document\" on a hard drive in his basement used to \"methodically blueprint\" his killings.\n\nThe all-caps document features a series of checklists with tasks to complete before, during and after the killings, as well as practical lessons for \"next time.\" Among the dozens of entries written are reminders to clean the bodies and destroy evidence, to \"get sleep before hunt\" and to \"have story set.\"\n\nOne section, titled \"things to remember,\" appears to highlight lessons from previous killings, prosecutors said, such as using heavier rope and limiting noise in order to maximize \"play time.\" A \"body prep\" checklist includes, among other items, a note to \"remove head and hands.\"\n\nProsecutors believe that entry may connect Heuermann to yet another victim, Valerie Mack, whose partial skeletal remains were discovered near the body of Taylor after her disappearance in 2000.\n\nHeuermann has not been charged in the death of Mack. But asked during a news conference after Thursday's hearing if he was a suspect, District Attorney Ray Tierney replied, \"That's fair to say.\"\n\nHe added that investigators are still working the case, noting that the \"method of the crime scene\" in Mack's killing was consistent with those of the other victims.\n\nHeuermann pleaded not guilty to killing Taylor and Costilla during the hearing and was ordered held without bail.\n\nAfterward, Tierney said the new charges provide \"some small measure of closure\" for the victims' families.\n\nThe charges involving Costilla, who was killed 30 years ago, indicate that prosecutors believe Heuermann was killing victims for much longer longer than previously thought. Unlike the other victims, Costilla's remains were not among those discovered at Gilgo Beach, but were found in a wooded area in Southampton, Long Island.\n\nSince late 2010, police have been investigating the deaths of at least 10 people -- mostly female sex workers -- whose remains were discovered along an isolated highway not far from Gilgo Beach on Long Island's south shore.\n\nThe victims had disappeared over a span of at least 14 years. Vexed police officers made only halting progress in identifying possible suspects. Investigators long said it was likely that not all of the deaths were the work of the same killer. Some of the victims disappeared in the mid-1990s. Investigators concluded that an 11th person who disappeared in 2010 from the barrier island community of Oak Beach had accidentally drowned.\n\nHeuermann, who lived across a bay from where the bodies were found, was arrested last July. Prosecutors said a new investigative task force used mobile phone location data and DNA samples to link the architect to some of the victims. He was charged with killing four of the women: Megan Waterman, Melissa Barthelemy, Amber Lynn Costello and Maureen Brainard-Barnes.\n\nInvestigators who had searched Heuermann's home extensively and dug up his yard last summer returned to the house again last month and spent nearly a week searching it again. They focused their efforts mostly in the basement, according to a lawyer for Heuermann's wife.\n\nThat followed a search in April of a wooded area in Manorville, about 40 miles (65 kilometers) east of Heuermann's home, linked to another Gilgo Beach victim.\n\nTierney said the planning document was recovered in March of this year, providing the impetus for the recent searches at the suspect's home and in Manorville.\n\nProsecutors also said they found a book in Heuermann's possession by the retired FBI agent John Douglas, \"The Cases That Haunt Us.\" They say the planning document referenced specific pages in another work by Douglas, \"Mind Hunter,\" that allude to the personality types of serial killers and profiles of those who use mutilation and sexual violence.\n\nJessica Taylor, 20, vanished in 2003 while working as an escort in New York City. Some of her remains were discovered in Manorville that year. Other remains were found in a 2011 search of the beach scrub by the side of Ocean Parkway, the road where the other Gilgo Beach victims were found.\n\nValerie Mack, 24, who had been working as an escort in Philadelphia, disappeared in 2000 and was last seen by her family in Port Republic, New Jersey, near Atlantic City. Some of her skeletal remains were discovered that same year in the Manorville woods. More of her remains were found in 2011 in the search around Gilgo Beach.\n\nInitially known as \"Jane Doe No. 6,\" Mack's remains had been unidentified for years until genetic testing revealed her identity in 2020.\n\nInvestigators in April also spent days searching a property in the eastern Long Island hamlet of North Sea, where Costilla's body was discovered in 1993. Costilla was 28 when she was killed and had lived in New York City.\n\nA decade ago, Suffolk County prosecutors said publicly that they believed Costilla had been killed by a carpenter who lived in the area, John Bittrolff, who was convicted of murdering two other women whose bodies had been found on the same part of Long Island. But Bittrolff was never charged with Costilla's death due to lack of evidence. He insists he is innocent of any murders.\n\nHeuermann's lawyer and the lawyers separately representing his wife and two adult children declined to comment.\n\nHeuermann, who has been in custody since his arrest, has pleaded not guilty. He had been set to return to court on July 30 for a status hearing. No trial date has been set.\n\nFollow Philip Marcelo at twitter.com/philmarcelo.", "source": {"uri": "wtnh.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "WTNH"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gilgo,_New_York", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gilgo, New York"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA_profiling", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "DNA profiling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long_Island", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Long Island"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Long Island"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Costilla_County,_Colorado", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Costilla County, Colorado"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Costilla County, Colorado"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex_worker", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Sex worker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riverhead_(town),_New_York", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Riverhead (town), New York"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Riverhead (town), New York"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serial_killer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Serial killer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forensic_science", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Forensic science"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massapequa_Park,_New_York", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Massapequa Park, New York"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Massapequa Park, New York"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Press_conference", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Press conference"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southampton,_New_York", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Southampton, New York"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Southampton, New York"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barrier_island", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Barrier island"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crime_scene", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Crime scene"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bay", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bay"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acquittal", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Acquittal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/District_attorney", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "District attorney"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bail", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bail"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oak_Beach,_New_York", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Oak Beach, New York"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Oak Beach, New York"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manorville,_New_York", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Manorville, New York"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Manorville, New York"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Bittrolff", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "John Bittrolff"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Administrative_divisions_of_New_York_(state)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Administrative divisions of New York (state)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_E._Douglas", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "John E.

The new charges came just days after police finished extensive searches of Heuermann's Massapequa Park home and a wooded area on Long Island tied to the investigation of a string of deaths known as the Gilgo Beach serial killings.\n\nIn a court filing, prosecutors said they were able to use new forensic testing methods to match hairs found on or near the vicinity of both victims to a DNA profile that is a likely match to Heuermann. Additionally, prosecutors say they discovered a \"planning document\" on the hard drive found in his basement used to \"methodically blueprint\" his killings.\n\nRelated\n\nFor the first time, daughter of Long Island serial killer victim from Maine speaks out\n\nThe document lays out a set of tasks to complete before, during and after killings, including checking the weather and setting up a staging area. It also has a place to note practical lessons for \"next time.\"\n\nOne section, titled \"BODY PREP,\" includes guidance to \"REMOVE HEAD AND HANDS,\" as well as tattoos and trace DNA, and to wash the bodies. Another section, \"THINGS TO REMEMBER,\" appears to highlight lessons from previous killings that should be heeded, according to prosecutors. The entries describe the importance of sleeping properly \"BEFORE HUNT,\" using thick rope, and limiting noise to increase \"PLAY TIME.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHeuermann pleaded not guilty at the court hearing and was ordered held without bail.\n\nSuffolk County District Attorney Ray Tierney planned to hold a news conference following the court hearing.\n\nThe charges involving Costilla, who was killed 30 years ago, indicate that prosecutors believe Heuermann was killing victims for much longer longer than previously thought. Prosecutors say one entry in the planning documents suggested he was involved in the death of another woman, Valerie Mack, who was found dismembered in the same vicinity as Taylor. Heuermann has not been charged in the death of Mack, who disappeared in 2000.\n\nSince late 2010, police have been investigating the deaths of at least 10 people - mostly female sex workers - whose remains were discovered along an isolated highway not far from Gilgo Beach on Long Island's south shore.\n\nThe victims had disappeared over a span of at least 14 years. Vexed police officers made only halting progress in identifying possible suspects. Investigators long said it was likely that not all of the deaths were the work of the same killer. Some of the victims disappeared in the mid-1990s. Investigators concluded that an 11th person who disappeared in 2010 from the barrier island community of Oak Beach had accidentally drowned.\n\nHeuermann, who lived across a bay from where the bodies were found, was arrested last July. Prosecutors said a new investigative task force used mobile phone location data and DNA samples to link the architect to some of the victims. He was charged with killing four of the women: Megan Waterman of Scarborough, Melissa Barthelemy, Amber Lynn Costello and Maureen Brainard-Barnes.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nInvestigators who had searched Heuermann's home extensively and dug up his yard last summer returned to the house again last month and spent nearly a week searching it again. They focused their efforts mostly in the basement, according to a lawyer for Heuermann's wife.\n\nThat followed a search in April of a wooded area in Manorville, about 40 miles east of Heuermann's home, linked to another Gilgo Beach victim.\n\nIn addition to the hard drive, prosecutors say they found a book in Heuermann's possession by the retired FBI agent John Douglas, \"The Cases That Haunt Us.\" They say the planning document also referenced specific pages in another work by Douglas, \"Mind Hunter,\" that allude to the personality types of serial killers and personality profiles of those who use mutilation and sexual violence.\n\nJessica Taylor, 20, vanished in 2003 while working as an escort in New York City. Some of her remains were discovered in Manorville that year. Other remains were found in a 2011 search of the beach scrub by the side of Ocean Parkway, the road where the other Gilgo Beach victims were found.\n\nInvestigators in April also spent days searching a property in the eastern Long Island hamlet of North Sea, where the Costilla's body was discovered in 1993. Costilla was 28 when she was killed and had lived in New York City.\n\nA decade ago, Suffolk County prosecutors said publicly that they believed Costilla had been killed by a carpenter who lived in the area, John Bittrolff, who was convicted of murdering two other women whose bodies had been found on the same part of Long Island. But Bittrolff was never charged with Costilla's death due to lack of evidence. He insists he is innocent of any murders.\n\nHeuermann's lawyer and the lawyers separately representing his wife and two adult children declined to comment.\n\nHeuermann, who has been in custody since his arrest, has pleaded not guilty. He had been set to return to court on July 30 for a status hearing. No trial date has been set.\n\nCopy the Story Link\n\nRelated Headlines\n\nFor the first time, daughter of Long Island serial killer victim from Maine speaks out\n\nComments are not available on this story.\n\nSend questions/comments to the editors.\n\n\" Previous\n\nBiden calls for solidarity with Ukraine on 80th anniversary of D-Day\n\nRelated Stories\n\nLatest Articles", "source": {"uri": "pressherald.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Portland Press Herald"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gilgo,_New_York", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gilgo, New York"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riverhead_(town),_New_York", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Riverhead (town), New York"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Riverhead (town), New York"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serial_killer", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Serial killer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA_profiling", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "DNA profiling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long_Island", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Long Island"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Long Island"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Costilla_County,_Colorado", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Costilla County, Colorado"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Costilla County, Colorado"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex_worker", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Sex worker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forensic_science", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Forensic science"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newsday", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Newsday"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Associated Press"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massapequa_Park,_New_York", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Massapequa Park, New York"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Massapequa Park, New York"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Press_conference", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Press conference"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long_Island_serial_killer", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Long Island serial killer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barrier_island", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Barrier island"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dismemberment", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dismemberment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acquittal", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Acquittal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "DNA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/District_attorney", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "District attorney"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tattoo", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tattoo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bail", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bail"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suffolk_County,_New_York", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Suffolk County, New York"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Suffolk County, New York"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oak_Beach,_New_York", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Oak Beach, New York"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Oak Beach, New York"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maine", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Maine"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Maine"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Bittrolff", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "John Bittrolff"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Administrative_divisions_of_New_York_(state)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Administrative divisions of New York (state)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_E._Douglas", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "John E.

(AP) -- The New York architect accused of murdering multiple women and leaving their corpses scattered along the Long Island coast kept a \"blueprint\" of his crimes on his computer, prosecutors revealed Thursday as they brought charges against Rex Heuermann in two more killings.\n\nHeuermann, 60, appeared before a judge to be arraigned in the deaths of Jessica Taylor and Sandra Costilla, two young women who were long suspected of being the victims of men preying on sex workers. He had previously been charged with murdering four other women in a string of deaths known as the Gilgo Beach serial killings.\n\nTaylor disappeared in 2003. Costilla was killed 30 years ago, in 1993, and her inclusion in the case indicates that prosecutors now believe Heuermann was killing women for much longer than previously thought.\n\nThe new charges came just days after police finished extensive searches of Heuermann's Massapequa Park home and a wooded area on Long Island tied to the investigation.\n\nIn a court filing, prosecutors said they were able to use new forensic testing methods to match hairs found on or near the vicinity of both victims to a DNA profile that is a likely match to Heuermann. Additionally, prosecutors say they recovered a file on a hard drive in his basement used to \"methodically blueprint\" his killings.\n\nThe all-caps document features a series of checklists with tasks to complete before, during and after the killings, as well as practical lessons for \"next time.\" Among the dozens of entries written are reminders to clean the bodies and destroy evidence, to \"get sleep before hunt\" and to \"have story set.\"\n\nOne section, titled \"things to remember,\" appears to highlight lessons from previous killings, prosecutors said, such as using heavier rope and limiting noise in order to maximize \"play time.\" A \"body prep\" checklist includes, among other items, a note to \"remove head and hands.\"\n\nProsecutors believe that entry may connect Heuermann to yet another victim, Valerie Mack, whose partial skeletal remains were discovered near the body of Taylor after her disappearance in 2000.\n\nHeuermann has not been charged in the death of Mack. But asked during a news conference after Thursday's hearing if he was a suspect, District Attorney Ray Tierney replied, \"That's fair to say.\"\n\nHeuermann pleaded not guilty to killing Taylor and Costilla during the hearing and was ordered held without bail. His lawyer, Michael Brown, said outside court that Heuermann is \"obviously in a bad place in terms of the new charges.\"\n\nAfterward, Tierney said the additional charges provide \"some small measure of closure\" for the victims' families.\n\nSince late 2010, police have been investigating the deaths of at least 10 people -- mostly female sex workers -- whose remains were discovered along an isolated highway not far from Gilgo Beach on Long Island's south shore.\n\nThose victims had disappeared over a span of at least 14 years. Vexed police officers made only halting progress in identifying possible suspects. Investigators long said it was likely that not all of the deaths were the work of the same killer. Some of the victims disappeared in the mid-1990s. Investigators concluded that an 11th person who disappeared in 2010 from the barrier island community of Oak Beach had accidentally drowned.\n\nHeuermann, who lived across a bay from where the bodies were found, was arrested last July. Prosecutors said a new investigative task force used mobile phone location data and DNA samples to link the architect to some of the victims. He was charged with killing four of the women: Megan Waterman, Melissa Barthelemy, Amber Lynn Costello and Maureen Brainard-Barnes.\n\nInvestigators who had searched Heuermann's home extensively and dug up his yard last summer returned to the house again last month and spent nearly a week searching it again. They focused their efforts mostly in the basement, according to a lawyer for Heuermann's wife.\n\nThat followed a search in April of a wooded area in Manorville, about 40 miles (65 kilometers) east of Heuermann's home, and in the Southampton hamlet of North Sea, where Costilla's remains were discovered decades ago.\n\nTierney said the planning document was recovered in March of this year, providing the impetus for the recent searches.\n\nProsecutors also said they found a book in Heuermann's possession by the retired FBI agent John Douglas, \"The Cases That Haunt Us.\" They say the planning document referenced specific pages in another work by Douglas, \"Mind Hunter,\" that allude to the personality types of serial killers and profiles of those who use mutilation and sexual violence.\n\nJessica Taylor, 20, vanished in 2003 while working as an escort in New York City. Some of her remains were discovered in Manorville that year. Other remains were found in a 2011 search of the beach scrub by the side of Ocean Parkway, the road where the other Gilgo Beach victims were found.\n\nTaylor's mother, Elizabeth Baczkiel, was at the courthouse for Thursday's court hearing. She held up childhood photos of her daughter but didn't speak to reporters. Her lawyer, Gloria Allred, read a statement from Baczkiel in which she described her daughter as \"loving, compassionate and so funny,\" and said she would have made a great mother.\n\n\"My darling daughter, you will never be forgotten,\" the statement said. \"You will forever be in our hearts.\"\n\nValerie Mack, 24, who had been working as an escort in Philadelphia, disappeared in 2000 and was last seen by her family in Port Republic, New Jersey, near Atlantic City. Some of her skeletal remains were discovered that same year in the Manorville woods. More of her remains were found in 2011 in the search around Gilgo Beach.\n\nInitially known as \"Jane Doe No. 6,\" Mack's remains had been unidentified for years until genetic testing revealed her identity in 2020.\n\nCostilla was 28 when she was killed and had lived in New York City.\n\nA decade ago, Suffolk County prosecutors said publicly that they believed Costilla had been killed by a carpenter who lived in the area, John Bittrolff, who was convicted of murdering two other women whose bodies had been found on the same part of Long Island. But Bittrolff was never charged with Costilla's death due to lack of evidence. He insists he is innocent of any murders.\n\nHeuermann's lawyer, Brown, said he planned to request the prosecution's files on Bittrolff.\n\n\"Quite frankly, the police department and the district attorney's office all had the finger pointed at Bittrolff for that murder,\" he said. ___", "source": {"uri": "delcotimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Delaware County Daily Times"}, "authors": [{"uri": "associated_press@delcotimes.com", "name": "Associated Press", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jessica_Taylor", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jessica Taylor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long_Island", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Long Island"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Long Island"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Costilla_County,_Colorado", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Costilla County, Colorado"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Costilla County, Colorado"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gilgo,_New_York", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Gilgo, New York"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex_worker", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Sex worker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riverhead_(town),_New_York", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Riverhead (town), New York"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Riverhead (town), New York"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serial_killer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Serial killer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forensic_science", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Forensic science"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA_profiling", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "DNA profiling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arraignment", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Arraignment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawyer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lawyer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massapequa_Park,_New_York", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Massapequa Park, New York"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Massapequa Park, New York"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Press_conference", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Press conference"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barrier_island", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Barrier island"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bay", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bay"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acquittal", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Acquittal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Task_force", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Task force"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brown_University", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Brown University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/District_attorney", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "District attorney"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bail", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bail"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_phone", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mobile phone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oak_Beach,_New_York", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Oak Beach, New York"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Oak Beach, New York"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manorville,_New_York", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Manorville, New York"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Manorville, New York"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Bittrolff", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "John Bittrolff"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Administrative_divisions_of_New_York_(state)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Administrative divisions of New York (state)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_E._Douglas", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "John E.

He was previously facing charges in four other murders and has pleaded not guilty in those cases.\n\nThursday's court appearance comes after investigators scoured the Manorville Pine Barrens in April. The partial remains of Valerie Mack were discovered there in 2000, and three years later, partial remains belonging to Jessica Taylor were also found in the area. Additional remains of Mack and Taylor, who both worked as escorts, were found near Gilgo Beach.\n\nAround the same time in April, the search led investigators to North Sea, a hamlet in Southampton, where Sandra Costilla was found dead in 1993. Prosecutors previously linked her death to Manorville carpenter John Bittrolff, who was later convicted of killing two other women.\n\nInvestigators then returned to Heuermann's Massapequa Park home in May to look for new evidence. Law enforcement previously seized hundreds of electronic devices from the home, some which, court documents suggest, Heuermann allegedly used to contact and research sex workers. Investigators also seized nearly 300 guns from the home and were seen digging in the backyard in the days following Heuermann's July 2023 arrest.\n\nSuffolk County District Attorney Ray Tierney is expected to share more details about the new charges around 11 a.m.\n\nHeuermann was arrested on July 14, 2023 and charged with the murders of Melissa Barthelemy, Megan Waterman and Amber Costello. In January, new charges were filed against him in connection to the murder of Maureen Brainard-Barnes.\n\nThe four women's remains were found in shallow graves near Gilgo Beach in 2010. All four were sex workers who went missing between 2007-2010.\n\nProsecutors said DNA evidence and burner phones tied Heuermann to the murders. Heuermann is being held without bail and has been behind bars for nearly a year.\n\nThe remains of 11 people were found near Gilgo Beach between 1996-2011.", "source": {"uri": "cbsnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CBS News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riverhead_(town),_New_York", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Riverhead (town), New York"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Riverhead (town), New York"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gilgo,_New_York", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Gilgo, New York"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manorville,_New_York", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Manorville, New York"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Manorville, New York"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acquittal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Acquittal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long_Island", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Long Island"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Long Island"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suffolk_County,_New_York", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Suffolk County, New York"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Suffolk County, New York"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Bittrolff", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "John Bittrolff"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Administrative_divisions_of_New_York_(state)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Administrative divisions of New York (state)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Sea", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "North Sea"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_enforcement", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Law enforcement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massapequa_Park,_New_York", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Massapequa Park, New York"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Massapequa Park, New York"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southampton", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Southampton"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Southampton"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex_worker", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sex worker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA_profiling", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "DNA profiling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/District_attorney", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "District attorney"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bail", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bail"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Murder"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Murder", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Murder", "wgt": 24}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Unsolved", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Unsolved", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Party_Games/Murder_Mystery", "label": "dmoz/Games/Party Games/Murder Mystery", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 53}], "image": "https://assets1.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2024/04/17/31f830fd-8ff5-4bbd-b008-a945e0839294/thumbnail/1200x630/804f1b730f214e59ba4e7bcabd40dde6/6t5a0593.jpg?v=6d480a252670b63de1e37fef02c977a5", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9620887", "eventUri": "eng-9620887", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Riverhead (town), New York"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2014-07-", "textStart": 1509, "textEnd": 1516}], "sentiment": -0.3019607843137255, "wgt": 207, "relevance": 1}

Taylor disappeared in the early 2000s. Costilla was killed in 1993. The new charges came just days after police finished extensive searches of Heuermann's Massapequa Park home and a wooded area on Long Island tied to the investigation of a string of deaths known as the Gilgo Beach serial killings.\n\nSuffolk County District Attorney Ray Tierney planned to hold a news conference following the court hearing.\n\nSince late 2010, police have been investigating the deaths of at least 10 people -- mostly female sex workers -- whose remains were discovered along an isolated highway not far from Gilgo Beach on Long Island's south shore.\n\nThe victims had disappeared over a span of at least 14 years. Vexed police officers made only halting progress in identifying possible suspects. Investigators long said it was likely that not all of the deaths were the work of the same killer. Some of the victims disappeared in the mid-1990s. Investigators concluded that an 11th person who disappeared in 2010 from the barrier island community of Oak Beach had accidentally drowned.\n\nHeuermann, who lived across a bay from where the bodies were found, was arrested last July. Prosecutors said a new investigative task force used mobile phone location data and DNA samples to link the architect to some of the victims. He was charged with killing four of the women: Megan Waterman, Melissa Barthelemy, Amber Lynn Costello and Maureen Brainard-Barnes.\n\nInvestigators who had searched Heuermann's home extensively and dug up his yard last summer returned to the house again last month and spent nearly a week searching it again. They focused their efforts mostly in the basement, according to a lawyer for Heuermann's wife.\n\nThat followed a search in April of a wooded area in Manorville, about 40 miles (65 kilometers) east of Heuermann's home, linked to another Gilgo Beach victim.\n\nJessica Taylor, 20, vanished in 2003 while working as an escort in New York City. Some of her remains were discovered in Manorville that year. Other remains were found in a 2011 search of the beach scrub by the side of Ocean Parkway, the road where the other Gilgo Beach victims were found.\n\nInvestigators in April also spent days searching a property in the eastern Long Island hamlet of North Sea, where the Costilla's body was discovered in 1993. Costilla was 28 when she was killed and had lived in New York City.\n\nA decade ago, Suffolk County prosecutors said publicly that they believed Costilla had been killed by a carpenter who lived in the area, John Bittrolff, who was convicted of murdering two other women whose bodies had been found on the same part of Long Island. But Bittrolff was never charged with Costilla's death due to lack of evidence. He insists he is innocent of any murders.\n\nHeuermann's lawyer and the lawyers separately representing his wife and two adult children declined to comment.\n\nHeuermann, who has been in custody since his arrest, has pleaded not guilty. He had been set to return to court on June 18 for a status hearing.

The partial remains of Valerie Mack were discovered there in 2000, and three years later, partial remains belonging to Jessica Taylor were also found in the area. Additional remains of Mack and Taylor, who both worked as escorts, were found near Gilgo Beach.\n\nAround the same time in April, the search led investigators to North Sea, a hamlet in Southampton, where Sandra Costilla was found dead in 1993. Prosecutors previously linked her death to Manorville carpenter John Bittrolff, who was later convicted of killing two other women.\n\nInvestigators then returned to Heuermann's Massapequa Park home in May to look for new evidence. Law enforcement previously seized hundreds of electronic devices from the home, some which, court documents suggest, Heuermann allegedly used to contact and research sex workers. Investigators also seized nearly 300 guns from the home and were seen digging in the backyard in the days following Heuermann's July 2023 arrest.\n\nSuffolk County District Attorney Ray Tierney is expected to share more details about the new charges following the hearing around 11 a.m.\n\nRex Heuermann charged in connection to Gilgo Beach murders\n\nHeuermann was arrested on July 14, 2023 and charged with the murders of Melissa Barthelemy, Megan Waterman and Amber Costello.

All four were sex workers who went missing between 2007-2010.\n\nProsecutors said DNA evidence and burner phones tied Heuermann to the murders. Heuermann is being held without bail and has been behind bars for nearly a year.\n\nThe remains of 11 people were found near Gilgo Beach between 1996-2011.", "source": {"uri": "cbsnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CBS News"}, "authors": [{"uri": "katie_houlis@cbsnews.com", "name": "Katie Houlis", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gilgo,_New_York", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Gilgo, New York"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manorville,_New_York", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Manorville, New York"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Manorville, New York"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riverhead_(town),_New_York", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Riverhead (town), New York"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Riverhead (town), New York"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acquittal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Acquittal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suffolk_County,_New_York", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Suffolk County, New York"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Suffolk County, New York"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Bittrolff", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "John Bittrolff"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Administrative_divisions_of_New_York_(state)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Administrative divisions of New York (state)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex_worker", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sex worker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Sea", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "North Sea"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_enforcement", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Law enforcement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massapequa_Park,_New_York", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Massapequa Park, New York"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Massapequa Park, New York"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southampton", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Southampton"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Southampton"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA_profiling", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "DNA profiling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/District_attorney", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "District attorney"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bail", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bail"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Murder"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Murder", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Murder", "wgt": 24}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Unsolved", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Unsolved", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Law", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Law", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Party_Games/Murder_Mystery", "label": "dmoz/Games/Party Games/Murder Mystery", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 61}], "image": "https://assets1.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2024/04/17/31f830fd-8ff5-4bbd-b008-a945e0839294/thumbnail/1200x630/804f1b730f214e59ba4e7bcabd40dde6/6t5a0593.jpg?v=6d480a252670b63de1e37fef02c977a5", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9620887", "eventUri": "eng-9620887", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2014-07-", "textStart": 1461, "textEnd": 1468}], "sentiment": -0.2862745098039216, "wgt": 205, "relevance": 1}

He has pleaded not guilty to all murder charges and is being held without bail.\n\nHis attorney, Michael Brown, told reporters in January that Heuermann maintains his innocence and is looking forward to fighting the charges.\n\nCNN affiliate WABC reported police recently searched Long Island's Manorville and North Sea in connection with the investigation, where the remains of three women were found years ago.\n\nInvestigators uncovered evidence in the searches of Manorville and Heuermann's home earlier this year that helped advance the investigation, according to the law enforcement sources.\n\nThe remains of Taylor and Mack were found in Manorville, according to police. Manorville, a community in eastern Long Island, is about 40 miles northeast of where the bodies of the \"Gilgo Four\" were discovered.\n\nMack was a 24-year-old Philadelphia mother who went missing in 2000 and whose partial remains were discovered in the Manorville woods later that year. More remains that matched her DNA were recovered along the marshy area of Gilgo Beach in 2011.\n\nartial remains belonging to 20-year-old Taylor were found in Manorville in 2003, and additional remains were found on Gilgo Beach in 2011.\n\nJohn Ray, a lawyer who represents Taylor's family, previously said he did not know whether Heuermann was connected to Taylor's death.\n\nThe search in North Sea - roughly 65 miles northeast of Gilgo Beach - was related to the unsolved murder of 28-year-old Sandra Costilla, whose body was found in a wooded area of North Sea in 1993, the law enforcement sources told CNN. Suffolk County Police are investigating to see if Costilla's murder is connected to Heuermann, the sources said.\n\nAfter Heuermann's arrest last summer, police said the investigation was far from over. They zeroed in on the Massapequa home where he had lived quietly for years with his wife, daughter and stepson.\n\nInvestigators used police dogs and ground-penetrating radar to search the home in July, uncovering over 280 firearms, more than 40 of which were possessed illegally, police said.\n\nAuthorities also looked into areas in Las Vegas and South Carolina where Heuermann owned property.\n\nTierney told reporters last summer that investigators were working with \"a flood of evidence.\"\n\nA few weeks ago, police once again searched the Massapequa home and were seen carrying boxes out of the house. Robert Macedonia, the attorney of Heuermann's estranged wife Asa Ellerup, confirmed that police had a warrant for the search.\n\nEllerup filed for divorce days after Heuermann's arrest last year, but still visits him weekly, according to a statement released by her attorneys in March.\n\nShe maintains that Heuermann is not capable of the crimes he's accused of, the statement said, adding that her sympathies go out to the victims and their families.\n\n\"Nobody deserves to die in that manner,\" Ellerup said in the statement.\n\nThe-CNN-Wire\n\n\u2122 & \u00a9 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

(AP) -- The New York architect previously accused of killing four women and leaving their corpses scattered along a coastal highway was charged Thursday in the deaths of two more women.\n\nRex Heuermann, 60, was set to appear before a judge to face charges that he killed Jessica Taylor and Sandra Costilla, two young women who were long suspected of being the victims of men preying on sex workers.\n\nTaylor disappeared in 2003. Costilla was killed in 1993. The new charges came just days after police finished extensive searches of Heuermann's Massapequa Park home and a wooded area on Long Island tied to the investigation of a string of deaths known as the Gilgo Beach serial killings.\n\nIn a court filing, prosecutors said were able to use new forensic testing methods to match hairs found on or near the vicinity of both victims to a DNA profile that is a likely match to Heuermann. Additionally, prosecutors say they discovered a \"planning document\" on the hard drive found in his basement used to \"methodically blueprint\" his killings.\n\nThe document includes Heuermann's concerns about leaving behind forensic evidence, guidance for cleaning and washing bodies, and notes on how to improve \"next time,\" according to the bail application\n\nSuffolk County District Attorney Ray Tierney planned to hold a news conference following the court hearing.\n\nThe charges involving Costilla, who was killed 30 years ago, indicate that prosecutors believe Heuermann was killing victims for much longer longer than previously thought.\n\nSince late 2010, police have been investigating the deaths of at least 10 people -- mostly female sex workers -- whose remains were discovered along an isolated highway not far from Gilgo Beach on Long Island's south shore.\n\nThe victims had disappeared over a span of at least 14 years. Vexed police officers made only halting progress in identifying possible suspects. Investigators long said it was likely that not all of the deaths were the work of the same killer. Some of the victims disappeared in the mid-1990s. Investigators concluded that an 11th person who disappeared in 2010 from the barrier island community of Oak Beach had accidentally drowned.\n\nHeuermann, who lived across a bay from where the bodies were found, was arrested last July. Prosecutors said a new investigative task force used mobile phone location data and DNA samples to link the architect to some of the victims. He was charged with killing four of the women: Megan Waterman, Melissa Barthelemy, Amber Lynn Costello and Maureen Brainard-Barnes.\n\nInvestigators who had searched Heuermann's home extensively and dug up his yard last summer returned to the house again last month and spent nearly a week searching it again. They focused their efforts mostly in the basement, according to a lawyer for Heuermann's wife.\n\nThat followed a search in April of a wooded area in Manorville, about 40 miles (65 kilometers) east of Heuermann's home, linked to another Gilgo Beach victim.\n\nJessica Taylor, 20, vanished in 2003 while working as an escort in New York City. Some of her remains were discovered in Manorville that year. Other remains were found in a 2011 search of the beach scrub by the side of Ocean Parkway, the road where the other Gilgo Beach victims were found.\n\nInvestigators in April also spent days searching a property in the eastern Long Island hamlet of North Sea, where the Costilla's body was discovered in 1993. Costilla was 28 when she was killed and had lived in New York City.\n\nA decade ago, Suffolk County prosecutors said publicly that they believed Costilla had been killed by a carpenter who lived in the area, John Bittrolff, who was convicted of murdering two other women whose bodies had been found on the same part of Long Island. But Bittrolff was never charged with Costilla's death due to lack of evidence. He insists he is innocent of any murders.\n\nHeuermann's lawyer and the lawyers separately representing his wife and two adult children declined to comment.\n\nHeuermann, who has been in custody since his arrest, has pleaded not guilty.

(AP) -- The New York architect previously accused of murdering four women and leaving their corpses scattered along a coastal highway was charged Thursday in the deaths of two more women.\n\nRex Heuermann, 60, was set to appear before a judge to face charges that he murdered Jessica Taylor and Sandra Costilla. Taylor disappeared in the early 2000s. Costilla was killed in 1993. The new charges came just days after police finished extensive searches of Heuermann's Massapequa Park home and a wooded area on Long Island tied to the investigation of a string of deaths known as the Gilgo Beach serial killings.\n\nSuffolk County District Attorney Ray Tierney planned to hold a news conference following the court hearing.\n\nSince late 2010, police have been investigating the deaths of at least 10 people -- mostly female sex workers -- whose remains were discovered along an isolated highway not far from Gilgo Beach on Long Island's south shore.\n\nThe victims had disappeared over a span of at least 14 years. Vexed police officers made only halting progress in identifying possible suspects. Investigators long said it was likely that not all of the deaths were the work of the same killer. Some of the victims disappeared in the mid-1990s. Investigators concluded that an 11th person who disappeared in 2010 from the barrier island community of Oak Beach had accidentally drowned.\n\nHeuermann, who lived across a bay from where the bodies were found, was arrested last July. Prosecutors said a new investigative task force used mobile phone location data and DNA samples to link the architect to some of the victims. He was charged with killing four of the women: Megan Waterman, Melissa Barthelemy, Amber Lynn Costello and Maureen Brainard-Barnes.\n\nInvestigators who had searched Heuermann's home extensively and dug up his yard last summer returned to the house again last month and spent nearly a week searching it again. They focused their efforts mostly in the basement, according to a lawyer for Heuermann's wife.\n\nThat followed a search in April of a wooded area in Manorville, about 40 miles (65 kilometers) east of Heuermann's home, linked to another Gilgo Beach victim.\n\nJessica Taylor, 20, vanished in 2003 while working as an escort in New York City. Some of her remains were discovered in Manorville that year. Other remains were found in a 2011 search of the beach scrub by the side of Ocean Parkway, the road where the other Gilgo Beach victims were found.\n\nInvestigators in April also spent days searching a property in the eastern Long Island hamlet of North Sea, where the Costilla's body was discovered in 1993. Costilla was 28 when she was killed and had lived in New York City.\n\nA decade ago, Suffolk County prosecutors said publicly that they believed Costilla had been killed by a carpenter who lived in the area, John Bittrolff, who was convicted of murdering two other women whose bodies had been found on the same part of Long Island. But Bittrolff was never charged with Costilla's death due to lack of evidence. He insists he is innocent of any murders.\n\nHeuermann's lawyer and the lawyers separately representing his wife and two adult children declined to comment.\n\nHeuermann, who has been in custody since his arrest, has pleaded not guilty. He had been set to return to court on June 18 for a status hearing. No trial date has been set.\n\nFollow Philip Marcelo at twitter.com/philmarcelo.", "source": {"uri": "santamariatimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Santa Maria Times"}, "authors": [{"uri":

Prosecutors are planning a major announcement in the case as Heuermann is set to appear in criminal court on Long Island on Thursday, June 6, 2024. (James Carbone/Newsday via AP)RIVERHEAD, N.Y. (AP) - The New York architect previously accused of murdering four women and leaving their corpses scattered along a coastal highway was charged Thursday in the deaths of two more women. Rex Heuermann, 60, was set to appear before a judge to face charges that he murdered Jessica Taylor and Sandra Costilla. Taylor disappeared in the early 2000s. Costilla was killed in 1993. The new charges came just days after police finished extensive searches of Heuermann's Massapequa Park home and a wooded area on Long Island tied to the investigation of a string of deaths known as the Gilgo Beach serial killings. Suffolk County District Attorney Ray Tierney planned to hold a news conference following the court hearing. Since late 2010, police have been investigating the deaths of at least 10 people - mostly female sex workers - whose remains were discovered along an isolated highway not far from Gilgo Beach on Long Island's south shore. The victims had disappeared over a span of at least 14 years. Vexed police officers made only halting progress in identifying possible suspects. Investigators long said it was likely that not all of the deaths were the work of the same killer. Some of the victims disappeared in the mid-1990s. Investigators concluded that an 11th person who disappeared in 2010 from the barrier island community of Oak Beach had accidentally drowned. Heuermann, who lived across a bay from where the bodies were found, was arrested last July. Prosecutors said a new investigative task force used mobile phone location data and DNA samples to link the architect to some of the victims. He was charged with killing four of the women: Megan Waterman, Melissa Barthelemy, Amber Lynn Costello and Maureen Brainard-Barnes. Investigators who had searched Heuermann's home extensively and dug up his yard last summer returned to the house again last month and spent nearly a week searching it again. They focused their efforts mostly in the basement, according to a lawyer for Heuermann's wife. That followed a search in April of a wooded area in Manorville, about 40 miles (65 kilometers) east of Heuermann's home, linked to another Gilgo Beach victim. Jessica Taylor, 20, vanished in 2003 while working as an escort in New York City. Some of her remains were discovered in Manorville that year. Other remains were found in a 2011 search of the beach scrub by the side of Ocean Parkway, the road where the other Gilgo Beach victims were found. Investigators in April also spent days searching a property in the eastern Long Island hamlet of North Sea, where the Costilla's body was discovered in 1993. Costilla was 28 when she was killed and had lived in New York City. A decade ago, Suffolk County prosecutors said publicly that they believed Costilla had been killed by a carpenter who lived in the area, John Bittrolff, who was convicted of murdering two other women whose bodies had been found on the same part of Long Island. But Bittrolff was never charged with Costilla's death due to lack of evidence. He insists he is innocent of any murders. Heuermann's lawyer and the lawyers separately representing his wife and two adult children declined to comment. Heuermann, who has been in custody since his arrest, has pleaded not guilty. He had been set to return to court on June 18 for a status hearing. No trial date has been set. ___ Follow Philip Marcelo at twitter.com/philmarcelo.", "source": {"uri": "medicinehatnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Medicine Hat News"}, "authors": [{"uri":

AP's earlier story follows below.\n\nRIVERHEAD, N.Y. (AP) -- The New York architect previously accused of killing four women and leaving their corpses scattered along a coastal highway was charged Thursday in the deaths of two more women.\n\nRex Heuermann, 60, was set to appear before a judge to face charges that he killed Jessica Taylor and Sandra Costilla, two young women who were long suspected of being the victims of men preying on sex workers.\n\nTaylor disappeared in 2003. Costilla was killed in 1993. The new charges came just days after police finished extensive searches of Heuermann's Massapequa Park home and a wooded area on Long Island tied to the investigation of a string of deaths known as the Gilgo Beach serial killings.\n\nIn a court filing, prosecutors said were able to use new forensic testing methods to match hairs found on or near the vicinity of both victims to a DNA profile that is a likely match to Heuermann. Additionally, prosecutors say they discovered a \"planning document\" on the hard drive found in his basement used to \"methodically blueprint\" his killings.\n\nThe document includes Heuermann's concerns about leaving behind forensic evidence, guidance for cleaning and washing bodies, and notes on how to improve \"next time,\" according to the bail application\n\nSuffolk County District Attorney Ray Tierney planned to hold a news conference following the court hearing.\n\nThe charges involving Costilla, who was killed 30 years ago, indicate that prosecutors believe Heuermann was killing victims for much longer longer than previously thought.\n\nSince late 2010, police have been investigating the deaths of at least 10 people -- mostly female sex workers -- whose remains were discovered along an isolated highway not far from Gilgo Beach on Long Island's south shore.\n\nThe victims had disappeared over a span of at least 14 years. Vexed police officers made only halting progress in identifying possible suspects. Investigators long said it was likely that not all of the deaths were the work of the same killer. Some of the victims disappeared in the mid-1990s. Investigators concluded that an 11th person who disappeared in 2010 from the barrier island community of Oak Beach had accidentally drowned.\n\nHeuermann, who lived across a bay from where the bodies were found, was arrested last July. Prosecutors said a new investigative task force used mobile phone location data and DNA samples to link the architect to some of the victims. He was charged with killing four of the women: Megan Waterman, Melissa Barthelemy, Amber Lynn Costello and Maureen Brainard-Barnes.\n\nInvestigators who had searched Heuermann's home extensively and dug up his yard last summer returned to the house again last month and spent nearly a week searching it again. They focused their efforts mostly in the basement, according to a lawyer for Heuermann's wife.\n\nThat followed a search in April of a wooded area in Manorville, about 40 miles (65 kilometers) east of Heuermann's home, linked to another Gilgo Beach victim.\n\nJessica Taylor, 20, vanished in 2003 while working as an escort in New York City. Some of her remains were discovered in Manorville that year. Other remains were found in a 2011 search of the beach scrub by the side of Ocean Parkway, the road where the other Gilgo Beach victims were found.\n\nInvestigators in April also spent days searching a property in the eastern Long Island hamlet of North Sea, where the Costilla's body was discovered in 1993. Costilla was 28 when she was killed and had lived in New York City.\n\nA decade ago, Suffolk County prosecutors said publicly that they believed Costilla had been killed by a carpenter who lived in the area, John Bittrolff, who was convicted of murdering two other women whose bodies had been found on the same part of Long Island. But Bittrolff was never charged with Costilla's death due to lack of evidence. He insists he is innocent of any murders.\n\nHeuermann's lawyer and the lawyers separately representing his wife and two adult children declined to comment.\n\nHeuermann, who has been in custody since his arrest, has pleaded not guilty. He had been set to return to court on June 18 for a status hearing. No trial date has been set.\n\nFollow Philip Marcelo at twitter.com/philmarcelo.", "source": {"uri": "maryvilleforum.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Maryville Forum"}, "authors": [{"uri":

Additionally, prosecutors say they discovered a \"planning document\" on the hard drive found in his basement used to \"methodically blueprint\" his killings.\n\nThe document lays out a series of tasks to complete before, during and after the killings, as well as practical lessons for \"next time.\" Among the dozens of entries written in all caps are reminders to clean the bodies and destroy evidence, to \"get sleep before hunt\" and to \"have story set.\"\n\nOne section, titled \"things to remember,\" appears to highlight lessons from previous killings, prosecutors said, including the importance of using heavy rope and limiting noise in order to maximize \"play time.\"\n\nAnother section, \"body prep,\" includes notes to \"remove head and hands\" and \"packaging for transport.\" Prosecutors believe those notes relate to the condition of both Taylor and another victim who disappeared in 2000, Valerie Mack, whose partial remains were found discovered near the body of Taylor.\n\nHeuermann has not been charged in the death of Mack, but asked at a news conference after Thursday's hearing whether he is a suspect in Mack's death, District Attorney Ray Tierney replied: \"That's fair to say.\" He added that investigators are still working the case, noting that the \"method of the crime scene\" in Mack's killing was consistent with those of the other victims.\n\nHeuermann pleaded not guilty to killing Taylor and Costilla during the hearing and was ordered held without bail.\n\nAfterward, Tierney said the new charges provide \"some small measure of closure\" for the victims' families.\n\nThe charges involving Costilla, who was killed 30 years ago, indicate that prosecutors believe Heuermann was killing victims for much longer longer than previously thought. Unlike the other victims, Costilla's remains were not among those discovered at Gilgo Beach, but were found in a wooded area in Southampton, Long Island.\n\nSince late 2010, police have been investigating the deaths of at least 10 people -- mostly female sex workers -- whose remains were discovered along an isolated highway not far from Gilgo Beach on Long Island's south shore.\n\nThe victims had disappeared over a span of at least 14 years.

Some of her remains were discovered in Manorville that year. Other remains were found in a 2011 search of the beach scrub by the side of Ocean Parkway, the road where the other Gilgo Beach victims were found.\n\nValerie Mack, 24, who had been working as an escort in Philadelphia, disappeared in 2000 and was last seen by her family in Port Republic, New Jersey, near Atlantic City. Some of her skeletal remains were discovered that same year in the Manorville woods. More of her remains were found in 2011 in the search around Gilgo Beach.\n\nInitially known as \"Jane Doe No. 6,\" Mack's remains had been unidentified for years until genetic testing revealed her identity in 2020.\n\nInvestigators in April also spent days searching a property in the eastern Long Island hamlet of North Sea, where Costilla's body was discovered in 1993.

Taylor disappeared in the early 2000s. Costilla was killed in 1993. The new charges came just days after police finished extensive searches of Heuermann's Massapequa Park home and a wooded area on Long Island tied to the investigation of a string of deaths known as the Gilgo Beach serial killings.\n\nSuffolk County District Attorney Ray Tierney planned to hold a news conference following the court hearing.\n\nSince late 2010, police have been investigating the deaths of at least 10 people -- mostly female sex workers -- whose remains were discovered along an isolated highway not far from Gilgo Beach on Long Island's south shore.\n\nThe victims had disappeared over a span of at least 14 years. Vexed police officers made only halting progress in identifying possible suspects. Investigators long said it was likely that not all of the deaths were the work of the same killer. Some of the victims disappeared in the mid-1990s. Investigators concluded that an 11th person who disappeared in 2010 from the barrier island community of Oak Beach had accidentally drowned.\n\nHeuermann, who lived across a bay from where the bodies were found, was arrested last July. Prosecutors said a new investigative task force used mobile phone location data and DNA samples to link the architect to some of the victims. He was charged with killing four of the women: Megan Waterman, Melissa Barthelemy, Amber Lynn Costello and Maureen Brainard-Barnes.\n\nInvestigators who had searched Heuermann's home extensively and dug up his yard last summer returned to the house again last month and spent nearly a week searching it again. They focused their efforts mostly in the basement, according to a lawyer for Heuermann's wife.\n\nThat followed a search in April of a wooded area in Manorville, about 65 kilometres east of Heuermann's home, linked to another Gilgo Beach victim.\n\nJessica Taylor, 20, vanished in 2003 while working as an escort in New York City. Some of her remains were discovered in Manorville that year. Other remains were found in a 2011 search of the beach scrub by the side of Ocean Parkway, the road where the other Gilgo Beach victims were found.\n\nInvestigators in April also spent days searching a property in the eastern Long Island hamlet of North Sea, where the Costilla's body was discovered in 1993. Costilla was 28 when she was killed and had lived in New York City.\n\nA decade ago, Suffolk County prosecutors said publicly that they believed Costilla had been killed by a carpenter who lived in the area, John Bittrolff, who was convicted of murdering two other women whose bodies had been found on the same part of Long Island. But Bittrolff was never charged with Costilla's death due to lack of evidence. He insists he is innocent of any murders.\n\nHeuermann's lawyer and the lawyers separately representing his wife and two adult children declined to comment.\n\nHeuermann, who has been in custody since his arrest, has pleaded not guilty. He had been set to return to court on June 18 for a status hearing.

AP's earlier story follows below. RIVERHEAD, N.Y. (AP) - The New York architect previously accused of killing four women and leaving their corpses scattered along a coastal highway was charged Thursday in the deaths of two more women. Rex Heuermann, 60, was set to appear before a judge to face charges that he killed Jessica Taylor and Sandra Costilla, two young women who were long suspected of being the victims of men preying on sex workers. Taylor disappeared in 2003. Costilla was killed in 1993. The new charges came just days after police finished extensive searches of Heuermann's Massapequa Park home and a wooded area on Long Island tied to the investigation of a string of deaths known as the Gilgo Beach serial killings. In a court filing, prosecutors said were able to use new forensic testing methods to match hairs found on or near the vicinity of both victims to a DNA profile that is a likely match to Heuermann. Additionally, prosecutors say they discovered a \"planning document\"\u009d on the hard drive found in his basement used to \"methodically blueprint\"\u009d his killings. The document includes Heuermann's concerns about leaving behind forensic evidence, guidance for cleaning and washing bodies, and notes on how to improve \"next time,\"\u009d according to the bail application Suffolk County District Attorney Ray Tierney planned to hold a news conference following the court hearing. The charges involving Costilla, who was killed 30 years ago, indicate that prosecutors believe Heuermann was killing victims for much longer longer than previously thought. Since late 2010, police have been investigating the deaths of at least 10 people - mostly female sex workers - whose remains were discovered along an isolated highway not far from Gilgo Beach on Long Island's south shore. The victims had disappeared over a span of at least 14 years. Vexed police officers made only halting progress in identifying possible suspects. Investigators long said it was likely that not all of the deaths were the work of the same killer. Some of the victims disappeared in the mid-1990s.

Prosecutors said a new investigative task force used mobile phone location data and DNA samples to link the architect to some of the victims. He was charged with killing four of the women: Megan Waterman, Melissa Barthelemy, Amber Lynn Costello and Maureen Brainard-Barnes. Investigators who had searched Heuermann's home extensively and dug up his yard last summer returned to the house again last month and spent nearly a week searching it again. They focused their efforts mostly in the basement, according to a lawyer for Heuermann's wife. That followed a search in April of a wooded area in Manorville, about 40 miles (65 kilometers) east of Heuermann's home, linked to another Gilgo Beach victim. Jessica Taylor, 20, vanished in 2003 while working as an escort in New York City. Some of her remains were discovered in Manorville that year. Other remains were found in a 2011 search of the beach scrub by the side of Ocean Parkway, the road where the other Gilgo Beach victims were found. Investigators in April also spent days searching a property in the eastern Long Island hamlet of North Sea, where the Costilla's body was discovered in 1993.

He had previously been scheduled to return to court for a June 18 status hearing.\n\nThe new court date comes two weeks after investigators returned to Heuermann\u00b4s single-story home in Massapequa Park, where they had recovered a cache of weapons during an initial search following his arrest last summer. A date for Heuermann\u00b4s trial has not yet been set.\n\nDuring the most recent search, which lasted several days, investigators placed paint chips and other materials into evidence bags and removed a large rectangular object covered in a blue cloth.\n\nA spokesperson for the prosecutor's office would not say whether the upcoming hearing was related to the renewed search effort.\n\nIn April, authorities involved in the investigation also spent more than a week searching a wooded area in Manorville, fueling speculation that they were seeking new evidence linked to some of the additional six sets of remains that were discovered along Gilgo Beach more than a decade ago.\n\nHeuermann, 60, was arrested in July in the deaths of Melissa Barthelemy, Megan Waterman and Amber Costello. He was charged in January in the death of Maureen Brainard-Barnes.\n\nHis attorney, Michael Brown, has said his client maintains his innocence. He declined to comment on the nature of Thursday's hearing.\n\nThe case had vexed investigators since the remains of eleven people, most of them young women who had been sex workers, were found on a stretch of Gilgo Beach in 2010 and 2011. Authorities have said the investigation into the other victims remains ongoing.\n\nRobert Macedonio, a lawyer for Heuermann\u00b4s estranged wife, said the most recent search of the Massapequa Park home was primarily focused on the basement. He said the family was out of state when the search was conducted.\n\nHe declined to say what was taken from the home and said the family has not yet received the search warrant affidavit that would spell out their reasons for conducting the search.\n\nDuring the initial search of the home in July, authorities tore up a wooden deck and used an excavator to dig up the backyard, which they scanned for buried objects using specialized equipment.\n\nThe most recent search was far less disruptive, according to Macedonia.\n\nVess Mitev, a lawyer for Heuermann\u00b4s two adult children, said the family was closely monitoring the developments.\n\n\"The hearing is yet another mile marker in this macabre saga, where they continue to be unfortunate bystanders,\" he said in a text message.", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Mail Online"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gilgo,_New_York", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Gilgo, New York"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York (state)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riverhead_(town),_New_York", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Riverhead (town), New York"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Riverhead (town), New York"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suburb", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Suburb"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long_Island", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Long Island"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Long Island"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/District_attorney", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "District attorney"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suffolk_County,_New_York", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Suffolk County, New York"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Suffolk County, New York"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massapequa_Park,_New_York", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Massapequa Park, New York"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Massapequa Park, New York"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawyer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lawyer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manorville,_New_York", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Manorville, New York"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Manorville, New York"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex_worker", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sex worker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affidavit", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Affidavit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brown_University", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Brown University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Associated Press"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Search_warrant", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Search warrant"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Internet/Searching", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Internet/Searching", "wgt": 25}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Paranormal/Investigators", "label": "dmoz/Society/Paranormal/Investigators", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Employment/Recruitment_and_Staffing", "label": "dmoz/Business/Employment/Recruitment and Staffing", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Search_Engines", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Search Engines", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Algorithms/Sorting_and_Searching", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Algorithms/Sorting and Searching", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 56}], "image": null, "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9620887", "eventUri": "eng-9620887", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-18", "textStart": 513, "textEnd": 520}], "sentiment": -0.1686274509803921, "wgt": 200, "relevance": 1}

Vexed police officers made only halting progress in identifying possible suspects. Investigators long said it was likely that not all of the deaths were the work of the same killer. Some of the victims disappeared in the mid-1990s. Investigators concluded that an 11th person who disappeared in 2010 from the barrier island community of Oak Beach had accidentally drowned.\n\nMr. Heuermann, who lived across a bay from where the bodies were found, was arrested last July. Prosecutors said a new investigative task force used mobile phone location data and DNA samples to link the architect to some of the victims. He was charged with killing four of the women: Megan Waterman, Melissa Barthelemy, Amber Lynn Costello, and Maureen Brainard-Barnes.\n\nInvestigators who had searched Mr. Heuermann's home extensively and dug up his yard last summer returned to the house again last month and spent nearly a week searching it again. They focused their efforts mostly in the basement, according to a lawyer for Mr. Heuermann's wife.\n\nThat followed a search in April of a wooded area in Manorville, about 40 miles (65 kilometers) east of Mr. Heuermann's home, linked to two other Gilgo Beach victims.\n\nValerie Mack, 24, who had been working as an escort in Philadelphia, disappeared in 2000 and was last seen by her family in Port Republic, New Jersey. Some of her skeletal remains were discovered that same year in the Manorville woods. More of her remains were found in 2011 in the search around Gilgo Beach.\n\nInitially known as \"Jane Doe No. 6,\" Mack's remains had been unidentified for years until genetic testing revealed her identity in 2020.\n\nJessica Taylor, 20, vanished in 2003 while working as an escort in New York City. Some of her remains were discovered in Manorville that year. Other remains were found in a 2011 search of the beach scrub by the side of Ocean Parkway, the road where the other Gilgo Beach victims were found.\n\nRelatives for Mack and Taylor declined to comment Wednesday.\n\nMr. Heuermann's lawyer and the lawyers separately representing his wife and two adult children declined to comment.\n\nMr. Heuermann, who has been in custody since his arrest, has pleaded not guilty. He had been set to return to court on June 18 for a status hearing.

Heuermann has pleaded not guilty to all of the charges against him.\n\nA lawyer for Heuermann did not immediately return Rolling Stone's request for comment on the reports of the impending new charge.\n\nIt's possible the new charge against Heuermann will expand the case against him beyond the Gilgo Four. The remains of 11 bodies were discovered on the coast of Long Island's Gilgo Beach between 1996 and 2011, but police focused on four victims -- all sex workers at the time of their deaths and wrapped similarly in burlap -- whom they believed were killed by the same person.\n\nThe case remained cold for over a decade, with investigators finally zeroing in on Heuermann as a suspect in 2022. The breakthrough came after investigators discovered that Heuermann had once owned a Chevrolet Avalanche, the same car model a witness had mentioned seeing in connection to the Costello murder. After that, police were able to connect a series of \"burner\" phones and email addresses to Heuermann, alleging he used these to contact sex workers. One burner account provided investigators with a trove of evidence, including internet searches related to \"sex workers, sadistic, torture-related pornography and child pornography,\" as well as over 200 searches related to the unsolved Long Island serial killer case.\n\nThe final piece of evidence that preceded Heuermann's arrest came from a discarded pizza crust. Investigators used it to obtain DNA evidence, which they matched to a male hair found in the burlap sack that contained Waterman's remains.", "source": {"uri": "rollingstone.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Rolling Stone"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jon_blistein@rollingstone.com", "name": "Jon Blistein", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gilgo,_New_York", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Gilgo, New York"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indictment", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Indictment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Search_warrant", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Search warrant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massapequa_Park,_New_York", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Massapequa Park, New York"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Massapequa Park, New York"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manorville,_New_York", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Manorville, New York"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Manorville, New York"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex_worker", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sex worker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acquittal", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Acquittal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long_Island", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Long Island"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Long Island"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rolling_Stone", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rolling Stone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long_Island_serial_killer", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Long Island serial killer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chevrolet_Avalanche", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chevrolet Avalanche"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gunny_sack", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gunny sack"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child_pornography", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Child pornography"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA_profiling", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "DNA profiling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pornography", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pornography"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Murder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Internet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sadomasochism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sadomasochism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Email", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Email"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Murder", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Murder", "wgt": 27}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Victims", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Victims", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Unsolved", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Unsolved", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Sexuality/Politics_of_Sexuality", "label": "dmoz/Society/Sexuality/Politics of Sexuality", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 52}], "image": "https://www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/AP23319608082136.jpg?w=1600&h=900&crop=1", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9620887", "eventUri": "eng-9620887", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-06", "textStart": 126, "textEnd": 132}], "sentiment": -0.2941176470588235, "wgt": 200, "relevance": 1}

(AP) -- The New York architect previously accused of killing four women and leaving their corpses scattered along a coastal highway was charged Thursday in the deaths of two more, after prosecutors said they gathered new DNA evidence and found a computer document he had used to \"blueprint\" his crimes.\n\nRex Heuermann, 60, appeared before a judge on the eastern end of Long Island to face charges that he killed Jessica Taylor and Sandra Costilla, two young women who were long suspected of being the victims of men preying on sex workers.\n\nTaylor disappeared in 2003. Costilla was killed in 1993. The new charges came just days after police finished extensive searches of Heuermann's Massapequa Park home and a wooded area on Long Island tied to the investigation of a string of deaths known as the Gilgo Beach serial killings.\n\nIn a court filing, prosecutors said they were able to use new forensic testing methods to match hairs found on or near the vicinity of both victims to a DNA profile that is a likely match to Heuermann. Additionally, prosecutors say they discovered a \"planning document\" on the hard drive found in his basement used to \"methodically blueprint\" his killings.\n\nThe document lays out a set of tasks to complete before, during and after killings, including checking the weather and setting up a staging area. It also has a place to note practical lessons for \"next time.\"\n\nOne section, titled \"BODY PREP,\" includes guidance to \"REMOVE HEAD AND HANDS,\" as well as tattoos and trace DNA, and to wash the bodies. Another section, \"THINGS TO REMEMBER,\" appears to highlight lessons from previous killings that should be heeded, according to prosecutors. The entries describe the importance of sleeping properly \"BEFORE HUNT,\" using thick rope, and limiting noise to increase \"PLAY TIME.\"\n\nHeuermann pleaded not guilty at the court hearing and was ordered held without bail.\n\nSuffolk County District Attorney Ray Tierney planned to hold a news conference following the court hearing.\n\nThe charges involving Costilla, who was killed 30 years ago, indicate that prosecutors believe Heuermann was killing victims for much longer longer than previously thought. Prosecutors say one entry in the planning documents suggested he was involved in the death of another woman, Valerie Mack, who was found dismembered in the same vicinity as Taylor. Heuermann has not been charged in the death of Mack, who disappeared in 2000.\n\nSince late 2010, police have been investigating the deaths of at least 10 people -- mostly female sex workers -- whose remains were discovered along an isolated highway not far from Gilgo Beach on Long Island's south shore.\n\nThe victims had disappeared over a span of at least 14 years. Vexed police officers made only halting progress in identifying possible suspects. Investigators long said it was likely that not all of the deaths were the work of the same killer. Some of the victims disappeared in the mid-1990s. Investigators concluded that an 11th person who disappeared in 2010 from the barrier island community of Oak Beach had accidentally drowned.\n\nHeuermann, who lived across a bay from where the bodies were found, was arrested last July. Prosecutors said a new investigative task force used mobile phone location data and DNA samples to link the architect to some of the victims. He was charged with killing four of the women: Megan Waterman, Melissa Barthelemy, Amber Lynn Costello and Maureen Brainard-Barnes.\n\nInvestigators who had searched Heuermann's home extensively and dug up his yard last summer returned to the house again last month and spent nearly a week searching it again. They focused their efforts mostly in the basement, according to a lawyer for Heuermann's wife.\n\nThat followed a search in April of a wooded area in Manorville, about 40 miles (65 kilometers) east of Heuermann's home, linked to another Gilgo Beach victim.\n\nIn addition to the hard drive, prosecutors say they found a book in Heuermann's possession by the retired FBI agent John Douglas, \"The Cases That Haunt Us.\" They say the planning document also referenced specific pages in another work by Douglas, \"Mind Hunter,\" that allude to the personality types of serial killers and personality profiles of those who use mutilation and sexual violence.\n\nJessica Taylor, 20, vanished in 2003 while working as an escort in New York City. Some of her remains were discovered in Manorville that year. Other remains were found in a 2011 search of the beach scrub by the side of Ocean Parkway, the road where the other Gilgo Beach victims were found.\n\nInvestigators in April also spent days searching a property in the eastern Long Island hamlet of North Sea, where the Costilla's body was discovered in 1993. Costilla was 28 when she was killed and had lived in New York City.\n\nA decade ago, Suffolk County prosecutors said publicly that they believed Costilla had been killed by a carpenter who lived in the area, John Bittrolff, who was convicted of murdering two other women whose bodies had been found on the same part of Long Island. But Bittrolff was never charged with Costilla's death due to lack of evidence. He insists he is innocent of any murders.\n\nHeuermann's lawyer and the lawyers separately representing his wife and two adult children declined to comment.\n\nHeuermann, who has been in custody since his arrest, has pleaded not guilty. He had been set to return to court on July 30 for a status hearing. No trial date has been set.\n\nFollow Philip Marcelo at twitter.com/philmarcelo.\n\nMore from this section\n\nJohn Driscoll wins Democratic nomination for U.S. House in Montana's 2nd Congressional

The new charges are expected after investigators returned last month to search Heuermann's home in the suburban Long Island community of Massapequa Park.\n\nAn area in Manorville, roughly 40 miles from Heuermann's home, was also searched.\n\nHeuermann was arrested in July and charged with murder in the killings of Melissa Barthelemy, 24; Megan Waterman, 22; and Amber Lynn Costello, 27. He was charged earlier this year in the killing of Maureen Brainard-Barnes, 25.\n\nThe women disappeared between 2007 and 2010. Their remains were found in December 2010 around Gilgo Beach, on Long Island's south shore. Authorities made the discoveries while searching for Shannan Gilbert, a sex worker who disappeared from the nearby gated community of Oak Beach.\n\nGilbert, 23, was last seen running from a client's home on May 1, 2010. Her remains were found in a marsh in December 2011. Authorities have said they believe she may have drowned, but an autopsy performed by revered forensic pathologist Michael Baden said she had been the victim of violence, possibly strangulation, without concluding how she died.\n\nThe remains of several other people were discovered during the Gilgo Beach search, including those of Jessica Taylor and Valerie Mack. Partial remains of Taylor and Mack, both sex workers, were also found in Manorville, roughly 45 miles east of Gilgo Beach.\n\nHeuermann, who is being held without bail, has maintained his innocence in the killings of the four women. He has not been charged in the deaths of Taylor or Mack.\n\nAuthorities connected Heuermann to the earlier cases in part through strands of his estranged wife's hair, which was obtained from burlap sacks in which the remains were found. Charging documents say that Heuermann's former partner and children were traveling out of state when he is alleged to have killed the women.", "source": {"uri": "nbcnews.com", "dataType": "news",

Now he will be arraigned on an indictment in the 2003 death of Jessica Taylor and the 1993 killing of Sandra Costilla, the New York Post reports.\n\nThe remains of Ms Taylor, a 20-year-old woman working as an escort, were found in a wooded area in Manorville in 2003. Further remains were also discovered on March 29, 2011, along Ocean Parkway.\n\nRead more: Dad of teen killed in grisly catfish murder plot dies in fifth anniversary motorcycle ride\n\nThe other new victim - Sandra Costilla - had not been included among the Gilgo Beach victims until now. Investigators previously suspected convicted serial killer John Bittrolff in her death but no charges had been brought.\n\nSuffolk County District Attorney Ray Tierney hasn't said what development he plans to announce or discuss the purpose of Thursday's court hearing. But sources close to the case revealed the new charges to the New York Post.\n\nSince late 2010, police have been investigating the deaths of at least 10 people, mostly female sex workers, whose remains were discovered along an isolated highway not far from Gilgo Beach on Long Island's south shore. The victims had disappeared over a span of at least 14 years.\n\nFrustrated officers made only slow progress in identifying possible suspects. Investigators long said it was likely that not all of the deaths were the work of the same killer. Some of the victims disappeared in the mid-1990s. Investigators concluded that an 11th person who disappeared in 2010 from the barrier island community of Oak Beach had accidentally drowned.\n\nHeuermann, who lived across a bay from where the bodies were found, was arrested last July. Prosecutors said a new investigative task force used mobile phone location data and DNA samples to link the architect to some of the victims. He was charged with killing four of the women: Megan Waterman, Melissa Barthelemy, Amber Lynn Costello and Maureen Brainard-Barnes.\n\nFor all the latest on news, politics, sports, and showbiz from the USA, go to The Mirror US .\n\nInvestigators who had searched Heuermann's home extensively and dug up his yard last summer returned to the house again last month and spent nearly a week searching it again.

Valerie Mack, 24, who had been working as an escort in Philadelphia, disappeared in 2000 and was last seen by her family in Port Republic, New Jersey. Some of her skeletal remains were discovered that same year in the Manorville woods. More of her remains were found in 2011 in the search around Gilgo Beach.\n\nInitially known as \"Jane Doe No. 6,\" Ms Mack's remains had been unidentified for years until genetic testing revealed her identity in 2020. Jessica Taylor, 20, vanished in 2003 while working as an escort in New York City. Some of her remains were discovered in Manorville that year. Other remains were found in a 2011 search of the beach scrub by the side of Ocean Parkway, the road where the other Gilgo Beach victims were found.\n\nHeuermann's lawyer and the lawyers separately representing his wife and two adult children declined to comment.

The new charges are expected after investigators returned last month to search Heuermann's home in the suburban Long Island community of Massapequa Park.\n\nAn area in Manorville, roughly 40 miles from Heuermann's home, was also searched.\n\nHeuermann was arrested in July and charged with murder in the killings of Melissa Barthelemy, 24; Megan Waterman, 22; and Amber Lynn Costello, 27. He was charged earlier this year in the killing of Maureen Brainard-Barnes, 25.\n\nThe women disappeared between 2007 and 2010. Their remains were found in December 2010 around Gilgo Beach, on Long Island's south shore. Authorities made the discoveries while searching for Shannan Gilbert, a sex worker who disappeared from the nearby gated community of Oak Beach.\n\nGilbert, 23, was last seen running from a client's home on May 1, 2010. Her remains were found in a marsh in December 2011. Authorities have said they believe she may have drowned, but an autopsy performed by revered forensic pathologist Michael Baden said she had been the victim of violence, possibly strangulation, without concluding how she died.\n\nThe remains of several other people were discovered during the Gilgo Beach search, including those of Jessica Taylor and Valerie Mack. Partial remains of Taylor and Mack, both sex workers, were also found in Manorville, roughly 45 miles east of Gilgo Beach.\n\nHeuermann, who is being held without bail, has maintained his innocence in the killings of the four women. He has not been charged in the deaths of Taylor or Mack.\n\nAuthorities connected Heuermann to the earlier cases in part through strands of his estranged wife's hair, which was obtained from burlap sacks in which the remains were found. Charging documents say that Heuermann's former partner and children were traveling out of state when he is alleged to have killed the women.", "source": {"uri": "aol.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Aol"}, "authors": [{"uri": "adam_reiss@aol.com", "name": "Adam Reiss", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "tim_stelloh@aol.com", "name": "Tim Stelloh", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gilgo,_New_York", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gilgo, New York"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long_Island", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Long Island"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Long Island"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex_worker", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Sex worker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York (state)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBC_News", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBC News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arraignment", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Arraignment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indictment", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Indictment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long_Island_serial_killer", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Long Island serial killer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Murder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massapequa_Park,_New_York", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Massapequa Park, New York"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Massapequa Park, New York"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manorville,_New_York", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Manorville, New York"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Manorville, New York"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Baden", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Michael Baden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gunny_sack", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gunny sack"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strangling", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Strangling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forensic_pathology", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Forensic pathology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gated_community", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gated community"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autopsy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Autopsy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bail", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bail"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oak_Beach,_New_York", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Oak Beach, New York"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Oak Beach, New York"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Murder", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Murder", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Victims", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Victims", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Sexuality/Politics_of_Sexuality", "label": "dmoz/Society/Sexuality/Politics of Sexuality", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Aging/Life_Expectancy", "label": "dmoz/Health/Aging/Life Expectancy", "wgt": 11}], "image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/64toDMOHFFrdHfAGskFCRw--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD04NTU-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/aol_nbc_universal_184/862ee3a1530342a8596f7d252d9ed7a7", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9620887", "eventUri": "eng-9620887", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2010-05-01", "textStart": 1410, "textEnd": 1421}, {"amb": false, "date": "2010-12-", "textStart": 1141, "textEnd": 1154}, {"amb": false, "date": "2011-12-", "textStart": 1460, "textEnd": 1473}], "sentiment": -0.403921568627451, "wgt": 197, "relevance": 1}

He has pleaded not guilty to all murder charges and is being held without bail.\n\nHis attorney, Michael Brown, told reporters in January that Heuermann maintains his innocence and is looking forward to fighting the charges.\n\nThe Suffolk County District Attorney's office confirmed Heuermann is expected in court Thursday.\n\n\"There were a number of necessary investigative steps that were taken,\" District Attorney Raymond Tierney said Monday at an unrelated news conference. \"Thursday, you will see the fruits of that investigation.\"\n\nCNN affiliate WABC reported that police recently searched Long Island's Manorville and North Sea in connection with the investigation, where the remains of three women were found years ago.\n\nThe remains of Gilgo Beach victims Taylor and Mack were found in Manorville, according to police.\n\nMack was a 24-year-old Philadelphia mother who went missing over 20 years ago and whose partial remains were discovered in 2000, authorities said. Police said Taylor's partial remains were found in 2003.\n\nJohn Ray, a lawyer who represents Taylor's family, previously said he did not know whether Heuermann was connected to Taylor's death.\n\nWABC reported that the body of 28-year-old Sandra Costilla was found in North Sea in 1993.\n\nAfter Heuermann's arrest last summer, police said the investigation was far from over. They zeroed in on the Massapequa home where he had lived quietly for years with his wife, daughter and stepson.\n\nInvestigators used police dogs and ground-penetrating radar to search the home in July, uncovering over 280 firearms, more than 40 of which were possessed illegally, police said.\n\nAuthorities also looked into areas in Las Vegas and South Carolina where Heuermann owned property.\n\nTierney told reporters last summer that investigators were working with \"a flood of evidence.\"\n\nA few weeks ago, police once again searched the Massapequa home and were seen carrying boxes out of the house. Robert Macedonia, the attorney of Heuermann's estranged wife Asa Ellerup, confirmed that police had a warrant for the search.\n\nEllerup filed for divorce days after Heuermann's arrest last year, but still visits him weekly, according to a statement released by her attorneys in March.\n\nShe maintains that Heuermann is not capable of the crimes he's accused of, the statement said, adding that her sympathies go out to the victims and their families.\n\n\"Nobody deserves to die in that manner,\" Ellerup said in the statement.\n\nThe-CNN-Wire\n\n\u2122 & \u00a9 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

Mack's partial remains were previously discovered in Manorville in September 2000, and police have suggested there may be a connection to Taylor's remains.\n\nThe remains of an unidentified female toddler are also located in the same area.\n\nThe remains of an unidentified man are also discovered closer to the remains of the Gilgo Four.

Heuermann was tracked through his car, a Chevrolet Avalanche, according to court documents. A witness to Costello's disappearance reported seeing a Chevrolet Avalanche at Costello's home, court records stated.\n\nJuly 13, 2023\n\nHeuermann is arrested in Manhattan at his midtown office. Investigators matched DNA from hair recovered from the burlap used to wrap Waterman's body to leftover pizza crust Heuermann threw into a Manhattan garbage can in January 2023, according to court documents.\n\nDetectives also tracked Heuermann through cellphone records, according to court records. Tierney said cellphone mapping led investigators to zero in on areas in midtown Manhattan and Massapequa Park, where Heuermann lives.\n\nJuly 14, 2023\n\nDefense attorney Michael Brown enters a not guilty plea on Heuermann's behalf at his arraignment for three counts of first-degree murder and three counts of second-degree murder.

2024\n\nHeuermann is charged with two more murders after investigators spent months combing through evidence taken from his family home and following searches of a wooded area in Manorville.\n\nHe is charged with the 2003 murder of Taylor, whose remains were found on Long Island in Gilgo Beach in March 2011, and in Manorville in July 2003, and the 1993 murder of Sandra Costilla, whose remains were found in North Sea, Long Island, in 1993, according to court documents.\n\nDNA, including a hair found on a drape under Taylor's body, ties Heuermann to both murders, according to prosecutors.\n\nCostilla's murder was initially suspected to have been the work of a different killer, John Bittrolff, but advanced DNA now points to Heuermann, prosecutors said.", "source": {"uri":

Vexed police officers made only halting progress in identifying possible suspects. Investigators long said it was likely that not all of the deaths were the work of the same killer. Some of the victims disappeared in the mid-1990s. Investigators concluded that an 11th person who disappeared in 2010 from the barrier island community of Oak Beach had accidentally drowned.\n\nHeuermann, who lived across a bay from where the bodies were found, was arrested last July. Prosecutors said a new investigative task force used mobile phone location data and DNA samples to link the architect to some of the victims. He was charged with killing four of the women: Megan Waterman, Melissa Barthelemy, Amber Lynn Costello and Maureen Brainard-Barnes.\n\nInvestigators who had searched Heuermann's home extensively and dug up his yard last summer returned to the house again last month and spent nearly a week searching it again. They focused their efforts mostly in the basement, according to a lawyer for Heuermann's wife.\n\nThat followed a search in April of a wooded area in Manorville, about 40 miles (65 kilometers) east of Heuermann's home, linked to two other Gilgo Beach victims.\n\nValerie Mack, 24, who had been working as an escort in Philadelphia, disappeared in 2000 and was last seen by her family in Port Republic, New Jersey. Some of her skeletal remains were discovered that same year in the Manorville woods. More of her remains were found in 2011 in the search around Gilgo Beach.\n\nInitially known as \"Jane Doe No. 6,\" Mack's remains had been unidentified for years until genetic testing revealed her identity in 2020.\n\nJessica Taylor, 20, vanished in 2003 while working as an escort in New York City. Some of her remains were discovered in Manorville that year. Other remains were found in a 2011 search of the beach scrub by the side of Ocean Parkway, the road where the other Gilgo Beach victims were found.\n\nRelatives for Mack and Taylor declined to comment Wednesday.\n\nHeuermann's lawyer and the lawyers separately representing his wife and two adult children declined to comment.\n\nHeuermann, who has been in custody since his arrest, has pleaded not guilty. He had been set to return to court on June 18 for a status hearing. No trial date has been set.\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2024 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

Her body, which was decapitated with her arms severed below her elbows, remained unidentified for eight years until her head and arms were found in another location, cops said. A tattoo on the body was also mutilated, the indictment read.\n\nTaylor's head and arms were found along Ocean Parkway in 2011 -- just east of Gilgo Beach where the remains of Maureen Brainard-Barnes, Melissa Barthelemy, Megan Waterman and Amber Costello were found, prosecutors said.\n\nIn April, a male hair that police found under Taylor's body back in 2003 was genetically linked to Heuermann, prosecutors say.\n\nCostilla's remains were found in a wooded area in Southampton by a pair of hunters. Hairs recovered from Costilla's body were also genetically linked to Heuermann, prosecutors said.\n\nThe new indictments come within weeks of a search by Gilgo Beach Task Force investigators in an area of Manorville where the partial remains of two victims -- Taylor and Valerie Mack -- were found more than two decades ago.\n\nJust two weeks ago, investigators were back at Heuermann's Massapequa Park home executing a new search warrant connected to the case. Police were seen removing a large rectangular object covered in blue cloth and loading it onto the back of a truck parked in the driveway.\n\nIn 2010 and 2011, the bodies of 11 people were found on and near Gilgo Beach. Heuermann has not, until now, been linked to any of the other seven victims\n\nCops said it was a Long Island pimp -- and pizza crust DNA -- that steered investigators toward Heuermann, a husband and father who had been living quietly in the Nassau County town of Massapequa Park and commuting to Manhattan, where he worked as an architect.\n\nThe pimp described the suspect's vehicle to authorities, giving them details about a green Chevrolet Avalanche during a spring 2022 meeting with investigators.\n\nCops also retrieved DNA from a pizza crust found in a Manhattan trash can near Heuermann's work office and matched it with a hair found on Waterman's body.\n\nHeuermann has been in custody since his arrest last July and no trial date has been set.", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com",

Costilla was killed in 1993. The new charges came just days after police finished extensive searches of Heuermann's Massapequa Park home and a wooded area on Long Island tied to the investigation of a string of deaths known as the Gilgo Beach serial killings.\n\nIn a court filing, prosecutors said they were able to use new forensic testing methods to match hairs found on or near the vicinity of both victims to a DNA profile that is a likely match to Heuermann. Additionally, prosecutors say they discovered a \"planning document\" on the hard drive found in his basement used to \"methodically blueprint\" his killings.\n\nThe document lays out a set of tasks to complete before, during and after killings, including checking the weather and setting up a staging area. It also has a place to note practical lessons for \"next time.\"\n\nOne section, titled \"BODY PREP,\" includes guidance to \"REMOVE HEAD AND HANDS,\" as well as tattoos and trace DNA, and to wash the bodies. Another section, \"THINGS TO REMEMBER,\" appears to highlight lessons from previous killings that should be heeded, according to prosecutors. The entries describe the importance of sleeping properly \"BEFORE HUNT,\" using thick rope, and limiting noise to increase \"PLAY TIME.\"\n\nHeuermann pleaded not guilty at the court hearing and was ordered held without bail.\n\nSuffolk County District Attorney Ray Tierney planned to hold a news conference following the court hearing.\n\nThe charges involving Costilla, who was killed 30 years ago, indicate that prosecutors believe Heuermann was killing victims for much longer longer than previously thought. Prosecutors say one entry in the planning documents suggested he was involved in the death of another woman, Valerie Mack, who was found dismembered in the same vicinity as Taylor. Heuermann has not been charged in the death of Mack, who disappeared in 2000.\n\nSince late 2010, police have been investigating the deaths of at least 10 people -- mostly female sex workers -- whose remains were discovered along an isolated highway not far from Gilgo Beach on Long Island's south shore.\n\nThe victims had disappeared over a span of at least 14 years. Vexed police officers made only halting progress in identifying possible suspects. Investigators long said it was likely that not all of the deaths were the work of the same killer. Some of the victims disappeared in the mid-1990s. Investigators concluded that an 11th person who disappeared in 2010 from the barrier island community of Oak Beach had accidentally drowned.\n\nHeuermann, who lived across a bay from where the bodies were found, was arrested last July. Prosecutors said a new investigative task force used mobile phone location data and DNA samples to link the architect to some of the victims. He was charged with killing four of the women: Megan Waterman, Melissa Barthelemy, Amber Lynn Costello and Maureen Brainard-Barnes.\n\nInvestigators who had searched Heuermann's home extensively and dug up his yard last summer returned to the house again last month and spent nearly a week searching it again. They focused their efforts mostly in the basement, according to a lawyer for Heuermann's wife.\n\nThat followed a search in April of a wooded area in Manorville, about 40 miles (65 kilometers) east of Heuermann's home, linked to another Gilgo Beach victim.\n\nIn addition to the hard drive, prosecutors say they found a book in Heuermann's possession by the retired FBI agent John Douglas, \"The Cases That Haunt Us.\" They say the planning document also referenced specific pages in another work by Douglas, \"Mind Hunter,\" that allude to the personality types of serial killers and personality profiles of those who use mutilation and sexual violence.\n\nJessica Taylor, 20, vanished in 2003 while working as an escort in New York City. Some of her remains were discovered in Manorville that year. Other remains were found in a 2011 search of the beach scrub by the side of Ocean Parkway, the road where the other Gilgo Beach victims were found.\n\nInvestigators in April also spent days searching a property in the eastern Long Island hamlet of North Sea, where the Costilla's body was discovered in 1993. Costilla was 28 when she was killed and had lived in New York City.\n\nA decade ago, Suffolk County prosecutors said publicly that they believed Costilla had been killed by a carpenter who lived in the area, John Bittrolff, who was convicted of murdering two other women whose bodies had been found on the same part of Long Island. But Bittrolff was never charged with Costilla's death due to lack of evidence. He insists he is innocent of any murders.\n\nHeuermann's lawyer and the lawyers separately representing his wife and two adult children declined to comment.\n\nHeuermann, who has been in custody since his arrest, has pleaded not guilty. He had been set to return to court on July 30 for a status hearing. No trial date has been set.\n\n___\n\nFollow Philip Marcelo at twitter.com/philmarcelo.", "source": {"uri": "clickondetroit.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "WDIV"}, "authors": [{"uri": "associated_press@clickondetroit.com", "name": "Associated Press", "type": "author", "isAgency": true}, {"uri": "philip_marcelo@clickondetroit.com", "name": "Philip Marcelo", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jessica_Taylor", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jessica Taylor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA_profiling", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "DNA profiling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long_Island", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Long Island"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Long Island"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Costilla_County,_Colorado", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Costilla County, Colorado"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Costilla County, Colorado"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gilgo,_New_York", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Gilgo, New York"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex_worker", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Sex worker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serial_killer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Serial killer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hard_disk_drive", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hard disk drive"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forensic_science", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Forensic science"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massapequa_Park,_New_York", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Massapequa Park, New York"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Massapequa Park, New York"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Press_conference", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Press conference"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barrier_island", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Barrier island"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dismemberment", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dismemberment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acquittal", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Acquittal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "DNA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/District_attorney", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "District attorney"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tattoo", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tattoo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bail", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bail"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suffolk_County,_New_York", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Suffolk County, New York"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Suffolk County, New York"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Bittrolff", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "John Bittrolff"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Administrative_divisions_of_New_York_(state)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Administrative divisions of New York (state)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_E._Douglas", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "John E.

That allegedly allowed Heuermann \"unfettered time to execute his plans for each victim without any fear that his family would uncover or learn of his involvement in these crimes,\" prosecutors previously said in an indictment.\n\nLess than a week after Heuermann's arrest, his wife filed for divorce.

CNN that investigators uncovered evidence during searches of the Manorville area of Long Island as well as Heuermann's home earlier this year that helped advance the investigation.\n\nDetectives believe, based on \"offender characteristics\" of serial killers, there may be more alleged killings, according to officials who have been briefed on the investigation.\n\n\"In most of these cases, a serial killer does not start killing in his 40s,\" said a law enforcement official familiar with the case.\n\nThat belief spurred investigators to not only expand their attempts to identify unidentified victims, re-examine dump sites and conduct additional searches of Heuermann's home, but to also begin reexamining unsolved missing persons cases.\n\nInvestigators are also looking at seemingly unrelated unsolved homicides where there may be similarities among the victims, the crime scenes or condition of the bodies.\n\n\"We are not near the end of this investigation,\" one law

They returned to the house last month and spent nearly a week conducting another thorough search, focusing mainly on the basement, as per a lawyer representing Heuermann's wife.\n\nThis followed a search in April of a wooded area in Manorville, situated about 40 miles (65 kilometres) east of Heuermann's residence, which is connected to another Gilgo Beach victim.

The new charges came just weeks after authorities renewed searches of Heuermann's home in Massapequa Park and a wooded area on Long Island where human remains were found over a decade ago.\n\nInvestigators found new evidence, including a document on a hard drive recovered from Heuermann's basement that they believe he used to plan the murders, according to a superseding bail application emailed to USA TODAY on Thursday.\n\nThe document lists \"supplies,\" including \"saw/cutting tools,\" and \"photo film,\" and a \"DS,\" which investigators believe stands for \"dump site.\" It also contains a \"dispose of the following\" section and the note, \"hunt too long seen in area too long.\"\n\nThe former New York architect has been in jail since July on charges in connection with the murder of four women - Maureen Brainard-Barnes, 25, Megan Waterman, 22, Melissa Barthelemy, 24, and Amber Costello, 27 - all sex workers whose bodies were discovered on the same strip of highway on Gilgo Beach on Long Island.

Multiple law enforcement sources told CNN that the 60-year-old will face murder charges relating to the deaths of Jessica Taylor (pictured bottom right) and Valerie Mack (pictured top right) on Thursday.\n\nThe headless and handless body of Taylor (pictured), 20, was discovered in the woods of Manorville, New York, in 2000. In 2011, the rest of her remains were discovered over 40 miles away near Gilgo Beach on Long Island.\n\nMack (pictured) had vanished near Atlantic City, New Jersey, in 2000 at the age of 24 and was also found dead in Manorville, with parts of her later discovered on Gilgo Beach. Heuermann, who has pleaded not guilty in the deaths of four women, will appear Thursday in state court in Riverhead.\n\nIn April of this year, detectives were seen scouring woodland close to where body parts belonging to the two were found. Search teams with K9s were seen sweeping the wooded area in Manorville over three days. Last month, detectives also went back to search the alleged serial killer's Long Island home. Officers had recovered a cache of weapons during an initial search following his arrest last summer.\n\nHeuermann was arrested in July and initially charged with killing Melissa Barthelemy, 24, Megan Waterman, 22, and Amber Lynn Costello 27. In February, he was also charged with the murder of Maureen Brainard-Barnes, 25. The women were found wrapped in burlap and buried along the remote stretch of Ocean Parkway on Long Island's South Shore over a decade ago.\n\nHeuermann (pictured), an architect, has pleaded not guilty to all counts and currently remains in jail awaiting trial. A date for trial has not yet been set. The Gilgo women's remains were discovered during the search for 23-year-old Shannan Gilbert, an escort from New Jersey who had vanished in May 2010 after making a frantic 911 call. Her remains were found along the same stretch of coast in December 2011 - and it was her body that led police to the discovery of the 'Gilgo Four'.\n\nNo one has ever been charged in Gilbert's death and police said it may have been accidental - but her family believe she was murdered. The women were among 11 found on the desolate stretch of coastline close to Heuermann's Long Island Home between 2010 and 2011. All of the victims worked as escorts who advertised themselves on Craigslist.\n\nHeuermann was linked to the killings by DNA on the burlap used to transport the bodied which was compared to samples taken from a pizza crust and napkin that were discarded outside his Manhattan architectural firm, police said. The samples boasted a 99.96 percent match, according to law enforcement officials.\n\nCops said they were alerted to Heuermann as a potential suspect after a witness linked Heuermann's Chevrolet Avalanche to Costello's murder. The car was then tied to Heuermann's cellphone records, which allegedly linked him to locations related to the murders. The indictment stated that Heuermann had used different burner phones to contact each of his victims. Pictured: Victim Amber Costello.\n\nCops also accused Heuermann of using Barthelemy's phone to make taunting phone calls to her family from the comfort of his office. Her sister Melissa told how she was bombarded with threatening phone calls from the killer who boasted of the killing and was keeping tabs on her movements. Pictured: Victim Melissa Barthelemy.\n\nVess Mitev, a lawyer for Heuermann's two adult children, said the family was closely monitoring the developments. 'The hearing is yet another mile marker in this macabre saga, where they continue to be unfortunate bystanders,' he said.\n\nWant more stories like this from the Daily Mail?

The remains of Maureen Brainard-Barnes, Amber Lynn Costello, Melissa Barthelemy and Megan Waterman were found in burlap bags along Gilgo Beach's Ocean Parkway in 2010.\n\nTaylor went missing in 2003 while working as an escort in New York City, her remains were discovered near Gilgo Beach as well as in a separate wooded area east of Long Island.\n\nCostillo's remains were found in North Sea in Southampton. She was killed in 1993 and had not previously been associated with the same suspect as the other killings Heuermann stands accused of.\n\nThe addition of her death expanded the timeline of the killings as the remains.\n\nInvestigators said images in Heuermann's collection of violent, bondage and torture pornography which dates back to 1994 \"notably and largely coincide with how the remains\" of Costilla, Taylor and a third woman, Valerie Mack, were found.\n\nCostilla's body, with several sharp-force injuries and evidence of sexual assault, was found in November 1993 by hunters near Old Fish Cove Road and North Sea.\n\nAccording to cell phone records, Heuermann's wife and children were out of town when victims Barthelemy, Waterman and Costello disappeared.\n\nAccording to a

In January, prosecutors brought a fourth indictment for the killing of 25-year-old Maureen Brainard-Barnes.\n\nHeuermann's ramshackle home in Massapequa Park was extensively searched at least twice in the wake of his bombshell arrest.\n\nLast year, police revealed that they found a concrete, sound-proofed room in the basement where Heuermann supposedly kept over 200 guns.\n\nA second search warrant was executed at the home last month. It was not immediately clear if the additional charges expected Thursday were tied to findings from the searches, or from another line inquiry.\n\nSuffolk County prosecutors tied Heuermann to the unsolved deaths through DNa matches - including from a discarded pizza crust and an energy drink that his adult daughter tossed in the trash.\n\nInvestigators also used cell phone towers to pinpoint calls Heuermann supposedly made to the victims, all of whom made a living as sex workers in the Long Island or New York City area.\n\nThe infamous case - sometimes referred to as the \"Long Island Serial Killer,\" or LISK - burst open in December 2010, when escort Shannan Gilbert, 23, vanished from a meeting with a client at the Oak Beach Association on May 1, 2010.\n\nThe search for Gilbert's disappearance led police to the bodies of the Gilgo Four - all of whom were slight, petite women who had been working in the sex industry in the lead-up to their own disappearance.\n\nThe partial remains of Jessica Taylor were found along Ocean Parkway on March 29, 2011. Her remains were initially found in a wooded area in Manorville in July 2003.\n\nLike the Gilgo Four, Taylor was working as a sex worker at the time of her disappearance.\n\nSandra Costilla was killed in 1993. She had not been linked to the Gilgo Beach killing spree until now.\n\nAuthorities also turned up the skeletal remains of a yet-to-be-identified Asian man off Ocean Parkway in April 2011, as well as the additional remains of Valerie Mack, a Philadelphia-based sex worker whose partial remains were found in Manorville in 2000.\n\nThe initial investigation also stumbled upon the remains of a toddler whose was later found through DNA testing to be the daughter of \"Peaches,\" a black woman whose partial remains were found in Hempstead Lake State Park\n\nHeuermann - who spent his entire life on the south shore of Long Island - was identified as a suspect in the case two months after former NYPD chief Rodney Harrison took over as Suffolk County police commissioner.\n\nHis arrest last summer marked the first public break in the unsolved string of murders, which had haunted Long Island for over 10 years.", "source": {"uri": "nypost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "New York Post"},

He had previously been scheduled to return to court for a June 18 status hearing.\n\nThe new court date comes two weeks after investigators returned to Heuermann's single-story home in Massapequa Park, where they had recovered a cache of weapons during an initial search following his arrest last summer. A date for Heuermann's trial has not yet been set.\n\nDuring the most recent search, which lasted several days, investigators placed paint chips and other materials into evidence bags and removed a large rectangular object covered in a blue cloth.\n\nA spokesperson for the prosecutor's office would not say whether the upcoming hearing was related to the renewed search effort.\n\nIn April, authorities involved in the investigation also spent more than a week searching a wooded area in Manorville, fueling speculation that they were seeking new evidence linked to some of the additional six sets of remains that were discovered along Gilgo Beach more than a decade ago.\n\nHeuermann, 60, was arrested in July in the deaths of Melissa Barthelemy, Megan Waterman and Amber Costello. He was charged in January in the death of Maureen Brainard-Barnes.\n\nHis attorney, Michael Brown, has said his client maintains his innocence. He declined to comment on the nature of Thursday's hearing.\n\nThe case had vexed investigators since the remains of eleven people, most of them young women who had been sex workers, were found on a stretch of Gilgo Beach in 2010 and 2011. Authorities have said the investigation into the other victims remains ongoing.\n\nRobert Macedonio, a lawyer for Heuermann's estranged wife, said the most recent search of the Massapequa Park home was primarily focused on the basement. He said the family was out of state when the search was conducted.\n\nHe declined to say what was taken from the home and said the family has not yet received the search warrant affidavit that would spell out their reasons for conducting the search.\n\nDuring the initial search of the home in July, authorities tore up a wooden deck and used an excavator to dig up the backyard, which they scanned for buried objects using specialized equipment.\n\nThe most recent search was far less disruptive, according to Macedonia.\n\nVess Mitev, a lawyer for Heuermann's two adult children, said the family was closely monitoring the developments.\n\n\"The hearing is yet another mile marker in this macabre saga, where they continue to be unfortunate bystanders,\" he said in a text message.", "source": {"uri": "aol.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Aol"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jake_offenhartz@aol.com", "name": "Jake Offenhartz", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gilgo,_New_York", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gilgo, New York"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serial_killer", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Serial killer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York (state)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riverhead_(town),_New_York", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Riverhead (town), New York"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Riverhead (town), New York"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suburb", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Suburb"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long_Island", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Long Island"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Long Island"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Associated Press"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/District_attorney", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "District attorney"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suffolk_County,_New_York", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Suffolk County, New York"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Suffolk County, New York"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massapequa_Park,_New_York", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Massapequa Park, New York"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Massapequa Park, New York"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawyer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lawyer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manorville,_New_York", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Manorville, New York"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Manorville, New York"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex_worker", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sex worker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affidavit", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Affidavit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brown_University", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Brown University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Search_warrant", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Search warrant"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Internet/Searching", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Internet/Searching", "wgt": 27}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Employment/Recruitment_and_Staffing", "label": "dmoz/Business/Employment/Recruitment and Staffing", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Search_Engines", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Search Engines", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Algorithms/Sorting_and_Searching", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Algorithms/Sorting and Searching", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Puzzles/Word_Search", "label": "dmoz/Games/Puzzles/Word Search", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 54}], "image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/.jRX.ybLroj5ZLsmjLvWVQ--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD04MDA-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/aol_associated_press_484/4e11b3b1159c8d5adb7b38fae6cd24f3", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9620887", "eventUri": "eng-9620887", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-18", "textStart": 664, "textEnd": 671}], "sentiment": -0.2862745098039216, "wgt": 193, "relevance": 1}

There were notes indicating steps to take \"next time,\" i.e., considering a hit to the face or neck \"NEXT TIME,\" or using heavier rope for the neck, according to court documents.\n\nCourt documents show he also allegedly had a \"post event\" checklist, which appeared to be a \"checklist of tasks following the 'event' or homicide to avoid apprehension, i.e. ... 'BURN GLOVES,' 'DISPOSE OF PICS' taken of the victim, and 'HAVE STORY SET' (e.g., alibi, story for family upon their return, or law enforcement, should an inquiry be made).\"\n\nHeuermann, an architect and father, was arrested in July and initially charged with murdering three escorts: Megan Waterman, Amber Costello and Melissa Barthelemy. He was charged in January with the murder of a fourth escort, Maureen Brainard-Barnes.\n\nThe remains of all four women were found in 2010 in desolate spots along the ocean near Gilgo Beach.

Costilla, 28, who was found dead in 1993 in North Sea, was previously connected to another accused killer.\n\nThe announcement comes after a recent uptick in activity in the Gilgo Beach inquiry. In April, investigators were seen searching a wooded area just off the Long Island Expressway in Manorville. ABC7 reported that two K9s from the NYPD's Emergency Service Unit took part in the search. The search also expanded to the area of North Sea in Southampton. Then, in May, authorities combed Heuermann's Massapequa Park home for days, removing boxes of evidence from the premises.\n\nThe Associated Press reports that, during their search, investigators discovered what they described in court papers as a \"planning document\" Heuermann used to formulate his crimes. The disturbing document reportedly included notes on how to clean bodies, potential dump sites, and how to evade capture, according to the New York Post.\n\nIn July 2023, Heuermann, an architect who worked in Manhattan, was arrested and charged in connection with the deaths of three women: Melissa Barthelemy, 24, Amber Lynn Costello, 27 and Megan Waterman, 22. In January, Heuermann was named in the death of a fourth woman: 25-year-old Maureen Brainard-Barnes, who originally went missing in 2007. He was charged with second-degree murder.

Costilla was 28 when she was killed and had lived in New York City.\n\nA decade ago, Suffolk County prosecutors said publicly that they believed Costilla had been killed by a carpenter who lived in the area, John Bittrolff, who was convicted of murdering two other women whose bodies had been found on the same part of Long Island. But Bittrolff was never charged with Costilla's death due to lack of evidence. He insists he is innocent of any murders.\n\nHeuermann's lawyer and the lawyers separately representing his wife and two adult children declined to comment.\n\nHeuermann, who has been in custody since his arrest, has pleaded not guilty. He had been set to return to court on June 18 for a status hearing. No trial date has been set.\n\nFollow Philip Marcelo at twitter.com/philmarcelo.", "source": {"uri": "reformer.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Brattleboro Reformer"}, "authors": [{"uri":

The new charges came just weeks after authorities renewed searches of Heuermann's home in Massapequa Park and a wooded area on Long Island where human remains were found over a decade ago.\n\nInvestigators found new evidence, including a document on a hard drive recovered from Heuermann's basement that they believe he used to plan the murders, according to a superseding bail application emailed to USA TODAY on Thursday.\n\nThe document lists \"supplies,\" including \"saw/cutting tools,\" and \"photo film,\" and a \"DS,\" which investigators believe stands for \"dump site.\" It also contains a \"dispose of the following\" section and the note, \"hunt too long seen in area too long.\"\n\nThe former New York architect has been in jail since July on charges in connection with the murder of four women - Maureen Brainard-Barnes, 25, Megan Waterman, 22, Melissa Barthelemy, 24, and Amber Costello, 27 - all sex workers whose bodies were discovered on the same strip of highway on Gilgo Beach on Long Island. Their remains were among 11 sets of remains found throughout suburban Long Island in 2010 and 2011.\n\nHeuermann has pleaded not guilty to all the charges. His trial date has not been set.\n\nHeuermann's attorney did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nDNA on pizza box leads to Heuermann's arrest\n\nHeuermann's arrest in July came more than a decade after the first bodies were discovered on Gilgo Beach in 2010. He was first identified as a suspect in Costello's death in March of 2022, when investigators linked him to a pickup that was reportedly seen by a witness in 2010.\n\nAccording to an indictment, detectives on the case found credit card payments and phone calls made by Heuermann in the same area where someone used burner phones to contact several of the victims before they disappeared. Prosecutors said Heuermann's Tinder profile, where he went by the name \"Andy,\" had links to the burner phones.\n\nDetectives also found searches on other serial killers and \"sex workers, sadistic, torture-related pornography and child pornography\" on a burner email account investigators tied to Heuermann, the indictment said.\n\nA key breakthrough in the investigation came the next year, when a surveillance team saw Heuermann throw a pizza box into a trash can outside his office and DNA taken from the crust matched DNA from a hair found on one of the victims.\n\nDays after the arrest, Heuermann's wife Asa Ellerup filed for divorce.\n\nIn March, Ellerup's attorney wrote in a statement that she still visits her ex-husband weekly and \"believes he is not capable of the crimes he is accused of.\"\n\n\"I will listen to all of the evidence and withhold judgment until the end of trial,\"Ellerup said in the statement. \"I have given Rex the benefit of the doubt, as we all deserve.\"", "source": {"uri": "usatoday.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "USA Today"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gilgo,_New_York", "type": "loc", "score": 5,

A spokesperson for the Suffolk County District Attorney's Office declined comment to Daily Voice.\n\nHeuermann, a 60-year-old architect with an office in Manhattan, was arrested in July 2023 on murder charges in the deaths of three Gilgo Beach victims: Melissa Barthelemy, Megan Waterman, and Amber Lynn Costello.\n\nIn January 2024, Suffolk County prosecutors formally charged him with murdering a fourth victim, 25-year-old Maureen Brainard-Barnes.\n\nShe disappeared in July 2007 while working as a sex worker and her remains were discovered along a grassy area of the South Shore in 2010 near those of Barthelemy, Waterman, and Costello.\n\nInvestigators said all four were killed between July 2007 and September 2010 in what became known as the Gilgo Beach murders.\n\nHeuermann was arrested in July 2023 after authorities linked his DNA from a discarded pizza crust to DNA from a man's hair that was found on camouflage burlap used to restrain Waterman.\n\nInvestigators also linked Heuermann's email account to dozens of disturbing search queries, including \"girl begging for rape porn\" and \"torture redhead porn,\" prosecutors said. He reportedly looked up numerous news articles about the Gilgo Beach murders.\n\nHeuermann has pleaded not guilty to all charges and is awaiting trial.\n\nThis continues to be a developing story.

Heuermann has been indicted in the killings of two additional women, including a Queens resident whose remains were found in Southampton Town more than 30 years ago and who had only recently been connected to the Gilgo Beach investigation, sources tell Newsday.\n\nHeuermann, 60, of Massapequa Park, will be arraigned before State Supreme Court Justice Timothy Mazzei in Riverhead today for the July 2003 dismemberment death of Jessica Taylor and the November 1993 death of Sandra Costilla, whose killing Suffolk police and prosecutors had long associated with a different suspect.\n\nNewsday first reported the new indictment, which remains under seal, on Monday. Suffolk County District Attorney Ray Tierney has declined to comment on the indictment, confirming only that Heuermann will return to court at 9:30 a.m. Thursday and that he will be joined by additional law enforcement for a press briefing at 11 a.m.\n\nHeuermann, who was 30 years old when Costilla's remains were found on Cove Road in North Sea on Nov. 20, 1993, had previously not been charged in a killing committed earlier than 2007. He was arrested in July in charged in the deaths of three women whose remains were found near Gilgo Beach in 2010. He was charged with an additional death in January.\n\nTaylor and Costilla also represent the first alleged victims tied to Heuermann whose remains were discovered somewhere other than Ocean Parkway, expanding the area to which he allegedly dumped bodies by more than 40 miles.\n\nThe four previous murders he was charged with also did not include dismemberment, as was the case with Taylor, whose torso was found in Manorville days after she disappeared before her head, hands and forearm were found in March 2011 along Ocean Parkway, near Cedar Beach.\n\nCostilla, who also used the last name Cutello and was 28 when she was killed, had lived on Gates Avenue in Ridgewood, Queens until around 1992, police said at the time. She also previously lived in an apartment in Flushing, Queens, property records show.\n\nCostilla's death had not been tied to the Gilgo Beach investigation until K-9 units spent five hours in April searching the wooded North Sea property where her remains had been found.\n\nInstead, since as early as 1994, police had said Costilla's death may have been linked to the killings of Colleen McNamee and Rita Tangredi, a narrative that continued through the 2014 arrest of John Bittrolff, who was eventually convicted in the other two murders.\n\nCostilla was strangled and might have been raped, police said shortly after he remains were discovered. Similar to McNamee and Tangredi, her body was found nude, with her arms behind her back and wood chips present at the crime scene, the prosecutors who tried Bittrolff's case said. But the DNA linking Bittrolff to the other two victims was not present at Costilla's scene, former Assistant District Attorney Robert Biancavilla told reporters in 2014.\n\nDetectives attempted to elicit a confession from Bittrolff in Costilla's killing, according to court records, showing him her headshot and a photograph of her crime scene.\n\nUltimately, Bittrolff was never charged in Costilla's death, and he is currently serving a 50-years-to-life sentence at Clinton Correctional Center in upstate Dannemora. He is appealing his conviction.\n\nPolice in 1993 asked the public for help finding Costilla's family, saying they needed more information to aid in the investigation. Unlike the other alleged victims in the case, law enforcement has never described Costilla as a sex worker.\n\nTaylor grew up in Poughkeepsie and lived in New York City before she disappeared. She was 20 years old when she was reported missing, having last been seen at the Port Authority bus terminal in Manhattan.\n\nTaylor was a sex worker who was in a relationship with a man believed to be her pimp and boyfriend, though her family believes she had run away from the man shortly before she died. Her remains were identified in part by a tattoo that included the man's name.\n\nTaylor's torso was found off Halsey Manor Lane in Manorville about a mile south of where Valerie Mack's remains were discovered near the Long Island Expressway. Mack's death is not a part of the new indictment, sources said.\n\nGilgo Beach Task Force investigators searched the portion of Manorville where the remains of Taylor and Mack were discovered for nine days in April. Tierney called the search, and an additional six-day search of Heuermann's home, a \"necessary investigative step.\"\n\n\"On Thursday, you will see the fruits of that investigation,\" Tierney told reporters in Riverhead Monday.\n\n\"Once that court proceeding unfurls, we'll have more comment,\" the district attorney said.\n\nHeuermann defense attorney Michael J. Brown, of Central Islip, declined to comment on the eve of the arraignment.\n\nHeuermann previously pleaded not guilty in the deaths of four women -- Megan Waterman, Melissa Barthelemy, Amber Lynn Costello and Maureen Brainard-Barnes -- who were the first of 10 sets of remains found within proximity of each other along Ocean Parkway between late fall 2010 and early spring 2011.\n\nThe Manhattan architect has been held without bail since his July 13 arrest on first- and second-degree murder charges in the killings of Waterman, Barthelemy and Costello. He was charged in January with second-degree murder for the killing of Brainard-Barnes. All four women worked as sex workers and Heuermann had hundreds of contacts with sex workers in the years before he was arrested, prosecutors have said.\n\nProsecutors believe Heuermann acted alone in the first four killings he was charged with and that the cause of each woman's death was \"homicidal violence.\" Their bodies were found nude and bound, and they were contacted by burner phones consistent with Heuermann's locations, prosecutors have said. Five hairs connected to Heuermann or a family member were recovered from three of the four sets of remains, according to prosecutors.\n\nHeuermann was connected to the case primarily through cell site data, burner phone records and DNA evidence linking him to the women and the location where the bodies were found, prosecutors have said. A witness in Costello's disappearance also provided a description of a truck linked to Heuermann, which helped establish him as a suspect and was later recovered from his brother's property in South Carolina, prosecutors have said.\n\nA cheek swab, obtained from Heuermann by court order since he's been in custody, matched a mitochondrial DNA profile authorities who were surveilling Heuermann developed from a pizza crust and used napkin that allegedly were discarded in Manhattan, prosecutors have said.\n\nThe mitochondrial DNA profile developed from the pizza and napkin could not be excluded as a match to a hair found at the bottom of burlap used to \"restrain and transport\" the remains of Waterman, according to prosecutors.\n\nProsecutors said in court papers filed in March they had turned over 12 terabytes of data to Heuermann's defense, including a transcript of the grand jury presentation, 85 grand jury exhibits, autopsy reports, photographs from the crime scene and the medical examiner's office, search warrants and affidavits. Prosecutors said the defense also has been given paperwork from the Suffolk County Police Department and its crime lab, as well as outside laboratory documentation.\n\nAt Heuermann's most recent court appearance in April, Tierney and Suffolk Assistant District Attorney Nicholas Santomartino said prosecutors also recently turned over nearly 400 complete leads, a total of more than 7,000 other persons of interest in the 13-year investigation.", "source": {"uri": "newsday.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Newsday"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

His attorney, Michael J. Brown is at left. (Newsday /James Carbone)\n\nGilgo Beach serial killer suspect Rex Heuermann was charged Thursday with the murders of two more women -- one with a different modus operandi and the other suggesting that he allegedly got away with murder for twice as long as previously thought.\n\nA grand jury indicted the 60-year-old architect from Massapequa Park with the murders of Jessica Taylor, whose body was dismembered and remains were scattered in Manorville and off Ocean Parkway -- unlike The Gilgo Four, who were found intact -- and Sandra Castilla, who was found dead in North Sea in 1993, 14 years before than the previously known earliest victim, who was killed 16 years ago. Heuermann pleaded not guilty at Suffolk County court to the new murder charges, which increased the number of victims authorities accused him of killing from four to six.\n\n\"All of the evidence indicates that the defendant acted alone,\" Suffolk County District Attorney Raymond Tierney told reporters during a news conference following the court hearing.\n\nHeuermann was initially arrested in July 2023, when he pleaded not guilty to charges of murdering Megan Waterman, Amber Lynn Costello, and Melissa Barthelemy. He later also pleaded not guilty to killing Maureen Brainard-Barnes, who was killed in 2007, making her the first of the four victims found nearby one another in Gigo Beach in December 2010.\n\nAuthorities had previously considered Costilla, who was found in North Sea in November 1993, to be a victim of convicted double murderer John Bittrolff, of Manorville, because she was found in a similar manner to Bittrolff victims Colleen McNamee and Rita Tangredi. However, during the recent cadaver dog search in Manorville that was reportedly linked to the Gilgo Beach Homicide Investigation Task Force, police briefly expanded their search to a wooded area of North Sea where her remains were found.\n\nAuthorities linked Heuermann to the Costilla murder by matching the DNA in hairs found on the victim's body, according to court documents. That DNA evidence also ruled out Bittrolff, who recently lost a request for a retrial. Another hair on Costilla's body was linked to a woman who lived with Heuermann around the same time was also found on the victim, who was stabbed, according to investigators.\n\n\"If the new allegations prove true, Heuermann would have started killing serially at age 29, which is average for serial murderers,\" said Enzo Yaksic, director of the Atypical Homicide Research Group. \"At six, Heuermann has allegedly killed twice as many victims than the average modern-day serial murderer, who typically takes three lives before being apprehended over the span of just a year.\"\n\nTaylor was found a decade after Costilla, in July 2003, hidden in the brush off Halsey-Manor Road in Manorville. Her skull and limbs were found near Cedar Beach -- a short drive down Ocean Parkway from Gilgo -- in April 2011 following a search of the entire Jones Beach Island that ensued after the discovery of The Gilgo Four. Authorities also allegedly connected Heuermann to Taylor with DNA from hair found on the victim's body and with an eyewitness account of his Chevrolet Avalanche at the scene where her body was found, according to court documents.\n\n\"Jessica was a beautiful person,\" Jasmine Robinson, Taylor's cousin, told reporters. \"Simple memories such as sitting down to dinner together, drawing pictures, dancing, jump rope, and sleepovers with her and my sister are memories that I cherish. I was lucky to share my childhood with her and I wish every day that we got the chance to create more memories.\"\n\n\"It's a tragedy she never had children,\" Taylor's mother, Elizabeth Baczkiel, said at the press conference. \"Jessica would have made a great mother. She loved kids.\"\n\nDue to the difference in modus operandi between the Gilgo Four -- all of whom were found fully intact -- and Taylor as well as three other dismembered bodies found in the Gilgo area, former Suffolk County District Attorney Tom Spota and others had suggested more than one serial killer hid their victims bodies in the same area because of the difference in how the bodies were found. But Heuermann being charged with Taylor's murder suggests he allegedly changed how he tried to cover up his crimes.\n\n\"When the murders are over a long period, like these, various life circumstances can affect the killer's MO,\" Dr. Carole Lieberman, a forensic psychiatrist, said of Heuermann. \"In the early days he may have been more careful to try to conceal the victims, but then when no one came after him, he may have gotten cocky and lazy.\"\n\nTaylor was one of two victims found in both Manorville and Gilgo, but she was the first of the dismembered victims to be identified. Valerie Mack was initially found three years before Taylor in 2000, but wasn't identified until 2020. Although there are obvious similarities between the two cases, Heuermann was not charged with Mack's murder, although Tierney said Heuermann is a suspect in that case as well.\n\n\"I think that would be fair to say,\" Tierney said, asked directly about Valerie Mack.\n\nTwo other Gilgo-area victims were similarly scattered. Karen Vergata, the victim previously known as Fire Island Jane Doe until she was identified last year, was found dismembered on Fire Island in 1996 and on Tobay Beach in 2011. And the unidentified victim known as \"Peaches,\" so named for her tattoo, was found at Hempstead Lake State Park in 1997 and at Jones Beach in 2011. Two more victims, \"Baby Doe,\" daughter of Peaches and \"Asian Male Doe,\" were both found intact along Ocean Parkway in 2011.\n\nPolice were initially searching for Shannan Gilbert, a New Jersey woman reported missing from Oak Beach in May 2010, when the other remains were found. Her body was found in December 2012 in a marsh near where she was last seen. Authorities have said it is unclear whether she died, but her family maintains that she was murdered, based on the desperate 911 call she made.\n\n\"We're not going to stop,\" Tierney said of the continuing investigation. \"We owe that to the victims.\"\n\nMichael Brown, Heuermann's defense attorney, had less to say than usual. In the past, he has called the veracity of DNA evidence into question, and mentioned a need to look at others previously suspected in the case.\n\n\"The allegations are obviously very disturbing today,\" Brown told reporters. \"But I haven't seen anything and we'll do the best to review it and prepare a defense.\"\n\nRelated Story: Gilgo Beach Serial Killer Suspect Rex Heuermann an 'Ogre' Who

Heuermann has been indicted in the killings of two additional women, including a Queens resident whose remains were found in Southampton Town more than 30 years ago and who had only recently been connected to the Gilgo Beach investigation, sources told Newsday.\n\nHeuermann, 60, of Massapequa Park, will be arraigned before State Supreme Court Justice Timothy Mazzei in Riverhead Thursday in the July 2003 dismemberment death of Jessica Taylor and the November 1993 death of Sandra Costilla, whose killing Suffolk police and prosecutors had long associated with a different suspect.\n\nNewsday first reported the new indictment, which remains under seal, on Monday. Suffolk County District Attorney Ray Tierney has declined to comment on the indictment, confirming only that Heuermann will return to court at 9:30 a.m. Thursday and that he will be joined by additional law enforcement for a press briefing at 11 a.m.\n\nHeuermann, who was 30 years old when Costilla's remains were found on Cove Road in North Sea on Nov. 20, 1993, had previously not been charged in a killing committed earlier than 2007.\n\nTaylor and Costilla also represent the first alleged victims tied to Heuermann whose remains were discovered somewhere other than Ocean Parkway, expanding the area in which he allegedly dumped bodies by more than 40 miles.\n\nThe four previous killings he was charged with also did not include dismemberment, as was the case with Taylor, whose torso was found in Manorville days after she disappeared before her head, hands and forearm were found in March 2011 along Ocean Parkway, near Cedar Beach.\n\nCostilla, who also used the last name Cutello and was 28 when she was killed, had lived on Gates Avenue in Ridgewood, Queens, until around 1992, police said at the time. She also previously lived in an apartment in Flushing, Queens, property records show.\n\nCostilla's death had not been tied to the Gilgo Beach investigation until K-9 units spent five hours in April searching the wooded North Sea property where her remains had been found.\n\nInstead, since as early as 1994, police had said Costilla's death may have been linked to the killings of Colleen McNamee and Rita Tangredi, a narrative that continued through the 2014 arrest of John Bittrolff, who was eventually convicted in the other two murders.\n\nCostilla was strangled and might have been raped, police said shortly after her remains were discovered. Similar to McNamee and Tangredi, her body was found nude, with her arms behind her back and wood chips present at the crime scene, the prosecutors who tried Bittrolff's case said. But the DNA linking Bittrolff to the other two victims was not present at Costilla's scene, former Assistant District Attorney Robert Biancavilla told reporters in 2014.\n\nDetectives attempted to elicit a confession from Bittrolff in Costilla's killing, according to court records, showing him her headshot and a photograph of her crime scene.\n\nUltimately, Bittrolff was never charged in Costilla's death, and he is now serving a 50-years-to-life sentence at Clinton Correctional Center in upstate Dannemora. He is appealing his conviction.\n\nPolice in 1993 asked the public for help finding Costilla's family, saying they needed more information to aid in the investigation. Unlike the other alleged victims in the case, law enforcement has never described Costilla as a sex worker.\n\nTaylor grew up in Poughkeepsie and lived in New York City before she disappeared. She was 20 when she was reported missing, having last been seen at the Port Authority Bus Terminal in Manhattan.\n\nTaylor was a sex worker who was in a relationship with a man believed to be her pimp and boyfriend, though her family believes she had run away from the man shortly before she died. Her remains were identified in part by a tattoo that included the man's name.\n\nTaylor's torso was found off Halsey Manor Lane in Manorville about a mile south of where Valerie Mack's remains were discovered near the Long Island Expressway. Mack's death is not a part of the new indictment, sources said.\n\nGilgo Beach Task Force investigators searched the portion of Manorville where the remains of Taylor and Mack were discovered for nine days in April. Tierney called the search, and an additional six-day search of Heuermann's home, a \"necessary investigative step.\"\n\n\"On Thursday, you will see the fruits of that investigation,\" Tierney told reporters in Riverhead Monday.\n\nHeuermann defense attorney Michael J. Brown, of Central Islip, declined to comment on the eve of the arraignment.\n\nHeuermann previously pleaded not guilty in the deaths of four women -- Megan Waterman, Melissa Barthelemy, Amber Lynn Costello and Maureen Brainard-Barnes -- who were the first of 10 sets of remains found near each other along Ocean Parkway between late fall 2010 and early spring 2011.\n\nThe Manhattan architect has been held without bail since his July 13 arrest on first- and second-degree murder charges in the killings of Waterman, Barthelemy and Costello. He was charged in January with second-degree murder in the killing of Brainard-Barnes. All four women worked as sex workers and Heuermann had hundreds of contacts with sex workers in the years before he was arrested, prosecutors have said.\n\nProsecutors believe Heuermann acted alone in the first four killings he was charged with and that the cause of each woman's death was \"homicidal violence.\" Their bodies were found nude and bound, and they were contacted by burner phones consistent with Heuermann's locations, prosecutors have said. Five hairs connected to Heuermann or a family member were recovered from three of the four sets of remains, according to prosecutors.\n\nHeuermann was connected to the case primarily through cell site data, burner phone records and DNA evidence linking him to the women and the location where the bodies were found, prosecutors have said. A witness in Costello's disappearance also provided a description of a truck linked to Heuermann, which helped establish him as a suspect and was later recovered from his brother's property in South Carolina, prosecutors have said.\n\nA cheek swab, obtained from Heuermann by court order since he's been in custody, matched a mitochondrial DNA profile authorities who were surveilling Heuermann developed from a pizza crust and used napkin that allegedly were discarded in Manhattan, prosecutors have said.\n\nThe mitochondrial DNA profile developed from the pizza and napkin could not be excluded as a match to a hair found at the bottom of burlap used to \"restrain and transport\" the remains of Waterman, according to prosecutors.\n\nProsecutors said in court papers filed in March they had turned over 12 terabytes of data to Heuermann's defense, including a transcript of the grand jury presentation, 85 grand jury exhibits, autopsy reports, photographs from the crime scene and the medical examiner's office, search warrants and affidavits. Prosecutors said the defense also has been given paperwork from the Suffolk County Police Department and its crime lab, as well as outside laboratory documentation.\n\nAt Heuermann's most recent court appearance in April, Tierney and Suffolk Assistant District Attorney Nicholas Santomartino said prosecutors also recently turned over nearly 400 complete leads, a total of more than 7,000 other persons of interest in the 13-year investigation.", "source": {"uri": "newsday.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Newsday"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

In the meantime, investigators turned to the six other victims -- four women, a man and a toddler -- whose remains, like those of the first four women, were found along Ocean Parkway by Gilgo Beach.\n\nOn Thursday, Mr. Heuermann was charged with killing one of them: Jessica Taylor, whose partial remains were found near Gilgo Beach in 2011 and then linked to other partial remains found eight years earlier in a remote wooded area in Manorville, a 45-minute drive east.\n\nHe was also charged with killing Sandra Costilla, a 28-year-old New York woman whose remains were found in 1993 in the Hamptons. Her long unsolved murder had not previously been associated with the Gilgo Beach investigation.\n\nThe new indictment followed a recent flurry of activity in the investigation: a nine-day canine search completed last month in Manorville and a wooded area in Southampton where Ms. Costilla's body was found. Last month, investigators also conducted a six-day search of Mr. Heuermann's home in Massapequa Park, which had been exhaustively searched for two weeks last summer after his arrest.\n\nThe Gilgo investigation dates back to late 2010, when investigators discovered the first of 10 victims left along a desolate stretch of Ocean Parkway running east from Jones Beach.", "source": {"uri": "nytimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New York Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gilgo,_New_York", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gilgo, New York"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serial_killer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Serial killer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long_Island", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Long Island"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Long Island"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocean_Parkway_(Long_Island)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ocean Parkway (Long Island)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manorville,_New_York", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Manorville, New York"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Manorville, New York"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "New York (state)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southampton,_New_York", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Southampton, New York"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Southampton, New York"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jones_Beach_State_Park", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jones Beach State Park"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hamptons", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Hamptons"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massapequa_Park,_New_York", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Massapequa Park, New York"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Massapequa Park, New York"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Murder", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Murder", "wgt": 26}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Paranormal/Investigators", "label": "dmoz/Society/Paranormal/Investigators", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Unsolved", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Unsolved", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Women's_Health/Smoking", "label": "dmoz/Health/Women's Health/Smoking", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Party_Games/Murder_Mystery", "label": "dmoz/Games/Party Games/Murder Mystery", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 47}], "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/06/06/multimedia/06gilgo-indict-bqtp/06gilgo-indict-bqtp-videoSixteenByNineJumbo1600.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9620887", "eventUri": "eng-9620887", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.388235294117647, "wgt": 187, "relevance": 1}

It also has a place to note practical lessons for 'next time.'\n\nOne section, titled 'BODY PREP,' includes guidance to 'REMOVE HEAD AND HANDS,' as well as tattoos and trace DNA, and to wash the bodies.\n\nAnother section, 'THINGS TO REMEMBER,' appears to highlight lessons from previous killings that should be heeded, according to prosecutors.\n\nThe entries describe the importance of sleeping properly 'BEFORE HUNT,' using thick rope, and limiting noise to increase 'PLAY TIME.'\n\nHeuermann also allegedly listed potential and past dumping sites as well as the supplies he had at hand.\n\nThe alleged killer pleaded not guilty at the court hearing and was ordered held without bail.\n\nInvestigators in April spent days searching a property in the eastern Long Island hamlet of North Sea, where Sandra Costilla's body was discovered in 1993\n\nJessica Taylor vanished in 2003 while working as an escort in New York City. Some of her remains were discovered in Manorville that year\n\nIn addition to the hard drive, prosecutors say they found a book in Heuermann's possession by the retired FBI agent John Douglas, The Cases That Haunt Us.\n\nThey say the planning document also referenced specific pages in another work by Douglas, Mind Hunter, that allude to the personality types of serial killers and personality profiles of those who use mutilation and sexual violence.\n\nJessica Taylor vanished in 2003 while working as an escort in New York City. Some of her remains were discovered in Manorville that year. Other remains were found in a 2011 search of the beach scrub by the side of Ocean Parkway, the road where the other Gilgo Beach victims were found.\n\nShe had been decapitated and both of her arms were severed. Moreover, a tattoo on her torso had been 'severely obliterated by a sharp object,' per officials.\n\nInvestigators in April also spent days searching a property in the eastern Long Island hamlet of North Sea, where Costilla's body was discovered in 1993. Costilla, originally from Trinidad & Tobago, had lived in New York City.\n\nThe charges involving Costilla, who was killed 30 years ago, indicate that prosecutors believe Heuermann was killing victims for much longer longer than previously thought.\n\nProsecutors say one entry in the planning documents suggested he was involved in the death of another woman, Valerie Mack, who was found dismembered in the same vicinity as Taylor. Heuermann has not been charged in the death of Mack, who disappeared in 2000.\n\nSince late 2010, police have been investigating the deaths of at least 10 people -- mostly female sex workers -- whose remains were discovered along an isolated highway not far from Gilgo Beach on Long Island's south shore.\n\nThe victims had disappeared over a span of at least 14 years. Vexed police officers made only halting progress in identifying possible suspects.\n\nInvestigators long said it was likely that not all of the deaths were the work of the same killer.\n\nSome of the victims disappeared in the mid-1990s.

The new charges came just weeks after authorities renewed searches of Heuermann's home in Massapequa Park and a wooded area on Long Island where human remains were found over a decade ago.\n\nInvestigators found new evidence, including a document on a hard drive recovered from Heuermann's basement that they believe he used to plan the murders, according to a superseding bail application emailed to USA TODAY on Thursday.\n\nThe document lists \"supplies,\" including \"saw/cutting tools,\" and \"photo film,\" and a \"DS,\" which investigators believe stands for \"dump site.\" It also contains a \"dispose of the following\" section and the note, \"hunt too long seen in area too long.\"\n\nThe former New York architect has been in jail since July on charges in connection with the murder of four women - Maureen Brainard-Barnes, 25, Megan Waterman, 22, Melissa Barthelemy, 24, and Amber Costello, 27 - all sex workers whose bodies were discovered on the same strip of highway on Gilgo Beach on Long Island. Their remains were among 11 sets of remains found throughout suburban Long Island in 2010 and 2011.\n\nHeuermann has pleaded not guilty to all the charges. His trial date has not been set.\n\nHeuermann's attorney did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nHeuermann's arrest in July came more than a decade after the first bodies were discovered on Gilgo Beach in 2010. He was first identified as a suspect in Costello's death in March of 2022, when investigators linked him to a pickup that was reportedly seen by a witness in 2010.\n\nAccording to an indictment, detectives on the case found credit card payments and phone calls made by Heuermann in the same area where someone used burner phones to contact several of the victims before they disappeared. Prosecutors said Heuermann's Tinder profile, where he went by the name \"Andy,\" had links to the burner phones.\n\nDetectives also found searches on other serial killers and \"sex workers, sadistic, torture-related pornography and child pornography\" on a burner email account investigators tied to Heuermann, the indictment said.\n\nA key breakthrough in the investigation came the next year, when a surveillance team saw Heuermann throw a pizza box into a trash can outside his office and DNA taken from the crust matched DNA from a hair found on one of the victims.\n\nDays after the arrest, Heuermann's wife Asa Ellerup filed for divorce.\n\nIn March, Ellerup's attorney wrote in a statement that she still visits her ex-husband weekly and \"believes he is not capable of the crimes he is accused of.\"\n\n\"I will listen to all of the evidence and withhold judgment until the end of trial,\"Ellerup said in the statement. \"I have given Rex the benefit of the doubt, as we all deserve.\"\n\nCybele Mayes-Osterman is a breaking news reporter for USA Today.

Vexed police officers made only halting progress in identifying possible suspects. Investigators long said it was likely that not all of the deaths were the work of the same killer. Some of the victims disappeared in the mid-1990s. Investigators concluded that an 11th person who disappeared in 2010 from the barrier island community of Oak Beach had accidentally drowned.\n\nHeuermann, who lived across a bay from where the bodies were found, was arrested last July. Prosecutors said a new investigative task force used mobile phone location data and DNA samples to link the architect to some of the victims. He was charged with killing four of the women: Megan Waterman, Melissa Barthelemy, Amber Lynn Costello and Maureen Brainard-Barnes.\n\nInvestigators who had searched Heuermann's home extensively and dug up his yard last summer returned to the house again last month and spent nearly a week searching it again. They focused their efforts mostly in the basement, according to a lawyer for Heuermann's wife.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nThat followed a search in April of a wooded area in Manorville, about 40 miles (65 kilometers) east of Heuermann's home, linked to two other Gilgo Beach victims.\n\nYou might be interested in Peterborough And Area News Dec 31, 1969 Peterborough And Area News Dec 31, 1969 ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nValerie Mack, 24, who had been working as an escort in Philadelphia, disappeared in 2000 and was last seen by her family in Port Republic, New Jersey.

Heuermann, 60, of Massapequa Park, had not previously been charged in a killing committed earlier than 2007.\n\nIn court documents posted ahead of the hearing, prosecutors said they had discovered a \"planning document\" on the hard drive found in Heuermann's basement that they believe he used to \"methodically blueprint\" his killings.\n\nThe document, the filing said, includes Heuermann's concerns about leaving behind forensic evidence, guidance for cleaning and washing bodies, and notes on how to improve \"next time\".\n\nIn addition to the murders of four women - Megan Waterman, Melissa Barthelemy, Amber Lynn Costello and Maureen Brainard-Barnes - Heuermann, who was arrested on a midtown Manhattan street last summer, is now charged with the July 2003 dismemberment death of Jessica Taylor and the November 1993 death of Sandra Costilla.\n\nHe has pleaded not guilty to the first set of murder charges and is being held without bail.\n\nSuffolk police and prosecutors had long associated the murder of Costilla with a different suspect. Her remains were found in North Sea, close to the tony Manhattan summer Hamptons resort towns, on 20 November 1993.\n\nThe indictment for the murder of Jessica Taylor, who was 20 at the time of her disappearance, marks the first time the suspected serial killer has been charged with dismemberment in addition to murder.\n\nProsecutors have said they believe Heuermann acted alone in the first four killings he was charged with, and linked him to those deaths through cellphone tower data, burner phone records and DNA evidence.\n\nTaylor's torso was found in Manorville, in central Long Island, days after she disappeared in 2003. Her head, hands and forearm were found in March 2011 40 miles away and close to where the Gilgo Beach victims were found. Her remains were identified in part by a tattoo that included the name of her pimp.\n\nBut the murder of Valerie Mack, another woman whose remains were found close to Taylor, was not charged in the new indictment. But the new indictment suggests that Heuermann's alleged reign of sexual violence and murder was far longer than previously suspected as well as more geographically dispersed.\n\nCostilla's murder was previously linked to the killings of Colleen McNamee and Rita Tangredi. In 2014, police arrested John Bittrolff for those murders. He was later convicted and is serving a 50-year-sentence in Dannemore prison in upstate New York.\n\nBittroloff was never charged with Costilla's murder because DNA present in the murders of McNamee and Tangredi was not present and he denied the crime.\n\nLast month, investigators with the Gilgo Beach taskforce spent six days searching Heuermann's home, and nine days searching woodland where the remains of Taylor and Mack were discovered in April. District attorney Ray Tierney called the searches a \"necessary investigative step\".", "source": {"uri": "theguardian.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Guardian"}, "authors": [{"uri":

Her additional remains -- initially labeled \"Jane Doe No. 5\" -- were discovered on March 29, 2011, along Ocean Parkway.\n\nCostilla was murdered in 1993 but had not been included among the so-called Gilgo Beach victims -- until now. Investigators suspected convicted serial killer John Bittrolff in Costilla's death, but he was never charged in her slaying -- which remains one of several unsolved Long Island murders.\n\nHeuermann, 60, is already charged in the deaths of four other women whose remains were found dumped along Ocean Parkway on Long Island's South Shore.\n\nThe married Massapequa Park dad was arrested on July 13, 2023, in the deaths of the women, who are known collectively as the \"Gilgo Four.\"\n\nHe was originally charged with three of the murders -- Megan Waterman, 22; Melissa Barthelemy, 24; and Amber Lynn Costello, 27 -- until January, when he was charged with the murder of a fourth woman, 25-year-old Maureen Brainard-Barnes.\n\nThe Heuermann home has been searched twice since he was arrested.\n\nCops said they found a concrete, sound-proof room in the basement where he kept more than 200 guns during the first search of the house last summer, with a second warrant executed last month.\n\nSuffolk County prosecutors said Heuermann was linked to the slayings through general DNA matches -- including from hair found on a discarded pizza crust and on an energy drink his daughter threw away.\n\nInvestigators also used cell phone towers to pinpoint calls Heuermann allegedly made to the victims, who were sex escorts he solicited on Long Island.\n\nThe case sat dormant until the start of 2022, when former NYPD chief Rodney Harrison took over as Suffolk County police commissioner and vowed to reopen the case.\n\nHe was identified as a suspect about two months later.\n\nBrainard-Barnes was the first of the \"Gilgo Four\" to go missing, disappearing in July 2007 after taking a train from Connecticut to Grand Central Terminal, with her body found in December 2010.\n\nBarthelemy disappeared in July 2009 and was also later found along the lonely stretch of the waterfront, where the remains of Costello and Waterman were discovered in late 2010.", "source":

(AP) -- The New York architect accused of murdering multiple women and leaving their corpses scattered along the Long Island coast kept a \"blueprint\" of his crimes on his computer, prosecutors revealed Thursday as they brought charges against Rex Heuermann in two more killings.\n\nHeuermann, 60, appeared before a judge to be arraigned in the deaths of Jessica Taylor and Sandra Costilla, two young women who were long suspected of being the victims of men preying on sex workers. He had previously been charged with murdering four other women in a string of deaths known as the Gilgo Beach serial killings.\n\n\u00d7\n\nAlready a Subscriber? Sign in You are logged in Switch accounts\n\nTaylor disappeared in 2003. Costilla was killed 30 years ago, in 1993, and her inclusion in the case indicates that prosecutors now believe Heuermann was killing women for much longer than previously thought.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nThe new charges came just days after police finished extensive searches of Heuermann's Massapequa Park home and a wooded area on Long Island tied to the investigation.\n\nIn a court filing, prosecutors said they were able to use new forensic testing methods to match hairs found on or near the vicinity of both victims to a DNA profile that is a likely match to Heuermann. Additionally, prosecutors say they recovered a file on a hard drive in his basement used to \"methodically blueprint\" his killings.\n\nThe all-caps document features a series of checklists with tasks to complete before, during and after the killings, as well as practical lessons for \"next time.\" Among the dozens of entries written are reminders to clean the bodies and destroy evidence, to \"get sleep before hunt\" and to \"have story set.\"\n\nOne section, titled \"things to remember,\" appears to highlight lessons from previous killings, prosecutors said, such as using heavier rope and limiting noise in order to maximize \"play time.\" A \"body prep\" checklist includes, among other items, a note to \"remove head and hands.\"\n\nProsecutors believe that entry may connect Heuermann to yet another victim, Valerie Mack, whose partial skeletal remains were discovered near the body of Taylor after her disappearance in 2000.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nHeuermann has not been charged in the death of Mack. But asked during a news conference after Thursday's hearing if he was a suspect, District Attorney Ray Tierney replied, \"That's fair to say.\"\n\nHeuermann pleaded not guilty to killing Taylor and Costilla during the hearing and was ordered held without bail. His lawyer, Michael Brown, said outside court that Heuermann is \"obviously in a bad place in terms of the new charges.\"\n\nAfterward, Tierney said the additional charges provide \"some small measure of closure\" for the victims' families.\n\nSince late 2010, police have been investigating the deaths of at least 10 people -- mostly female sex workers -- whose remains were discovered along an isolated highway not far from Gilgo Beach on Long Island's south shore.\n\nThose victims had disappeared over a span of at least 14 years. Vexed police officers made only halting progress in identifying possible suspects. Investigators long said it was likely that not all of the deaths were the work of the same killer. Some of the victims disappeared in the mid-1990s. Investigators concluded that an 11th person who disappeared in 2010 from the barrier island community of Oak Beach had accidentally drowned.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nHeuermann, who lived across a bay from where the bodies were found, was arrested last July. Prosecutors said a new investigative task force used mobile phone location data and DNA samples to link the architect to some of the victims. He was charged with killing four of the women: Megan Waterman, Melissa Barthelemy, Amber Lynn Costello and Maureen Brainard-Barnes.\n\nInvestigators who had searched Heuermann's home extensively and dug up his yard last summer returned to the house again last month and spent nearly a week searching it again. They focused their efforts mostly in the basement, according to a lawyer for Heuermann's wife.\n\nThat followed a search in April of a wooded area in Manorville, about 40 miles (65 kilometers) east of Heuermann's home, and in the Southampton hamlet of North Sea, where Costilla's remains were discovered decades ago.\n\nTierney said the planning document was recovered in March of this year, providing the impetus for the recent searches.\n\nProsecutors also said they found a book in Heuermann's possession by the retired FBI agent John Douglas, \"The Cases That Haunt Us.\" They say the planning document referenced specific pages in another work by Douglas, \"Mind Hunter,\" that allude to the personality types of serial killers and profiles of those who use mutilation and sexual violence.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nJessica Taylor, 20, vanished in 2003 while working as an escort in New York City. Some of her remains were discovered in Manorville that year. Other remains were found in a 2011 search of the beach scrub by the side of Ocean Parkway, the road where the other Gilgo Beach victims were found.\n\nTaylor's mother, Elizabeth Baczkiel, was at the courthouse for Thursday's court hearing. She held up childhood photos of her daughter but didn't speak to reporters. Her lawyer, Gloria Allred, read a statement from Baczkiel in which she described her daughter as \"loving, compassionate and so funny,\" and said she would have made a great mother.\n\n\"My darling daughter, you will never be forgotten,\" the statement said. \"You will forever be in our hearts.\"\n\nValerie Mack, 24, who had been working as an escort in Philadelphia, disappeared in 2000 and was last seen by her family in Port Republic, New Jersey, near Atlantic City. Some of her skeletal remains were discovered that same year in the Manorville woods. More of her remains were found in 2011 in the search around Gilgo Beach.\n\nInitially known as \"Jane Doe No. 6,\" Mack's remains had been unidentified for years until genetic testing revealed her identity in 2020.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nCostilla was 28 when she was killed and had lived in New York City.\n\nA decade ago, Suffolk County prosecutors said publicly that they believed Costilla had been killed by a carpenter who lived in the area, John Bittrolff, who was convicted of murdering two other women whose bodies had been found on the same part of Long Island.

In the meantime, investigators turned to the six other victims -- four women, a man and a toddler -- whose remains, like those of the first four women, were found along Ocean Parkway by Gilgo Beach.\n\nOn Thursday, Heuermann was charged with killing one of them: Jessica Taylor, whose partial remains were found near Gilgo Beach in 2011 and then linked to other partial remains found eight years earlier in a remote wooded area in Manorville, a 45-minute drive east.\n\nHe was also charged with killing Sandra Costilla, a 28-year-old New York woman whose remains were found in 1993 in the Hamptons. Her long unsolved killing had not previously been associated with the Gilgo Beach investigation.\n\nThe new indictment followed a recent flurry of activity in the investigation: a nine-day canine search completed last month in Manorville and a wooded area in Southampton where Costilla's body was found. Last month, investigators also conducted a six-day search of Heuermann's home in Massapequa Park, which had been exhaustively searched for two weeks last summer after his arrest.\n\nThe Gilgo investigation dates back to late 2010, when investigators discovered the first of 10 victims left along a desolate stretch of Ocean Parkway running east from Jones Beach.\n\nThe first four discovered, known as the Gilgo Four, seemed to be the prey of a serial killer. They were all young, petite women bound with burlap, belts and tape. Their bodies had been dumped over a quarter-mile stretch in the previous three years, authorities said.\n\nProsecutors used DNA from human hairs found on the tape to connect the bodies to Heuermann. That plus burner phone records and his internet history linked him to the women and the location where the bodies were found, prosecutors said.\n\nBut the other six sets of remains were colder cases with fewer clues and more inconsistent characteristics than the Gilgo Four.\n\nThey had disappeared as long ago as the mid-1990s, when mobile phones and internet use were rare -- along with the clues they leave. Four were dismembered, and their remains were exposed to the elements for more than a decade.\n\nDNA matches remained so sparse for the six bodies during the first decade of the investigation that only one victim, Taylor, was identified. In recent years, Karen Vergata and Valerie Mack have been named as victims, while the other three have remained unidentified.\n\nMichael J. Brown, Heuermann's lawyer, has challenged the genetic evidence as \"one strand of hair\" and has floated an alternate theory about the case: that the investigation into the killings was tainted years ago by the involvement of a now-disgraced Long Island police chief, James Burke. Burke, who oversaw the investigation as head of the Suffolk County Police Department from 2012-15, later became a symbol of police corruption and spent time in federal prison.", "source": {"uri": "heraldonline.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Herald"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gilgo,_New_York", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gilgo, New York"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "New York (state)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serial_killer", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Serial killer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indictment", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Indictment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocean_Parkway_(Long_Island)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ocean Parkway (Long Island)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acquittal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Acquittal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long_Island", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Long Island"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Long Island"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Murder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manorville,_New_York", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Manorville, New York"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Manorville, New York"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southampton,_New_York", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Southampton, New York"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Southampton, New York"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jones_Beach_State_Park", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jones Beach State Park"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "DNA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hamptons", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Hamptons"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Internet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massapequa_Park,_New_York", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Massapequa Park, New York"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Massapequa Park, New York"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suffolk_County_Police_Department", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Suffolk County Police Department"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Police_corruption", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Police corruption"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edmund_Burke", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Edmund Burke"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_of_police", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chief of police"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawyer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lawyer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_phone", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mobile phone"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Murder", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Murder", "wgt": 24}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Paranormal/Investigators", "label": "dmoz/Society/Paranormal/Investigators", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Victims", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Victims", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 57}], "image": "https://www.mcclatchy-wires.com/incoming/csogmp/picture289061494/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1140/16292851-4455-4ce4-88e0-e433bed06b2d", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9620887", "eventUri": "eng-9620887", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.5607843137254902, "wgt": 184, "relevance": 1}

He had previously been charged with murdering four other women in a string of deaths known as the Gilgo Beach serial killings.\n\nTaylor disappeared in 2003.

Additionally, prosecutors say they recovered a file on a hard drive in his basement used to \"methodically blueprint\" his killings.\n\nThe all-caps document features a series of checklists with tasks to complete before, during and after the killings, as well as practical lessons for \"next time.\" Among the dozens of entries written are reminders to clean the bodies and destroy evidence, to \"get sleep before hunt\" and to \"have story set.\"\n\nOne section, titled \"things to remember,\" appears to highlight lessons from previous killings, prosecutors said, such as using heavier rope and limiting noise in order to maximize \"play time.\" A \"body prep\" checklist includes, among other items, a note to \"remove head and hands.\"\n\nProsecutors believe that entry may connect Heuermann to yet another victim, Valerie Mack, whose partial skeletal remains were discovered near the body of Taylor after her disappearance in 2000.\n\nHeuermann has not been charged in the death of Mack. But asked during a news conference after Thursday's hearing if he was a suspect, District Attorney Ray Tierney replied, \"That's fair to say.\"\n\nHeuermann pleaded not guilty to killing Taylor and Costilla during the hearing and was ordered held without bail. His lawyer, Michael Brown, said outside court that Heuermann is \"obviously in a bad place in terms of the new charges.\"\n\nAfterward, Tierney said the additional charges provide \"some small measure of closure\" for the victims' families.\n\nSince late 2010, police have been investigating the deaths of at least 10 people -- mostly female sex workers -- whose remains were discovered along an isolated highway not far from Gilgo Beach on Long Island's south shore.\n\nThose victims had disappeared over a span of at least 14 years. Vexed police officers made only halting progress in identifying possible suspects. Investigators long said it was likely that not all of the deaths were the work of the same killer. Some of the victims disappeared in the mid-1990s. Investigators concluded that an 11th person who disappeared in 2010 from the barrier island community of Oak Beach had accidentally drowned.\n\nHeuermann, who lived across a bay from where the bodies were found, was arrested last July. Prosecutors said a new investigative task force used mobile phone location data and DNA samples to link the architect to some of the victims. He was charged with killing four of the women: Megan Waterman, Melissa Barthelemy, Amber Lynn Costello and Maureen Brainard-Barnes.\n\nInvestigators who had searched Heuermann's home extensively and dug up his yard last summer returned to the house again last month and spent nearly a week searching it again. They focused their efforts mostly in the basement, according to a lawyer for Heuermann's wife.\n\nThat followed a search in April of a wooded area in Manorville, about 40 miles (65 kilometers) east of Heuermann's home, and in the Southampton hamlet of North Sea, where Costilla's remains were discovered decades ago.\n\nTierney said the planning document was recovered in March of this year, providing the impetus for the recent searches.\n\nProsecutors also said they found a book in Heuermann's possession by the retired FBI agent John Douglas, \"The Cases That Haunt Us.\" They say the planning document referenced specific pages in another work by Douglas, \"Mind Hunter,\" that allude to the personality types of serial killers and profiles of those who use mutilation and sexual violence.\n\nJessica Taylor, 20, vanished in 2003 while working as an escort in New York City. Some of her remains were discovered in Manorville that year. Other remains were found in a 2011 search of the beach scrub by the side of Ocean Parkway, the road where the other Gilgo Beach victims were found.\n\nTaylor's mother, Elizabeth Baczkiel, was at the courthouse for Thursday's court hearing. She held up childhood photos of her daughter but didn't speak to reporters. Her lawyer, Gloria Allred, read a statement from Baczkiel in which she described her daughter as \"loving, compassionate and so funny,\" and said she would have made a great mother.\n\n\"My darling daughter, you will never be forgotten,\" the statement said. \"You will forever be in our hearts.\"\n\nValerie Mack, 24, who had been working as an escort in Philadelphia, disappeared in 2000 and was last seen by her family in Port Republic, New Jersey, near Atlantic City. Some of her skeletal remains were discovered that same year in the Manorville woods. More of her remains were found in 2011 in the search around Gilgo Beach.\n\nInitially known as \"Jane Doe No. 6,\" Mack's remains had been unidentified for years until genetic testing revealed her identity in 2020.\n\nCostilla was 28 when she was killed and had lived in New York City.\n\nA decade ago, Suffolk County prosecutors said publicly that they believed Costilla had been killed by a carpenter who lived in the area, John Bittrolff, who was convicted of murdering two other women whose bodies had been found on the same part of Long Island. But Bittrolff was never charged with Costilla's death due to lack of evidence. He insists he is innocent of any murders.\n\nHeuermann's lawyer, Brown, said he planned to request the prosecution's files on Bittrolff.\n\n\"Quite frankly, the police department and the district attorney's office all had the finger pointed at Bittrolff for that murder,\" he said. ___\n\nFollow Philip Marcelo at twitter.com/philmarcelo.\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

The charges come after authorities expanded their search for possible human remains on Long Island, WABC reported in April.\n\nThe new charges come almost a year after Heuermann's bombshell arrest in the case. For years, remains had been found along Long Island's Gilgo Beach with no suspect, sparking fear in the community. Heuermann was initially charged in the deaths of Megan Waterman, 22, Amber Lynn Costello, 27, and Melissa Barthelemy, 24. He was then charged in the death of Maureen Brainard-Barnes; the four women had been known as the Gilgo Four.\n\nHeuermann, a longtime Long Island resident, was arrested outside his Manhattan architecture firm's office in July of last year after detectives obtained DNA evidence from a pizza box he thrown out in Midtown that linked him to Waterman's case, according to a bail application obtained by HuffPost.\n\nDetectives also reviewed Heuermann's cellphone data, which revealed he allegedly used burner phones to arrange meetings with his victims before killing them, according to the bail application. Prosecutors also alleged that Heuermann used Brainard-Barnes' and Barthelemy's cellphones after their deaths.\n\nAccording to the filing, Heuermann allegedly killed the women while his wife and children were traveling out of state or out of the country so they would not \"uncover or learn of his involvement in these crimes.\"\n\nHeuermann's now ex-wife, Asa Ellerup, filed for divorce last year shortly after his arrest.

That allegedly allowed Heuermann \"unfettered time to execute his plans for each victim without any fear that his family would uncover or learn of his involvement in these crimes,\" prosecutors previously said in an indictment.\n\nLess than a week after Heuermann's arrest, his wife filed for divorce. But she has since said she does not believe Heuermann is capable of the crimes he's accused of.\n\nIn January, Heuermann's attorney Michael Brown told reporters the former New York architect claimed he's \"not guilty of these charges\" and looks forward to fighting the charges in court.\n\n'We are not near the end of this investigation,' law enforcement source says\n\nLaw enforcement sources told CNN that investigators uncovered evidence during searches of the Manorville area of Long Island as well as Heuermann's home earlier this year that helped advance the investigation.\n\nDetectives believe, based on \"offender characteristics\" of serial killers, there may be more alleged killings, according to officials who have been briefed on the investigation.\n\n\"In most of these cases, a serial killer does not start killing in his 40s,\" said a law enforcement official familiar with the case.\n\nThat belief spurred investigators to not only expand their attempts to identify unidentified victims, re-examine dump sites and conduct additional searches of Heuermann's home, but to also begin reexamining unsolved missing persons cases.\n\nInvestigators are also looking at seemingly unrelated unsolved homicides where there may be similarities among the victims, the crime scenes or condition of the bodies.\n\n\"We are not near the end of this investigation,\" one law enforcement official involved in the sweeping case said. \"We are very much at the beginning.\"\n\nCNN's Emma Tucker and Ray Sanchez contributed to this report.\n\nThe-CNN-Wire\n\n\u2122 & \u00a9 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

His defense attorney said a tearful Heuermann declared, \"I didn't do this.\"\n\nThe charges are the latest development in a case that has confounded detectives for over a decade.\n\nShannan Gilbert vanished on Long Island's South Shore on May 1, 2010.\n\nIn May 2022, Suffolk County police released 911 audio related to Gilbert's disappearance. The sex worker initially called 911 from inside the home of a client in Oak Beach shortly before 5 a.m. May 1, 2010.\n\n\"There is somebody after me,\" she told the dispatcher multiple times. \"Somebody's after me -- please,\" she said.\n\nGilbert didn't give her location but said she was on Long Island. At times during the call, she was heard speaking to her driver and security, Michael Pak, saying \"Please, get me out of here, Mike.\"\n\nDuring the search for Gilbert, authorities found the remains of four other women.\n\nGilbert's remains were discovered in December 2011 in a marsh not far from where she was last seen.\n\nOn Dec. 11, 2010, human remains were found by a police officer and his police dog during a training exercise, according to court documents. They were later determined to belong to Melissa Barthelemy, 24.\n\nTwo days after Barthelemy was found, Suffolk County police found three more sets of human remains within a quarter-mile of the first discovery, according to court documents.\n\nMaureen Brainard-Barnes, Megan Waterman and Amber Costello were identified as the victims.\n\nThe cause of death of all four women was determined to be homicidal violence.\n\nThe victims' bodies were found not far from one another and about 22 to 33 feet from the edge of the Ocean Parkway. Authorities said they ranged in age from 22 to 27, were sex workers and described as petite.\n\nHeuermann has been charged in connection with the deaths of Barthelemy, Waterman and Costello.\n\nSome of the bodies found on Gilgo Beach were partial, and the rest were found in a wooded area of Manorville, Long Island, years before the search for Shannan Gilbert.\n\nJessica Taylor was one of those. Taylor's skeletal remains were found in Manorville on July 26, 2003 -- but additional remains were found along Ocean Parkway on March 29, 2011, during the search for Gilbert, police said.\n\nThe remains of Valerie Mack, 24, who was last working in Philadelphia, were found in Manorville and Gilgo Beach years apart, according to police.\n\nPartial skeletal remains were found in Manorville in September 2000, the same year she went missing. On April 4, 2011, her dismembered remains were found on Gilgo Beach.\n\nShe was known as \"Jane Doe #6\" until May 2020, when investigators used genetic genealogy to identify her. She had last been seen by her family in Port Republic, New Jersey, in 2000.\n\nThat same day, investigators found the remains of a child, believed to be around 2 years old, who is still unidentified. The remains were found along Ocean Parkway near where Mack's remains were found, police said.\n\nOn April 4, 2011, the remains of an unidentified Asian male were found along Ocean Parkway. He was estimated to be between 17 and 23 when he died, which authorities believe was likely 5 to 10 years before the discovery.\n\nHe is listed as a victim on a police website containing information about the Gilgo Beach cases.\n\nTwo sets of remains were found off Ocean Parkway about 7 miles from Gilgo Beach.\n\nOne person has not been identified and is known as \"Jane Doe 7,\" according to the police website about the cases.\n\nThe second set is believed to be those of the mother of the toddler whose remains had previously been found.\n\nIn an effort to generate leads, Suffolk County police released new information about evidence and said a website would be launched, Gilgo News, to help advance the case.\n\nThe revelations included details about a belt with the initials \"WH or HM\" that police believed the then-unknown suspect handled at one of the crime scenes.\n\nThe Gilgo Homicide Investigation Task Force included state and federal agencies.\n\nHeuermann is believed to have searched the Internet between March 2022 and June 2023 about serial killers, how police investigate them, and also for information about the task force, according to court documents.\n\nAs part of a renewed investigation, officials discovered a first-generation Chevy Avalanche was registered to Heuermann at the time of the murders, according to court documents.\n\n\"This was significant, because a witness to the disappearance of Amber Costello identified a first-generation Chevrolet Avalanche as the vehicle believed to have been driven by her killer,\" prosecutors wrote in opposing any bail for Heuermann after his arrest.\n\nThe discovery of the Avalanche, a pickup, led to a \"comprehensive investigation\" of Heuermann, with more than 300 subpoenas, search warrants and other ways to get or process evidence, prosecutors wrote in court documents.\n\nBilling records connected Heuermann to cell site locations where \"burner phones\" were used to arrange meetings, according to the document.\n\nThe records allegedly show Heuermann was in the same location as the burner cellphones used to contact Barthelemy, Waterman and Costello.\n\nIn one case on July 10, 2009, records show the burner phone and Heuermann's phone were in the same location and traveled together from Massapequa to New York City, prosecutors wrote.\n\nThen, both Barthelemy's phone and Heuermann's phone traveled eastbound toward Massapequa, according to the court document filed by prosecutors.\n\nJuly 10, 2009, was the last day Barthelemy was seen alive, according to prosecutors.\n\nIn July 2022, a Suffolk County police detective took 11 bottles from the trash outside Heuermann's home for testing.\n\nOn Feb. 24, a forensic lab concluded that a hair found on Waterman's remains matched the DNA from the bottle, according to court documents.\n\nThat is believed to have been from Heuermann's wife, prosecutors wrote. His wife was out of New York at the times of the murders, according to the document.\n\nA hair from Costello's remains was tested and also was a match for the DNA on a bottle, it says. Prosecutors wrote that means it's likely the burlap, tape, vehicles or other things used in the killings came from his home, or was transferred to them from his clothes.\n\nSuffolk County police officers arrest Heuermann at his home on the evening of July 13. Searches are ongoing, officials said.\n\nA grand jury indicted Heuermann in connection with the deaths of Barthelemy, Waterman and Costello, Suffolk County District Attorney Raymond A. Tierney said July 14.\n\nTierney said the investigation into Brainard-Barnes is ongoing.\n\nHe said that after the bodies were found in December 2010, the cases went cold.\n\n\"And then there was nothing, absolutely nothing,\" he said. \"For the next 13 years, their cases went unsolved -- until today.\"\n\nTierney said Friday that \"this case is not over, it's only beginning,\" and that more search warrants would be sought.\n\nCORRECTION (July 17, 2023, 2:44 p.m. ET): A previous version of this article misstated when Valerie Mack was identified.

Vexed police officers made only halting progress in identifying possible suspects. Investigators long said it was likely that not all of the deaths were the work of the same killer. Some of the victims disappeared in the mid-1990s. Investigators concluded that an 11th person who disappeared in 2010 from the barrier island community of Oak Beach had accidentally drowned.\n\nHeuermann, who lived across a bay from where the bodies were found, was arrested last July. Prosecutors said a new investigative task force used mobile phone location data and DNA samples to link the architect to some of the victims. He was charged with killing four of the women: Megan Waterman, Melissa Barthelemy, Amber Lynn Costello and Maureen Brainard-Barnes.\n\nInvestigators who had searched Heuermann's home extensively and dug up his yard last summer returned to the house again last month and spent nearly a week searching it again. They focused their efforts mostly in the basement, according to a lawyer for Heuermann's wife.\n\nThat followed a search in April of a wooded area in Manorville, about 40 miles (65 kilometers) east of Heuermann's home, linked to two other Gilgo Beach victims.\n\nValerie Mack, 24, who had been working as an escort in Philadelphia, disappeared in 2000 and was last seen by her family in Port Republic, New Jersey. Some of her skeletal remains were discovered that same year in the Manorville woods. More of her remains were found in 2011 in the search around Gilgo Beach.\n\nInitially known as ''Jane Doe No. 6,'' Mack's remains had been unidentified for years until genetic testing revealed her identity in 2020.\n\nJessica Taylor, 20, vanished in 2003 while working as an escort in New York City. Some of her remains were discovered in Manorville that year. Other remains were found in a 2011 search of the beach scrub by the side of Ocean Parkway, the road where the other Gilgo Beach victims were found.\n\nRelatives for Mack and Taylor declined to comment Wednesday.\n\nHeuermann's lawyer and the lawyers separately representing his wife and two adult children declined to comment.\n\nHeuermann, who has been in custody since his arrest, has pleaded not guilty. He had been set to return to court on June 18 for a status hearing. No trial date has been set.\n\nFollow Philip Marcelo at twitter.com/philmarcelo.", "source": {"uri": "startribune.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Star Tribune"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New York (state)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gilgo,_New_York", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Gilgo, New York"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long_Island", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Long Island"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Long Island"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serial_killer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Serial killer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/District_attorney", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "District attorney"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suffolk_County,_New_York", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Suffolk County, New York"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Suffolk County, New York"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massapequa_Park,_New_York", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Massapequa Park, New York"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Massapequa Park, New York"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barrier_island", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Barrier island"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex_worker", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sex worker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bay", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bay"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Task_force", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Task force"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA_profiling", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "DNA profiling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oak_Beach,_New_York", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Oak Beach, New York"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Oak Beach, New York"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manorville,_New_York", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Manorville, New York"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Manorville, New York"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocean_Parkway_(Long_Island)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ocean Parkway (Long Island)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_testing", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Genetic testing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acquittal", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Acquittal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawyer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lawyer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philadelphia", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port_Republic,_New_Jersey", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Port Republic, New Jersey"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Port Republic, New Jersey"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Law_Enforcement", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Law Enforcement", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Murder", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Murder", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Victims", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Victims", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 52}], "image": "https://www.startribune.com/static/img/branding/logos/strib-social-card.png?d=1717510706", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9620887", "eventUri": "eng-9620887", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-18", "textStart": 3315, "textEnd": 3322}], "sentiment": -0.4901960784313726, "wgt": 181, "relevance": 1}

Please try again later{{ /verifyErrors }}\n\nAccused Gilgo Beach serial killer Rex Heuermann has been charged with the brutal murders of two more women, whose remains were found over two decades ago, including a victim whom investigators had previously linked to a different suspect.\n\nHeuermann, 60, was back in court in Riverhead, New York, on Thursday morning where he was arraigned on murder charges in the 2003 dismemberment death of 20-year-old Jessica Taylor and the 1993 death of 28-year-old Sandra Costilla. He pleaded not guilty to the shocking charges that came just days after another exhaustive search at his Long Island home.\n\nThe former Manhattan architect, who was first arrested in July 2023, has already been charged with the 2009 and 2010 murders of Megan Waterman, Melissa Barthelemy, Amber Lynn Costello and Maureen Brainard-Barnes - collectively known as the \"Gilgo Four\" - after their remains were found in burlap sacks along Ocean Parkway.\n\nThe remains of the four women were the first of 10 found along a remote beach parkway on Long Island between late fall 2010 and early spring 2011. All four women were sex workers, authorities have said.\n\nJessica Taylor, a Poughkeepsie resident who worked as an escort in New York City, was found dismembered in a wooded area of Manorville, New York, on July 26, 2003. Her torso was found, but other parts were missing.\n\nThose remains, including her head, hands and forearm were discovered years later - along Ocean Parkway on March 29, 2011 - and initially labeled \"Jane Doe No. 5.\"\n\nSandra Costilla was a resident of Queens whose remains were found on November 20, 1993, on Cove Road in North Sea, a Southampton town. She had not been included among the group of Gilgo Beach victims -- until now.\n\nInstead, investigators suspected that convicted serial killer John Bittrolff was linked to Costilla's murder, but he was never charged. He is currently serving a 50-years-to-life sentence at Clinton Correctional Center in Dannemora.\n\nJessica Taylor and Sandra Costilla are the first alleged victims of Heuermann who were murdered before 2007, according to Newsday, which first reported news of the indictment this week.\n\nThis is also the first time he's been charged in connection with victims whose remains were found dismembered and somewhere other than Ocean Parkway. This expands the area of where he allegedly dumped bodies by more than 40 miles.\n\nHeuermann, who has been held without bail since his arrest on July 13, has pleaded not guilty to the four murder charges. He was previously due back in court for a status hearing on June 18 until this week's indictment came through.\n\nIt comes just days after Gilgo Beach Task Force investigators completed a second search of Heuermann's home in Massapequa Park and a search of an area of Manorville where the partial remains of two Jessica Taylor -- and Valerie Mack -- were found more than two decades ago.\n\nTaylor's torso was found off Halsey Manor Lane in Manorville about a mile south of where Valerie Mack's remains were discovered near the Long Island Expressway, Newsday reported. However, Mack's death is not a part of the new indictment, sources told the paper.\n\nOver the course of nine days back in April of this year, Gilgo Beach Task Force investigators searched the area of Manorville where the remains of Taylor and Mack were discovered, as well as Heuermann's home.\n\nA first search of the house back in July lasted 12 days and turned up more than 200 firearms, including dozens stored in a basement vault. Investigators also tore up a wooden deck, used an excavator to dig up the backyard and scanned for buried objects with specialized equipment.\n\nRobert Macedonio, who represents Heuermann's estranged wife, Asa Ellerup, talked to Newsday last week after inspecting the condition of the Massapequa Park property following the most recent search.\n\n\"It seems to be that the focus was in the basement,\" Macedonio said at the time.\n\n\"There doesn't seem to be much disturbance in the bathrooms [and] bedrooms.\" But details of what exactly the investigators were looking for in the basement remains a mystery.\n\nInvestigators descended on Long Island's Manorville in April looking for evidence in the 1993 murder of Sandra Costilla, which they had hoped to tie to convicted murderer John Bittrolff, 57, police sources with knowledge of the case told the New York Post at the time.\n\nThe extensive search shifted to North Sea, a hamlet within Southampton Town, where she had been found on November 20, 1993, beaten and strangled. She was nude and her hands were tied behind her.\n\nCostilla, who also used the last name Cutello, was 28 years old when she was killed. She had lived in Ridgewood, Queens until around 1992, police said at the time. And records showed she had also previously lived in an apartment in Flushing, Queens\n\nShe was initially linked to the murders of Colleen McNamee and Rita Tangredi, who John Bittrolff was later convicted of killing.\n\nBut the DNA linking him to the other two victims was not found at Costilla's scene, former Assistant District Attorney Robert Biancavilla said in 2014.\n\nHer death had not been tied to the Gilgo Beach investigation until K-9 units spent five hours in April searching the wooded North Sea property where her remains had been found, Newsday reported.\n\nWhile the other Gilgo Beach murder victims have been described by police as sex workers, Costilla was not.\n\nJust months before Heuermann was arrested at his Manhattan firm last year, Bittrolff was dismissed as the Gilgo Beach suspect.\n\nThe case began back in May 2010 when Shannan Gilbert, a young woman working as a sex worker, vanished after leaving a client's house on foot near Gilgo Beach. She called 911 for help saying she feared for her life and was never seen alive again.\n\nDuring a search for Gilbert in a dense thicket close to the beach, police discovered human remains. Within days, four victims had been found. By spring 2011, the number of victims rose to 10.\n\nGilbert's body was then found in December 2011. Her cause of death is widely contested with authorities long claiming that it is not connected to the serial killer or killers but that she died from accidental drowning as she fled from the client's home.\n\nHowever, an independent autopsy commissioned by her family ruled that she died by strangulation and her family continues to believe she was murdered.\n\nCourt records show that Heuermann was linked to the \"Gilgo Four\" murders through a tip about his pickup truck, a stash of burner phones, \"sadistic\" online searches and phone calls taunting victims' families.\n\nEmail accounts allegedly used by Heuermann were used \"to access and/or conduct searches related to pornography, rape, torture, and sex workers several thousand times,\" prosecutors said.\n\nAmong the harrowing searches were: \"autopsy photos of female\", \"stories of rape audio\", \"escorts manhattan\", and \"very skinny white teen tied up porn.\"\n\nHis DNA was also found on one of the victims, while his wife's hair was found on three of the four women he is connected to, according to prosecutors.\n\nInvestigators are continuing to work to determine if Heuermann is also linked to any of the other victims - while law enforcement officials across the country are probing cold case murders for any potential ties.", "source": {"uri": "independent.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "The

Police initially believed the corpses of four women found in close proximity to each other, each wrapped in similar burlap, were killed by the same person. Maureen Brainard-Barnes, Melissa Barthelemy, Megan Waterman, and Amber Costello, all of whom were sex workers at the time of their deaths, were dubbed \"The Gilgo Four\" and remained cold case victims of the Long Island Serial Killer until Heuermann's arrest in July 2023.\n\nHeuermann -- who was first charged with the murders of Barthelemy, Waterman, and Costello in July 2023 and Brainard-Barnes in January 2024 -- has pleaded not guilty to all counts.\n\nLike the previous four victims attributed to LISK, Taylor was a sex worker at the time of her disappearance in 2003. Her partial remains were first discovered near Manorville in 2003, with the rest of Taylor's remains found in 2011 as part of a search that uncovered the 10 bodies in the vicinity of Gilgo Beach.\n\n\"Investigators believe the mutilation of the victim's tattoo, decapitation of her head, and dismemberment of Ms. Taylor's arms, were acts perpetrated by Rex A. Heuermann to inhibit the identification of the victim via facial recognition, fingerprints and/or tattoo identification,\" the bail application Thursday stated. \"During the initial investigation in Manorville in 2003, the victim's head, arms, and hands were not found at the scene and their location remained unknown to law enforcement for approximately eight years.\"\n\nHeuermann, potentially, could face even more murder charges: Following the discovery of Taylor's remains, investigators long believed that she and Valerie Mack -- another sex worker who disappeared in 2003 and whose remains were found as part of the LISK search in 2011 -- were the victims of the same killer, as their remains were disposed of in a similar manner in the same area near Manorville. While Heuermann was not charged with the murder of Mack Thursday, the bail application mentions Mack several times and notes the similarities between her 2000 murder and Taylor's.\n\n(Incidentally, Manorville was the home of another convicted serial killer, John Bittrolff, a one-time LISK suspect who was also eyed in the death of Taylor and Mack due to the remains' proximity to Manorville and the fact he was also convicted of killing two sex workers and suspected in a third murder.)", "source": {"uri": "rollingstone.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Rolling Stone"}, "authors": [{"uri": "daniel_kreps@rollingstone.com", "name": "Daniel Kreps", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gilgo,_New_York", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gilgo, New York"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long_Island", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Long Island"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Long Island"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long_Island_serial_killer", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Long Island serial killer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Murder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manorville,_New_York", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Manorville, New York"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Manorville, New York"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex_worker", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sex worker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bail", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bail"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rolling_Stone", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rolling Stone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suffolk_County,_New_York", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Suffolk County, New York"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Suffolk County, New York"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutilation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mutilation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cold_case", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cold case"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acquittal", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Acquittal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tattoo", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tattoo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Bittrolff", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "John Bittrolff"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dismemberment", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dismemberment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fingerprint", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fingerprint"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serial_killer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Serial killer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decapitation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Decapitation"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Murder", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Murder", "wgt": 35}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Victims", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Victims", "wgt": 25}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Unsolved", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Unsolved", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Party_Games/Murder_Mystery", "label": "dmoz/Games/Party Games/Murder Mystery", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 71}], "image": "https://www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/GettyImages-1983627813.jpg?w=1600&h=900&crop=1", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9620887", "eventUri": "eng-9620887", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2010-12-", "textStart": 737, "textEnd": 746}], "sentiment": -0.4823529411764705, "wgt": 180, "relevance": 1}

Both of her arms had been severed below her elbows and a tattoo on her torso had been \"severely obliterated by a sharp object,\" according to prosecutors.\n\nThe woman's skull, hands, and forearm would go undiscovered until March 2011 when they were located along Ocean Parkway, just east of Gilgo Beach.\n\nHer remains were found on the same side of the road as those of Maureen Brainard-Barnes, Melissa Barthelemy, Megan Waterman, and Amber Costello, all four of whom Heuermann is charged with murdering.\n\nCostilla's remains were discovered by hunters in a wooded area of Southampton, in the hamlet of North Sea, on Nov. 20, 1993. The 28-year-old was lying on her back with her arms outstretched over her head with her uncovered legs spread apart, prosecutors said.\n\nHer shirt had been pulled up over her torso and head, exposing her breasts. Investigators determined she had suffered multiple stab wounds to her face, torso, breasts, thigh, and vaginal area.\n\nCostilla was a native of Trinidad and Tobago and, like the other victims, was working as a sex worker at the time of her murder, prosecutors said.\n\nAccording to court documents, Heuermann's DNA matched with male hairs that were found on both Costilla and Taylor's remains.\n\nProsecutors also noted that, as with the other killings, his wife and children were out of state at the time, \"which would have allowed Defendant Heuermann unfettered time to execute his plans for Ms. Taylor, which included the decapitation, dismemberment, and transportation of her remains, without any fear that his family would uncover or learn of his involvement in these crimes.\"\n\nThe additional murder charges come weeks after teams from the Gilgo Beach Homicide Investigation Task Force conducted another search of Heuermann's home on Monday, May 20.\n\nHeuermann, a 60-year-old architect with an office in Manhattan, was arrested in July 2023 on murder charges in the deaths of three Gilgo Beach victims: Melissa Barthelemy, Megan Waterman, and Amber Lynn Costello.\n\nIn January 2024, Suffolk County prosecutors formally charged him with murdering a fourth victim, 25-year-old Maureen Brainard-Barnes.\n\nHeuermann was arrested after authorities linked his DNA from a discarded pizza crust to DNA from a man's hair that was found on camouflage burlap used to restrain Waterman.\n\nInvestigators also linked Heuermann's email account to dozens of disturbing search queries, including \"girl begging for rape porn\" and \"torture redhead porn,\" prosecutors said. He reportedly looked up numerous news articles about the Gilgo Beach murders.\n\nHeuermann has pleaded not guilty to all charges and remains jailed without bail.\n\nThis continues to be a developing story.

He had previously been scheduled to return to court for a June 18 status hearing.\n\nThe new court date comes two weeks after investigators returned to Heuermann's single-story home in Massapequa Park, where they had recovered a cache of weapons during an initial search following his arrest last summer. A date for Heuermann's trial has not yet been set.\n\nDuring the most recent search, which lasted several days, investigators placed paint chips and other materials into evidence bags and removed a large rectangular object covered in a blue cloth.\n\nA spokesperson for the prosecutor's office would not say whether the upcoming hearing was related to the renewed search effort.\n\nIn April, authorities involved in the investigation also spent more than a week searching a wooded area in Manorville, fueling speculation that they were seeking new evidence linked to some of the additional six sets of remains that were discovered along Gilgo Beach more than a decade ago.\n\nHeuermann, 60, was arrested in July in the deaths of Melissa Barthelemy, Megan Waterman and Amber Costello. He was charged in January in the death of Maureen Brainard-Barnes.\n\nHis attorney, Michael Brown, has said his client maintains his innocence. He declined to comment on the nature of Thursday's hearing.\n\nThe case had vexed investigators since the remains of eleven people, most of them young women who had been sex workers, were found on a stretch of Gilgo Beach in 2010 and 2011. Authorities have said the investigation into the other victims remains ongoing.\n\nRobert Macedonio, a lawyer for Heuermann's estranged wife, said the most recent search of the Massapequa Park home was primarily focused on the basement. He said the family was out of state when the search was conducted.\n\nHe declined to say what was taken from the home and said the family has not yet received the search warrant affidavit that would spell out their reasons for conducting the search.\n\nDuring the initial search of the home in July, authorities tore up a wooden deck and used an excavator to dig up the backyard, which they scanned for buried objects using specialized equipment.\n\nThe most recent search was far less disruptive, according to Macedonia.\n\nVess Mitev, a lawyer for Heuermann's two adult children, said the family was closely monitoring the developments.\n\n\"The hearing is yet another mile marker in this macabre saga, where they continue to be unfortunate bystanders,\" he said in a text message.\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

Pool photo by James Carbone\n\nBy Corey Kilgannon\n\nJune 6, 2024, 10:05 a.m. ET\n\nRex Heuermann, who was arrested last summer and has been accused of murdering four women in the Gilgo Beach serial killings on Long Island, was indicted Thursday on murder charges in the deaths of two more women.\n\nMr. Heuermann, 60, who has pleaded not guilty to all charges in connection with the first four women's deaths, has remained in jail for nearly a year awaiting trial. In the meantime, investigators turned to the six other victims -- four women, a man and a toddler -- whose remains, like those of the first four women, were found along Ocean Parkway by Gilgo Beach.\n\nOn Thursday, Mr. Heuermann was charged with killing one of them: Jessica Taylor, whose partial remains were found near Gilgo Beach in 2011 and then linked to other partial remains found eight years earlier in a remote wooded area in Manorville, a 45-minute drive east. ... He was also charged with killing Sandra Costilla, a 28-year-old New York woman whose remains were found in 1993 in the Hamptons. Her long unsolved murder had not previously been associated with the Gilgo Beach investigation.\n\nThe new indictment followed a recent flurry of activity in the investigation: a nine-day canine search completed last month in Manorville and a wooded area in Southampton where Ms. Costilla's body was found. Last month, investigators also conducted a six-day search of Mr. Heuermann's home in Massapequa Park, which had been exhaustively searched for two weeks last summer after his arrest.\n\n{snip}\n\nCorey Kilgannon is a Times reporter who writes about crime and criminal justice in and around New York City, as well as breaking news and other feature stories.

Investigators long said it was likely that not all of the deaths were the work of the same killer.\n\nSome of the victims disappeared in the mid-1990s, and investigators concluded that an 11th person who disappeared in 2010 from the barrier island community of Oak Beach had accidentally drowned.\n\nHeuermann, who lived across a bay from where the bodies were found, was arrested last July.\n\nProsecutors said a new investigative taskforce used mobile phone location data and DNA samples to link the architect to some of the victims. He was charged with killing four of the women: Megan Waterman, Melissa Barthelemy, Amber Lynn Costello and Maureen Brainard-Barnes.\n\nInvestigators who had searched Heuermann's home extensively and dug up his yard last summer returned to the house again last month and spent nearly a week searching it again. They focused mostly in the basement, according to a lawyer for Heuermann's wife.\n\nMs Taylor, 20, vanished in 2003 while working as an escort in New York City. Some of her remains were discovered in Manorville that year.\n\nOther remains were found in a 2011 search of the beach scrub by the side of Ocean Parkway, the road where the other Gilgo Beach victims were found.\n\nInvestigators in April also spent days searching a property in the eastern Long Island hamlet of North Sea, where Ms Costilla's body was discovered in 1993. She was 28 when she was killed and had lived in New York City.\n\nA decade ago, Suffolk County prosecutors said publicly that they believed she had been killed by a carpenter who lived in the area, John Bittrolff, who was convicted of murdering two other women whose bodies had been found on the same part of Long Island. But he was never charged with Ms Costilla's death due to lack of evidence, and insists he is innocent of any murders.\n\nHeuermann, who has been in custody since his arrest, has pleaded not guilty. He had been set to return to court on June 18 for a status hearing. No trial date has been set.", "source": {"uri": "jerseyeveningpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Jersey Evening Post"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jessica_Taylor", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jessica Taylor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Costilla_County,_Colorado", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Costilla County, Colorado"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Costilla County, Colorado"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forensic_identification", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Forensic identification"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex_worker", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sex worker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA_profiling", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "DNA profiling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Press_conference", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Press conference"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barrier_island", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Barrier island"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bay", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bay"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/District_attorney", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "District attorney"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bail", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bail"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suffolk_County,_New_York", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Suffolk County, New York"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Suffolk County, New York"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oak_Beach,_New_York", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Oak Beach, New York"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Oak Beach, New York"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Bittrolff", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "John Bittrolff"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Administrative_divisions_of_New_York_(state)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Administrative divisions of New York (state)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocean_Parkway_(Long_Island)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ocean Parkway (Long Island)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gilgo,_New_York", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gilgo, New York"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Sea", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "North Sea"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acquittal", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Acquittal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carpentry", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Carpentry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long_Island", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Long Island"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Long Island"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawyer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lawyer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manorville,_New_York", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Manorville, New York"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Manorville, New York"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Murder", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Murder", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Science_in_Society/Forensic_Science", "label": "dmoz/Science/Science in Society/Forensic Science", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Victims", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Victims", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 53}], "image": "https://d3gvyx4eg3tne0.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Img38225542.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9620887", "eventUri": "eng-9620887", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-18", "textStart": 3291, "textEnd": 3298}], "sentiment": -0.5529411764705883, "wgt": 177, "relevance": 1}

Jessica Taylor?", "body": "Heuermann was initially arrested last July and pleaded not guilty in the deaths of four women: Melissa Barthelemy, Maureen Brainard Barnes, Megan Waterman and Amber Lynn Costello. Their bodies were all located near each other on Ocean Parkway, and were the first of 10 sets of remains found in the same area between fall of 2010 and spring of 2011.\n\nHere's what is known about the two victims:\n\nHeuermann was indicted in the November 1993 death of Sandra Costilla, a Queens woman whose remains were found in the town of Southampton over three decades ago.\n\nCostilla had not been included among the so-called Gilgo Beach victims, until now. Investigators suspected convicted serial killer John Bittrolff in Costilla's death, but he was never charged in her slaying, which remains one of several unsolved Long Island murders, according to the New York Post.\n\nHeuermann was also arraigned in connection with the July 2003 dismemberment death of 20-year-old escort Jessica Taylor.\n\nAccording to police, Taylor was found decapitated with her arms severed from her body (around July 26, 2003). Police also said a tattoo on her body had been \"severely obliterated by a sharp object.\"\n\nDuring the initial investigation in Manorville in 2003, the victim's head, arms, and hands were not found at the scene and their location remained unknown to law enforcement for nearly eight years.\n\nSome of her remains were found in a wooded area in Manorville. The rest were located in March 2011 along Ocean Parkway, near those of another sex worker, 24-year-old Valerie Mack.\n\nThe Gilgo Homicide Task Force has established a pattern that Heuermann's wife and children were out of state at the time of Taylor's disappearance and murder, a consistent theme attributable to Heuermann for each of the charged homicides thus far.\n\nThe bodies of the \"Gilgo Four\" were located within a quarter-mile of one another near Gilgo Beach in December 2010.\n\nIn 2022, Suffolk County Police released new information on victims Maureen Brainard-Barnes, Melissa Barthelemy, Megan Waterman, and Amber Lynn Costello including personal information and their last known whereabouts.\n\nShannan Gilbert, a 24-year-old sex worker, vanished on May 1, 2010. A police officer and his cadaver dog were looking for her body in the thicket along nearby Ocean Parkway when they happened upon the remains of a different woman. Within days, three other bodies were found, all within a short walk of one another.\n\nGilbert's disappearance and search is what ultimately led to the discovery of several remains in the area.", "source": {"uri": "fox5ny.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "FOX 5 New York"}, "authors": [{"uri": "michael_stallone@fox5ny.com", "name": "Michael Stallone", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gilgo,_New_York", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Gilgo, New York"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocean_Parkway_(Long_Island)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ocean Parkway (Long Island)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southampton,_New_York", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Southampton, New York"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Southampton, New York"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acquittal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Acquittal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indictment", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Indictment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queens", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Queens"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Queens"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Bittrolff", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "John Bittrolff"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dismemberment", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dismemberment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serial_killer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Serial killer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_enforcement", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Law enforcement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Post", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "New York Post"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decapitation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Decapitation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long_Island", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Long Island"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Long Island"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arraignment", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Arraignment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homicide", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Homicide"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manorville,_New_York", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Manorville, New York"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Manorville, New York"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long_Island_serial_killer", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Long Island serial killer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suffolk_County_Police_Department", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Suffolk County Police Department"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex_worker", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sex worker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Search_and_rescue_dog", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Search and rescue dog"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Police_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Police officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Murder"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Law_Enforcement", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Law Enforcement", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Murder", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Murder", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Victims", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Victims", "wgt": 17}], "image": "https://images.foxtv.com/static.fox5ny.com/www.fox5ny.com/content/uploads/2024/06/1280/720/Untitled-1.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9620887", "eventUri": "eng-9620887", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2003-07-26", "textStart": 1072, "textEnd": 1085}, {"amb": false, "date": "2010-05-01", "textStart": 2197, "textEnd": 2208}, {"amb": false, "date": "1993-11-", "textStart": 425, "textEnd": 438}, {"amb": false, "date": "2003-07-", "textStart": 909, "textEnd": 918}, {"amb": false, "date": "2011-03-", "textStart": 1465, "textEnd": 1475}, {"amb": false, "date": "2010-12-", "textStart": 1908, "textEnd": 1921}], "sentiment": -0.3803921568627451, "wgt": 177, "relevance": 1}

Heuermann has pleaded not guilty to the murders of the so-called Gilgo 4, four women found dead and buried in close proximity along Ocean Parkway on Gilgo Beach in 2010.\n\nThe murders of Taylor and Costilla are considerably older than those of Amber Costello, Maureen Brainard-Barnes, Melissa Barthelmy, and Megan Waterman, who are the Gilgo 4. Taylor and Costilla's bodies were found further afield than Gilgo Beach, expanding the killing fields connected with Heuerman by 40 miles.\n\nNew court documents say Taylor was killed sometime between July 21 and July 26, 2003, and Costilla was killed on November 19 or 20, 1993. Taylor's body was dismembered, unlike the Gilgo 4. Her torso was found in July 2003, but other parts of her body, including her head, arms, and hands, were not located for another eight years. Those body parts were found just east of Gilgo Beach. not far from where the remains of the Gilgo 4 were found.\n\nIn fact, Costilla's murder had long been connected with another serial killer, John Bittrolff, who was eventually convicted in two other murders and is serving 50 years to life in prison, but investigators were never able to firmly tie Bittrolff with Costilla.\n\nUnlike all the other victims tied to Heuermann, including Taylor, Costilla was never described as a sex worker.\n\nAuthorities have scheduled a news conference on the matters for later Thursday morning.\n\nFor the latest

AP's earlier story follows below.\n\nRIVERHEAD, N.Y. (AP) -- The New York architect previously accused of killing four women and leaving their corpses scattered along a coastal highway was charged Thursday in the deaths of two more women.\n\nRex Heuermann, 60, was set to appear before a judge to face charges that he killed Jessica Taylor and Sandra Costilla, two young women who were long suspected of being the victims of men preying on sex workers.\n\nTaylor disappeared in 2003. Costilla was killed in 1993. The new charges came just days after police finished extensive searches of Heuermann's Massapequa Park home and a wooded area on Long Island tied to the investigation of a string of deaths known as the Gilgo Beach serial killings.\n\nIn a court filing, prosecutors said were able to use new forensic testing methods to match hairs found on or near the vicinity of both victims to a DNA profile that is a likely match to Heuermann. Additionally, prosecutors say they discovered a \"planning document\" on the hard drive found in his basement used to \"methodically blueprint\" his killings.\n\nThe document includes Heuermann's concerns about leaving behind forensic evidence, guidance for cleaning and washing bodies, and notes on how to improve \"next time,\" according to the bail application\n\nSuffolk County District Attorney Ray Tierney planned to hold a news conference following the court hearing.\n\nThe charges involving Costilla, who was killed 30 years ago, indicate that prosecutors believe Heuermann was killing victims for much longer longer than previously thought.\n\nSince late 2010, police have been investigating the deaths of at least 10 people -- mostly female sex workers -- whose remains were discovered along an isolated highway not far from Gilgo Beach on Long Island's south shore.\n\nThe victims had disappeared over a span of at least 14 years. Vexed police officers made only halting progress in identifying possible suspects. Investigators long said it was likely that not all of the deaths were the work of the same killer. Some of the victims disappeared in the mid-1990s. Investigators concluded that an 11th person who disappeared in 2010 from the barrier island community of Oak Beach had accidentally drowned.\n\nHeuermann, who lived across a bay from where the bodies were found, was arrested last July. Prosecutors said a new investigative task force used mobile phone location data and DNA samples to link the architect to some of the victims. He was charged with killing four of the women: Megan Waterman, Melissa Barthelemy, Amber Lynn Costello and Maureen Brainard-Barnes.\n\nInvestigators who had searched Heuermann's home extensively and dug up his yard last summer returned to the house again last month and spent nearly a week searching it again. They focused their efforts mostly in the basement, according to a lawyer for Heuermann's wife.\n\nThat followed a search in April of a wooded area in Manorville, about 40 miles (65 kilometers) east of Heuermann's home, linked to another Gilgo Beach victim.\n\nJessica Taylor, 20, vanished in 2003 while working as an escort in New York City. Some of her remains were discovered in Manorville that year. Other remains were found in a 2011 search of the beach scrub by the side of Ocean Parkway, the road where the other Gilgo Beach victims were found.\n\nInvestigators in April also spent days searching a property in the eastern Long Island hamlet of North Sea, where the Costilla's body was discovered in 1993. Costilla was 28 when she was killed and had lived in New York City.\n\nA decade ago, Suffolk County prosecutors said publicly that they believed Costilla had been killed by a carpenter who lived in the area, John Bittrolff, who was convicted of murdering two other women whose bodies had been found on the same part of Long Island. But Bittrolff was never charged with Costilla's death due to lack of evidence. He insists he is innocent of any murders.\n\nHeuermann's lawyer and the lawyers separately representing his wife and two adult children declined to comment.\n\nHeuermann, who has been in custody since his arrest, has pleaded not guilty. He had been set to return to court on June 18 for a status hearing. No trial date has been set.\n\nFollow Philip Marcelo at twitter.com/philmarcelo.\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

Vexed police officers made only halting progress in identifying possible suspects. Investigators long said it was likely that not all of the deaths were the work of the same killer. Some of the victims disappeared in the mid-1990s. Investigators concluded that an 11th person who disappeared in 2010 from the barrier island community of Oak Beach had accidentally drowned.\n\nHeuermann, who lived across a bay from where the bodies were found, was arrested last July. Prosecutors said a new investigative task force used mobile phone location data and DNA samples to link the architect to some of the victims. He was charged with killing four of the women: Megan Waterman, Melissa Barthelemy, Amber Lynn Costello and Maureen Brainard-Barnes.\n\nInvestigators who had searched Heuermann's home extensively and dug up his yard last summer returned to the house again last month and spent nearly a week searching it again. They focused their efforts mostly in the basement, according to a lawyer for Heuermann's wife.\n\nThat followed a search in April of a wooded area in Manorville, about 40 miles (65 kilometers) east of Heuermann's home, linked to two other Gilgo Beach victims.\n\nValerie Mack, 24, who had been working as an escort in Philadelphia, disappeared in 2000 and was last seen by her family in Port Republic, New Jersey. Some of her skeletal remains were discovered that same year in the Manorville woods. More of her remains were found in 2011 in the search around Gilgo Beach.\n\nInitially known as \"Jane Doe No. 6,\" Mack's remains had been unidentified for years until genetic testing revealed her identity in 2020.\n\nJessica Taylor, 20, vanished in 2003 while working as an escort in New York City. Some of her remains were discovered in Manorville that year. Other remains were found in a 2011 search of the beach scrub by the side of Ocean Parkway, the road where the other Gilgo Beach victims were found.\n\nRelatives for Mack and Taylor declined to comment Wednesday.\n\nHeuermann's lawyer and the lawyers separately representing his wife and two adult children declined to comment.\n\nHeuermann, who has been in custody since his arrest, has pleaded not guilty. He had been set to return to court on June 18 for a status hearing. No trial date has been set.\n\nFollow Philip Marcelo at twitter.com/philmarcelo.\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

Kathy Hochul said. \"We are hoping that this will bring justice to this individual but also peace to the families.\"\n\nThat day came - finally - years after a bestselling nonfiction book, a Netflix drama, and a podcast about a long-running murder mystery that made national headlines and become known as the Gilgo Beach killings.\n\nHeuermann was initially charged with three counts of first-degree murder for the killings of Melissa Barthelemy in 2009, and Megan Waterman and Amber Costello the following year, according to the Suffolk County District Attorney.\n\nThe 60-year-old is expected to be indicted on a new murder charge this week in a New York court, according to CNN affiliate WCBS.\n\nThe alleged killer had been living a double life in a Long Island village a short drive from where their remains were found, prosecutors said.\n\nHeuermann, who told his attorney he's not the killer, was also the prime suspect in the 2007 disappearance and death of a fourth woman, Maureen Brainard-Barnes, according to a bail application from Suffolk County prosecutors. In January, he was charged with the murder of Brainard-Barnes, who was 25 years when she was last seen. He pleaded not guilty in that case.\n\nThe victims, who worked as escorts, became known as the \"Gilgo Four.\"\n\nThe day after his arrest, July 14, Heuermann was ordered held without bail after pleading not guilty during a first court appearance.\n\nHeuermann was in tears following his arrest.\n\n\"I did not do this,\" his court appointed attorney, Michael Brown, said his client told him.\n\nA crucial break in the case came in January when investigators took a swab from leftover pizza crust Heuermann discarded in the trash outside his Manhattan office, according to the bail application.\n\nDNA evidence linked him to a hair found on the burlap sack where Waterman's remains were found.\n\nThe son of an aerospace engineer, Heuermann lived with his spouse and children in the homey village of Massapequa Park, across the bay from where the remains were found, on the southeastern edge of Nassau County.\n\nIn a video interview posted online by Bonjour Realty in 2022, as police in Suffolk County formed a multiagency task force to investigate the long-dormant cases, Heuermann said he was born and raised on Long Island. He had been working as an architectural consultant in Manhattan since 1987.\n\n\"I do troubleshooting, architectural troubleshooting, and negotiations with the building department,\" Heuermann said.\n\n\"When a job that should have been routine suddenly becomes not routine, I get the phone call,\" he added.\n\nHis father had built satellites for a living, Heuermann told the interviewer. His dad also built furniture in a workshop in the house Heuermann grew up in and still lived with his family.\n\nAsked what his job taught him about himself, Heuermann said: \"I think it's taught me more about how to understand people. Dealing with the technical aspects is something a person can learn ... But it's the people, how they're all so different and how you deal with the people, I think, is one of the more interesting aspects that has come out of this.\"\n\nRH Consultants & Associates was founded by Heuermann and incorporated in 1994, according to the company website.\n\nAt the end of his online video, Heuermann put on a pair of sunglasses and posed for a selfie with his interviewer.\n\nIt took investigators nearly 15 years to track down Heuermann.\n\nThey first connected him to the killings in 2022 while conducting a review of evidence under a newly formed task force, which included the Suffolk County Police Department, the Suffolk County Sheriff's Office, the New York State Police and the FBI.\n\nIn March 2022, investigators found a first-generation Chevrolet Avalanche - the same type of truck a witness believed to have been driven by Costello's killer - registered to Heuermann at the time of the murders, according to the bail application.\n\nArmed with more than 300 subpoenas and search warrants, investigators began to close in on their suspect.\n\nEvidence revealed the killer had used burner phones to contact victims. Investigators found calls to the victims originated from locations connected to Heuermann.\n\nInvestigators said they narrowed cell tower records from thousands of possible individuals down to hundreds and then to a handful of people. They focused on residents who matched a physical description provided by a witness who had seen the killer.\n\nTask force members also learned Heuermann lived close to one Long Island cell site and worked near New York City cell sites where other calls originated.\n\nA series of \"taunting\" calls in which a male caller admitted killing and sexually assaulting Barthelemy were made from her phone to her family members from the vicinity of Heuermann's midtown Manhattan office during the summer of 2009, according to the bail application.\n\nHeuermann also used burner phones to contact sex workers or massage parlors, the bail application said. And he created false names for an email account used to search for \"sex workers, sadistic, torture-related pornography and child pornography,\" the bail application said.\n\nOne fictitious email account was used to send selfies \"to solicit and arrange for sexual activity.\" Another was used to search for podcasts and documentaries about the investigation, as well as \"images depicting the murdered victims and members of their immediate families,\" according to the bail application.\n\nBetween March 2022 and June 2023, Heuermann used the same account to conduct more than 200 searches about serial killers and articles about the task force investigating the Gilgo Beach killings, the bail application said.\n\nA key break in the case came when investigators recovered Heuermann's DNA from pizza crust in a crumpled box he discarded in a Manhattan trash can in January 2023.\n\nThe initial examination of Waterman's skeletal remains turned up a male hair from the \"bottom of the burlap\" the killer used to wrap her body, according to prosecutors. Analysis of DNA found on the victim and the pizza showed the samples matched.\n\nAdditionally, hair believed to be from Heuermann's wife was found on or near three of the murder victims, according to the bail application. The DNA was collected from bottles inside a garbage can outside the Heuermann home.\n\nThe hairs were found in 2010 and had degraded. DNA testing at the time yielded no results but recent mitochondrial DNA testing allowed investigators to make the connection, according to Tierney.\n\nHeuermann's wife and children were out of the state when the three women are believed to have been killed, Tierney said. Investigators said his wife's hair may have been transferred to the victims from his clothing.\n\nHis wife, Asa Ellerup, likely did not know about his life as an alleged killer, said Suffolk County Police Commissioner Rodney Harrison.\n\n\"If you ask me, I don't believe that they knew about this double life that Mr. Heuermann was living,\" Harrison said of the suspect's family.\n\nBut authorities were not ruling anything out and were continuing to collect information on what the family might have known, Harrison said after the arrest.\n\nEllerup had filed for divorce from her husband of 27 years, her attorney Robert Macedonio told CNN last year.\n\nAuthorities, fearing the Heuermann might be tipped off they were closing in, moved to arrest him.\n\n\"We were playing before a party of one,\" Tierney told reporters. \"We knew the person responsible for these murders would be looking at us.\"\n\nThe case started with the search for a missing woman in 2010, leading to the discovery of multiple sets of human remains at Gilgo Beach.\n\nBy the time the remains of the missing woman, Shannan Gilbert, were found one year later, at least 10 sets of human remains had been recovered across two Long Island counties.\n\nTierney had said last year the work of the task force was not over.\n\n\"There are a lot of other victims, you know, in that area,\" he told CNN. \"There are a lot of victim's families that want closure. So that's what you work towards.\"\n\nAuthorities believe the death of Gilbert, whose disappearance sparked discovery of the other victims, may have been accidental and not related to the other killings.\n\nThe remains of the Gilgo Four were found in bushes along a quarter-mile stretch of Ocean Parkway over a two-day period in 2010.\n\nThe skeletal remains of Barthelemy were discovered near Gilgo Beach on December 11. Barthelemy, who was a sex worker, was last seen July 12, 2009, at her apartment when she told a friend she was going to see a man, according to a Suffolk County website about the killings.\n\nThe remains of three other women were found on December 13, 2010: Brainard-Barnes, who advertised escort services on Craigslist and was last seen in early June 2007 in New York City; Amber Lynn Costello, who also advertised escort services and was last seen leaving her North Babylon home in early September 2010; and Waterman, who also advertised as an escort and was last seen in early June 2010 at a Holiday Inn Express in Hauppauge.\n\nHeuermann was surprised when he was surrounded by officers and taken into custody near his office on the evening of July 13, according to Tierney.\n\nWhen Heuermann was being processed at the jail, he had just one question about his arrest. According to a source, he said, \"Is it in the news?\"\n\nSpeaking of the arrest, Harrison said last year: \"Rex Heuermann is a demon that walks among us. A predator that ruined families. If not for the members of this task force, he would still be on the streets today.\"\n\nThe-CNN-Wire\n\n\u2122 & \u00a9 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros. Discovery Company.

He also was identified as the prime suspect in the disappearance and killing of the fourth woman, Maureen Brainard-Barnes, who was 25 years old when she was last seen. He was charged with her murder in January and pleaded not guilty.\n\nHeurmann, 60, is expected to be indicted on a new murder charge this week in a New York court, according to CNN affiliate WCBS.\n\nLess than a week after her husband's arrest, Ellerup filed for divorce, her attorney Robert Macedonio told CNN. He did not comment further on the matter.\n\nShe was shocked to hear what her husband is accused of, Harrison said.\n\nBut she unknowingly played a key role in her husband's arrest: it was her DNA, among other evidence, that authorities say helped tie Heuermann to the crimes.\n\nHere's what we know about his wife, their life together and the unexpected role she played in the case.\n\nHeuermann and Ellerup were married in April 1996, the suspect said in a 2018 deposition. Since then, they lived in Heuermann's red and green childhood home in the Long Island suburb of Massapequa Park with their daughter and Heuermann's stepson.\n\nBut despite their long stint in the neighborhood - and though Heuermann's life was long rooted in the same community, neighbors knew little detail about the family.\n\nNeighbors described the home as creepy and the family as distant, according to the Long Island Press, a monthly magazine serving Long Island.\n\n\"The family is very to themselves, quiet,\" neighbor Frankie Musto told the publication. \"We never saw anything suspicious.\"\n\nIn his 2018 deposition, Heuermann said he had been married once before. That marriage, he said, lasted three years and they had no children.\n\nWhen the victims were first discovered, there were pieces of degraded hair recovered by authorities - but DNA testing at the time could not provide the answers investigators hoped for.\n\nTechnological improvements soon helped yield results.\n\nHair that is now believed to belong to Ellerup - which presumably had been unintentionally carried by the suspect on his clothes - was found on or near the three victims, prosecutors alleged in the bail application, citing DNA testing.\n\nThat DNA came from 11 bottles inside a garbage can outside the Heuermann home, the court document says. Authorities had been surveilling Heuermann and his family for months after they identified him as a suspect in early 2022, and during that time collected DNA samples from items the family threw away.\n\nThough her hair was found with the victims, Ellerup and their daughter were both traveling when the killings were committed and Heuermann was \"alone in the tri-state area,\" Suffolk County District Attorney Ray Tierney said at a news conference last summer.\n\n\"It's very significant in as much as it then limits it down to him,\" criminal defense attorney Joey Jackson told CNN's Jake Tapper about the finding. \"If the suspect's wife is out of town, then why would her hair be there if he's in town?\"\n\nSuffolk County authorities say DNA evidence also linked Heuermann to a male hair found on the burlap sack where one victim's remains were found.\n\nHarrison told CNN last summer he was informed that once authorities told Ellerup and her daughter about the crimes Heuermann is accused of, the two were \"shocked, they were disgusted, they were embarrassed.\"\n\nTheir reaction, he said, is why he believes they were not aware of what he was doing.\n\n\"But, time will tell,\" he added. \"And once again, there are still a lot more questions that need to be done to the family and friends.\"\n\nCNN has made multiple attempts to contact Heuermann's wife and daughter.\n\nThe attorneys representing Ellerup said last July she and her family \"are going through a devastating time in their lives\" and are asking for privacy.\n\n\"The sensitive nature of her husband's arrest is taking an emotional toll on the immediate and extended family, especially their elderly family members,\" said a statement from the Macedonio & Duncan law firm. \"Ms. Ellerup does not wish to comment further and has requested the public and press to please respect the family's privacy at this time.\"\n\nFollowing his arrest, Heuermann was remanded without bail. He entered a not guilty plea through his attorney.\n\nThe-CNN-Wire\n\n\u2122 & \u00a9 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros. Discovery Company.

Some of her remains were discovered in Manorville that year, and more were found by the side of Ocean Parkway. The body of 28-year-old Costilla was discovered in 1993.\n\nIn a court filing, prosecutors said they were able to use new forensic testing methods to match hairs found on or near the vicinity of both victims to a DNA profile that is a likely match to Heuermann. Additionally, prosecutors say they recovered a \"planning document\" on a hard drive in his basement used to \"methodically blueprint\" his killings.\n\nThe all-caps document features a series of checklists with tasks to complete before, during and after the killings, as well as practical lessons for \"next time.\" Among the dozens of entries written are reminders to clean the bodies and destroy evidence, to \"get sleep before hunt\" and to \"have story set.\"\n\nOne section, titled \"things to remember,\" appears to highlight lessons from previous killings, prosecutors said, such as using heavier rope and limiting noise in order to maximize \"play time.\" A \"body prep\" checklist includes, among other items, a note to \"remove head and hands.\"\n\nPolice have been probing the deaths of at least 10 people, most of whom are sex workers, whose remains were discovered along an isolated highway not far from Gilgo Beach since 2010.\n\nThe victims had gone missing over a span of at least 14 years.\n\nHeurmann, an architect who lived across a bay from where the bodies were found, was arrested last July in connection to the killings of Megan Waterman, Melissa Barthelemy, Amber Lynn Costello and Maureen Brainard-Barnes.

And the case is broadening.\n\nA task force with state and local investigators pieced together evidence that led them to their \"ogre\" suspect: an eyewitness description of his green Chevy Avalanche, records from a slew of burner phones, crime scene DNA and a discarded pizza crust.\n\nREX HEUERMANN'S FAMILY KEPT GRUESOME PIECE OF EVIDENCE, SOURCE SAYS\n\nIn July 2023, they arrested Heuermann outside his Manhattan office and spent nearly two weeks scouring through his home in Massapequa Park, about 20 minutes from where police found the bodies of Melissa Barthelemy, 24; Megan Waterman, 22; and Amber Costello, 27, in 2010.\n\nProsecutors later tacked on charges for the murder of Maureen Brainard-Barnes, 25, whose remains they found near the others.\n\nCollectively, those women are known as the Gilgo Four because they were found close together and under similar circumstances.\n\nSUSPECTED SERIAL KILLER REX HEUERMANN'S HOME SEARCHED AGAIN\n\nPolice uncovered their remains in the brush along Ocean Parkway after another woman, Shannan Gilbert, vanished into the night after placing a panicked 911 call begging for help.\n\nPolice found seven other bodies further east along the highway. Most of the deaths remain under investigation. Gilbert was the last one in 2011.\n\nPolice said in 2020 that Gilbert's death appeared to be an accidental drowning, although her official cause of death is undetermined and a private autopsy conducted by Dr. Michael Baden found evidence of \"homicidal strangulation.\"\n\nTwo of the other victims have been identified as Jessica Taylor and Valerie Mack, who were both dismembered and dumped in separate locations.\n\nPolice discovered their partial remains in Manorville in 2000 and 2003. Additional remains of both victims were uncovered near the Gilgo victims.\n\nFOLLOW THE FOX TRUE CRIME TEAM ON X\n\nK-9 units conducted a search in Manorville in April and then served a second search warrant on Heuermann's house in May. Police returned to the North Sea area further east, where they had found the body of a woman named Sandra Costilla in 1993.\n\nThe prime suspect in Costilla's death was another serial killer, former Manorville carpenter John Bittrolff, who is currently in prison for two other murders.\n\nIf Heuermann is responsible for any of the deaths out east, his suspected killing spree would have started decades earlier than previously known.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nHeuermann has pleaded not guilty to murder charges in connection with the Gilgo Four.", "source": {"uri": "foxnews.com",

(AP) -- The New York architect previously accused of murdering four women and leaving their corpses scattered along a coastal highway was charged Thursday in the deaths of two more women.\n\nRex Heuermann, 60, was set to appear before a judge to face charges that he murdered Jessica Taylor and Sandra Costilla. Taylor disappeared in the early 2000s. Costilla was killed in 1993. The new charges came just days after police finished extensive searches of Heuermann's Massapequa Park home and a wooded area on Long Island tied to the investigation of a string of deaths known as the Gilgo Beach serial killings.\n\nPeople are also reading...

Vexed police officers made only halting progress in identifying possible suspects. Investigators long said it was likely that not all of the deaths were the work of the same killer. Some of the victims disappeared in the mid-1990s. Investigators concluded that an 11th person who disappeared in 2010 from the barrier island community of Oak Beach had accidentally drowned.\n\nHeuermann, who lived across a bay from where the bodies were found, was arrested last July.

Some of her remains were discovered in Manorville that year. Other remains were found in a 2011 search of the beach scrub by the side of Ocean Parkway, the road where the other Gilgo Beach victims were found.\n\nInvestigators in April also spent days searching a property in the eastern Long Island hamlet of North Sea, where the Costilla's body was discovered in 1993. Costilla was 28 when she was killed and had lived in New York City.\n\nA decade ago, Suffolk County prosecutors said publicly that they believed Costilla had been killed by a carpenter who lived in the area, John Bittrolff, who was convicted of murdering two other women whose bodies had been found on the same part of Long Island. But Bittrolff was never charged with Costilla's death due to lack of evidence. He insists he is innocent of any murders.\n\nHeuermann's lawyer and the lawyers separately representing his wife and two adult children declined to comment.\n\nHeuermann, who has been in custody since his arrest, has pleaded not guilty. He had been set to return to court on June 18 for a status hearing. No trial date has been set.\n\nFollow Philip Marcelo at twitter.com/philmarcelo.\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

All four women worked as online escorts and disappeared between 2007 and 2010.\n\nHere is PEOPLE's July 2023 cover story following Heuermann's arrest.\n\nOn a hot, humid late-summer night in 2010, Amber Costello, 27, called her roommate from the locked bathroom of their rented cottage in West Babylon, N.Y., on Long Island. She was terrified. Costello, a sex worker, had been dancing for a client when he'd threatened to rape her, she said. Her roommate raced home and burst through the door ready to take a swing at anyone inside, only to find a hulking man in the living room who barely flinched. \"It was like fighting Frankenstein,\" the roommate says. As the man drove away in a first-generation Chevy Avalanche, he uttered a chilling admonition: \"You don't know who you're f---ing with.\" Says Costello's roommate, who has asked not to be identified by name: \"He had the blankest look on his face.\"\n\nShortly after, on Sept. 2, 2010, Costello left her home and was never seen again, yet her roommate never forgot the man or his haunting expression. And on July 14, 2023, when a picture of architect and twice-married father of two Rex Heuermann, 59, of nearby Massapequa Park, flashed across the news, \"I said, 'That's the Frankenstein dude. That's him.'\"\n\nPolice in New York's Suffolk County say they have finally caught the deadly predator known as the Long Island Serial Killer, believed to have murdered at least 3 and, by some estimates, as many as 18 victims over a decade. Heuermann is charged with three counts each of first- and second-degree murder for the killing of Costello, Melissa Barthelemy, 24, an aspiring hair salon owner who went missing in 2009, and Megan Waterman, 22, who vanished in 2010. Charges in the murder of Maureen Brainard-Barnes, 25, a mother of two who disappeared in 2007, are likely pending, say prosecutors. (Heuermann has pleaded not guilty on all counts.)\n\nAuthorities point to the work of an interagency task force -- made up of FBI agents and state and local police -- put together in early 2022 for identifying Heuermann as a suspect in March 2022 and working fastidiously to build a case. \"Rex Heuermann is a demon that walks among us, a predator that ruined families,\" Suffolk County Police commissioner Rodney Harrison said at a July 14 press conference. \"If not for the members of this task force, he would still be on the streets today. However, even with this arrest, we're not done.\"\n\n***\n\nNeighbors on First Avenue in the usually sedate village of Massapequa Park who woke up on the morning of July 14 to find an army of investigators searching Heuermann's ranch-style house -- reportedly his childhood home -- are in shocked disbelief that an accused serial killer had lived in their midst. \"He was a recluse,\" says Michael Musto, who lives a few doors down from Heuermann. Musto's sister would try to speed her pace up when walking the dog past the house, with its sagging front porch and dilapidated wood shingles. \"She felt uncomfortable,\" Musto says. \"She had a sixth sense that she picked up on.\"\n\nAnother homeowner says that when he first moved into the area, Heuermann often did woodworking in the driveway but didn't make any effort to introduce himself. \"He never said two words to me,\" the neighbor says. \"If I saw him at the train station, I didn't acknowledge him at all. He didn't acknowledge me.\"\n\nThe train took Heuermann to and from his professional life working in Manhattan as an architect specializing in building permits. He seemed to take pride in his meticulous planning and exhaustive knowledge of arcane city building codes going back decades. In a video interview conducted by a real estate agent in 2022, he boasted that when permitting difficulties arise on an architectural job, \"those calls come to me.\" His 26-year-old daughter Victoria was listed as a staff member on the company website.\n\n***\n\nInvestigators identified Heuermann as a possible suspect just six weeks after the task force consisting of the Suffolk County Sheriff's Department, Suffolk County Police, New York State Police and FBI launched. In reviewing evidence collected as far back as 2007 in the disappearances and murders of at least 10 people -- mostly women, though there is a male victim as well as a toddler thought to have been killed alongside her mother -- authorities used cellphone activity on burner phones used by the suspected killer while he stalked his victims. According to authorities, that data showed that the would-be killer would have been in Massapequa Park and Midtown Manhattan during the time of those calls. Next, the task force used motor vehicle records to track a pickup truck -- a Chevy Avalanche -- spotted by witnesses in the vicinity of victim Costello on the day before she disappeared. According to court documents obtained by People, that vehicle was traced to Heuermann's home in Massapequa Park.\n\nArmed with more than 300 subpoenas and search warrants, authorities dug deeper. They secured \"abandoned DNA samples\" from a pizza crust they allege Heuermann discarded in a Manhattan trash can and from 11 bottles taken from a trash can outside his home. DNA from the pizza crust matched DNA found on a murder victim, authorities say. And DNA and hairs from the bottles matched hairs found on the victims as well. Those hairs were determined to belong to Heuermann's wife, Asa Ellerup, 59. Because she had been out of the area when each of the women disappeared, detectives believe the hairs were a result of her close proximity to her husband and not because she was involved in the killings. Heuermann's daughter and a stepson were also out of town when the murders took place.\n\nInvestigators also discovered more than 200 Google searches allegedly conducted by Heuermann about the status of the police investigation, and others about the whereabouts of victims' family members, as well as for rape and torture porn. Records from phone accounts also tied him to sadistic calls made to the families of victims. Among them was a call to Melissa Barthelemy's sister Amanda days after Melissa went missing in 2009 asking if she was \"going to be a whore like her sister,\" Lynn Barthelemy, Melissa and Amanda's mother, told People in 2016. \"He would call in the evening and torment Amanda. In his last call to Amanda, he said he had killed Melissa.\"\n\nAs the task force continued uncovering evidence of Heuermann's secret double life, a dark portrait of a serial murderer emerged, says Suffolk County D.A. Raymond Tierney. But evidence that he was using burner phones to once again contact women led detectives to arrest Heuermann. \"He was using these burner phones and fictitious accounts to contact sex workers,\" says Tierney. \"We knew we had to take him down, and we thought it would be safer to do it [away from] his home, since he has 92 gun permits. I'd say he was pretty surprised, so we did our job well. I think he lived this double life, and he used the anonymity of phones and computers to shield himself from the rest of society. Unfortunately for him -- and fortunately for the rest of us -- he wasn't successful.\"\n\nSpeaking to reporters outside the courthouse at Heuermann's arraignment on July 14, his court-appointed lawyer Michael Brown said his client wept as he told him, \"I didn't do this.\" Heuermann is being held without bail and is expected to appear back in court in August.\n\nThough the families of the victims are reliving grief all over again as details of the deaths of their loved ones are made public, there is also relief that justice may be served at last. Investigators say a trove of potential clues have been removed from the suspect's home and storage units. This could lead to additional charges in the upcoming days. \"I began to have my reservations about whether this would ever be solved,\" says attorney John Ray, who represents the families of possible Long Island Serial Killer victims Jessica Taylor and Shannan Gilbert. \"But that still leaves seven other people with their cases unsolved, and we're hoping that somebody turns the killer in -- maybe even the killer himself.\"", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long_Island_serial_killer", "type":

All four women worked as online escorts and disappeared between 2007 and 2010.\n\nHere is PEOPLE's July 2023 cover story following Heuermann's arrest.\n\nOn a hot, humid late-summer night in 2010, Amber Costello, 27, called her roommate from the locked bathroom of their rented cottage in West Babylon, N.Y., on Long Island. She was terrified. Costello, a sex worker, had been dancing for a client when he'd threatened to rape her, she said. Her roommate raced home and burst through the door ready to take a swing at anyone inside, only to find a hulking man in the living room who barely flinched. \"It was like fighting Frankenstein,\" the roommate says. As the man drove away in a first-generation Chevy Avalanche, he uttered a chilling admonition: \"You don't know who you're f---ing with.\" Says Costello's roommate, who has asked not to be identified by name: \"He had the blankest look on his face.\"\n\nShortly after, on Sept. 2, 2010, Costello left her home and was never seen again, yet her roommate never forgot the man or his haunting expression. And on July 14, 2023, when a picture of architect and twice-married father of two Rex Heuermann, 59, of nearby Massapequa Park, flashed across the news, \"I said, 'That's the Frankenstein dude. That's him.'\"\n\nPolice in New York's Suffolk County say they have finally caught the deadly predator known as the Long Island Serial Killer, believed to have murdered at least 3 and, by some estimates, as many as 18 victims over a decade.

That has come into fruition today with these two new charges.\"\n\nNewsweek reporter Jenna Sundel is livestreaming the press conference on Instagram.\n\nThe 60-year-old was first arrested in July 2023 for the deaths of four women whose remains were found in burlap sacks along the Ocean Parkway in New York over a decade ago.\n\nHeuermann already faces charges in connection to the murders of Melissa Barthelemy, Megan Waterman, Amber Lynn Costello and Maureen Brainard-Barnes - also known as \"The Gilgo Four.\"\n\n\"The families have been nothing short of incredible,\" Tierney said. \"The way that they continue to support each other and their loved ones is inspiring to us.\"\n\nJessica Taylor, 20, was a sex worker near the Port Authority Bus Terminal in New York City.\n\nTaylor spoke last to her mother July 21, according to Tierney during a press conference on Thursday. Less than two hours later, she made her last outcall.\n\nTierney said Taylor's family notified the police that she was missing on July 25 when she did not show up for her mother's birthday.\n\nTaylor's remains were found in July 2003 in the wooded area of Manorville, where Heuermann's Massapequa Park home is located. A woman walking her dog found Taylor's nude body just off of Halsey Manor Road and the Long Island Expressway. Taylor's body was decapitated, her hands and arms were obliterated, according to Tierney on Thursday.\n\nEight years later, on March 2011, more of Taylor's remains, including her skull, hands and forearm, were found on Gilgo Beach.\n\n\"They were found less than a mile away from the Gilgo four,\" Tierney said. \"All of the remains were found less than 50 feet away from the roadway.\"\n\nHeuermann graduated from the same local high school as actor Billy Baldwin who tweeted after the news broke about his 1981 classmate's arrest, describing it as \"mind-boggling.\"\n\nAfter getting a bachelor's degree from the New York Institute of Technology, Heuermann started his architecture firm RH Consultants in 1994. He did most of his architectural work in New York City, according to a company biography and the firm's website.\n\nPolice have found Heuermann owned a book of other serial killers, authored by John Douglas, according to court records obtained by Newsweek.\n\nHeuermann is currently being held at the Riverhead Correctional Facility in Suffolk County, about 50 miles from his home.\n\nWith the additional two murders, Tierney is asking for Heuermann's life incarceration to remain without bail.\n\nSuffolk County Sheriff Dr. Errol Toulon Jr. said Heuermann busies himself with reading books, reading his discovery, watching TV and sleeping, according to an Oxygen article.\n\nHe has been separated from other inmates \"for his safety,\" according to the article. Toulon called him \"very compliant.\"\n\nThe next court date for this case will be July 30.", "source": {"uri": "newsweek.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Newsweek"}, "authors": [{"uri":

Police also said a tattoo on her body had been \"severely obliterated by a sharp object.\"\n\nDuring the initial investigation in Manorville in 2003, the victim's head, arms, and hands were not found at the scene and their location remained unknown to law enforcement for nearly eight years.\n\nAccording to court documents, The Gilgo Homicide Task Force has established a pattern that Heuermann's wife and children were out of state at the time of Taylor's disappearance and murder, \"a consistent theme in each of the charged homicides thus far.\"\n\nHeuermann was indicted in the November 1993 death of Sandra Costilla, a Queens woman whose remains were found in the town of Southampton over three decades ago.\n\nAccording to police, Costilla was found lying on her back with her arms outstretched over her head with her uncovered legs spread apart.\n\nShe was also found with sharp force injuries to her face and her body.\n\nCostilla was a native of Trinidad and Tobago but had been living in New York prior to her disappearance and murder.", "source": {"uri": "fox5ny.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "FOX 5 New York"}, "authors": [{"uri": "adeja_shivonne@fox5ny.com", "name":

The source would not clarify to NBC News whether it meant there would be two or more than two additional charges.\n\nThe indictment is sealed but the source describes Thursday's arraignment and planned press conference at 11 a.m. by Suffolk County District Attorney Ray Tierney as \"huge\" and \"game-changing\" in the ongoing case against the 60-year-old former architect.\n\nWhen asked on Monday if Heuermann's upcoming court date is the result of two recent searches, Tierney said, \"It's the result of those and other investigative steps.\" However, the district attorney would not confirm any new charges.\n\n\"There were a number of investigative steps that were taken...Thursday you will see the fruits of that investigation,\" said Tierney.\n\nNews of the additional charges was first reported by Newsday.\n\nNBC New York previously reported earlier in the week that Heuermann would face an additional murder charge Thursday. Now it appears there will be at least one additional murder he will be connected to, the source told NNBC News.\n\nEarlier in the week, the Suffolk district attorney's office confirmed the court date but declined to specify the reasoning behind the new hearing or when it would occur.\n\nHeuermann's attorney, Michael Brown, has said his client maintains his innocence. Earlier in the week, he declined to comment on the nature of Thursday's hearing.\n\nThe new court date comes two weeks after investigators returned to Heuermann's single-story home in Massapequa Park, where they had recovered a cache of weapons during an initial search following his arrest last summer. A date for Heuermann's trial has not yet been set.\n\nDuring the most recent search, which lasted several days, investigators placed paint chips and other materials into evidence bags and removed a large rectangular object covered in a blue cloth.\n\n\"Just like the rest of us, we're waiting to hear what the district attorney has to say,\" Vess Mitev, the lawyer representing Heuermann's two adult children, previously told NBC New York. \"My clients, again, they're going to take it day-by-day, minute-by-minute, hour-by-hour as the landscape shifts around them.\"\n\nMitev earlier this week told NBC New York his clients have yet to return to their home after the latest police search there and says they stand by their father.\n\n\"If it's one or 100, they are allegations and they are eager have the legal process play itself out. Not in the court of public opinion, but in the courtroom in front of a jury, in front of a judge,\" Mitev said. \"These are allegations. They're horrible allegations, horrific allegations and they're dealing with an everyday process of trying to wrap their heads around it, the fact of allegations against their father. But they're allegations nonetheless.\"\n\nThe 60-year-old Heuermann was first arrested in July 2023 in the deaths of four women whose remains were found in burlap sacks along a remote stretch of Ocean Parkway more than a decade ago. The bodies of Maureen Brainard-Barnes, Amber Lynn Costello, Melissa Barthelemy and Megan Waterman, were found during a search for a missing escort, Shannan Gilbert, who later was found dead in a marsh. Her case was inconclusive; it has not been linked to the others.\n\nAs officers searched for her, they found at least six additional sets of remains in addition to the four women's bodies. Not all of those people have been positively identified. At least two were believed to be escorts who fit the victim profile.\n\nHeuermann has pleaded not guilty to the charges. Word of the new charges comes weeks after investigators returned to Heuermann's home with a search warrant. It wasn't clear what, if anything, they found, but that search came shortly after another unspecified search connected to the Gilgo investigation, this time in a wooded area in Manorville.\n\nSome of the remains discovered in Manorville years ago, when the investigation started, were linked to the body parts of Jessica Taylor and Valerie Mack discovered along Ocean Parkway. No arrests have been made in those cases.\n\nRobert Macedonio, a lawyer for Heuermann's estranged wife, said the most recent search of the Massapequa Park home was primarily focused on the basement. He said the family was out of state when the search was conducted. Macedonio declined to say what was taken from the home and said the family has not yet received the search warrant affidavit that would spell out their reasons for conducting the search.\n\nDuring the initial search of the home in July 2023, authorities tore up a wooden deck and used an excavator to dig up the backyard, which they scanned for buried objects using specialized equipment. The most recent search was far less disruptive, according to Macedonio.", "source": {"uri": "nbcchicago.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NBC Chicago"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBC_News", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "NBC News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arraignment", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Arraignment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/District_attorney", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "District attorney"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WNBC", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "WNBC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Murder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suffolk_County,_New_York", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Suffolk County, New York"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Suffolk County, New York"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massapequa_Park,_New_York", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Massapequa Park, New York"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Massapequa Park, New York"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gilgo,_New_York", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gilgo, New York"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serial_killer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Serial killer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long_Island", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Long Island"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Long Island"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indictment", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Indictment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawyer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lawyer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manorville,_New_York", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Manorville, New York"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Manorville, New York"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brown_University", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Brown University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newsday", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Newsday"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long_Island_serial_killer", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Long Island serial killer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gunny_sack", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gunny sack"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocean_Parkway_(Brooklyn)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ocean Parkway (Brooklyn)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acquittal", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Acquittal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_opinion", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Public opinion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affidavit", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Affidavit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Search_warrant", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Search warrant"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Murder", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Murder", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Internet/Searching", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Internet/Searching", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Paranormal/Investigators", "label": "dmoz/Society/Paranormal/Investigators", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Search_Engines", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Search Engines", "wgt": 18}], "image": "https://media.nbcchicago.com/2024/06/Heuermann-house-search-w-pic-inset.jpg?quality=85&strip=all&resize=1200%2C675", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9620887", "eventUri": "eng-9620887", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.3333333333333334, "wgt": 164, "relevance": 1}

Gilgo Beach victims revealed", "body": "Rex Heuermann, the alleged Gilgo Beach serial killer, is now charged with two additional murders for the deaths of Sandra Costilla and Jessica Taylor, according to court records obtained by Newsweek.\n\nThe charges mark now the fifth and sixth victims connected to Heuermann.\n\nThe 60-year-old was first arrested in July 2023 for the deaths of four women whose remains were found in burlap sacks along the Ocean Parkway in New York over a decade ago. He is expected to appear in a Suffolk County courthouse Thursday morning for the new charges.\n\nHeuermann already faces charges in connection to the murders of Melissa Barthelemy, Megan Waterman, Amber Lynn Costello and Maureen Brainard-Barnes - also known as \"The Gilgo Four.\"\n\nThe announcement of a potential fifth victim comes weeks after authorities returned to Heuermann's Long Island home. At least half a dozen law enforcement agents were spotted in Heuermann's driveway on May 20. Cars, including state trooper vans, lined the street along the Massapequa Park neighborhood.\n\nRobert Macedonio, who represents Heuermann's estranged wife, told Newsday the inspection seemed to focus in the basement of the Long Island house.\n\nCostilla's body was found in 1993 in a wooded area in North Sea. On Nov. 21, 1993, two hunters discovered the 28-year-old's body in Southampton.\n\nShe had been strangled to death and left partially clothed. He remains were in the woods for several days prior to being discovered.\n\nAuthorities identified Costilla by using her fingerprints, which had been entered into the system after she was arrested for jumping over a subway turnstile in 1992.\n\nCostilla was called a \"drifter\" by the police. Her last known address was in Queens, but it is thought she wasn't living there at the time of her death. Police never said if Costilla was a sex worker but called her lifestyle \"substantially similar.\"\n\nIn the past, convicted murderer John Bittrolff had been tied to Costilla's death. Bittrolff was never charged, however.\n\nTaylor, 20, was a sex worker near the Port Authority Bus Terminal in New York City.\n\nTaylor's remains were found in July of 2003 in the wooded area of Manorville, where Heuermann's Massapequa Park home is located. A woman walking her dog found Taylor's nude body just off of Halsey Manor Road and the Long Island Expressway.\n\nDuring the examination of Taylor's body male human hairs were found, \"specifically from a surgical drape that had been underneath the victim,\" according to court records obtained by Newsweek. They were determined to be from the head of a person with \"Caucasian / European characteristics.\" The hairs were unsuitable for further DNA testing.\"\n\nIn March 2011, more of Taylor's remains, including her skull, hands and forearm, were found on Gilgo Beach.\n\nAt the time of Taylor's disappearance, Heuermann worked in the same vicinity as where Taylor was known to \"street walk,\" or work as a sex worker, according to court records obtained by Newsweek.\n\n\"Records seized during the execution of prior search warrants reveal Heuermann was in fact present in midtown Manhattan on July 21, 2003, the same date Ms. Taylor disappeared,\" the document reads.\n\nWhen police were investigating the area in the days following Taylor's disappearance investigators spoke with a witness who had seen a \"dark-colored Chevrolet pickup truck backed-in to the same wooded area where Ms. Taylor's body was later found,\" according to court records.\n\nHeuermann purchased a 2002 dark-colored Chevrolet Avalanche pick-up truck in March 2002. While the make and model of Heuermann's vehicle is the same as his 2002 vehicle, the exterior color is different.\n\nIn the days after Taylor's disappearance, Heuermann searched a Newsday article called \"Cops Seek Help in IDing Manorville Body,\" which was about the discovery of Taylor's remains. That online activity was subsequently deleted, according to the bail application.\n\nOn July 29, 2003, Heuermann searched online for a new Chevrolet Avalanche. The forensic analysis also showed he attempted to delete this query.\n\nThe Gilgo Homicide Task Force has established that Heuermann's wife and children were out of state at the time of Taylor's disappearance.\n\nBrainard-Barnes is believed to be the first victim among the \"Gilgo Four.\" The 25-year-old was living in Norwich, Connecticut when she went missing. It is believed that she took an Amtrak train from New London to New York City on July 6, 2007.\n\nShe spent her time in the city working as a prostitute, as advertised on Craigslist, Backpage and other sites.\n\nThe weekend she went missing, Brainard-Barnes traveled with another woman to the city. The other woman, however, went back home early.\n\nOn July 9 Brainard-Barnes called a friend in Connecticut minutes before midnight. She said she was going to meet someone outside of the motel. Suffolk Police Department said that was not her typical operating procedure.\n\nA friend reported Brainard-Barnes missing five days later.\n\nHer body was found on the north side of Ocean Parkway near Gilgo Beach on Dec. 13, 2010.\n\nBarthelemy, 24, went missing on July 12, 2009. She was last seen at her basement apartment on Underhill Avenue in the Unionport section of the Bronx.\n\nThe escort advertised on Adult Friend Finder and other sites, according to the police. She would meet clients at bars, restaurants and hotels on Manhattan's West Side.\n\nBarthelemy told a friend the night she went missing that she was going to meet a man and would be back in the morning. The friend did not know any other details about the meet up beyond that Barthelemy was a sex worker.\n\nBarthelemy's mother reported her missing to the New York Police Department on July 18 after not being able to reach her for a few days.\n\nCellphone records show Barthelemy went from the Bronx to Manhattan on July 12. Her cellphone signal was picked up in Long Island as well.\n\nSuffolk County Police Department said Barthelemy's sister got a series of taunting phone calls. They were believed to come from her killer.\n\nBarthelemy's body was found on Dec. 11, 2010. She was the first victim the police physically found.\n\nWaterman was a sex worker and resident of Scarborough, Maine. Her family watched the 22-year-old board a New York-bound bus with a man who may have been her pimp.\n\nAn investigation found Waterman was staying at a Holiday Inn Express in Hauppauge on June 6, 2010. She left around 1:30 a.m. to meet a client, according to the police. However, she told her pimp that she was going to a convenience store.\n\nTwo days later, Waterman's family reported her missing to police in Maine. They said it was unlike her to not check-in on her then-3-year-old daughter.\n\nCostello is the oldest of the \"Gilgo Four\" victims. She was 27 when she went missing in September of 2010.\n\nShe was a heroin addict at the time and was living with another woman and two men, who were similarly addicted to drugs.\n\nCostello moved to New York from Clearwater, Florida. Police said she completed a 28-day drug rehabilitation program but had relapsed prior to going missing.\n\nThey lived on Long Island. In order to support their addictions, Costello and the other woman advertised as sex workers on Craigslist and Backpage, according to police.\n\nCostello was last seen leaving the home she shared on America Avenue on Sept. 2, 2010. She was going to meet a client, who was picking her up at the house. Costello didn't have a cellphone on her at the time.\n\nShe was never reported missing.\n\nThe hunt for a possible serial killer started in 2010 when 11 sets of human remains were discovered along a property on Gilgo Beach in Suffolk County. Law enforcement first started searching along Ocean Parkway after Shannan Gilbert, a 24-year-old sex worker from New Jersey, vanished in 2010.\n\nThe search first turned up the remains of Barthelemy, Waterman, Lynn Costello and Brainard-Barnes. All the women were in their mid-20s.\n\nPolice found other remains during the search, including those that belonged to Jessica Taylor and Valerie Mack, who were also in their 20s when they had gone missing years earlier.\n\nOther remains discovered included those of a female toddler, an Asian male, an unidentified woman who was believed to be the toddler's mother and another woman identified as 34-year-old Karen Vergata who went missing in 1996.\n\nGilbert was found in late 2011, after the other 10 victims were found.\n\nThe case has long mystified police, and it captured the public's attention when Netflix released a film in 2020 called Lost Girls that was based on the murders.\n\nDetectives finally nabbed Heuermann in 2023 after he tossed a pizza box with leftover crust into a Manhattan trash can. The DNA from the crust matched genetic material found on the women's remains.\n\nShannon Gilbert's death is riddled with mystery. Her family is convinced it was homicide.\n\nGilbert, 24, disappeared in Oak Beach, a quiet gated community off of the Ocean Parkway, on May 1, 2010. The 23-year-old sex worker was meeting with a client, Joseph Brewer.\n\nLaw enforcement first started searching along Ocean Parkway after Gilbert vanished in 2010. The hunt for a possible serial killer commenced when 11 sets of human remains were discovered along a property on Gilgo Beach in Suffolk County.\n\nSuffolk County detectives said for a while that Gilbert was not one of Heuermann's victims. Suffolk County Police Department said Gilbert's death was not a murder and was \"most likely an accident.\"\n\nHer sister, Sherre intensely disagreed for years, pointing to 911 calls.\n\nThree phone calls to 911, including one that was more than 21-minutes long by Gilbert, took place the night Gilbert went missing. She initially called from inside Brewer's home shortly before 5 a.m.\n\n\"There is somebody after me,\" she tells the dispatcher multiple times. \"Somebody's after me -- please,\" Gilbert said.\n\nGilbert couldn't specify where she was but said she was located on Long Island. Brewer and Michael Pak, Gilbert's driver and security, are heard telling her to go outside.\n\nAfter 22 minutes and 42 seconds, the call cuts out.\n\nA neighbor had also called 911 saying a young girl was \"running around screaming.\"\n\nInvestigators believe Gilbert got disoriented in marsh reeds while running in the dark. Much of the marshland is impassable. Some of Gilbert's belongings were found along a path.\n\nA private pathologist hired by the Gilbert family found insufficient evidence to confirm a cause of death. Renowned forensic pathologist Michael Baden, however, said Gilbert had suffered injuries \"consistent with homicidal strangulation.\"\n\nA taxi driver said in a sworn statement previously that she believes she saw Gilbert and Heuermann at the Sayville Motor Lodge. Gilbert allegedly told the cab driver that she met Heuermann on Craigslist and was promised financial assistance.\n\nHeuermann graduated from the same local high school as actor Billy Baldwin who tweeted after the news broke about his 1981 classmate's arrest, describing it as \"mind-boggling.\"\n\nAfter getting a bachelor's degree from the New York Institute of Technology, Heuermann started his architecture firm RH Consultants in 1994. He did most of his architectural work in New York City, according to a company biography and the firm's website.\n\nHeuermann is currently being held at the Riverhead Correctional Facility in Suffolk County, about 50 miles from his home.\n\nSuffolk County Sheriff Dr. Errol Toulon Jr. said Heuermann busies himself with reading books, reading his discovery, watching TV and sleeping, according to an Oxygen article.\n\nHe has been separated from other inmates \"for his safety,\" according to the article. Toulon called him \"very compliant.\"", "source": {"uri": "newsweek.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Newsweek"}, "authors": [{"uri": "monica_sager@newsweek.com", "name": "Monica Sager", "type":

He is currently in custody.\n\nTaylor, 20, went missing in 2003 while working as an escort in New York City. Some of her remains were discovered in Manorville that year, and more were found by the side of Ocean Parkway. The body of 28-year-old Costilla was discovered in 1993.\n\nIn a court filing, prosecutors said they were able to use new forensic testing methods to match hairs found on or near the vicinity of both victims to a DNA profile that is a likely match to Heuermann. Additionally, prosecutors say they recovered a \"planning document\" on a hard drive in his basement used to \"methodically blueprint\" his killings.\n\nPolice have been probing the deaths of at least 10 people, most of whom are sex workers, whose remains were discovered along an isolated highway not far from Gilgo Beach since 2010.\n\nThe victims had gone missing over a span of at least 14 years.\n\nHeurmann, an architect who lived across a bay from where the bodies were found, was arrested last July in connection to the killings of Megan Waterman, Melissa Barthelemy, Amber Lynn Costello and Maureen Brainard-Barnes.\n\nAlleged 'planning document'\n\nOne piece of evidence the Gilgo Homicide Task Force found in Heuermann's basement was a Microsoft Word document entitled \"HK2002-04.\" Though it had been deleted, forensics experts were able to recover it.\n\n\"The task force believes that this is a planning document that was utilized by Heuremann to methodically blueprint and plan out his kills with excruciating detail,\" Suffolk County District Attorney Ray Tierney said at a press conference Thursday. \"His intent was specifically to locate these victims, to hunt them down and to bring them under his control and to kill them. His motivations, meticulous planning and clear intent is obvious.\"\n\nThe all-caps document featured a series of checklists with tasks to complete before, during and after the killings, as well as practical lessons for \"next time,\" according to a court filing. Among the dozens of entries written are reminders to clean the bodies and destroy evidence, to \"get sleep before hunt\" and to \"have story set.\"\n\nOne section, titled \"things to remember,\" appeared to highlight lessons from previous killings, prosecutors said, such as using heavier rope and limiting noise in order to maximize \"play time.\" A \"body prep\" checklist includes, among other items, a note to \"remove head and hands.\"\n\nOther evidence in latest victims' case\n\nMore of what investigators found was detailed in a bail application document sent out before the hearing, which also includes more information about the condition of the victims' remains.\n\nIn 2003, a person walking their dog found Taylor's remains and called 911, according to the document. She had been found decapitated, lying on her back, with her legs bent underneath her. Both of Taylor's arms were severed from her body below her elbows and a tattoo on her torso had been \"severely obliterated\" by a sharp object.\n\nTaylor's skull, hands and forearm were later discovered along Ocean Parkway, just east of Gilgo Beach. The remains were on the same side of the road from where Brainard-Barnes, Barthelemy, Waterman and Costello's had been found.\n\nA male human hair was recovered on Taylor, from a surgical drape that she had been underneath. It was sent to a mitochondrial testing laboratory, as well as a nuclear DNA testing lab, and test results showed that results were able to exclude most of the population except for Heuermann.\n\nCostilla's remains were found in November 1993 by two people hunting in a wooded area of Southampton. She had been lying on her back, her arms outstretched over her head, with her uncovered legs spread apart. Costilla's shirt was pulled over her torso and head, the bail application document said, and there were multiple sharp force injuries to her body. Hairs found on Costilla were also sent for testing, which also pointed to Heuremann, the bail application said.", "source": {"uri": "wgntv.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "WGN-TV"}, "authors": [],

After recent searches, accused Gilgo Beach killer facing charges in deaths of more victims: sources", "body": "He is expected to be charged in two more deaths Thursday; investigators haven't identified the victims. Two, Valerie Mack and Jessica Taylor, had been dismembered; part of their remains were found in Manorville in an earlier. Those matched remains found along Ocean Parkway\n\nThe New York City architect arrested last year in connection with a string of cold case bodies found on Long Island's Gilgo Beach is expected to be arraigned Thursday on an indictment charging him in the deaths of two more victims, sources with knowledge of the investigation confirmed.\n\nAccused serial killer Rex Heuermann is scheduled for a 9:30 a.m. arraignment on the new charges. The names of the victims were not specified.\n\nThe 60-year-old was first arrested in July 2023 in the deaths of four women whose remains were found in burlap sacks along a remote stretch of Ocean Parkway in 2010. The bodies of Maureen Brainard-Barnes, Amber Lynn Costello, Melissa Barthelemy and Megan Waterman, were discovered during a search for a missing escort, Shannan Gilbert, who later was found dead in a marsh. Her case was ruled an accidental drowning. It has not been linked to the others.\n\nOther sets of remains turned up in that search for Gilbert, too. Two of the victims, Jessica Taylor and Valerie Mack, were escorts like the others. No arrests have been made in their deaths.\n\nThe indictment is sealed. A press conference is planned for later Thursday. News 4 had previously reported Heuermann was expected to face one new charge. The additional development came late Wednesday.\n\nThe anticipated new charges come after two recent searches tied to the case, which baffled investigators for more than a decade. Investigators returned to Heuermann's single-family Massapequa Park home not long after they scoured a wooded area in Manorville in connection with the case. A lawyer for Heuermann's wife said investigators focused primarily on the basement when they returned to the home with a search warrant last month.\n\nIt wasn't clear what they were looking for or what they may have found, but asked this week if Heuermann's Thursday court date resulted from those searches, Suffolk County District Attorney Raymond Tierney said, \"It's the result of those and other investigative steps.\"\n\nTierney declined to elaborate further.\n\nHeuermann has pleaded not guilty to the charges against him. His attorney maintains his innocence.\n\nValerie Mack, 24, who had been working as an escort in Philadelphia, disappeared in 2000 and was last seen by her family in Port Republic, New Jersey. Some of her skeletal remains were discovered that same year in the Manorville woods. More of her remains were found in 2011 in the search around Gilgo Beach.\n\nInitially known as \"Jane Doe No. 6,\" Mack's remains had been unidentified for years until genetic testing revealed her identity in 2020.\n\nJessica Taylor, 20, vanished in 2003 while working as an escort in New York City. Some of her remains were discovered in Manorville that year. Other remains were found in a 2011 search of the beach scrub by the side of Ocean Parkway.\n\nRelatives for Mack and Taylor declined to comment Wednesday.\n\nAs for Heuermann's family, his two adult children are waiting, too, according to their lawyer.\n\n\"Just like the rest of us, we're waiting to hear what the district attorney has to say,\" said Vess Mitev, the lawyer representing Heuermann's two adult children. \"My clients, again, they're going to take it day-by-day, minute-by-minute, hour-by-hour as the landscape shifts around them.\"\n\nMitev earlier this week told NBC New York his clients have yet to return to their home after the latest police search there and says they stand by their father.\n\n\"If it's one or 100, they are allegations and they are eager have the legal process play itself out. Not in the court of public opinion, but in the courtroom in front of a jury, in front of a judge,\" Mitev said. \"These are allegations. They're horrible allegations, horrific allegations and they're dealing with an everyday process of trying to wrap their heads around it, the fact of allegations against their father. But they're allegations nonetheless.\"", "source": {"uri": "nbcnewyork.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NBC New York"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

The source would not clarify to NBC News whether it meant there would be two or more than two additional charges.\n\nThe indictment is sealed but the source describes Thursday's arraignment and planned press conference at 11 a.m. by Suffolk County District Attorney Ray Tierney as \"huge\" and \"game-changing\" in the ongoing case against the 60-year-old former architect.\n\nNBC New York previously reported earlier in the week that Heuermann would face an additional murder charge on Thursday. Now, it appears there will be at least one additional murder he will be connected to, the source told NNBC News.\n\nEarlier in the week, the Suffolk district attorney's office confirmed the court date but declined to specify the reasoning behind the new hearing.\n\nHeuermann's attorney, Michael Brown, has said his client maintains his innocence. Earlier in the week, he declined to comment on the nature of Thursday's hearing.\n\nThe new court date comes two weeks after investigators returned to Heuermann's single-story home in Massapequa Park, where they had recovered a cache of weapons during an initial search following his arrest last summer. A date for Heuermann's trial has not yet been set.\n\nDuring the most recent search, which lasted several days, investigators placed paint chips and other materials into evidence bags and removed a large rectangular object covered in a blue cloth.\n\n\"Just like the rest of us, we're waiting to hear what the district attorney has to say,\" Vess Mitev, the lawyer representing Heuermann's two adult children, previously told NBC New York. \"My clients, again, they're going to take it day-by-day, minute-by-minute, hour-by-hour as the landscape shifts around them.\"\n\nMitev earlier this week told NBC New York his clients have yet to return to their home after the latest police search there and says they stand by their father.\n\n\"If it's one or 100, they are allegations and they are eager have the legal process play itself out. Not in the court of public opinion, but in the courtroom in front of a jury, in front of a judge,\" Mitev said. \"These are allegations. They're horrible allegations, horrific allegations and they're dealing with an everyday process of trying to wrap their heads around it, the fact of allegations against their father. But they're allegations nonetheless.\"\n\nThe 60-year-old Heuermann was first arrested in July 2023 in the deaths of four women whose remains were found in burlap sacks along a remote stretch of Ocean Parkway more than a decade ago. The bodies of Maureen Brainard-Barnes, Amber Lynn Costello, Melissa Barthelemy and Megan Waterman, were found during a search for a missing escort, Shannan Gilbert, who later was found dead in a marsh. Her case was inconclusive; it has not been linked to the others.\n\nAs officers searched for her, they found at least six additional sets of remains in addition to the four women's bodies. Not all of those people have been positively identified. At least two were believed to be escorts who fit the victim profile.\n\nHeuermann has pleaded not guilty to the charges. Word of the new charges comes weeks after investigators returned to Heuermann's home with a search warrant. It wasn't clear what, if anything, they found, but that search came shortly after another unspecified search connected to the Gilgo investigation, this time in a wooded area in Manorville.\n\nSome of the remains discovered in Manorville years ago, when the investigation started, were linked to the body parts of Jessica Taylor and Valerie Mack discovered along Ocean Parkway. No arrests have been made in those cases.\n\nRobert Macedonio, a lawyer for Heuermann's estranged wife, said the most recent search of the Massapequa Park home was primarily focused on the basement. He said the family was out of state when the search was conducted. Macedonio declined to say what was taken from the home and said the family has not yet received the search warrant affidavit that would spell out their reasons for conducting the search.\n\nWhen asked Monday if Heuermann's upcoming court date is the result of the two recent searches, the Suffolk County DA said, \"It's the result of those and other investigative steps.\" However, the district attorney would not confirm any new charges.\n\n\"There were a number of investigative steps that were taken...Thursday you will see the fruits of that investigation,\" said Ray Tierney.\n\nDuring the initial search of the home in July 2023, authorities tore up a wooden deck and used an excavator to dig up the backyard, which they scanned for buried objects using specialized equipment. The most recent search was far less disruptive, according to Macedonio.", "source": {"uri": "nbcnewyork.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NBC New York"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WNBC", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "WNBC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBC_News", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "NBC News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arraignment", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Arraignment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/District_attorney", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "District attorney"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Architect", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Architect"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawyer", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Lawyer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Murder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suffolk_County,_New_York", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Suffolk County, New York"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Suffolk County, New York"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gilgo,_New_York", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gilgo, New York"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serial_killer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Serial killer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long_Island", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Long Island"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Long Island"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brown_University", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Brown University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indictment", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Indictment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocean_Parkway_(Brooklyn)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ocean Parkway (Brooklyn)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_opinion", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Public opinion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massapequa_Park,_New_York", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Massapequa Park, New York"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Massapequa Park, New York"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long_Island_serial_killer", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Long Island serial killer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gunny_sack", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gunny sack"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acquittal", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Acquittal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affidavit", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Affidavit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Search_warrant", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Search warrant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manorville,_New_York", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Manorville, New York"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Manorville, New York"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Murder", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Murder", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Internet/Searching", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Internet/Searching", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Paranormal/Investigators", "label": "dmoz/Society/Paranormal/Investigators", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Search_Engines", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Search Engines", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 50}], "image": "https://media.nbcnewyork.com/2024/06/Heuermann-house-search-w-pic-inset.jpg?quality=85&strip=all&resize=1200%2C675", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9620887", "eventUri": "eng-9620887", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.3490196078431372, "wgt": 160, "relevance": 1}

She has been working at PEOPLE since 2014.\n\nLong Island Serial Killer suspect Rex Heuermann has been charged with two more murders, with one dating back to 1993.\n\nThe Suffolk County District Attorney's Office announced Thursday that a grand jury indicted the architect from Massapequa Park, N.Y., with two counts of murder in connection with the deaths of Sandra Costilla in 1993 and Jessica Taylor in 2003.\n\nHeuermann is already facing murder charges in the deaths of Megan Waterman, Melissa Barthelemy, Amber Costello and Maureen Brainard-Barnes. All four women worked as online escorts and disappeared between 2007 and 2010. Their remains were all found in an area on Gilgo Beach in Long Island, N.Y., in December 2010.\n\nTaylor's remains were discovered by a witness walking their dog on July 26, 2003, according to an amended indictment, which states she was found \"lying on her back with her legs bent underneath her.\"\n\nA tattoo on her torso had been \"severely obliterated by a sharp object\" and her arms had been decapitated, per the indictment which was released on Thursday.\n\nCostilla's remains were discovered on Nov. 20, 1993 by two people hunting in a wooded area and she was found \"lying on her back with her arms outstretched over her head with her uncovered legs spread apart,\" per the indictment. Costila, who was from Trinidad and Tobago, had several \"sharp force injuries\" across her body.\n\nBob Macedonio, the attorney for Asa Ellerup, Heuermann's wife, told PEOPLE the Suffolk County District Attorney's Office and other law enforcement personnel searched Heuermann's house over six days last month.\n\nThe search, according to Macedonio, focused primarily on the basement.\n\nHeuermann -- a father of two -- was arrested July 13, 2023, near his office building in Manhattan.\n\nHeuermann was allegedly linked to the murders of Waterman, Barthelemy, Brainard-Barnes and Waterman by burner phones and DNA evidence found on the victims.\n\nHe was also traced to a Chevrolet Avalanche registered to him that was allegedly seen at the time of Costello's disappearance. Authorities also found evidence that Heuermann was allegedly obsessed with the case and searched for articles about the task force that was formed to investigate the murders.\n\nAccording to authorities, included in his searches were: \"Why could law enforcement not trace the calls made by the Long Island serial killer,\" and \"why hasn't the Long Island serial killer been caught.\"\n\nWant to keep up with the latest crime coverage?

He was also suspected of killing a fourth person whose body was found, and was charged with that person's murder in January.

She's now filed for divorce", "body": "\"If you ask me, I don't believe, that they knew about this double life that Mr. Heuermann was living,\" Suffolk County Police Commissioner Rodney Harrison said of the suspect's family.\n\nBut authorities were not ruling anything out yet and were continuing to collect information \"to see if the family might have known exactly what Mr. Heuermann was up to,\" Harrison told CNN's Erica Hill in a July 2023 interview.\n\nThat month, Heuermann was arrested and charged with murder in connection to the killings of three of the \"Gilgo Four,\" a group of four women whose remains were found along a short stretch of Long Island's Gilgo Beach in 2010. He also was identified as the prime suspect in the disappearance and killing of the fourth woman, Maureen Brainard-Barnes, who was 25 years old when she was last seen. He was charged with her murder in January and pleaded not guilty.\n\nHeuermann, 60, is expected to be indicted on two additional murder charges when he appears in court Thursday, according to multiple law enforcement sources.\n\nLess than a week after her husband's arrest, Ellerup filed for divorce, her attorney Robert Macedonio told CNN. He did not comment further on the matter.\n\nShe was shocked to hear what her husband is accused of, Harrison said.\n\nBut she unknowingly played a key role in her husband's arrest: it was her DNA, among other evidence, that authorities say helped tie Heuermann to the crimes.\n\nHere's what we know about his wife, their life together and the unexpected role she played in the case.\n\nThe two have been married for 27 years\n\nHeuermann and Ellerup were married in April 1996, the suspect said in a 2018 deposition. Since then, they lived in Heuermann's red and green childhood home in the Long Island suburb of Massapequa Park with their daughter and Heuermann's stepson.\n\nBut despite their long stint in the neighborhood - and though Heuermann's life was long rooted in the same community, neighbors knew little detail about the family.\n\nNeighbors described the home as creepy and the family as distant, according to the Long Island Press, a monthly magazine serving Long Island.\n\n\"The family is very to themselves, quiet,\" neighbor Frankie Musto told the publication. \"We never saw anything suspicious.\"\n\nIn his 2018 deposition, Heuermann said he had been married once before. That marriage, he said, lasted three years and they had no children.\n\nWife's hair found with all three victims\n\nWhen the victims were first discovered, there were pieces of degraded hair recovered by authorities - but DNA testing at the time could not provide the answers investigators hoped for.\n\nTechnological improvements soon helped yield results.\n\nHair that is now believed to belong to Ellerup - which presumably had been unintentionally carried by the suspect on his clothes - was found on or near the three victims, prosecutors alleged in the bail application, citing DNA testing.\n\nThat DNA came from 11 bottles inside a garbage can outside the Heuermann home, the court document says. Authorities had been surveilling Heuermann and his family for months after they identified him as a suspect in early 2022, and during that time collected DNA samples from items the family threw away.\n\nThough her hair was found with the victims, Ellerup and their daughter were both traveling when the killings were committed and Heuermann was \"alone in the tri-state area,\" Suffolk County District Attorney Ray Tierney said at a news conference last summer.\n\n\"It's very significant in as much as it then limits it down to him,\" criminal defense attorney Joey Jackson told CNN's Jake Tapper about the finding. \"If the suspect's wife is out of town, then why would her hair be there if he's in town?\"\n\nSuffolk County authorities say DNA evidence also linked Heuermann to a male hair found on the burlap sack where one victim's remains were found.\n\nShocked, disgusted, embarrassed\n\nHarrison told CNN last summer he was informed that once authorities told Ellerup and her daughter about the crimes Heuermann is accused of, the two were \"shocked, they were disgusted, they were embarrassed.\"\n\nTheir reaction, he said, is why he believes they were not aware of what he was doing.\n\n\"But, time will tell,\" he added. \"And once again, there are still a lot more questions that need to be done to the family and friends.\"\n\nCNN has made multiple attempts to contact Heuermann's wife and daughter.\n\nThe attorneys representing Ellerup said last July she and her family \"are going through a devastating time in their lives\" and are asking for privacy.\n\n\"The sensitive nature of her husband's arrest is taking an emotional toll on the immediate and extended family, especially their elderly family members,\" said a statement from the Macedonio & Duncan law firm. \"Ms. Ellerup does not wish to comment further and has requested the public and press to please respect the family's privacy at this time.\"\n\nFollowing his arrest, Heuermann was remanded without bail. He entered a not guilty plea through his attorney.\n\nCNN's Patricia DiCarlo, Rob Frehse and Jean Casarez contributed to this report.", "source": {"uri": "uk.news.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news",

She was a native of Trinidad and Tobago but had been living in New York when she disappeared around November. Two hunters found Costilla's body in a wooded area of Southampton, the bail application detailed. She would have been the earliest known victim of the alleged serial killer who hadn't been named until Thursday.\n\nThe court document detailed how a female hair found on Costilla's mutilated body \"share a common base at all compared positions\" to a witness who once lived at Heuermann's residence in Massapequa.\n\nThe other alleged victim of the 59-year-old is Jessica Taylor. Parts of her remains were found in the vicinity of Mill Road in July 2003 and again in March 2011.\n\nFollowing Heuermann's arrest, investigators searched his residence numerous times and discovered over 350 electronic devices that contained a \"significant collection\" of violent pornography dating back to 1994, according to the bail application. The obscene images allegedly accessed by Heuermann notably coincided with how the remains of Costilla, Taylor and another young woman, Valerie Mack, were discovered.\n\nHeuermann has not been charged with Mack's murder. So far, he's accused of killing six women, including Maureen Brainard-Barnes in 2007, Melissa Barthelemy in 2009, Megan Waterman in 2010 and Amber Costello in 2010.

The new charges came just days after police finished extensive searches of Heuermann's Massapequa Park home and a wooded area on Long Island tied to the investigation of a string of deaths known as the Gilgo Beach serial killings.", "source": {"uri": "syracuse.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "syracuse"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jessica_Taylor", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jessica Taylor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riverhead_(town),_New_York", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Riverhead (town), New York"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Riverhead (town), New York"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gilgo,_New_York", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gilgo, New York"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serial_killer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Serial killer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long_Island", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Long Island"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Long Island"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Associated Press"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massapequa_Park,_New_York", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Massapequa Park, New York"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Massapequa Park, New York"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Murder", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Murder", "wgt": 29}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Women's_Health/Smoking", "label": "dmoz/Health/Women's Health/Smoking", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Folklore/Death_and_Funeral_Customs", "label": "dmoz/Society/Folklore/Death and Funeral Customs", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death/Near_Death_Experiences", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death/Near Death Experiences", "wgt": 21}], "image": "https://www.syracuse.com/resizer/v2/4P6UWRYY5RAIXCMQ7BWCLUCPC4.jpg?auth=eae1e8f7629a241e39082dc90b0641980f8fdb469c4c8bc5bf9182cfc1c3aaa0&width=1280&quality=90", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9620887", "eventUri": "eng-9620887", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Riverhead (town), New York"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.6470588235294117, "wgt": 133, "relevance": 1}

Vexed police officers made only halting progress in identifying possible suspects. Investigators long said it was likely that not all of the deaths were the work of the same killer. Some of the victims disappeared in the mid-1990s. Investigators concluded that an 11th person who disappeared in 2010 from the barrier island community of Oak Beach had accidentally drowned.\n\nHeuermann, who lived across a bay from where the bodies were found, was arrested last July. Prosecutors said a new investigative task force used mobile phone location data and DNA samples to link the architect to some of the victims. He was charged with killing four of the women: Megan Waterman, Melissa Barthelemy, Amber Lynn Costello and Maureen Brainard-Barnes.\n\nInvestigators who had searched Heuermann's home extensively and dug up his yard last summer returned to the house again last month and spent nearly a week searching it again.

Unlike the other victims in the case, Costilla was not known to be a sex worker, and her long-unsolved murder had not previously been associated with the investigation.", "source": {"uri": "radaronline.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "RadarOnline"}, "authors": [{"uri": "peter_helman@radaronline.com", "name": "Peter Helman", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_jury", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Grand jury"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indictment", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Indictment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Costilla_County,_Colorado", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Costilla County, Colorado"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Costilla County, Colorado"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocean_Parkway_(Long_Island)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ocean Parkway (Long Island)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gilgo,_New_York", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gilgo, New York"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daily_Mail", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Daily Mail"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manorville,_New_York", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Manorville, New York"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Manorville, New York"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex_worker", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sex worker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Murder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queens", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Queens"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Queens"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southampton", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Southampton"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Southampton"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trinidad_and_Tobago", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Trinidad and Tobago"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Trinidad and Tobago"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Murder", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Murder", "wgt": 32}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Party_Games", "label": "dmoz/Games/Party Games", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Unsolved", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Unsolved", "wgt": 26}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Party_Games/Murder_Mystery", "label": "dmoz/Games/Party Games/Murder Mystery", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 54}], "image": "https://media.radaronline.com/brand-img/EQ5HlMph_/1200x628/rex-heuermanns-estranged-wife-shows-up-to-court-with-documentary-crew-1700077467808.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9620887", "eventUri": "eng-9620887", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2003-07-", "textStart": 203, "textEnd": 212}], "sentiment": -0.3411764705882353, "wgt": 107, "relevance": 1}

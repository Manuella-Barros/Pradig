With more than 20,000 global customers and a network of approximately 800 partners worldwide, Boomi is leading the industry towards the future with a focus on integration and automation, API management, and data management, all made more important and powerful than ever with the emergence of the AI economy.\n\nThis press release features multimedia. View the full release here: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20240508488304/en/\n\nIn his keynote, Boomi CEO Steve Lucas emphasized the transformative impact of integration platform as a service (iPaaS), spotlighting its pivotal role in enhancing speed, agility, and effectiveness across business operations. Lucas explained how Boomi's iPaaS streamlines connectivity -- seamlessly linking people, systems, devices, and applications -- for building stronger relationships and enabling swift, informed decision-making through real-time data access.\n\nBut Boomi recognizes the opportunity to take connectivity even further, and to bring connectivity solutions to more companies in more areas of business and IT.\n\n\"Connectivity,\" Lucas pointed out, \"remains a critical challenge for almost every organization. The chief culprit is digital fragmentation, a byproduct of digital shifts that, paradoxically, lead to digital silos and disjointed technical architectures that leave the average enterprise now juggling over 364 applications and numerous API gateways.\"\n\nThe emergence of the AI economy has further highlighted the challenges of digital fragmentation. \"AI thrives on reliable, secure, and current data, yet too often, this data is fragmented, difficult to govern, and not securely managed,\" Lucas noted. \"What companies urgently need is a unified, enterprise-scale platform that not only bridges APIs, applications, data, and AI models, but also accelerates digital transformation.\"\n\nTo address these pressing challenges, Boomi unveiled key announcements at Boomi World, including:\n\nNext-Generation API Management for the AI Economy\n\nJoining Lucas onstage, Matt McLarty, CTO at Boomi, explained that \"companies today suffer from API sprawl: API gateways are everywhere, and there's no effective global view or management dashboard for discovering, governing, and securing them, let alone rationalizing API investments and promoting best-in-class APIs for adoption. The AI economy requires next-generation API management (APIM) that accounts for a fragmented APIM landscape and can handle the demands of enterprise-grade scalability and security that AI workloads place on APIM solutions.\"\n\nTo solve this problem, Boomi announced the acquisitions of APIIDA's federated API management business and API management assets from Cloud Software Group. Both acquisitions accelerate Boomi's roadmap for providing solutions to the most pressing API management challenges that companies face today, allowing enterprises to rapidly and securely deliver business value through API products in one end-to-end enterprise platform.\n\nBoomi AI Agent Framework\n\nTo accelerate innovation in the AI economy, Boomi introduced the Boomi AI agent framework, a set of integration and no-code development capabilities that enable business and IT users to run AI agents built by Boomi or Boomi partners, and to build and run their own AI agents to solve pressing integration and automation requirements.\n\nBoomi introduced four new agents built into the platform that make use of the new AI agent framework, including:\n\nIn addition, the Boomi AI agent framework is open to third parties, and supports pluggable AI agents, allowing customers to integrate third-party AI agents into the platform via APIs or Boomi GPT.\n\nIn his Boomi World keynote, Lucas announced a strategic OEM agreement with Vianai Systems, a leading provider of conversational AI solutions for finance, and demonstrated one of the first third-party AI agents, Boomi FinTalk powered by Vianai. Customers can seamlessly connect to Boomi FinTalk powered by Vianai via Boomi GPT, leveraging Boomi's AI agent framework.Using Boomi, the agent connects to sources of financial data in ERP systems, databases, documents, customers' data lakes, and other data, and enables users to ask questions of their data through a natural language interface to discover and analyze financial data and trends in real-time, for immediate actionable insights.\n\n\"Technology and business leaders have struggled to leverage the power of generative AI in their enterprises due to the very real issues of accuracy and security, relevance to business users with domain-specific requirements, and the inability to query both structured and unstructured data and systems in natural language,\" said Dr. Vishal Sikka, Founder and CEO, Vianai Systems. \"With Boomi FinTalk powered by Vianai, we are solving these issues with Boomi's vast integration capabilities and Vianai's conversational AI application for CFOs and finance users, enabling real-time, accurate, and actionable insights to drive business transformation.\"\n\nTrusted Data Management\n\nBoomi also announced Boomi DataHub, a trusted data foundation for operational, analytical, and AI workloads. A high velocity, high quality data access layer, Boomi DataHub provides master data management, integration pipelines, and a framework that will expand over time to provide other data management capabilities, including enterprise scale movement and standardization of data for AI and analytics initiatives.\n\n\"Centralizing data has proved to be a dead end for companies,\" said Lucas. \"A better approach is to build connectivity, governance, and automation into the IT resources companies already have, taking advantage of AI to make this work faster and easier than ever before. With the Boomi Enterprise Platform, we're giving customers the foundation they need for connecting and managing all their data, and for accelerating AI and API development. Using Boomi, customers can say goodbye to the digital fragmentation that's been undermining their digital transformation efforts, and finally get the comprehensive visibility, control, and automation they need.\"\n\nBoomi powers the future of business with intelligent integration and automation.

Using Boomi, the agent connects to sources of financial data in ERP systems, databases, documents, customers' data lakes, and other data, and enables users to ask questions of their data through a natural language interface to discover and analyse financial data and trends in real-time, for immediate actionable insights.\n\n\"Technology and business leaders have struggled to leverage the power of generative AI in their enterprises due to the very real issues of accuracy and security, relevance to business users with domain-specific requirements, and the inability to query both structured and unstructured data and systems in natural language,\" said Dr. Vishal Sikka, Founder and CEO, Vianai Systems. \"With Boomi FinTalk powered by Vianai, we are solving these issues with Boomi's vast integration capabilities and Vianai's conversational AI application for CFOs and finance users, enabling real-time, accurate, and actionable insights to drive business transformation.\"\n\nBoomi also announced Boomi DataHub, a trusted data foundation for operational, analytical, and AI workloads. A high velocity, high quality data access layer, Boomi DataHub provides master data management, integration pipelines, and a framework that will expand over time to provide other data management capabilities, including enterprise scale movement and standardisation of data for AI and analytics initiatives.\n\n\"Centralising data has proved to be a dead end for companies,\" said Lucas. \"A better approach is to build connectivity, governance, and automation into the IT resources companies already have, taking advantage of AI to make this work faster and easier than ever before. With the Boomi Enterprise Platform, we're giving customers the foundation they need for connecting and managing all their data, and for accelerating AI and API development. Using Boomi, customers can say goodbye to the digital fragmentation that's been undermining their digital transformation efforts, and finally get the comprehensive visibility, control, and automation they need.\"", "source": {"uri": "scoop.co.nz", "dataType": "news", "title": "Scoop"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/API", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "API"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud-based_integration", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cloud-based integration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Automation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/API_management", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "API management"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boomi,_New_South_Wales", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boomi, New South Wales"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Boomi, New South Wales"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision-making", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Decision-making"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real-time_data", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Real-time data"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_silo", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Information silo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_management", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Data management"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_technology", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Information technology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dashboard_(business)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dashboard (business)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_technology_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chief technology officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computing_platform", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Computing platform"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_transformation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Digital transformation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scalability", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Scalability"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_computing", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cloud computing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_lake", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Data lake"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chatbot", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chatbot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_model", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Generative model"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Master_Data_Management", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Master Data Management", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Speech_Technology/Telephony", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Speech Technology/Telephony", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Information_Technology/Outsourcing", "label": "dmoz/Business/Information Technology/Outsourcing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/E-Commerce/Standards_and_Protocols", "label": "dmoz/Business/E-Commerce/Standards and Protocols", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 96}], "image": "http://img.scoop.co.nz/stories/images/1908/scoop_image.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9548790", "eventUri": "eng-9548790", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2156862745098038, "wgt": 235, "relevance": 1}

Lucas explained how Boomi's iPaaS streamlines connectivity -- seamlessly linking people, systems, devices, and applications -- for building stronger relationships and enabling swift, informed decision-making through real-time data access.\n\nBut Boomi recognizes the opportunity to take connectivity even further, and to bring connectivity solutions to more companies in more areas of business and IT.\n\n\"Connectivity,\" Lucas pointed out, \"remains a critical challenge for almost every organization. The chief culprit is digital fragmentation, a byproduct of digital shifts that, paradoxically, lead to digital silos and disjointed technical architectures that leave the average enterprise now juggling over 364 applications and numerous API gateways.\"\n\nThe emergence of the AI economy has further highlighted the challenges of digital fragmentation. \"AI thrives on reliable, secure, and current data, yet too often, this data is fragmented, difficult to govern, and not securely managed,\" Lucas noted. \"What companies urgently need is a unified, enterprise-scale platform that not only bridges APIs, applications, data, and AI models, but also accelerates digital transformation.\"\n\nTo address these pressing challenges, Boomi unveiled key announcements at Boomi World, including:\n\nNew Boomi Enterprise Platform Vision\n\nBoomi has expanded and deepened the capabilities of the Boomi Enterprise Platform with:\n\nNext-generation API management for the AI economyAn AI agent framework that provides out-of-the-box AI agents, pluggability for 3rd party AI agents, as well as the ability to automate AI orchestration workflowsEnhanced data management to support data quality, data lineage, and metadata management\n\nNext-Generation API Management for the AI Economy\n\nJoining Lucas onstage, Matt McLarty, CTO at Boomi, explained that \"companies today suffer from API sprawl: API gateways are everywhere, and there's no effective global view or management dashboard for discovering, governing, and securing them, let alone rationalizing API investments and promoting best-in-class APIs for adoption. The AI economy requires next-generation API management (APIM) that accounts for a fragmented APIM landscape and can handle the demands of enterprise-grade scalability and security that AI workloads place on APIM solutions.\"\n\nTo solve this problem, Boomi announced the acquisitions of APIIDA's federated API management business and API management assets from Cloud Software Group. Both acquisitions accelerate Boomi's roadmap for providing solutions to the most pressing API management challenges that companies face today, allowing enterprises to rapidly and securely deliver business value through API products in one end-to-end enterprise platform.\n\nBoomi AI Agent Framework\n\nTo accelerate innovation in the AI economy, Boomi introduced the Boomi AI agent framework, a set of integration and no-code development capabilities that enable business and IT users to run AI agents built by Boomi or Boomi partners, and to build and run their own AI agents to solve pressing integration and automation requirements.\n\nBoomi introduced four new agents built into the platform that make use of the new AI agent framework, including:\n\nBoomi Answers: Agent for providing prescriptive helpBoomi DataDetective: Agent for classifying data fields, protecting sensitive data like personally identifiable information (PII), and tracking where data is being movedBoomi DesignGen: Agent for autonomously building integrationsBoomi Scribe: Agent for automatically documenting existing and built-by-AI integrations\n\nIn addition, the Boomi AI agent framework is open to third parties, and supports pluggable AI agents, allowing customers to integrate third-party AI agents into the platform via APIs or Boomi GPT.\n\nIn his Boomi World keynote, Lucas announced a strategic OEM agreement with Vianai Systems, a leading provider of conversational AI solutions for finance, and demonstrated one of the first third-party AI agents, Boomi FinTalk powered by Vianai.

The banner, while meant to introduce the school's football coach Deion \"Coach Prime\" Sanders, could just as easily have said \"AI,\" for this is what will write much of Boomi's story going forward.\n\nKeynote presentations, side sessions and interviews with company executives at the iPaaS provider's Boomi World this week pointed toward a transformational shift to an AI-based architecture in enterprise computing. Boomi is laying the groundwork for this new course through several key acquisitions and enhancements to its Enterprise Platform that will facilitate next-generation information technology management in the AI economy.\n\n\"This is a pivotable moment for each and every one of us,\" Lucas (pictured) said during his keynote remarks. \"We will reimagine enterprise applications. I believe there is a moment coming where we will be surrounded by AI.\"\n\nThat moment, according to Lucas, will be driven primarily by AI agents, intelligent software that can collect data and perform tasks. Boomi unveiled several new platform capabilities this week that included AI agents for protecting personally identifiable information, autonomously documenting and building data integrations, and providing proscriptive help.\n\nBoomi's framework, based on integration and no-code development capabilities, will allow customers to run AI agents built by Boomi and its partners, or allow users to develop new tools themselves. It is part of the company's vision for how AI will transform enterprise operations to automate repetitive application integration tasks.\n\n\"Applications are going to get rewritten on this new technology and Boomi absolutely must be a part of it,\" Lucas told reporters after his keynote. \"I will bet you a dollar that Walmart is building a corporate buying agent. Why would they not do that? The vast number of companies do not have those resources like Walmart. Boomi can help with that.\"\n\nBoomi also announced two acquisitions this week designed to position itself further for an AI agent-driven world. The company purchased Mashery's application programming interface management assets from Cloud Software Group Inc., a business formed two years ago through the merger of Tibco Software Inc. and Citrix Systems Inc.\n\nIn addition to Mashery, Boomi also acquired an API management platform developed by the German firm APIIDA GmbH which will provide a centralized interface for API monitoring. The acquisitions were designed to further Boomi's evolving AI agent strategy.\n\n\"The API is fundamental,\" Boomi Chief Technology Officer Matt McLarty said in an interview with SiliconANGLE. \"How are those agents going to talk to each other? They are going to be connecting via APIs.\"\n\nBoomi's acquisitions appear designed to head off a potential issue that could arise as AI agents make their way through IT infrastructure. No CIOs will want agents operating in their companies without management or oversight, and APIs provide an ability to monitor performance. The autonomous future still requires governance.\n\n\"A corporate registry for these agents must exist,\" said Lucas. \"Boomi will deliver much of that capability in the due course of time. We will do more acquisitions. We're not in markets to lose them.\"\n\nAlthough Lucas is quick to note that AI agents exist today, performing operations in various enterprise environments, this is still new technology and Boomi customers are just beginning to assess how it could potentially be used.\n\nAt Boston-based Suffolk Construction Co., IT administrators are evaluating how AI agents can help evaluate risks at a job site or identify possible design flaws in architectural drawings.\n\n\"We are exploring them,\" Dinesh Singh, director, enterprise development and architecture at Suffolk, told SiliconANGLE. \"This is another next step with data management. It's going to make job sites safer. It will give us data insight then and there.\"\n\nFor the global technology solutions provider Word Wide Technology Inc., AI agents have not yet been deployed in its infrastructure, but that day may not be far off. WWT's Ken Maglio, principal architect and manager, told SiliconANGLE that, as a Boomi customer, there are several offerings in the company's portfolio that he will be focused on in the months ahead.\n\n\"There's things coming that we want to take advantage of,\" Maglio said. \"My goal in the next six months or longer is to take all of the things we are doing with the documentation to manage our business... and merge it into one source and point Boomi at it. Being able to commoditize the infrastructure is coming. You're going to need tools to do that.\"\n\nBoomi has been telegraphing its emerging focus in the API and AI arenas for some time now. Lucas was quoted at the start of the year as saying that the future would be \"AI, APIs and automation,\" with integration on one side of the coin and automation on the other.\n\nPresentations and comments made at Boomi World in Denver this week revealed more of the company's strategy for how it will put the pieces together to deliver its vision of an AI future that can be automated and properly governed. Generative AI can be used to create processes, and this will be the way systems will be architected in an emerging AI world.\n\n\"We're in the art of the possible stage right now with AI,\" McLarty told SiliconANGLE. \"What I love about Boomi is we're not afraid to experiment.

Can you provide our readers with a broader overview of the Boomi business model?\n\nIn short, Boomi helps organizations radically simplify the complexity of enterprise software. Boomi is all about powering the future of businesses with smart integration and automation.\n\nAs the market leading iPaaS (Integration Platform as a Service) company, our role is to be the intelligent integration and automation leader of choice, globally, Boomi has a strong community of over 20,000 customers and a network of 800 partners around the world.\n\nBusinesses choose Boomi's market-leading platform to connect their apps, data, systems, processes and people, which speeds up their digital transformation journey, and enables them to foster and harness innovation.\n\nAs we know AI is the future, and in May 2023, Boomi launched Boomi AI, which is a first-of-its-kind simplified user experience that leverages Generative AI to connect and integrate applications. Again, can you outline to our readers what the unique capabilities are in Boomi AI - and what impact does it have for the businesses that adopt the technology?\n\nBoomi AI enhances the capabilities of our existing iPaaS platform by leveraging artificial intelligence to refine and optimize the data integration and automation process for our customers.\n\nBy leveraging Boomi's vast data lake of over 200 million integrations, encompassing 70 terabytes of de-identified metadata, Boomi AI can efficiently generate the best integration from simple user intent, for exampleith Boomi AI, a user can use Boomi's natural language interface to request: \"connect SalesForce to Netsuite\" and the integration will be created.\n\nThe user can then inspect the design and choose what to do next. . This enables users to meet their integration needs more effectively and rapidly than with other platforms, and ultimately empowers our users to achieve their goals.\n\nAdditionally, Boomi AI has recently integrated new features that enhance data transparency and security, such as the ability to track and flag the movement of Personally Identifiable Information (PII) across regions, thereby mitigating privacy concerns.\n\nFurthermore, Boomi AI has introduced Documentation as a Service (DaaS), which automates the documentation process for both existing and newly created integrations, whether created by AI or not.\n\nThe beauty of Boomi is that our platform can continuously evolve to support our customer's needs.\n\nThe impact this has for our customers is clear: By understanding user intention alongside our platform's knowledge and community-driven insights, we significantly reduce the learning curve for our customers, minimize errors and enable faster outcomes.\n\nThe term AI Readiness has been coined by many analysts, but it can have a different meaning from one organization to another. From Boomi's perspective, how would you define AI Readiness, and what are the key components an enterprise needs to be AI Ready?\n\nWe're in an AI revolution, and the pace of change we're experiencing is more rapid than it has ever been.\n\nOrganizations today are really feeling the pressure of that change, expect disruption, and know they need to be prepared.\n\nThey also know that AI presents an opportunity, and they want to take advantage of this opportunity.\n\nSo, AI readiness is really about how an organization can become 'digitally ready' for the challenges of today while preparing for the opportunities that AI brings.\n\nWhen we think about the key components for AI readiness, perhaps the most important are effective data management and governance.\n\nAI readiness requires developing a solid foundation of data trust, ensuring that the integrity and reliability of data are maintained.\n\nAt Boomi, we focus on connecting critical data systems and guiding organizations to establish comprehensive data governance practices, which are crucial for minimizing risks and maximizing the effectiveness of AI applications.\n\nBy instilling confidence in the data used for AI initiatives, organizations can prevent potential pitfalls and set the stage for genuine, sustainable transformation.\n\nThis strategic approach to data governance not only prepares organizations for the current AI wave but also positions them to capitalize on future advancements in AI technology.\n\nBecoming AI-ready also involves meticulous preparation and alignment of your company's processes and platforms to seamlessly integrate AI technologies.\n\nThis includes evaluating and automating existing processes where possible, and instilling strong ethical practices in handling data and AI operations.\n\nThe role of a supportive network of partners -- vendors, integrators, and advisors -- is crucial in providing the necessary guidance and challenge to navigate the AI landscape.\n\nSuch thorough preparation ensures that the organization is not only equipped with the right technology but also fosters a mindset geared towards innovation and ethical responsibility in the AI era.\n\nBoomi has enjoyed phenomenal success globally, but can you tell us about its market presence and market share across the META region?\n\nBoomi's presence in the region is a strategic one. And, I'm pleased to say our market presence across the region is growing rapidly.\n\nOrganizations in the region need solutions that are able to grow and scale with them.\n\nBoomi has been serving a diverse array of industries such as transportation, retail, logistics, manufacturing, real estate and government, in the region, building a legacy of trust and innovation for some time now.\n\nBoomi is dedicated to supporting local businesses and to empowering organizations to harness the full potential of intelligent integration and automation solutions.\n\nBoomi is well-positioned to respond to the unique challenges faced by our clients in the region, helping them power the future of business with cutting-edge technology and tailored support.\n\nHow excited are Boomi by the swathe of opportunities emerging in the Middle East, especially in the KSA marketplace?\n\nWe are thrilled to witness the expanding opportunities across the region, particularly in Saudi Arabia, where our presence is rapidly strengthening.\n\nOur client base includes prominent names from a range of vital industries, such as maritime, manufacturing, distribution, and logistics.\n\nThis growth is not only a testament to the trust and reliability that these major players place in our services but also reflects our deep commitment to understanding and addressing the unique challenges of each customer.\n\nAs we continue to build our relationships and expand our offerings, we are more dedicated than ever to powering the success of businesses across META through innovative solutions and dedicated support.\n\nIn your opinion, what is it that ultimately differentiates Boomi from its market rivals?\n\nAgain, it's Boomi's ability to grow and scale with our customer's businesses. Organizations today want to work with technology vendors that are cloud-native, and aren't hampered by baggage caused by legacy technology.\n\nThe Boomi platform was built with this ability to scale in mind, it's agnostic, and can easily pivot to our customer's needs and innovation is in our DNA. This is what really sets us apart from legacy vendors.\n\nWith a strong foundational platform, we are able to consistently innovate our offering to respond to technology shifts and customer needs.\n\nNot only are we growing the services inside the platform, we're also adding brand new product services along the way. Ultimately, this results in a continuously enhanced user experience.\n\nRelated Articles", "source": {"uri": "tahawultech.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "TahawulTech.com"}, "authors": [{"uri": "mark_forker@tahawultech.com", "name": "Mark Forker", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enterprise_software", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Enterprise software"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Automation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boomi,_New_South_Wales", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boomi, New South Wales"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Boomi, New South Wales"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud-based_integration", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Cloud-based integration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transparency_(behavior)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Transparency (behavior)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_data", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Personal data"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outline_(list)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Outline (list)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_integration", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Data integration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agnosticism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Agnosticism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metadata", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Metadata"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platform_as_a_service", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Platform as a service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_transformation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Digital transformation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byte", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Byte"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_model", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Business model"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salesforce", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Salesforce"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_governance", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Data governance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_management", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Data management"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_distribution", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Digital distribution"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_language", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Natural language"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_experience", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "User experience"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_East", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Middle East"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saudi_Arabia", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Saudi Arabia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Saudi Arabia"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Speech_Technology/Telephony", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Speech Technology/Telephony", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 86}], "image": "https://www.tahawultech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Boomi-NEW.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9548790", "eventUri": "eng-9548790", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3490196078431373, "wgt": 212, "relevance": 1}

Alongside the features gained through the two acquisitions, Boomi detailed several new platform capabilities that it developed in-house. The latter enhancements are headlined by a set of artificial intelligence agents designed to ease customers' day-to-day work.\n\nBoomi launched at the turn of the millennium and became part of Dell Technologies Inc. through a 2010 acquisition. About a decade later, Dell sold the software maker for $4 billion to Francisco Partners and TPG Capital. Boomi's iPaaS platform helps companies develop integrations that allow data to move between cloud applications, databases and other workloads.\n\nPrograms typically exchange data using application programming interfaces. The first acquisition that Boomi disclosed today saw it purchase API Control, an API management platform developed by German software maker APIIDA. The platform allows administrators to monitor all their company's APIs through a centralized interface that displays usage metrics, cybersecurity information and related data.\n\nAPI Control doubles as a productivity tool. According to APIIDA, developers can use its centralized interface to quickly find the APIs needed for their work.\n\nAs part of the second acquisition that Boomi announced today, it purchased certain \"API management assets\" from Cloud Software Group. The latter company was formed through the merger of Tibco Software Inc. and Citrix Systems Inc. in 2022.\n\nThe assets bought by Boomi relate to a product called Mashery that Tibco acquired in 2015 from Intel Corp. The chipmaker, in turn, obtained the offering through a $200 million startup acquisition two years earlier. Mashery was an API gateway designed to help companies filter unauthorized requests to their APIs, monitor traffic levels and perform related maintenance tasks.\n\n\"With these acquisitions, we're putting an end to operational overhead and API sprawl by offering a robust, enterprise-grade and federated API management solution, giving customers the ability to quickly provision, discover, secure, and infinitely scale in one end-to-end enterprise platform,\" said Boomi Chief Executive Officer Steve Lucas (pictured).\n\nAlongside the two acquisitions, Boomi today debuted several internally-developed enhancements to its iPaaS platform. One of the main highlights is a framework that allows customers to automate repetitive application integration tasks with the help of AI agents.\n\nOn launch, the framework will include four agents. The first can surface technical information about application integration topics using natural language prompts. A second agent, Boomi Scribe, is capable of automatically generating documentation for newly created integrations.\n\nThe two other agents in the lineup are designed for more advanced tasks. The first, DesignGen, can automatically build application integrations to save time for developers. It's joined by Boomi DataDetective, which promises to help software teams ensure that data moves between workloads in a secure manner.\n\nCustomers with more advanced requirements can integrate third-party agents into Boomi's platform using APIs. At Boomi World 2024 today, the company introduced a prepackaged third-party agent powered by technology from startup Vianai Systems Inc. It allows workers to interact with financial information stored in databases and other applications using natural language prompts.\n\nRounding out the list of product updates is a new tool called Boomi DataHub. According to the company, it's designed to help companies more efficiently manage the information they use in AI and analytics projects.\n\nOrganizations often have multiple copies of important data that are stored in different applications. Over time, changes made by workers can lead to inconsistencies between those copies. DataHub includes MDM, or master data management, features that can avoid such inconsistencies.", "source": {"uri": "siliconangle.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "SiliconANGLE"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/API", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "API"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud-based_integration", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cloud-based integration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_computing", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cloud computing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Software"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boomi,_New_South_Wales", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boomi, New South Wales"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Boomi, New South Wales"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/API_management", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "API management"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TIBCO_Software", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "TIBCO Software"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francisco_Partners", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Francisco Partners"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dell", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denver", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Denver"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Denver"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dell_Technologies", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dell Technologies"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citrix_Systems", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Citrix Systems"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Productivity", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Productivity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intel", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Intel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Startup_company", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Startup company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_security", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Computer security"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Database"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Germany"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Master_data_management", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Master data management"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_device_management", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mobile device management"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_language", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Natural language"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytics", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Analytics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Marketing", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Marketing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Business", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Business", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/ERP", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/ERP", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 65}], "image": "https://d15shllkswkct0.cloudfront.net/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2024/05/Steve-Lucas-Boomi.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9548790", "eventUri": "eng-9548790", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2, "wgt": 210, "relevance": 1}

Both these acquisitions accelerate Boomi's roadmap for providing solutions to the most pressing API management challenges that companies face today.\n\nThis press release features multimedia. View the full release here: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20240508324428/en/\n\nBoomi Doubles Down on API Management with Key Acquisitions (Graphic: Business Wire)\n\n\"APIs are the backbone of modern software and application development, and have become a cornerstone of modern architectures that enable businesses to stay agile and compete effectively,\" said Steve Lucas, CEO at Boomi. \"However, cloud adoption and the explosive growth of APIs have disrupted traditional IT infrastructures. With these acquisitions, we're putting an end to operational overhead and API sprawl by offering a robust, enterprise-grade and federated API management solution, giving customers the ability to quickly provision, discover, secure, and infinitely scale in one end-to-end enterprise platform.\"\n\nAPIIDA Federated API Management\n\nAs the market-leading solution for federated API management, APIIDA's API Control Plane expands Boomi's portfolio by offering the ability for enterprises to discover, govern, and provision APIs from one central place, including APIs managed through gateways from various vendors. This allows a vendor-agnostic, federated administration of the entire API lifecycle, and can be adapted to the requirements of any organization, enabling a consistent consumer experience and governance across all APIs.\n\nBy offering federated API management, Boomi enables enterprises to:\n\nReduce complexity and cost by unifying access to all their APIs across cloud-based and on-premises API gateways from multiple vendorsDrive innovation with a single destination for application developers, simplifying API consumption and accelerating time-to-market by giving developers a dynamic catalog where APIs can be discovered and reusedEnhance provider security and governance with total visibility and control over all their APIs\n\n\"Companies that rely on a manual, fragmented approach to registering, managing, and publishing APIs across distributed platforms risk having those APIs be undiscovered, overlooked, and hence unadopted by users and applications that could benefit from them,\" said Jaime Ryan, Vice President of Product, API Management at Boomi. \"To successfully enable digital transformation, businesses need a proven, reliable way to connect applications and other data sources. With federated API management, customers will be able to reduce time to value with a single control plane for wherever APIs are deployed, providing better discovery, governance, and collaboration while making existing APIs more visible, subscribable, and consumable.\"\n\nAPI Management Assets From Cloud Software Group\n\nFurther accelerating the company's API management roadmap, Boomi has also acquired assets from Cloud Software Group, providing Boomi customers enterprise-grade scalability and security. These assets, developed by a team that helped invent the API economy and used by some of the world's largest organizations, will enable the Boomi Enterprise Platform to support even the most demanding API management performance and security requirements in markets such as travel, retail, tech, finance, and healthcare.\n\nAdditional Resources\n\nRead more about Boomi's latest acquisitionsFollow Boomi on X, LinkedIn, Facebook, and YouTube\n\nAbout Boomi\n\nBoomi powers the future of business with intelligent integration and automation.

This AI integration in business is helping companies to compete more effectively in the market.\n\nOne of the major players using AI and automation to address integration challenges and future-proof organizations across different industries is Boomi LP.\n\n\"The reality is organizations have this massive integration challenge today,\" said Steve Lucas (pictured, left), chief executive officer of Boomi. \"Why are you attacking an integration challenge with a dozen or more integration products? That's one integration problem for another. You don't want to do that. Using the singular Boomi enterprise platform, we can solve all of that in one go.\"\n\nLucas, Kapil Goel (second from right), associate VP and global head of BPM, API and digital process at Infosys Ltd., and Suman Mishra (right), senior director at Infosys, spoke with theCUBE Research's Savannah Peterson at Boomi World, during an exclusive broadcast on theCUBE, SiliconANGLE Media's livestreaming studio. They discussed how Boomi is using AI and automation to address integration challenges. (* Disclosure below.)\n\nThe rise of APIs and microservices, along with the shift to digital and cloud-first approaches, has led to an increase in the number and complexity of apps, requiring sophisticated data handling and event-driven architecture. Boomi is able to unify data from various sources, protocols and formats to create a cohesive protocol, Goel explained.\n\n\"Clients wanted to build apps that could leverage the event-driven architecture out there. I think that's where Boomi fits extremely well. It's able to bring in this unification of data from different sources, different protocols and different formats,\" he said. \"It's going to put all of this together and create that protocol. Very exciting times ahead in terms of the future of integration, particularly with AI coming into the mix.\"\n\nTechnology is changing drastically, requiring a rewrite of enterprise software to accommodate new AI technology. The challenges in integration include future-proofing, addressing all integration patterns and ensuring scalability and flexibility in architecture, according to Goel.\n\n\"The future of AI infused into integration, where we are no longer doing the routine manual mappings or configurations inside the integrations,\" he said. \"We are no longer worried about data quality after integrations, because imagine if there is an AI agent which is going to look at the past data flows and suggest and tell you beforehand, 'Hey, this pattern is wrong, this mapping is wrong.' They're able to get out of this grappling issue of modernization by implementing a platform like Boomi.\"\n\nBoomi and Infosys are working together to help organizations manage the rise of autonomous agents by consolidating integration and automation systems on one platform, while also balancing governance and flexibility for democratizing development, Lucas explained.\n\n\"What we're doing, Boomi, with Infosys in particular, is we're helping organizations see that future -- that it's not just apps and databases and APIs. Very important,\" Lucas said. \"That's today here and now, but add agents into that mix and it gets infinitely more complex. You can't really tackle that future without having a good grasp on your current, today -- consolidating different integration and automation systems on one platform.\"\n\nHere's the complete video interview, part of SiliconANGLE's and theCUBE Research's coverage of Boomi World:", "source": {"uri": "siliconangle.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "SiliconANGLE"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boomi,_New_South_Wales", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boomi, New South Wales"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Boomi, New South Wales"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infosys", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Infosys"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automation", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Automation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/API", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "API"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Event-driven_architecture", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Event-driven architecture"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communication_protocol", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Communication protocol"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Livestreaming", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Livestreaming"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microservices", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Microservices"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_process_management", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Business process management"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_president", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Vice president"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leverage_(finance)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Leverage (finance)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intelligent_agent", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Intelligent agent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enterprise_software", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Enterprise software"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scalability", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Scalability"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Database"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Intranet", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Intranet", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Security/Honeypots_and_Honeynets", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Security/Honeypots and Honeynets", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Enterprise_Information_Integration", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Enterprise Information Integration", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 87}], "image": "https://d15shllkswkct0.cloudfront.net/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2024/05/Steve-Lucas-CEO-of-Boomi-LP-Kapil-Goel-associate-VP-and-global-head-of-BPM-API-and-digital-process-at-Infosys-Ltd-and-Suman-Mishra-senior-director-at-Infosys-Boomi-World-2024.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9548790", "eventUri": "eng-9548790", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1215686274509804, "wgt": 185, "relevance": 1}

Its focus on artificial intelligence, APIs and automation has poised the company to potentially revolutionize how businesses operate and interact with technology.\n\n\"Boomi has the keys to the kingdom,\" Furrier said. \"They have access to the jewels of all the top enterprises, and they're in a good position to make that work.\"\n\nThis insight captures the essence of Boomi's approach -- leveraging its established infrastructure and customer loyalty to innovate and expand the company's technological capabilities.\n\nFurrier and his co-host Savannah Peterson kicked off Boomi World with exclusive industry analysis, during a broadcast on theCUBE, SiliconANGLE Media's livestreaming studio. They discussed Boomi's strategic positioning and innovations in the enterprise operations. (* Disclosure below.)\n\nBoomi's recent activities highlight its strategic direction toward becoming a dominant force in the enterprise tech space. The company has expanded its technological offerings through both acquisitions and organic growth. Notably, it just announced the acquisition of software assets from APIIDA GmbH and Cloud Software Group Inc., aiming to bolster its premier iPaaS offering.\n\n\"Then they have the organic innovation, which is on the product side,\" Furrier added. \"But the key news here is they launched a new vision around the Boomi Enterprise Platform that's around the next-gen API management service ... they put a stake in the ground there. They got the AI agent framework that they launched on stage and showed their Boomi GPT, which was launched last year.\"\n\nThese moves are part of Boomi's broader vision to integrate next-gen applications and AI into its services, aiming not just for improvement, but for transformation. The launch of Boomi GPT and the agent framework indicates its commitment to advancing AI beyond just conversational interfaces, aiming to make AI a practical and integral part of business processes, according to theCUBE analysts.\n\nLooking forward, Boomi is not just focusing on technological advancement, but also on fostering a strong community and culture of collaboration. This approach not only enhances its business model, but also solidifies the company's position as a leader in a market where customer and partner relationships are crucial, theCUBE analysts explained. Its community-centric approach is apparent in its engagements and partnerships.\n\n\"There's a lot of passion here for folks to actually make that AI real and deliver value, both for the human experience as well as for the traditional value experience in terms of ROI and business,\" Peterson said. \"Boomi has kind of a unique community energy around that. I think their culture of collaboration is actually remarkable. It's an intimate but extremely well-knit group here.\"\n\nBoomi's integration capability, combined with its strategic acquisitions and innovations, places the company at the forefront of the iPaaS industry, ready to capitalize on the growing demands of AI and automation, according to theCUBE analysts. This focus on practical, impactful AI applications underlines Boomi's strategy to not just participate in the market, but to lead it by delivering tangible benefits to its customers and partners.\n\n\"The company is really poised for potentially becoming the next ServiceNow-like company, where their presence in the enterprise is pretty significant,\" Furrier said. \"They have a huge loyal base of customers.\"\n\nHere's the complete video interview, part of SiliconANGLE's and theCUBE Research's coverage of Boomi World:", "source": {"uri": "siliconangle.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "SiliconANGLE"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boomi,_New_South_Wales", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boomi, New South Wales"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Boomi, New South Wales"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/API", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "API"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automation", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Automation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loyalty_program", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Loyalty program"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Business"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Livestreaming", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Livestreaming"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GUID_Partition_Table", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "GUID Partition Table"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud-based_integration", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cloud-based integration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organic_food", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Organic food"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organic_growth", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Organic growth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_computing", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cloud computing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Software"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_process", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Business process"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Return_on_investment", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Return on investment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_model", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Business model"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business", "label": "dmoz/Business", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Marketing_and_Advertising/Strategic", "label": "dmoz/Business/Marketing and Advertising/Strategic", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities", "label": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Marketing_and_Advertising/Relationship_Marketing", "label": "dmoz/Business/Marketing and Advertising/Relationship Marketing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Information_Technology/Marketing_and_Advertising", "label": "dmoz/Business/Information Technology/Marketing and Advertising", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 76}], "image": "https://d15shllkswkct0.cloudfront.net/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2024/05/Savannah-Peterson-and-John-Furrier-Boomi-World-2024.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9548790", "eventUri": "eng-9548790", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3647058823529412, "wgt": 179, "relevance": 1}

With its strategic moves and innovative approach, Boomi's vision for the future of digital innovation has come into sharp focus.\n\nDuring a conversation with theCUBE, Arlen Shenkman (pictured), president and chief financial officer of Boomi, offered a glimpse into the cutting-edge strategies driving Boomi's growth agenda. He shared the company's strategic insights, innovative approaches and future visions as Boomi navigates this trajectory amid a landscape of digital disruption and transformation.\n\n\"I think there are three things that really come to mind,\" Shenkman said. \"One is that we are clearly moving from an integration platform to an enterprise platform. The second is that we are really a cloud platform. The third is, as you see these processes happening, we're just giving customers flexibility, because ... AI in the automotive industry won't be the same as AI in the financial services business or in healthcare.\"\n\nShenkman spoke with John Furrier, theCUBE Research executive analyst, at Boomi World, during an exclusive broadcast on theCUBE, SiliconANGLE Media's livestreaming studio. They discussed Boomi's strategic acquisitions, its commitment to driving customer value and its role in shaping the future of integration and digital innovation. (* Disclosure below.)\n\nBoomi's recent acquisitions and strategic deals show the company's commitment to meeting customer demands and expanding its product offerings. With a strong and loyal customer base, the company is leveraging its platform to address a myriad of challenges faced by organizations, according to Shenkman.\n\n\"We focus a lot on ARR, on renewal rates, on NRR, continuing to add value across the customer base in terms of trying to structure things that make sense with our customer base around consumption and around throughput,\" he said. \"I think we have a lot of flexibility, but mostly it's about are we getting the return we expect when we make an investment in our product and our customers acquire that and then keeping it?\"\n\nBy integrating new products into its portfolio, Boomi aims to provide comprehensive solutions that resonate with its customer base and attract new clients. The company takes a proactive approach to growth, blending inorganic moves with organic product development to drive innovation and market leadership.\n\n\"We have 20 years of data from our customers,\" Shenkman said. \"We know how they do integrations; we know how their processes work because we're a cloud solution and we can leverage that information to help other customers perform their processes in the best ways possible.\"\n\nBoomi's strategy for navigating market disruptions and capitalizing on emerging opportunities lies in the convergence of APIs, integration platforms and data management. This strategy shows the company's role in enabling organizations to leverage artificial intelligence and drive digital transformation, according to Shenkman.\n\n\"I think you saw that with the acquisitions around API, where we have a strategy to provide people with visibility and governance of all the APIs they have with APIIDA,\" he said. \"To your point about where are we going to invest, we're going to invest in our ecosystem, we're going to invest in our customer base, we're going to invest in digital products so that we continue to add value to our customer base.\"\n\nBy offering a horizontal and agnostic platform, Boomi empowers organizations to adapt to evolving market dynamics and harness the full potential of their data assets. Shenkman's vision reflects Boomi's commitment to driving value for its customers and maintaining its position as a market leader.\n\n\"There is no AI without data, and we bring data across to whatever that repository is,\" he said. \"That platform conversation is an enormous opportunity for our partners to go to their customers and to say, 'I have a tool that will help you solve the problems and meet your business needs.'\"\n\nHere's the complete video interview, part of SiliconANGLE's and theCUBE Research's coverage of Boomi World:", "source": {"uri": "siliconangle.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "SiliconANGLE"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_transformation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Digital transformation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_financial_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Chief financial officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boomi,_New_South_Wales", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boomi, New South Wales"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Boomi, New South Wales"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_computing", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cloud computing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automotive_industry", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Automotive industry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Livestreaming", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Livestreaming"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/API", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "API"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Health care"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_services", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Financial services"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Product_development", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Product development"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technological_convergence", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Technological convergence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_management", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Data management"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organic_compound", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Organic compound"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecosystem", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ecosystem"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Marketing_and_Advertising", "label": "dmoz/Business/Marketing and Advertising", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities", "label": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities/Opposing_Views", "label": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities/Opposing Views", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 56}], "image": "https://d15shllkswkct0.cloudfront.net/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2024/05/Featured-Image-Arlen-Shenkman-president-and-CFO-of-Boomi---Boomi-World-2024.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9548790", "eventUri": "eng-9548790", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3803921568627451, "wgt": 178, "relevance": 1}

The chief culprit is digital fragmentation, a byproduct of digital shifts that, paradoxically, lead to digital silos and disjointed technical architectures that leave the average enterprise now juggling over 364 applications and numerous API gateways.\"\n\nThe emergence of the AI economy has further highlighted the challenges of digital fragmentation. \"AI thrives on reliable, secure, and current data, yet too often, this data is fragmented, difficult to govern, and not securely managed,\" Lucas noted. \"What companies urgently need is a unified, enterprise-scale platform that not only bridges APIs, applications, data, and AI models, but also accelerates digital transformation.\"\n\nTo address these pressing challenges, Boomi unveiled key announcements at Boomi World, including:\n\nNext-Generation API Management for the AI Economy\n\nJoining Lucas onstage, Matt McLarty, CTO at Boomi, explained that \"companies today suffer from API sprawl: API gateways are everywhere, and there's no effective global view or management dashboard for discovering, governing, and securing them, let alone rationalizing API investments and promoting best-in-class APIs for adoption.

This complexity has spurred the need for a streamlined approach to enterprise software solutions, focusing on integration and automation to simplify IT infrastructure.\n\nAs organizations grapple with disparate systems, the demand for a unified platform that can efficiently connect and manage these elements is becoming increasingly critical. This platform approach not only addresses integration challenges, but also paves the way for leveraging advancements in artificial intelligence and data management to enhance business operations and drive innovation, according to Steve Lucas (pictured), chief executive officer of Boomi LP.\n\n\"It's really quite simple. Customers have tons of applications, databases, APIs. That's an integration challenge,\" Lucas said. \"Why would you solve that integration challenge with a dozen integration products? It doesn't make any sense. For us, it's a single solution for integration and automation.\"\n\nLucas spoke with theCUBE Research executive analyst John Furrier at Boomi World, during an exclusive broadcast on theCUBE, SiliconANGLE Media's livestreaming studio. They discussed Boomi's strategic expansion into a comprehensive enterprise platform that integrates and automates business operations, emphasizing enhancements in API and data management, and the transformative potential of AI in the industry. (* Disclosure below.)\n\nBoomi recently announced a significant strategic expansion into data management and AI, coupled with the acquisition of two API management companies. This move is aimed at bolstering its capabilities and addressing the vacuum in the market created by competitors' shifts in strategy, according to Lucas.\n\n\"Boomi's gone from integration automation to plus API Management,\" he said. \"We're building out plus data management as well. We think we can be that one platform for the enterprise.\"\n\nThis strategy signifies a leap toward becoming a more comprehensive solution that goes beyond traditional integration. Also critical for the company is the strategic role of APIs in its platform, including the new capability to integrate seamlessly with both cloud and on-premises solutions.\n\n\"For me it was how do we apply to our application database and API management solutions that we have, this open API or infrastructure where you can write anything on top of it,\" Lucas said. \"That's what we're doing. That's what opens up a lot.\"\n\nThis flexibility is part of what makes the platform robust and capable of handling diverse enterprise needs, ensuring seamless connectivity regardless of whether systems are cloud-based or on-premises.\n\nDiscussing the company's market positioning, Furrier likens Boomi's approach to being an \"independent third party in Switzerland,\" suggesting a neutral stance in a market dominated by giants such as Salesforce Inc. and Oracle Corp. This independence is crucial as it allows Boomi to serve a wide range of customers without bias toward any particular technology stack.\n\nLooking to the future, Lucas is enthusiastic about the role of AI in revolutionizing the industry.

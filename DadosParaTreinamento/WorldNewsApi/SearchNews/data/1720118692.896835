The three-time champion took to the court an hour early at 11am local time as organisers attempt to get the schedule back on track following all the rain delays. And Swiatek took just 40 minutes, one of the shortest matches in Roland Garros history, to dispatch the Russian. She hit just two unforced errors to Potapova\u2019s 19 and won 94 per cent of points on her first serve. Out of the 58 points played in the match, 23-year-old Potapova won just 10. \u201cI was just really focused, in the zone and not really looking at the score, and yeah it went pretty quickly, pretty weird,\u201d said Swiatek. \u201cBecause we played really early with the open roof it\u2019s always a bit different but it\u2019s still not too warm. It doesn\u2019t feel like summer in Europe but we\u2019ll see what it\u2019s going to be like in two days.\u201d Coco Gauff was in no mood to hang around either. The US Open champion and third seed, who was on Court Phillipe Chatrier straight after Swiatek, swept past Italian Elisabetta Cocciaretto 6-1 6-2. \u201cUsually if you\u2019re after her, you know it\u2019s probably going to be a quick match,\u201d said Gauff. \u201cSo I figured the match would probably go an hour (and) 15 (minutes), an hour at the quickest. I definitely wasn\u2019t expecting 40 minutes. \u201cIt didn\u2019t really affect much because I kind of knew. We planned for it. It\u2019s one of those things that you kind of plan for, the fastest-case scenario. I didn\u2019t feel affected by how fast it went.\u201d", "summary": "The world number one wrapped up her match before noon in Paris.", "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/tennis/iga-swiatek-anastasia-potapova-paris-french-coco-gauff-b2555225.html", "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/2024/06/02/11/02-4932202649b34370bdb6bcf03a99e877.jpg?width=1200", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-02 12:13:06", "author": "Andy Sims", "authors": ["Andy Sims"], "language": "en", "source_country": "gb", "sentiment": 0.025}

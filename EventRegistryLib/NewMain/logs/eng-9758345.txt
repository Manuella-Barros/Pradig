Microbes hidden within tree bark can absorb methane -- a powerful greenhouse gas -- from the atmosphere.\n\nAn international team of researchers led by the University of Birmingham has shown for the first time that microbes living in bark or in the wood itself are removing atmospheric methane on a scale equal to or above that of soil. They calculate that this newly discovered process makes trees 10 per cent more beneficial for climate overall than previously thought.\n\nMethane is responsible for around 30 per cent of global warming since pre-industrial times and emissions are currently rising faster than at any point since records began in the 1980s.\n\nAlthough most methane is removed by processes in the atmosphere, soils are full of bacteria that absorb the gas and break it down for use as energy. Soil had been thought of as the only terrestrial sink for methane, but the researchers now show that trees may be as important, perhaps more so.\n\nLead researcher on the study, Professor Vincent Gauci of the University of Birmingham, said: \"The main ways in which we consider the contribution of trees to the environment is through absorbing carbon dioxide through photosynthesis, and storing it as carbon. These results, however, show a remarkable new way in which trees provide a vital climate service.\n\n\"The Global Methane Pledge, launched in 2021 at the COP26 climate change summit aims to cut methane emissions by 30 per cent by the end of the decade. Our results suggest that planting more trees, and reducing deforestation surely must be important parts of any approach towards this goal.\"\n\nIn the study, the researchers investigated upland tropical, temperate and boreal forest trees. Specifically, they took measurements spanning tropical forests in the Amazon and Panama; temperate broadleaf trees in Wytham Woods, in Oxfordshire, UK; and boreal coniferous forest in Sweden. The methane absorption was strongest in the tropical forests, probably because microbes thrive in the warm wet conditions found there. On average the newly discovered methane absorption adds around 10% to the climate benefit that temperate and tropical trees provide.\n\nBy studying methane exchange between the atmosphere and the tree bark at multiple heights, they were able to show that while at soil level the trees were likely to emit a small amount of methane, from a couple of metres up the direction of exchange switches and methane from the atmosphere is consumed.\n\nIn addition, the team used laser scanning methods to quantify the overall global forest tree bark surface area, with preliminary calculations indicating that the total global contribution of trees is between 24.6-49.9 Tg (millions of tonnes) of methane. This fills a big gap in understanding the global sources and sinks of methane.\n\nThe tree shape analysis also shows that if all the bark of all the trees of the world were laid at flat, the area would be equal to the Earth's land surface. \"Tree woody surfaces add a third dimension to the way life on Earth interacts with the atmosphere, and this third dimension is teeming with life, and with surprises,\" said co-author Yadvinder Malhi of the University of Oxford.\n\nProfessor Gauci and colleagues at Birmingham are now planning a new research programme to find out if deforestation has led to increased atmospheric methane concentrations.

But now, our large-scale study proves that there's another way that trees absorb greenhouse gases - so forests can provide even more climate benefits than previously thought.\n\nMethane has contributed about a third of the observed climate warming since preindustrial times. Concentrations of methane in the atmosphere have been rising rapidly for the best part of two decades.\n\nThat's a real problem for Earth's climate because methane traps much more heat in the atmosphere than the equivalent amount of CO\u2082. But while CO\u2082 can last in the atmosphere for hundreds of years, methane has a lifetime of around ten years.\n\nThis short atmospheric lifetime means that any changes to sources of methane or processes that remove methane from the atmosphere (known as methane sinks) can have rapid effects. If removal is enhanced, this can be a quick climate win helping to mitigate escalating climate change.\n\nThat's why researchers are so interested in understanding how methane gets into the atmosphere and how different processes remove it. It's why my team of ecologists and climate scientists have been studying the exchange of methane between tree bark, a surface that had previously been overlooked for its climate contribution, and the atmosphere.\n\nWetlands are known to be the primary natural source of methane - trees in swamps and floodplains can emit methane from the lower portions of their trunks. But methane exchange in trees growing on free-draining soils that don't flood - that includes most of the world's forests - has not been well-studied, until now.\n\nWe measured methane exchange on hundreds of tree stems in forests along a climate gradient spanning the Amazon and Panama, through to Sweden and forests near Oxford in the UK. We used a simple plastic chamber that wrapped around the tree trunk which was then connected to a laser-based methane analyser.\n\nAt first, we looked for methane emissions from trees, and some do emit a small amount from their trunk base. But the surprise happened when we measured higher up the trunks: trees were taking up methane from the atmosphere and this methane removal grew stronger the higher up we went, with methane removal from the atmosphere dominating overall exchange.\n\nNext, we investigated whether this was a globally important process. To do this we needed to calculate the global area of tree bark. Using a technique called terrestrial laser scanning, we mapped tree woody surfaces down to the finest twig.\n\nWe discovered that, if the bark from all the world's trees were laid flat, it would cover all of Earth's land surface. Potentially, this represents a vast area for gas exchange between tree bark and the atmosphere but this mechanism is still poorly understood.\n\nIn total, our cautious first estimate is that trees take up between about 25 and 50 million tonnes of atmospheric methane each year, with most taken up by tropical forests.\n\nThis is similar to the only other land-based methane sink - soils - and it makes temperate and tropical trees 7%-12% better for climate than they are currently credited for.\n\nBut unlike soil, which isn't changing in area, forests are contracting and expanding through deforestation and reforestation - these changes can influence atmospheric methane. If we reforest and plant trees in the right place, more methane could be drawn down from the atmosphere.\n\nClearly, decarbonisation of the global economy and energy system is the key way to address climate change. But, this capacity for tree bark to absorb methane offers another angle of attack as a nature-based climate solution.\n\nThere may be new ways to improve methane uptake in plantation forestry, by selecting trees that are particularly good at atmospheric methane removal or modifying tree bark microbial communities.\n\nNations could be given greater incentives to preserve existing natural forest and avoid further deforestation.

But now, our large-scale study proves that there's another way that trees absorb greenhouse gases - so forests can provide even more climate benefits than previously thought.\n\nMethane has contributed about a third of the observed climate warming since preindustrial times. Concentrations of methane in the atmosphere have been rising rapidly for the best part of two decades.\n\nThat's a real problem for Earth's climate because methane traps much more heat in the atmosphere than the equivalent amount of CO\u2082. But while CO\u2082 can last in the atmosphere for hundreds of years, methane has a lifetime of around ten years.\n\nThis short atmospheric lifetime means that any changes to sources of methane or processes that remove methane from the atmosphere (known as methane sinks) can have rapid effects. If removal is enhanced, this can be a quick climate win helping to mitigate escalating climate change.\n\nThat's why researchers are so interested in understanding how methane gets into the atmosphere and how different processes remove it. It's why my team of ecologists and climate scientists have been studying the exchange of methane between tree bark, a surface that had previously been overlooked for its climate contribution, and the atmosphere.\n\nWetlands are known to be the primary natural source of methane - trees in swamps and floodplains can emit methane from the lower portions of their trunks. But methane exchange in trees growing on free-draining soils that don't flood - that includes most of the world's forests - has not been well-studied, until now.\n\nWe measured methane exchange on hundreds of tree stems in forests along a climate gradient spanning the Amazon and Panama, through to Sweden and forests near Oxford in the UK. We used a simple plastic chamber that wrapped around the tree trunk which was then connected to a laser-based methane analyser.\n\nAt first, we looked for methane emissions from trees, and some do emit a small amount from their trunk base. But the surprise happened when we measured higher up the trunks: trees were taking up methane from the atmosphere and this methane removal grew stronger the higher up we went, with methane removal from the atmosphere dominating overall exchange.\n\nNext, we investigated whether this was a globally important process. To do this we needed to calculate the global area of tree bark. Using a technique called terrestrial laser scanning, we mapped tree woody surfaces down to the finest twig.\n\nWe discovered that, if the bark from all the world's trees were laid flat, it would cover all of Earth's land surface. Potentially, this represents a vast area for gas exchange between tree bark and the atmosphere but this mechanism is still poorly understood.\n\nAn untapped sink\n\nIn total, our cautious first estimate is that trees take up between about 25 and 50 million tonnes of atmospheric methane each year, with most taken up by tropical forests.\n\nThis is similar to the only other land-based methane sink - soils - and it makes temperate and tropical trees 7%-12% better for climate than they are currently credited for.\n\nBut unlike soil, which isn't changing in area, forests are contracting and expanding through deforestation and reforestation - these changes can influence atmospheric methane. If we reforest and plant trees in the right place, more methane could be drawn down from the atmosphere.\n\nClearly, decarbonisation of the global economy and energy system is the key way to address climate change. But, this capacity for tree bark to absorb methane offers another angle of attack as a nature-based climate solution.\n\nThere may be new ways to improve methane uptake in plantation forestry, by selecting trees that are particularly good at atmospheric methane removal or modifying tree bark microbial communities.\n\nNations could be given greater incentives to preserve existing natural forest and avoid further deforestation. Expensive reforestation projects may become more economically viable under reputable carbon offset schemes that consider methane.\n\nThis new evidence reinforces the importance of trees and forests for our climate system while demonstrating there is still much to learn about these valuable ecosystems.\n\nDon't have time to read about climate change as much as you'd like?\n\nGet a weekly roundup in your inbox instead.

Microbes hidden within tree bark can absorb methane - a powerful greenhouse gas - from the atmosphere.\n\nAn international team of researchers led by the University of Birmingham has shown for the first time that microbes living in bark or in the wood itself are removing atmospheric methane on a scale equal to or above that of soil. They calculate that this newly discovered process makes trees 10 per cent more beneficial for climate overall than previously thought.\n\nMethane is responsible for around 30 per cent of global warming since pre-industrial times and emissions are currently rising faster than at any point since records began in the 1980s.\n\nAlthough most methane is removed by processes in the atmosphere, soils are full of bacteria that absorb the gas and break it down for use as energy. Soil had been thought of as the only terrestrial sink for methane, but the researchers now show that trees may be as important, perhaps more so.\n\nLead researcher on the study, Professor Vincent Gauci of the University of Birmingham, said: \"The main ways in which we consider the contribution of trees to the environment is through absorbing carbon dioxide through photosynthesis, and storing it as carbon. These results, however, show a remarkable new way in which trees provide a vital climate service.\n\n\"The Global Methane Pledge, launched in 2021 at the COP26 climate change summit aims to cut methane emissions by 30 per cent by the end of the decade. Our results suggest that planting more trees, and reducing deforestation surely must be important parts of any approach towards this goal.\"\n\nIn the study, the researchers investigated upland tropical, temperate and boreal forest trees. Specifically, they took measurements spanning tropical forests in the Amazon and Panama; temperate broadleaf trees in Wytham Woods, in Oxfordshire, UK; and boreal coniferous forest in Sweden. The methane absorption was strongest in the tropical forests, probably because microbes thrive in the warm wet conditions found there. On average the newly discovered methane absorption adds around 10% to the climate benefit that temperate and tropical trees provide.\n\nBy studying methane exchange between the atmosphere and the tree bark at multiple heights, they were able to show that while at soil level the trees were likely to emit a small amount of methane, from a couple of metres up the direction of exchange switches and methane from the atmosphere is consumed.\n\nIn addition, the team used laser scanning methods to quantify the overall global forest tree bark surface area, with preliminary calculations indicating that the total global contribution of trees is between 24.6-49.9 Tg (millions of tonnes) of methane. This fills a big gap in understanding the global sources and sinks of methane.\n\nThe tree shape analysis also shows that if all the bark of all the trees of the world were laid at flat, the area would be equal to the Earth's land surface. \"Tree woody surfaces add a third dimension to the way life on Earth interacts with the atmosphere, and this third dimension is teeming with life, and with surprises\", said co-author Yadvinder Malhi of the University of Oxford.\n\nProfessor Gauci and colleagues at Birmingham are now planning a new research programme to find out if deforestation has led to increased atmospheric methane concentrations. They also aim to understand more about the microbes themselves, the mechanisms used to take up the methane and will investigate if this atmospheric methane removal by trees can be enhanced.\n\n/Public Release.

They discussed the components of an effective methane reduction toolbox, highlighting the importance of integrated strategies and support mechanisms for farmers.\n\nEarly action on methane is the path to net zero, said John Tauzel, senior director for global agriculture methane at the US headquartered, Environmental Defense Fund (EDF).\n\nThere is no cookie cutter solution to mitigation of this potent gas, he said.\n\n\"If you have five different farms, you have five different solutions that can be implemented in five different ways or practices. We recognise that to address methane it will require a bespoke, tailormade approach for each farm.\"\n\nIncreasing productivity on farm and improving animal health will be important, but the big wins in methane emissions reduction will be achieved through optimized manure management and enteric methane mitigation approaches that target methanogens in the rumen, he remarked.\n\nFor manure, potential solutions include capturing biogas from manure storage or preventing methane formation altogether, with solid-liquid separation being a promising method.\n\n\"It is crucial to implement manure storage systems that avoid unintended negative impacts on both the climate and the local environment.\"\n\nThe recent approval by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) of Bovaer for dairy cows, a feed additive targeted at methane reduction, is an exciting development, but additional research and development are needed to bring more products to the US market, commented Tauzel.\n\nSpecifically, there should be increased focus on innovation to reduce methane emissions from beef cattle, particularly those raised on pasture.\n\n\"The Enteric Fermentation R&D Accelerator, a global initiative under the Global Methane Hub, aims to harmonize and coordinate research to expedite the introduction of solutions.\"\n\nUS policy advances, such as the Innovative FEED Act, will support these enteric solutions by providing the FDA with greater authority and ensuring a transparent process for bringing new products to market, he continued.\n\n\"However, it is really critical that we get the safety protocol correct,\" he added.\n\nIf enacted, the EMIT LESS Act, recently introduced into the US House of Representatives, will advance lower-methane livestock production in two ways, said Tauzel. First, it will boost financial support and training to enable more producers to adopt enteric methane solutions more quickly. Second, it will accelerate research into additional solutions.\n\nIn addition to policy, improvements in monitoring, reporting and verification (MRV) systems will incentivize mitigation practices by farmers, he believes.\n\nDr Annie Williams, business development manager at the UK Agri-Tech Centre, agreed with Tauzel that improving manure management will support methane reduction efforts. \"Optimizing manure application to land can directly reduce emissions.\"\n\nThe UK Agri-Tech Centre is exploring multiple mitigation strategies including ones based on a precision nutrition approach involving the formulation of diets with closer alignment to amino acid requirements along with reducing the amount of protein in animal diets, she explained.\n\nAlongside such nutrition focused research, the UK Agri-Tech Centre team is looking at how to enhance forage quality, particularly with multi-species swards, as that kind of innovation can play a role in lowering carbon footprint and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in both grasslands and livestock production, reported Williams.\n\nAnimal-specific strategies are also crucial. These include genetic improvements for better efficiency, improving cow fertility, and reducing the age at first calving. \"Enhancing animal health is vital, as healthier animals are more efficient and produce less methane per unit of product.\"\n\nJan Dijkstra, associate professor of animal nutrition at Wageningen University (WUR), Netherlands, told us about the importance of considering the quality of roughage feed to cows, stressing the relationship between grass quality and methane emissions.\n\nResearch undertaken at WUR revealed that feeding dairy cows the youngest, most digestible grass significantly reduces methane emissions compared to feeding them more mature grass, he continued.\n\nThe researchers found that grass silage made from shorter, leafier grass produces much less methane than silage made from grass harvested at a later stage, which becomes stiffer and less digestible. Eating young grass or young grass silage can result in up to 30% less methane emissions. \"This presents an opportunity for many farmers to incorporate this strategy into their day-to-day management to reduce methane emissions,\" Dijkstra reported.\n\nHe also noted that there is significant variation in the effectiveness of different methane mitigation strategies.\n\nA case in point is a meta-analysis conducted by Dijkstra and other experts on 3NOP, or Bovaer. Published last year, the study showed that the mitigating effect of this additive on methane emissions in dairy cows is influenced by the nutrient composition of the diet. Specifically, increases in fiber and crude fat concentrations reduced the effectiveness of 3NOP in mitigating methane production and yield, while increases in starch content enhanced its effectiveness. For methane intensity, reducing the fiber content of the diet improved the additive's effectiveness. As expected, increasing the dose of 3NOP resulted in greater efficacy, he outlined.\n\nAnother important point, said Dijkstra, is that it is crucial for farmers to trust the products they use, to have assurances that they are reliable and do not negatively impact production or animal health. Equally important is consumer satisfaction with the use of mitigation agents on farms for methane reduction. So, ensuring both farmers' trust and consumers' approval is essential for the successful implementation of these solutions, he stressed.\n\nDr Pablo Modernel: program manager, Farm Nature, FrieslandCampina, shared with us how that dairy cooperative is encouraging emission reductions through feed additive trials and farmer incentives. But driving change throughout the whole value chain is the overarching goal for the business.\n\n\"We can make a significant impact within the dairy sector. With our 11,000 member farmers, we hold a unique position to address key sustainability themes throughout the entire supply chain, from grass to glass. These themes include carbon footprint, biodiversity, clean water and energy, better nutrition, and packaging.\"\n\nWork is in progress on emissions reduction, but acceleration is needed to reach a 33% reduction by 2030, compared to a 2015 baseline.\n\nThe cooperative supplies farmers with knowledge and tools to reduce on farm emissions but partnerships and valorisation initiatives are also playing a role.\n\nVarious measures implemented by its farmer members to improve sustainability and earn financial bonuses include increasing cow longevity, reducing GHG emissions with feed additives, sourcing low-carbon animal feed, fermenting manure, enhancing biodiversity by growing more home-grown protein, increasing permanent grassland, and sowing herb-rich grassland. For their efforts, the farmers earn premiums through FrieslandCampina's 'Foqus Planet Sustainable Development' incentive system, or from participation in special milk flows such as organic, On the way to PlanetProof, and VLOG.\n\nThe cooperative has entered into agreements with key international buyers, such as Mars, McDonald's, and Mondel\u0113z International, to support the accelerated reduction of GHG emissions during milk production for dairy products supplied to these customers, with these tie-ups enabling FrieslandCampina to remunerate its member farmers for sustainability focused actions.\n\nIn April, the Danish government announced it was setting aside US$74m to finance the use of feed additives to cut methane emissions from the country's roughly 550,000 dairy cows by 30% in 2030. When asked whether such government subsidies are the way to go to encourage farmers to adopt methane reduction strategies, Williams told us:\n\n\"We're having extensive discussions around these topics. In the UK, for example, Defra announced that by 2030, every cow would have a methane additive. However, they did not explain how they plan to implement this, particularly regarding funding. These are ongoing conversations we're having with farmers and the entire supply chain, including processors and retailers, who need to reduce their Scope 3 emissions. Dairy products often represent a significant portion of these emissions.\n\n\"There's considerable work being done along the supply chain, with a lot of research and development in this area. Many businesses are currently trialling different additives and exploring various methods to reduce emissions, encouraging farmers to adopt these practices. While government incentives might play a role, it's crucial to ensure we have the science and evidence to support the effectiveness of additives in specific situations, whether for TMR-fed or grazing cattle.\n\n\"Before any government incentives are implemented, we will likely see significant work within the supply chain. Ensuring that the right additive is effective in the given context is essential. This groundwork will pave the way for potential government incentives, making the transition smoother and more scientifically backed.\"\n\nLast year saw Elanco launch a tool, UpLook, to help US dairy farmers quantify their GHG emissions reductions; it connects to Athian, a livestock carbon inset marketplace. Tauzel said that approach is a promising first attempt at finding a financial instrument to advance change.\n\n\"What we really need to see in the short term is a blended finance model to cover some of the costs. This would involve private financing, public sector financing, and supply chain financing working together. We need to trial various models and processes to determine which ones farmers will actually adopt. Ultimately, multiple approaches are necessary to bring methane mitigation solutions to market effectively.\"\n\nBy experimenting with different models, we can identify the best strategies to support farmers and achieve our sustainability goals, he added.", "source": {"uri": "feednavigator.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "feednavigator.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gastrointestinal_tract", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gastrointestinal tract"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manure_management", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Manure management"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_additive", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Food additive"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manure", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Manure"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poaceae", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Poaceae"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methane", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Methane"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nutrition", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nutrition"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methane_emissions", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Methane emissions"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silage", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Silage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Veterinary_medicine", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Veterinary medicine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dairy_cattle", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Dairy cattle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_and_Drug_Administration", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Food and Drug Administration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cattle", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Cattle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research_and_development", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Research and development"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenhouse_gas_emissions", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Greenhouse gas emissions"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rumen", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rumen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environmental_Defense_Fund", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Environmental Defense Fund"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methanogen", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Methanogen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beef_cattle", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Beef cattle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_neutrality", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Carbon neutrality"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Europe"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FrieslandCampina", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "FrieslandCampina"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netherlands", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McDonald's", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "McDonald's"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denmark", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Denmark"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Denmark"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Environment", "label": "dmoz/Science/Environment", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Agriculture/Animals", "label": "dmoz/Science/Agriculture/Animals", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Alternative/Non-Toxic_Living", "label": "dmoz/Health/Alternative/Non-Toxic Living", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Agriculture", "label": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Agriculture", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work/Workweek_Reduction", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work/Workweek Reduction", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 74}], "image": "https://www.feednavigator.com/var/wrbm_gb_food_pharma/storage/images/publications/feed/feednavigator.com/article/2024/07/22/how-to-achieve-30-cut-in-methane-emissions-from-cows-by-2030/17602216-1-eng-GB/How-to-achieve-30-cut-in-methane-emissions-from-cows-by-2030.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9758345", "eventUri": "eng-9758345", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3019607843137255, "wgt": 200, "relevance": 1}

That includes USAID sitting, for the first time, on the EPA-chaired Global Methane Initiative. I raise this because the action we take to reduce pollution abroad means we are less exposed to the impacts of climate change here, and vice versa.\n\nLast year, USAID programs helped prevent around 300 million metric tons of greenhouse gas emissions, equal to taking a quarter of cars in the United States off the road for a year, mostly through helping our partners scale renewable energy or conserve tropical forests.\n\nAddressing super pollutants including methane is another way we are really looking to make a dent in global emissions moving forward, given that six of the ten highest methane-emitting countries are countries where USAID works.\n\nAt the same time, cutting methane emissions can drive significant development gains. It means improving people's health - as methane emissions worsen smog and trigger asthma and bronchitis. It means increasing global food security - because one of the most powerful methods for reducing methane emissions is ensuring food gets on people's plates instead of rotting in landfills. And it means reducing energy prices when we work with gas companies to detect and repair methane leaks in their pipelines.\n\nRecognizing this, at COP27 in Egypt, Administrator Power launched a Methane Accelerator to fund and scale innovative efforts to address methane emissions throughout USAID's work, in partnership with the State Department. To date, USAID is working with 13 countries to reduce methane emissions across sectors such as energy, sanitation, and agriculture.\n\nWe also named our first ever Methane Coordinator to work with teams across USAID and the U.S. government on a cohesive, whole-of-government effort to improve development outcomes while preventing super polluting emissions. And we're already seeing results.\n\nFor example, as this group knows, one large source of methane emissions and air pollution is gas flaring. Last year, a USAID-led Power Africa initiative worked with the Government of Nigeria to issue licenses to some 40 successful bidders to capture flared gas and sell the byproduct, for example, as compressed natural gas for cars. Work under these licenses will eliminate more than 5 million metric tons of CO2 equivalent in methane emissions per year - that's equal to the emissions from 13 natural gas plants - while putting gas that would've been wasted into productive use. The effort is also anticipated to generate a substantial number of local jobs and $1 billion in potential revenue. That's $1 billion that would've otherwise been burned without our work.\n\nWith respect to increasing food security, last year at the UN General Assembly, USAID stood up a new food loss and waste accelerator that provides matching grants for businesses to invest in innovative ways to address food waste and minimize food loss in their supply chains. Food loss and waste contributes up to 10 percent of global greenhouse gas emissions. This includes toxic methane emissions generated by discarded food as it decomposes.\n\nToday, I'm excited to announce that through this Accelerator, USAID has formed new partnerships with nine private companies to address food loss and waste. We'll work with businesses across Kenya, Nepal, and Tanzania on solutions such as improving food processing and storage so food doesn't rot before it even leaves the farm, or converting food that would otherwise have been wasted into fertilizer and animal feed.\n\nFinally, we also understand that to truly reduce emissions, we need to improve how we measure and observe emissions. Over the past decade, significant advancements in methane monitoring, supported by domestic legislation such as the Inflation Reduction Act, have improved our ability to detect and measure methane and other pollutants within the United States. It is encouraging to see growing global collaboration between international partners to develop the necessary systems and tools for emissions measurement and observation. If we can pinpoint emissions, we can act to stop them at their source.\n\nI especially want to acknowledge our counterparts at State, NASA, EPA, and other organizations, like the Bezos Earth Foundation for their support to MethaneSat, to develop more robust systems and tools for monitoring and detecting emissions worldwide. Our hope is that efforts like these continue to demonstrate to our partners in the development community, other countries, and the private sector the value of work on methane, not just for the climate but for all development progress.", "source": {"uri": "foreignaffairs.co.nz", "dataType": "news", "title": "foreignaffairs.co.nz"}, "authors": [{"uri": "mil_osi_publisher@foreignaffairs.co.nz",

And even today, there has not been a widely established formula. The main reason behind the difficulty is the challenges in calculating methane's contribution to LNG life-cycle emissions. In producing and transporting LNG, gaseous methane can be leaked into the atmosphere. Methane is a much more potent greenhouse gas than carbon dioxide (CO2), as it can trap as much as 80 times the amount of heat as CO2 does during the first 20 years of its existence. But methane is also more short living (i.e., it dies out after 10 years), so under a 100-year timeframe, it becomes 28 times more powerful as CO2. Today, the norm is to calculate the global warming impact of methane over 100 years, but still, it remains challenging to precisely compare methane with CO2.\n\nMoreover, there is not yet a consensus on the average rate of methane leakages from LNG production. Studies from NGOs (e.g., the Environment Defense Fund), universities (e.g., Cornell and Carnegie Mellon), and governmental agencies (e.g., the Department of Energy, or the DOE) show the average methane leakage rates ranging from 0.7% to 3.3% - and that number can become a lot larger depending on production location and well productivity. Given the powerful nature of methane in causing global warming, even a small change in the leakage rate assumption can lead to substantially different results of emissions from LNG.\n\nOrganisations from both the public and the private sectors have been trying to compare the life-cycle emissions of methane from LNG imports in a region to the emissions from alternative options (such as coal or pipeline gas) that are available to that region.\n\nWhile we think this is an important approach, we also acknowledge that the discrepancies in methane leakage assumptions can yield different conclusions. Mainstream research analysis (from the US DOE) shows that LNG exported from the US to Asia can result in a 54% to 2% emissions reduction compared to local coal combustion over a 20-year timeframe, and emissions from LNG exported from the US to Europe can be 56% less to 1% more than using coal. As for comparing US exported LNG to Russia pipeline natural gas to Europe, results indeed vary based on methane leakage assumptions, with some scholars concerned about mega leakages from Russia pipelines. It is also true that with the Russia-Ukraine war ongoing, imports of natural gas from Russia have dropped significantly regardless of emissions considerations.\n\nAs the awareness of and technologies for measuring methane emissions develop, the issue of methane leakage and emissions from the other parts of the LNG value chain have become a topic of concern from businesses, investors, and governments. And because LNG is still a fossil fuel, there has been increasing debate on how much more of LNG the world will realistically produce to achieve an increasingly noticeable balance between energy security, especially for Europe and Asia, economic development, notably in developing countries, and climate mitigation.\n\nHow industry players are reducing emissions\n\nOne thing, at least, is clear: the current and any potential future LNG value chains need emissions reduction. Several pathways are being developed by the industry:\n\n* Methane monitoring and prevention of leakage\n\nReducing methane emissions from LNG starts with monitoring the leakages. And this is already a challenge. Today, technologies such as optical gas imaging cameras, satellites, aircraft, drones, regional sensors, and point sensors are available to detect methane leakages from gas operations - but these technologies cannot yet track methane emissions systematically and accurately. Point sensors can track small leakages but it would require an army of those sensors to cover large natural gas projects or extended pipelines. Satellites can cover larger areas, but they are unable to detect small leakages. This means that current methane leakages are likely to be underestimated, and as technologies develop, we may see increases in those numbers.\n\nThe natural gas industry needs real innovation to improve methane monitoring. Luckily, there are efforts aimed at driving change. Smart sensors are being explored to better track pipeline methane emissions. Other sensor technologies for production sites are also becoming more advanced. LongPath Technologies in Colorado, for example, recently received funding from the US Department of Energy to develop its mobile dual-frequency comb laser spectrometer. Still, more policy support is needed to incentivise R&D from gas companies to innovate and deploy new technology. The industry would also benefit from having guided standards on how to best measure methane emissions.\n\nAs for methane emissions prevention, effective practices are already available. These include replacing components that emit methane during operations, installing emissions control equipment, and installing leak detection and repair (LDAR) devices. As methane that is prevented from leaking can be sold to the market, the additional revenue can in many cases exceed the cost of installation. In fact, analysis from the International Energy Agency shows that about half of all existing technology for methane emissions reduction can be implemented at no additional cost.\n\n* Carbon capture and storage (CCS)\n\nBesides using carbon offsets essentially paying for others to reduce emissions on one's behalf, companies are also exploring options to use CCS technology to reduce the actual emissions from LNG production. Qatargas' Qatar LNG CCS project is reported to have become operational since 2019, and the project is undergoing development to capture 4.3 million tonnes per annum (mmtpa) of CO2 from Qatargas' 10 trains by 2024. In addition, Venture Global LNG in the US, BP Tangguh LNG in Indonesia, NextDecade Rio Grande LNG in the US, Hoegh LNG Stella Maris (location undecided), Novatek Yamal LNG in Russia, and Total Energies Papua LNG in Papua New Guinea are going through various stages of project development or early evaluation, with expected operation years ranging from 2024 to 2027. Despite a higher interest rate environment in many advanced economies, policy support across jurisdictions such as tax credits and carbon pricing continue to fuel the deployment of CCS technology. We see CCS as a key mitigation method for the LNG industry in the future.\n\n* Carbon offsetting\n\nPurchasing voluntary carbon credits to offset emissions is becoming more and more common practice among LNG companies in the pursuit to reduce GHG emissions. And if the amount of purchased carbon credits is equal to the estimate of life-cycle LNG emissions, then an LNG cargo can be deemed 'emissions-neutral'. In fact, several dozens of LNG cargoes have claimed themselves as emissions neutral since 2021.\n\nThis is a viable mechanism, but there needs to be more transparency, standardisation and scrutiny to make the system more effective. First, a good portion of the purchased carbon offsets have no disclosure of where the credits come from. This makes it hard to verify the credibility of those carbon offsets. Second, carbon offsets should not be the main way for LNG companies to pay and 'write off' their emissions. Companies should still prioritise reducing emissions. Finally - and this is not limited to the LNG industry - voluntary carbon credit platforms such as Verra should take on a stricter approach when verifying offset generating projects before offering the credits to buyers.\n\nVarious frameworks have been established to address the first two challenges. One which is widely used is from the International Group of Liquefied Natural Gas Importers (GIIGNL). Companies adhering to this framework need to (among other things) report the origin of their purchased carbon offsets, emissions reduction plans, and the LNG emissions standards they have applied.\n\n* Shipping fuel switch\n\nFinally, as the shipping industry races to switch from using fossil fuels to biofuels or even LNG to power their cargoes, we can expect the emissions from transporting LNG to decrease over time.\n\n* Conclusion\n\nAll in all, the issue of emissions along the value chain is now holds more weight in LNG companies' strategic decision-making processes. There is still a long way to go toward methane detection improvement, measurement standardisation, and so on - but because of the nature of methane, even a small achievement can have a huge positive impact. While the exact future role of LNG in energy transition and energy security is still up for debate, there is no doubt that any existing or upcoming LNG projects need deep emissions reduction.\n\nSource: ING", "source": {"uri": "hellenicshippingnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Hellenic Shipping News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

UKO ETIM reports.\n\nEnvironmental experts have issued dire warnings about the catastrophic consequences of climate change in Nigeria, urging immediate action to reduce methane emissions.\n\nHuman activities, they noted, contribute 60% of methane emissions and collective efforts are crucial to achieving the 1.5\u00b0C warming pathway and avoiding the worst effects of climate change.\n\nThey emphasised the need for methane abatement, particularly in the oil and gas, agriculture and waste management sectors.\n\nThe experts advocated for technological solutions, behavioural change and policy implementation to reduce methane emissions.\n\nThey emphasized further the benefits of methane reduction, including increased life expectancy, better crop yields and improved livestock health.\n\nThese were some of their submissions during a round-table discussion in Uyo recently during a meeting on the theme: 'Methane Abatement in Nigeria: A Special Focus on Anthropogenic Sources of Methane Emission'.\n\nIt could be recalled that the event was jointly organised by the Environmental Centre for Oil Spill and Gas flaring (ECOSGF), African Initiative for Transparency Accountability/Responsible Leadership (AfriTAL), Peace Point Development Foundation (PPDF) and sponsored by TrustAfrica.\n\nThe paper presentations\n\nIn his paper presentation titled, 'Methane Abatement in Nigeria: An Assessment of Anthropogenic Methane Emissions and Mitigate Strategies', Dr Soberekon Afiesimama of ECOSGF highlighted that methane has contributed over 30% of global temperature rise since the Industrial Revolution and has 80 times the heat-trapping potential of carbon dioxide CO2.\n\nAccording to him, \"Anthropogenic methane emissions are mainly from three sectors: fossil fuels, ~35 %; agriculture, ~42 %; and waste, ~20 %.\n\n\"Total methane emission from human activities is between 350 - 390 million tonnes annually. Natural methane emissions come primarily from vegetated wetland, freshwater systems, natural geological sources, the arctic, etc. Vegetated wetlands contributed about 83% of natural sources.\n\n\"Sources of methane emissions in Nigeria followed the global pattern with the oil and gas sector contributing.\n\n\"Fossil fuels account for 35% of anthropogenic methane emissions. Oil and Gas: 23% (78 Mt/year), Coal: 12% (41 Mt/year).\"\n\nOn how to reduce methane emission, Dr Afiesimama noted that it required a combination of technological solutions and behavioural change by the oil and gas sector.\n\n\"Seventy percent of emissions can be abated using natural gas for power production, vehicle fuel (CNG), LPG. Elimination of the flaring of associated gases, adoption and implementation of regulatory standards in the downstream, midstream and upstream sectors are also key.\"\n\nAfiesimama stated that for instance, the agricultural/waste management sector could deploy biodigester technology as a way of abating methane emission. He further noted that methane could be captured and used as a source of energy.\n\nThe expert advised against food waste, open burning of waste and called for the adoption of alternate wetting and drying of rice cultivation even as he highlighted the benefits of reducing methane emission to include increase in life expectancy, better crop yield, improvement in the lives of livestock and the general wellbeing.\n\nOn his part, an international environmental rights expert, Christopher Inyang stressed the importance of a green environment and tree planting to mitigate global warming.\n\nHe expressed concern about Nigeria's ability to meet its methane emission reduction targets amidst ongoing gas flaring, waste mismanagement and other human-induced activities.\n\n\"Global warming is what causes an international environmental crisis that can affect plants, animals and human lives.\n\n\"It has been agreed that carbon dioxide has been the greatest problem of human lives and there have been solutions reeled out to see how to manage it, including planting of green trees.\n\n\"While humans breathe in oxygen and breathe out carbon dioxide, plants give out oxygen and take in carbon dioxide and this synergy will bring about beautiful life.\n\n\"How can we situate our discussion on management of energy and abating methane emission when there is a serious gas flaring in Ibeno, Onne? Even as you are standing at the soil of Ibeno, you will feel earth tremor as if there would be an earthquake.\n\n\"Also, the waste disposal site in Uyo village road and other centres provide us with an example of mismanagement of waste which can lead to methane emission,\" he said.\n\nAlso speaking, a professor of Environmental Sciences, from Ritman University in Akwa Ibom, Prof Essien Udosen frowned at the rate of waste mismanagement and gas flaring which worsen climate change. He therefore called for deliberate action from both the government and the stakeholders in methane abatement.\n\n\"Waste accumulation is the worst; when rain falls, it would decompose these things and you know what it means. Methane would be released to the air. Methane is dangerous and it contributes higher than carbon dioxide in global warming.\n\n\"The good thing is that you can capture it and convert it to biogas for cooking or automotive purposes; even the lipids that come out could be used for fertilising plants,\" the professor observed.\n\nThe coordinator of PPDF, Umo Isua-Iko urged that returning the environment to the standard nature requested would mitigate climate change in the country.", "source": {"uri": "blueprint.ng", "dataType": "news", "title": "Blueprint Newspapers Limited"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effects_of_climate_change", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Effects of climate change"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fossil_fuel", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Fossil fuel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methane", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Methane"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agriculture", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Agriculture"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methane_emissions", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Methane emissions"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uyo", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Uyo"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Uyo"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Nigeria"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nigeria", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nigeria"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Nigeria"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gas_flare", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Gas flare"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_dioxide", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Carbon dioxide"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waste_management", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Waste management"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wetland", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wetland"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Livestock", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Livestock"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crop_yield", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Crop yield"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_change", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Climate change"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life_expectancy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Life expectancy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_impact_on_the_environment", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Human impact on the environment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geology", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Geology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Industrial_Revolution", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Industrial Revolution"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compressed_natural_gas", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Compressed natural gas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liquefied_petroleum_gas", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Liquefied petroleum gas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arctic", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Arctic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fresh_water", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fresh water"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Environment", "label": "dmoz/Science/Environment", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Environment", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Environment", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Energy", "label": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Energy", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Carbon_Cycle", "label": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Carbon Cycle", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Agriculture", "label": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Agriculture", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://blueprint.ng/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/climate-change-1.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9758345", "eventUri": "eng-9758345", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.04313725490196085, "wgt": 193, "relevance": 1}

But now, our large-scale study proves that there's another way that trees absorb greenhouse gases - so forests can provide even more climate benefits than previously thought.\n\nMethane has contributed about a third of the observed climate warming since preindustrial times. Concentrations of methane in the atmosphere have been rising rapidly for the best part of two decades. That's a real problem for Earth's climate because methane traps much more heat in the atmosphere than the equivalent amount of CO\u2082. But while CO\u2082 can last in the atmosphere for hundreds of years, methane has a lifetime of around ten years.\n\nThis short atmospheric lifetime means that any changes to sources of methane or processes that remove methane from the atmosphere (known as methane sinks) can have rapid effects. If removal is enhanced, this can be a quick climate win helping to mitigate escalating climate change.\n\nMore:\n\nhttps://theconversation.com/weve-discovered-the-worlds-trees-absorb-methane-so-forests-are-even-more-important-in-the-climate-fight-than-we-thought-235233", "source": {"uri": "democraticunderground.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Democratic Underground"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methane", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Methane"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenhouse_gas", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Greenhouse gas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_dioxide", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Carbon dioxide"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photosynthesis", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Photosynthesis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_change_mitigation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Climate change mitigation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmospheric_methane", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Atmospheric methane"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biomass", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Biomass"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmosphere", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Atmosphere"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_change", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Climate change"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Carbon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Earth"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Agriculture/Forestry", "label": "dmoz/Science/Agriculture/Forestry", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Climate_Change", "label": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Climate Change", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Carbon_Cycle", "label": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Carbon Cycle", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Ozone_Layer", "label": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Ozone Layer", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Forests_and_Rainforests", "label": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Forests and Rainforests", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Science", "label": "news/Science", "wgt": 66}], "image": null, "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9758345", "eventUri": "eng-9758345", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1450980392156862, "wgt": 193, "relevance": 1}

Microbes hidden within tree bark can absorb methane - a powerful greenhouse gas - from the atmosphere.\n\nAn international team of researchers led by the University of Birmingham has shown for the first time that microbes living in bark or in the wood itself are removing atmospheric methane on a scale equal to or above that of soil. They calculate that this newly discovered process makes trees 10 per cent more beneficial for climate overall than previously thought.\n\nMethane is responsible for around 30 per cent of global warming since pre-industrial times and emissions are currently rising faster than at any point since records began in the 1980s.\n\nAlthough most methane is removed by processes in the atmosphere, soils are full of bacteria that absorb the gas and break it down for use as energy. Soil had been thought of as the only terrestrial sink for methane, but the researchers now show that trees may be as important, perhaps more so.\n\nLead researcher on the study, Professor Vincent Gauci of the University of Birmingham, said: \"The main ways in which we consider the contribution of trees to the environment is through absorbing carbon dioxide through photosynthesis, and storing it as carbon. These results, however, show a remarkable new way in which trees provide a vital climate service.\n\n\"The Global Methane Pledge, launched in 2021 at the COP26 climate change summit aims to cut methane emissions by 30 per cent by the end of the decade. Our results suggest that planting more trees, and reducing deforestation surely must be important parts of any approach towards this goal.\"\n\nIn the study, the researchers investigated upland tropical, temperate and boreal forest trees. Specifically, they took measurements spanning tropical forests in the Amazon and Panama; temperate broadleaf trees in Wytham Woods, in Oxfordshire, UK; and boreal coniferous forest in Sweden. The methane absorption was strongest in the tropical forests, probably because microbes thrive in the warm wet conditions found there. On average the newly discovered methane absorption adds around 10% to the climate benefit that temperate and tropical trees provide.\n\nBy studying methane exchange between the atmosphere and the tree bark at multiple heights, they were able to show that while at soil level the trees were likely to emit a small amount of methane, from a couple of metres up the direction of exchange switches and methane from the atmosphere is consumed.\n\nIn addition, the team used laser scanning methods to quantify the overall global forest tree bark surface area, with preliminary calculations indicating that the total global contribution of trees is between 24.6-49.9 Tg (millions of tonnes) of methane. This fills a big gap in understanding the global sources and sinks of methane.\n\nThe tree shape analysis also shows that if all the bark of all the trees of the world were laid at flat, the area would be equal to the Earth's land surface. \"Tree woody surfaces add a third dimension to the way life on Earth interacts with the atmosphere, and this third dimension is teeming with life, and with surprises\", said co-author Yadvinder Malhi of the University of Oxford.\n\nProfessor Gauci and colleagues at Birmingham are now planning a new research programme to find out if deforestation has led to increased atmospheric methane concentrations. They also aim to understand more about the microbes themselves, the mechanisms used to take up the methane and will investigate if this atmospheric methane removal by trees can be enhanced.\n\nENDS\n\nFor media enquiries, interviews, or an embargoed copy of the research paper, please contact Press Office, University of Birmingham, tel: +44 (0)121 4142772: email:

To inform strategies for abating methane emissions, it is essential to identify global sources and sinks accurately and to disentangle the factors that control methane exchange with the atmosphere. The role of vegetation in the methane cycle has been increasingly studied in the past few decades, but large gaps persist in our understanding. Writing in Nature, Gauci and colleagues present measurements of methane flux at the stems of upland trees along a latitudinal gradient, from tropical forests to 'hemiboreal' forests that are found mid-way between temperate and subarctic (or boreal) zones. The findings reveal a consistent pattern of net methane uptake from the atmosphere by woody surfaces -- and suggest that this uptake, when scaled worldwide, is a substantial sink that is missing from the presently unbalanced global methane budget.\n\nCurrent 'bottom-up' estimates of global methane emissions, which are derived from data-driven modelling, are about 30% higher than are 'top-down' estimates based on atmospheric observations and inverse modelling. This discrepancy suggests either that emissions sources are being overestimated in the top-down modelling, or that a sink is being underestimated or is missing. The main process that removes methane from the atmosphere is the reaction of the gas with short-lived hydroxyl radicals in the troposphere, the lowermost part of the atmosphere. In the terrestrial domain, the only sink that is currently reasonably well understood is in soils: methane is consumed by 'methanotrophic' bacteria in the uppermost layers of many freely drained soils worldwide.\n\nThe role of trees in ecosystem methane flux has been studied intensively since 2006, when a seminal paper reported direct methane emissions from plants and suggested that this methane was formed inside the plants. Trees can affect soil methane flux through their influence on soil properties and hydrology, but it has also been shown that trees, notably those growing on water-saturated soil, can emit methane directly from their stems. The origin of this emitted methane has been debated, but several lines of evidence suggest that the gas is produced in the soil and transported up through the trees, eventually diffusing out through the stems. However, methane can also be produced by methanogenic bacteria in tree tissues.\n\nA few studies have also reported methane uptake by tree stems and branches, possibly as a result of consumption by methanotrophic microbes found in stem and leaf tissue and on bark. This might occur simultaneously with the transport of methane from the soil by trees.\n\nIn their study, Gauci and colleagues used advanced gas analysers to quantify the net exchange of methane between tree stems and the air in chambers attached to the stems. Measurements were taken along a latitudinal gradient, spanning tropical forests in Amazonia, a temperate forest in the United Kingdom (Fig. 1) and a hemiboreal forest in Sweden. At each location, the authors observed the same vertical pattern of methane exchange: net emissions were produced at the tree base (below about 1.3 metres), whereas net uptake occurred higher up the stems (up to 2 m above ground). The authors' analysis of carbon isotopes in methane sampled from the chamber air and from tree cores suggested that microbial consumption on woody surfaces and in tree tissue is responsible for the net uptake higher up the stems.\n\nGauci et al. also observed that floodplain trees, which usually act as net methane sources, could exhibit net uptake during dry periods. Moreover, the authors report a clear positive correlation between the mean methane uptake of trees at a stem height of 2 m and the mean annual temperature at each location. This relationship allows climatic variability to be taken into account when extrapolating the results to larger regions.\n\nTo scale up these tree-level measurements and assess tree methane flux around the globe, an accurate estimate of the woody surface area of trees worldwide is needed. Gauci and colleagues used a technique called terrestrial laser scanning (TLS) -- which provides high-resolution 3D representations of tree structures -- to estimate the woody surface area of 2,161 trees at 22 sites in tropical and temperate forests. The authors used the data to construct models of the woody surface area for tropical and temperate trees. These were combined with maps of global tree-canopy cover derived from satellite data to estimate the global woody surface area.\n\nThis estimate, used in combination with the relationship between methane uptake and mean annual temperature, enabled the authors to estimate that 24.6-49.9 teragrams of methane is taken up globally by woody surfaces annually (1 Tg is 1 million tonnes). This is comparable to the well-established value for the soil methane sink (11-49 Tg of methane per year), and helps to resolve differences between bottom-up and top-down estimates of atmospheric methane removal. The findings have important implications for estimates of the potential of forests to mitigate climate change, and for our understanding of the global methane budget. The study also highlights that efforts to protect and restore global forests have climate benefits beyond simply acting as carbon dioxide sinks.\n\nA key limitation of the study is that the methane measurements were taken mainly below 2 m, but it is highly likely that uptake is different farther up the tree stems. The TLS approach is another source of uncertainty in the study, especially in the estimation of the surface area of small branches. This issue could affect the global estimates of methane flux, especially if methane uptake rates are indeed increased farther up in the tree canopies.\n\nFuture studies should focus on taking measurements higher up the trees, as well as from smaller branches, shoots and leaves. Data should be gathered in other environments, such as dry forests, savannahs and shrublands, to determine whether net methane uptake is universal.

robust frameworks and policies that hold oil and gas companies accountable, while civil society organisations must continue to monitor and advocate for environmental sustainability.\n\n\"We all need to recognise the urgency of addressing methane emissions within Nigeria's oil and gas sector.\n\n\"Nigerian communities will also benefit from cleaner air and improved health outcomes; to achieve this

As global temperature records are being shattered month after month, we clearly see the danger is already manifesting - and it will only worsen in the coming years if something isn't done immediately to clamp down on these high-polluting industries,\" said Food & Water Watch Research Director Amanda Starbuck. \"While the right wing and their Project 2025 playbook are calling for more and more destructive oil and gas production, science and reality are screaming that we must move decisively in the opposite direction.\"\n\nFood & Water Watch (FWW) estimates that in 2022, fracking across the U.S. released lifecycle emissions of over 26.4 million metric tons of methane.This includes emissions from well sites, processing, and distribution, but excludes combustion. This is equivalent to over 500 million cars driven for a year, or 255 billion gallons of gasoline burned. Peer-reviewed research has shown that the EPA consistently underestimates the scale of this pollution.\n\nOn the industrial agriculture front, FWW estimates that on-farm emissions from hogs, beef cattle and dairy cows living on U.S. factory farmstotaled up to 3.2 million metric tons of methane in 2022.This is equivalent to 65.3 million cars being driven for a year, or driving around the Equator over 28 million times. (This does not include emissions from cattle feed production, which makes up the lion's share of the livestock industry's greenhouse gas emissions.)\n\nMost on-farm livestock emissions come from enteric fermentation, a natural process within the digestive system of ruminants. The report estimates that mega-dairies dominate these emissions, with nearly 7 million cows together producing 1.06 million metric tons of methane every year. The 11 to 12 million beef cattle on factory farms produce 507,000 metric tons of methane annually. The other major source of on-farm emissions is manure management.

The href=\"https://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/politics/government-plans-tree-planting-frenzy-as-report-shows-nz-no-longer-on-track-to-hit-climate-target/IWPXQM4DIBGYPGCOSDXWE3GFIQ/\" target=\"_blank\"> draft emissions plan will have a more far-reaching impact than any policy announced to date. Perhaps the muted response is because the goal of the plan, net zero emissions by 2050, remains unchanged.\n\nThe target of net zero is set in stone. If we do not meet our international commitments countries and companies will refuse to trade with us.\n\nLabour's plan was to use central planning to achieve net zero emissions. The coalition's plan is to let the market find the lowest-cost solutions.\n\nLabour's plan was to use today's technology. The coalition's plan assumes over the next 25 years new technology will lower emissions.\n\nParliament has adopted a cap-and-trade scheme for greenhouse gases. Those who emit must buy greenhouse units from those who remove emissions such as forestry. There would be no need for a plan if the Emissions Trading Scheme covered the whole economy. The government could just set the cap on emissions until we reach net zero in 2050.\n\nWe need an emissions plan for two reasons: Industries in the global economy are receiving free carbon credits. Without free credits, these industries could not compete with international companies that are not required to buy credits.\n\nThe principal reason we need a plan is agriculture produces half of all emissions and has been excluded from the Emissions Trading Scheme. The draft plan proposes agriculture have its own reduction plan for adoption in 2030.\n\nWorldwide, CO2 is causing global warming. New Zealand agriculture produces little CO2 but does produce methane, a shorter-lived gas but more potent.\n\nThere is a case for methane to be treated differently from CO2.\n\nNew Zealand's dairy industry is the world's lowest greenhouse emitter. Including dairy in the Emissions Trading Scheme would shift global milk production to countries where the emissions per litre of milk are higher. As the goal is to reduce global warming that makes no sense.\n\nWhile a different scheme for methane is sensible there is no getting away from the fact that agriculture must reduce its emissions to enable New Zealand to reach net zero.\n\nThe Greens' solution is to have far fewer cows. Labour's is to include agriculture in the Emissions Trading Scheme.\n\nThe coalition's solution is to rely on new technology.\n\nCritics, to quote a Guardian headline say \"New Zealand will fail to meet 2050 net zero targets, data shows, after climate policies scrapped\".\n\nScientists say the Government's approach to emissions-cutting is 'high risk' and reliant on \"immature technologies\".\n\nHistory is full of examples of experts predicting disaster by projecting the future based on existing technology. In 1894, it was predicted that in 50 years London's streets would be under nine feet of horse manure. Technology and Henry Ford solved the issue without a plan.\n\nInsisting on a plan using only today's technology just gives the illusion of certainty. We do know that technological change is accelerating.\n\nThis five-year plan will be overtaken by unpredictable events.\n\nWhile the technological changes will be unknowable, what is known is that in 25 years there will be even more technological change.\n\nImagine New Zealand had, in 1999, adopted a 25-year plan based on existing technology. It would have been a plan for a country with no take up of smartphones, electric and hybrid cars, cloud computing, Internet shopping or AI, to name a few of the technical developments of the past 25 years.\n\nImplementing Labour's Luddite plan to use only today's technology would require draconian regulations. The result would be a much poorer country.\n\nGlobally a huge effort is underway to find ways to reduce global emissions ranging from better batteries to carbon capture.\n\nDevelopments are being made where New Zealand has an advantage - wind, geothermal and wave.\n\nOur challenge is having a unique greenhouse profile. We must reduce the methane produced from agriculture.\n\nThe plan makes research into methane reduction New Zealand's priority.\n\nThere are many promising projects. Feed additives that inhibit methane production: Selective breeding to create herds and flocks that emit less methane: Grazing management using forage plants that reduce methane production: AgResearch has a vaccine under development that targets the microbes that produce methane.\n\nOverseas research has shown adding some types of seaweed to stock feed can reduce methane production by 80%.\n\nWhere the draft plan can be criticised is for ignoring existing safe technology that we refuse to use.

Through photosynthesis, trees take in atmospheric carbon dioxide and release the oxygen we need to breathe. Earth's forests hold an estimated 861 gigatons of carbon, which is about equivalent to 100 years of anthropogenic fossil fuel emissions. Keeping trees intact ensures all that carbon stays stored and supporting careful reforestation efforts ensures additional carbon gets locked away.\n\nIf all that wasn't enough, new research offers another reason why forests may be critical to keeping climate change in check. Trees absorb methane (CH) through their bark, thanks to methane-hungry microbes. Through this mechanism, forests could be as much of a methane sink as soil, according to a study published July 24 in the journal Nature. The findings could help balance our understanding of Earth's climate budget and also bolster reforestation projects.\n\nMethane, a less-frequently discussed type of carbon emissions, is a major driver of human-caused climate change, released through industries like agriculture and natural gas extraction. Over a century, one ton of atmospheric CH is about 28 to 36 times as warming as carbon dioxide. Though methane is much less abundant in the atmosphere than CO, the potent greenhouse gas is responsible for about 20 to 30 percent of global temperature increases since the industrial revolution, according to NASA estimates.\n\nIt's long been understood that there are two primary ways methane disappears. Over a decade or so, methane molecules break down into carbon dioxide and water in the atmosphere. This is the biggest methane sink, or source of loss, in Earth's carbon cycle. The planet's soils represent the second largest known sink. Below ground, so-called methanotrophs (single-celled organisms that rely on methane for energy) metabolize the gas.\n\nYet there seems to be a third important and previously unquantified methane sink at play: trees. The bark on many tree species is also host to methanotrophs, per the new study. Added altogether, the researchers calculate that microbes inhabiting all the tree surface area worldwide are absorbing and eliminating between 24.6 and 49.9 teragrams (about 29 to 55 million tons) of the greenhouse gas each year. That puts the estimated impact of trees on par with the soil sink.\n\nCompared with known sources and sinks of methane, top-down calculations of atmospheric concentrations indicate a mysterious missing sink. Some proportion of methane emissions are being uptaken, but scientists aren't yet sure where. The new study could offer a big clue. \"If their globally-scaled estimates are even the right order of magnitude, then they've demonstrated that tree methane uptake may account for one third of the global 'missing sink',\" says Nicholas Ward, a senior research scientist and biogeochemist at the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory.\n\nPrevious research has identified the presence of methanotrophs in a few types of trees. But the new study is notable for assessing more species across multiple biomes, including tropical, temperate, and boreal forests. The research is also the first to offer a total estimate of how much methane Earth's trees might be taking in. \"We've found that this is actually a large-scale process that operates across the world,\" says Vincent Gauci, lead study author and an ecologist and biogeochemist at the University of Birmingham in England. \"On average, this makes trees about 10% better for the climate,\" Gauci tells Popular Science.\n\nAnother recent spate of studies has identified certain forests as methane sources. Some trees, particularly those in wetland environments, act as conduits carrying underground methane to the surface and atmosphere. The new study doesn't contradict these existing findings, but rather adds nuance to the question of forests' overall role in the methane cycle, says Patrick Megonigal, an ecologist and biogeochemist at the Smithsonian Environmental Research Center, where he serves as associate director for research.\n\nMegonigal was not involved in the new work, but has previously studied tree methane fluxes. There's instances where trees produce methane, consume methane, and where trees do neither, he says. Drivers like soil moisture and tree anatomy might shift which occurs in a particular place. \"It's clear that this is just very dynamic,\" he adds. However, the new research suggests that, on a planetary scale, trees could be taking up much more methane than they're giving off. \"It's exciting and a major step forward in how we conceptualize the role of forests in the global methane budget,\" says Megonigal. \"They've made an important point about the potential for the woody surfaces of trees to act as a net methane sink, while also acknowledging the difficulties of making those estimates.\"\n\nEven if some trees are net sources of methane, that doesn't mean we should cut them down, emphasize Gauci and Ward. \"Society should value forests despite whether or not specific tree species emit or consume methane. This is a natural process that has occurred since long before humans existed,\" says Ward. \"Trees and forests are wonderful,\" says Gauci. \"They offer so much and they're part of our natural world and ecosystems. We should appreciate them for their intrinsic value rather than necessarily having to tout percentages of this or that greenhouse gas.\"\n\nGauci and a team of international scientists focused their work on non-wetland trees, which take up much more global land area than wetland forests. By placing foam and plastic gas traps around trees at various heights, they measured the methane flux occurring at different points on tree trunks in four different regions: the Brazilian Amazon, a tropical forest in Panama, a temperate deciduous forest in the UK, and a boreal forest in Sweden.\n\nThey found that, close to the soil, most trees' bark emits a small amount of methane. However, farther up the trunk, that changes. Beginning at about breast-height, the methane flux switches over to absorption, and at ever-higher points along trunks, tree bark seems to take in more and more methane. So far, it's unclear what role these methanotrophs are performing in a tree's biology, if any. \"It's a really new frontier of research,\" says Gauci. But it's clear that the microbes are widespread and burning through methane at meaningful rates. Given that mature trees can be tens to hundreds of feet tall, Gauci and his colleagues estimate that the bulk of Earth's woody surface area is absorbing methane, not emitting it.\n\nGreenhouse gas uptake varied between ecosystems and tree species. Some species like oaks, demonstrated very little methane absorption. While others, like ashes, sycamore, and many tropical species, took in much more of the gas. Overall, tropical trees were the largest methane sinks, while temperate trees took in a smaller yet still net significant amount of CH. In a tropical floodplain, the researchers found that whether or not trees act as a methane source or sink depends on time of year and whether the ground is inundated or dry.\n\nUsing all of this small-scale tree data, the scientists used estimates of global tree surface area to come up with an approximate range for total bark-based methane uptake. Ultimately, the numbers they came to mean that trees are even more of a climate boost than we knew, providing about 12% more carbon benefit in tropical regions and 7% more in temperate zones. \"It means our trees are that much more useful and powerful than we've given them credit for,\" says Gauci. \"That has implications for forest protection, reforestation, and restoration projects,\" he adds.\n\n\"This is a group that has experience in [scaling up] measurements,\" notes Megonigal. \"They've done a good job of that, in this case,\" he adds. \"There's lots of uncertainty built into these data, but they acknowledge that and were conservative in their estimates.\"\n\nDespite the fact that the researchers continually documented methane absorption increasing as they measured farther up tree trunks, they only estimated mean absorption from their real measured data points, which topped out at about two meters above the forest floor. It's quite possible that, even higher up, trees are taking in even more methane-yet Gauci and co. didn't include that likelihood in their assessment. They also didn't include trees in water-limited ecosystems, like savannahs, for lack of data on how methane flux unfolds in more arid habitats. Nonetheless, they still found a major potential effect.\n\nYet even with this abundant caution, the study has limitations. Megonigal points out that their overall sample size of about 160 trees is small. Plus, the study offers no information on what's unfolding in the tree canopies, and what role leaves might play in methane flux. Ward notes that four locations and ecoregions can't fully encapsulate what's happening worldwide. \"For a first order estimation these methods and conclusions are robust, but [it] by no means closes the books on global forest methane cycle,\" he tells Popular Science. Additionally, since the study doesn't include wetland trees, it's impossible to know exactly what the net balance is between non-wetland methane uptake and wetland tree emissions. \"Even if uplands and wetlands are in a net balance currently... this balance will likely change in the face of climate change,\" Ward says.\n\n\"The strength of this paper is that it makes an initial case about the potential importance of this process,\" says Megnonigal. But more research is needed to really home in on what trees across the whole globe are doing. \"I am hopeful that this paper...will bring more people who are doing forest work off the soil and up the trees,\" Megonigal adds.\n\nAlready, Gauci has a research project planned in Ghana that will assess canopy and leaf contributions to methane flux, as well as the impacts of moisture and drought conditions on absorption. The findings could further inform how we calculate our planet's capacity to manage greenhouse gasses.\n\nRegardless of the eventual results of that study, though, both Gauci and Megonigal caution that tree bark's methane sink potential isn't enough to resolve climate change on its own. Forests and reforestation \"are just another part of the equation,\" says Gauci. \"If it can be used for good in an effort to improve uptake of methane from the atmosphere then, heck, that'd be great,\" he adds. \"But there's no magic bullet.\"\n\n\"At the end of the day, the solution is going to have to be regulating the greenhouse gasses that we are putting into the atmosphere,\" says Megonigal. \"We have to rely first on controlling our emissions, and then work with nature to do the same.\"", "source": {"uri": "popsci.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Popular Science"}, "authors": [{"uri": "lauren_leffer@popsci.com", "name": "Lauren Leffer", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bark_(botany)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bark (botany)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methanotroph", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Methanotroph"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biogeochemistry", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Biogeochemistry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reforestation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Reforestation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microorganism", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Microorganism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenhouse_gas", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Greenhouse gas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methane", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Methane"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soil", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Soil"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forest", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Forest"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Earth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmosphere", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Atmosphere"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Species", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Species"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Carbon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flux", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Flux"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_dioxide", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Carbon dioxide"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ton", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Ton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_change", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Climate change"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tropics", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Tropics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenhouse_gas_emissions", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Greenhouse gas emissions"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface_area", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Surface area"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panama", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Panama"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Panama"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Environment", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Environment", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Agriculture/Forestry", "label": "dmoz/Science/Agriculture/Forestry", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Climate_Change", "label": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Climate Change", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Agriculture/Soils", "label": "dmoz/Science/Agriculture/Soils", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Forests_and_Rainforests", "label": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Forests and Rainforests", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Science", "label": "news/Science", "wgt": 86}], "image": "https://www.popsci.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/bark-tree.jpg?w=2000", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9758345", "eventUri": "eng-9758345", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-24", "textStart": 843, "textEnd": 850}], "sentiment": 0.3019607843137255, "wgt": 181, "relevance": 1}

This new research, led by the University of Birmingham and including NAU as the only American partner, found that microbes living in bark or in the wood itself are removing atmospheric methane on a scale equal to or above that of soil, making trees 10% more beneficial for climate overall than previously thought. Methane is responsible for about 30% of global warming since pre-industrial times, and emissions are currently rising faster than at any point since records began in the 1980s.\n\nAlthough most methane is removed by processes in the atmosphere, soils are full of bacteria that absorb the gas and break it down for use as energy. Soil had been thought of as the only terrestrial sink for methane, but this research shows that trees may be equally as important as, or even more important than, soil in this cleaning process.\n\nThe researchers took measurements spanning tropical forests in the Amazon and Panama; temperate broadleaf trees in Wytham Woods, in Oxfordshire, United Kingdom; and boreal coniferous forest in Sweden, hitting three major global forest ecosystems. In addition, the team used laser scanning methods to quantify the overall global forest tree bark surface area, with preliminary calculations indicating that the total global contribution of trees is between 24.6-49.9 million tons of methane. This fills a big gap in understanding the global sources and sinks of methane.\n\nThe researchers found methane absorption was strongest in the tropical forests, likely because microbes thrive in the warm, wet conditions found there. On average, the newly discovered methane absorption adds about 10% to the climate benefit that temperate and tropical trees provide.\n\n\"We suspect that natural ecosystems are more valuable to society than we give them credit for, and this study shows an important, previously invisible process that bears this out,\" Shenkin said. \"It turns out that the intricate 3D structural complexity of forests enables them to efficiently scrub methane from the atmosphere. What else will we find out that natural ecosystem complexity enables?\"\n\nFor the next phase of this research, Shenkin has launched a venture, SelvaFlux Inc., that aims to leverage this finding to increase tropical reforestation and conservation by making it more profitable in the carbon markets.", "source": {"uri": "d.newswise.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "d.newswise.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bark_(botany)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bark (botany)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methane", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Methane"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmosphere", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Atmosphere"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Arizona_University", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Northern Arizona University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_dioxide", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Carbon dioxide"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_change", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Climate change"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photosynthesis", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Photosynthesis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_change_mitigation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Climate change mitigation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenhouse_gas", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Greenhouse gas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deforestation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Deforestation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soil", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Soil"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nature_(journal)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nature (journal)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tropical_forest", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tropical forest"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmospheric_methane", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Atmospheric methane"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satellite_imagery", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Satellite imagery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temperate_climate", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Temperate climate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Birmingham", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "University of Birmingham"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microorganism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Microorganism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacteria", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bacteria"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conifer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Conifer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forest_ecology", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Forest ecology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface_area", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Surface area"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxfordshire", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Oxfordshire"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Oxfordshire"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sweden", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sweden"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Sweden"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panama", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Panama"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Panama"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Agriculture/Forestry", "label": "dmoz/Science/Agriculture/Forestry", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Climate_Change", "label": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Climate Change", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Agriculture/Soils", "label": "dmoz/Science/Agriculture/Soils", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Ozone_Layer", "label": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Ozone Layer", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Forests_and_Rainforests", "label": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Forests and Rainforests", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Science", "label": "news/Science", "wgt": 86}], "image": "https://d.newswise.com/assets/new/img/newswise-logo-square.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9758345", "eventUri": "eng-9758345", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2549019607843137, "wgt": 176, "relevance": 1}

Livestock produces methane as a byproduct of methanogenesis, which occurs when the cattle break down feed in the rumen. TBM inhibits this methanogenesis process by blocking the action of key enzymes in the cycle in which carbon dioxide is reduced to methane by the microbes in a cow's rumen called archaea.\"\n\nThe New Zealand provisional registration is one of multiple registration processes that are progressing in parallel.\n\nRumin8 is also engaging with the US Food and Drug Administration's Center for Veterinary Medicine and Brazil's Ministry of Agriculture, Livestock and Supply (MAPA).\n\nAsked about the challenges and potential regulatory hurdles Rumin8 might face in obtaining final approval for its feed additives in New Zealand and other markets, Messina said:\n\n\"Regulators are always concerned with animal and human food safety as the most important considerations, but also need to see evidence of efficacy in the target production system with local feeds and animal management practices in mind. The biggest challenge most companies face is developing an effective product with an acceptable safety profile, and our 18+ studies around the world have already provided that level of confidence. Most global regulators look for similar data to support registration and we are on the road to finalizing those data packages at present.\"\n\nRumin8 has been working with commercial and research partners in New Zealand since late 2022 to evaluate the safety and efficacy of its technology.\n\n\"Provisional registration means that the regulator has reviewed Rumin8's safety and efficacy package for its product generated to date and is happy for the company to proceed to conduct commercial trials. So, we will be conducting a number of studies focused on New Zealand production systems and local feeds to demonstrate the target dose level, efficacy, and long-term safety of the product. There is already a significant safety database around TBM itself, so Rumin8 will be filling in with some non-clinical studies to support its New Zealand and international regulatory filings,\" Messina told FeedNavigator.\n\nThe trial results to date are providing a good indication that livestock producers will be able to reduce the GHG emissions that their cattle produce, while at the same time producing more meat and milk, reported the CEO.\n\n\"That increase in production is important as it will have the ability to fund the cost of the product partly or totally. We have been aiming to provide an environmental benefit and a P&L benefit for farmers and ranchers, and the results achieved to date are promising.\"\n\nThe company presented key methane reduction and productivity improvement results from studies at the Breakthrough Energy 2024 Summit in London last month. The Bill Gates-founded Breakthrough Energy is a cornerstone investor in Rumin8.\n\nThe release of two sets of study results at the Breakthrough Energy Summit were each important to Rumin8 individually, but combined their importance was even greater, said Messina.\n\n\"Firstly, we announced that a University of New England (Armidale, NSW, Australia) controlled cattle study found the methane yield was slashed by 81% when trial cattle had access to water troughs dosed with Rumin8's methane reducing livestock supplements.\n\n\"Given the predominance of grass-based cattle production systems across the globe, water dosing is crucial, because without it, there is currently no way to administer methane reducing additives to this large market segment.\n\n\"Secondly, we provided positive top-line results from three cattle trials - lasting between 75-130 days - where the treated cattle recorded reductions of methane intensity of up to 86% and weight gains ranging 8.4% to 12.5% higher than control groups that were fed the same base ration.\n\n\"Products that can both reduce methane emissions and create weight gains are much more likely to be embraced by livestock producers, so this was an extremely promising result,\" commented the CEO.\n\nAs regards how Rumin8 plans to expand its production and distribution to meet the demand from farmers in New Zealand and other target markets, he said that one of the startup's key advantages is that it produces its methane reducing feed and water supplements using a pharmaceutical process that allows for rapid scaling to meet the demands of the markets where our products get registered.", "source": {"uri": "feednavigator.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "feednavigator.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

As extreme weather becomes more and more prevalent, what should we do? Take a look at our interview with Amanda Leland, the executive director of the Environmental Defense Fund.\n\nCGTN: Let's talk a little bit about the extreme weather events that's been happening. In early April, there's been a strong wind in China's Jiangxi province. It was quite deadly. Several people were swept out of their homes when they were sleeping. And then there was the pouring rain in Dubai, which I don't think it happened for 7.5 decades for rain to fall that much. What's going on? How can we deal with these kinds of events?\n\nAmanda Leland: So, while we deal with the long term threat of global warming, we also need to cope with the short term impact of these extreme weather events that you just mentioned, that they're both dangerous for people in nature, but also super disruptive to agriculture and the economy. And as the warming climate increases, the likelihood of extreme weather events, such as heat waves, typhoons, floods, droughts, wildfires (increases).\n\nThe solution is to drastically cut carbon dioxide emissions as well as methane emissions and other greenhouse gas pollution. And we do that by transitioning away from fossil fuels and increasing the share of renewable in the energy mix. Among these solutions, cutting methane has the critical role to play in limiting and slowing (global) warming, because methane is 84 times more powerful than carbon dioxide in the near term.\n\nCGTN: Last year at Dubai, the global community reached the agreement to transition away from the fossil fuels, but apparently, activists and NGOs and governments have been calling for more actions to address the climate change. What's the next step? What's the next big thing that we should be aiming for?\n\nAmanda Leland: Global warming affects us all, and everyone has a stake in this problem and the solutions. The transition to cleaner, more efficient energy is happening all around the world - faster than many people predicted, but it's still not happening fast enough. And that's why we need governments and industry working as hard and as fast as possible to cut greenhouse gas pollution and really accelerate that transition to cleaner forms of energy.\n\nWe've witnessed a lot of positive actions in China. The government has issued comprehensive guidelines to advance the Beautiful China Initiative, which is a vision highlighting China's path to modernization in harmony with nature. The Chinese government has also made climate a central focus using market-based solutions. China continues to improve its national emissions trading system, which is already the largest in the world, and plans to broaden the coverage of this emissions trading system to encompass even more sectors. At the end of 2023, China developed the country's first national methane action plan, which is an important framework for how methane is used and monitored in China.\n\nEurope and the United States are also making progress. The Biden administration has made climate and clean energy a central priority, combining strong rules and regulations on the one hand and new incentives for clean energy and energy efficiency on the other. Europe has always been known for strong climate leadership, everything from energy to buildings, to transportation. And the impressive thing is that they have stayed strong on climate, even in the face of energy price increases and supply shocks in the most recent years.\n\nWhat we all know is that international collaboration is key. And that's how we keep everyone moving on the same path and working together, especially when it comes to helping developing economies that can't do it on their own. Because in the end, it's up to those countries to deliver on their climate targets and their commitments. The important thing is that all countries need to keep moving forward.\n\n(If you want to contribute and have specific expertise, please contact us at opinions@cgtn.com.

We are the only party that has a plan to deliver on the priorities of the people.\"\n\nHis comments came after Oxford academics Colin Rallings and Michael Thrasher said the local election results suggested that Labour were nine points ahead, rather than the more than 20 per cent that had been suggested by polling.\n\nWriting in The Times, they said: \"Repeated at a general election on a uniform swing, these figures would lead to a hung parliament with Labour as comfortably the largest party but still short of a majority. A rather different picture to the Blackpool story.\"\n\nFormer home secretary Suella Braverman has urged the Prime Minister to change course rightward to win back voters, offering further tax cuts and a cap on legal migration.\n\nTory grandee Sir John Hayes signalled the Prime Minister should reshuffle his Cabinet, with his close ally Ms Braverman as a voice at the table for what he called the \"authentic Tory part of the Conservative Party\".\n\nBut Conservative moderates warned against Mr Sunak lurching rightward, with outgoing West Midlands mayor Andy Street claiming after his loss that \"winning from that centre ground is what happens\".\n\nDamian Green, chairman of the One Nation Group of Tory moderates, made a similar plea on the BBC's Westminster Hour.\n\n\"I would just observe the seats that we have lost in the past few days - we lost to parties to the left of us. So, I think suggesting that what we need to do is to move to the right is irrational in the face of the electorate,\" he said.\n\nLabour sought to dispel suggestions it would consider a coalition with the SNP after the next election.\n\nPat McFadden, the party's national campaign co-ordinator, said: \"Our aim is to win a majority, to govern, to meet the mood for change, and we're not planning any alliances or pacts with anyone.\"\n\nThe West Midlands result was a shock defeat for the Conservatives, with Lord Ben Houchen the sole remaining Tory mayor, in Tees Valley.\n\nLabour dominated other mayoral contests across England, including in London and Greater Manchester, and took a Tory scalp by winning the Blackpool South by-election.\n\nWith the results of all 107 councils in England that held elections on May 2 declared, Labour has won 1,158 seats, an increase of more than 232.\n\nThe Liberal Democrats beat the Tories into second place, winning 552 seats, up by about 100, a result hailed by party leader Sir Ed Davey as \"stunning\".", "source": {"uri": "thenationalnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The National"}, "authors": [{"uri": "gillian_duncan@thenationalnews.com",

We are the only party that has a plan to deliver on the priorities of the people.\"\n\nFormer home secretary Suella Braverman urged the Prime Minister to change course rightwards to win back voters.\n\nBut she said a change of leadership was not a \"feasible prospect\", adding: \"There is no superman or superwoman out there who can do it.\"\n\nAmong the measures Braverman has urged the Prime Minister to adopt to win back voters are further tax cuts and a cap on legal migration.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTory grandee John Hayes signalled the Prime Minister should reshuffle his Cabinet, with his close ally Braverman as a voice at the table for what he called the \"authentic Tory part of the Conservative Party\".\n\nBut Conservative moderates warned against Sunak lurching rightwards, with outgoing West Midlands mayor Andy Street claiming after his loss that \"winning from that centre ground is what happens\".\n\nDamian Green, chairman of the One Nation Group of Tory moderates, made a similar plea on the BBC's Westminster Hour.\n\n\"I would just observe the seats that we have lost in the past few days - we lost to parties to the left of us. So I think suggesting that what we need to do is to move to the right is irrational in the face of the electorate,\" he said.\n\nLabour sought to dispel suggestions it would consider a coalition with the SNP after the next election.\n\nPat McFadden, the party's national campaign co-ordinator, said: \"Our aim is to win a majority, to govern, to meet the mood for change, and we're not planning any alliances or pacts with anyone.\"\n\nThe West Midlands result was a shock defeat for the Conservatives, with Lord Ben Houchen the sole remaining Tory mayor, in Tees Valley.\n\nLabour dominated other mayoral contests across England, including in London and Greater Manchester, and took a Tory scalp by winning the Blackpool South by-election.\n\nWith the results of all 107 councils in England that held elections on May 2 declared, Labour has won 1,158 seats, an increase of more than 232.\n\nThe Liberal Democrats beat the Tories into second place, winning 552 seats, up nearly 100, a result hailed by party leader Sir Ed Davey as \"stunning\".\n\nThe Tories are just behind on 515 seats, down nearly 400.", "source": {"uri": "thejournal.ie", "dataType": "news", "title": "TheJournal.ie"},

However, smaller parties and independent candidates tend to do better in local elections.\n\nIt also does not take account of what could happen in Scotland, instead using the results of the 2019 general election, while Labour are expected to do much better there this year.\n\nChallenged over his suggestion there could be a hung Parliament, Mr Sunak said: \"The independent analysis shows that whilst of course this was a disappointing weekend for us, that the result of the next general election isn't a foregone conclusion and indeed actually is closer than, or the situation is closer than, many people are saying - or indeed some of the opinion polls are predicting.\n\n\"And that's why I'm absolutely determined to fight incredibly hard for what I believe and for the future country that I want to build, and that's what I'm going to do.\"\n\nOne MP argued talk of hung Parliament was \"delusional\" and said the Tories would be lucky to win more than 200 seats out of 650 at the general election.\n\nJeremy Corbyn won 202 seats in Labour's drubbing in 2019.\n\nOthers are more pessimistic and think the number of Tory MPs could be similar to 1997, when John Major returned just 165.\n\nEven among those who think a hung parliament is possible, few are arguing the Conservatives have much chance of being the biggest party.\n\nOne former cabinet minister, themselves facing a challenge to keep their seat, said the case to voters would be they should vote Conservative to stop a Labour landslide.\n\nThe prime minister's job in the next few days will be to try and rally his party and persuade them all is not lost.\n\nBut as has been the case for some time now, there is still an active debate about what the party should do next.\n\nFormer Prime Minister Liz Truss is among those arguing privately that changing the leader would be mad but that the Conservatives need to offer \"fundamental reform\" - policy, not personnel.\n\nThere are figures on the right of the party agitating, and calls for the Conservatives to back leaving the European Convention on Human Rights.\n\nSome want a radical reshuffle or more moves to cut taxes.\n\nSome have suggested finding more wedge issues to highlight differences with Labour on cultural issues.\n\nHome Secretary Suella Braverman is among those urging the prime minister to change course and adopt more right-wing policies, although she argued it would be \"impossible\" to change leaders so close to a general election.\n\nBut those in the centrist One Nation group agree with Andy Street, who lost the West Midlands mayoral contest by just 1,508 votes, that the party should focus on \"moderate, inclusive, tolerant Conservatism\".", "source": {"uri": "ca.news.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"},

Some are motivated by their own self interest and patronage Rishi has. Some are deluded and some have just given up and don't think anything will make any difference and it would be just as bad if not worse with a new leader.\"\n\nAnd another told this paper: \"I think there is some concern that there is no clear candidate.\n\n\"Concern someone like Penny Mordaunt could get it and is unsound.\n\n\"The further damage that changing again could do and some are holding onto shreds of silver linings in the local election results in their areas.\"\n\nAnother said: \"Most of my colleagues are spineless cowards. And have given up trying to stop a Labour government. It's maddening. Most of them won't be back in Parliament.\"\n\nIn a bid to punch the Tory bruise, Reform UK leader Richard Tice said the PM's presentation to MPs appears to be an attempt to \"persuade Tory voters\" not to back his and Nigel Farage's right-wing challenger party.\n\nThe row erupted as Mr Sunak claimed that, while the Conservatives will lose the general election, Labour will fail to win an outright majority and Britain will be left with a hung parliament.\n\nOne Tory MP described the suggestion as \"wishful thinking\", while Labour Party chairman Anneliese Dodds said it was \"extraordinary\".\n\nMr Sunak pointed to Sky News analysis of the local election results which suggested Labour would be the largest party in a hung parliament. Elections expert Michael Thrasher said that if Labour's seven point local election lead over the Conservatives was repeated at a general election there would be a hung parliament.\n\nHowever, people tend not to vote the same way in a general election where independent and smaller party candidates do not fare as well, and the analysis did not factor in any Labour gains in Scotland off the back of ongoing SNP chaos.\n\n\"These results suggest we are heading for a hung parliament with Labour as the largest party,\" Mr Sunak told The Times. \"Keir Starmer propped up in Downing Street by the SNP, Liberal Democrats and the Greens would be a disaster for Britain.\"\n\nIt is an attempt to revive the message used successfully by David Cameron ahead of the 2015 general election warning voters would face an SNP-Labour \"coalition of chaos\" if they did not back the Tories.\n\nIt also came as Downing Street shelved plans for a summer general election, with an autumn vote now widely expected.\n\nFormer home secretary Suella Braverman has urged the prime minister to embrace more right-wing policies to win back voters ahead of the contest.\n\nBut she said a change of leadership was not a \"feasible prospect\", adding: \"There is no superman or superwoman out there who can do it.\"\n\nAmong the measures Ms Braverman has urged Mr Sunak to adopt to win back voters are further tax cuts and a cap on legal migration.", "source": {"uri": "uk.news.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo News UK"}, "authors": [{"uri": "archie_mitchell@uk.news.yahoo.com", "name": "Archie

The 43-year-old British Indian leader told 'The Times' in the wake of a debacle for the governing Conservative Party, who lost hundreds of local council seats and key mayoralties across England in results over the weekend, that he was bitterly disappointed but determined to fight back.\n\nHe sought to paint a less bleak picture for party rebels, demanding a change of political course to win back voters in time for a general election, expected later this year.\n\n\"These results suggest we are heading for a hung parliament with Labour as the largest party,\" Sunak told the newspaper.\n\n\"[Labour Leader] Keir Starmer propped up in Downing Street by the SNP [Scottish National Party], Liberal Democrats and the Greens would be a disaster for Britain. The country doesn't need more political horse-trading, but action. We are the only party with a plan to deliver on the priorities of the people,\" he insisted.\n\nHe went on to acknowledge the frustration of the voters because of a tough few years due to a cost-of-living crisis and soaring household bills, which had made them less inclined to vote for Tory councillors and mayors in the polls last Thursday.\n\n\"I know the last few years have been tough, and I understand why people are frustrated. Losing good Conservative councillors and a mayor as fantastic as Andy Street who has done so much good for the West Midlands is of course bitterly disappointing. But I am determined to show people that we are delivering for them, and standing up for our values,\" he said.\n\nAfter the final votes were counted on Sunday, the Tories had lost control of 10 councils and more than 470 council seats. They also lost 10 Police and Crime Commissioners, with most of the gains made by Labour and the Lib Dems who pushed the Tories to the third position.\n\nIn an apparent message for the rebellious voices from the Conservative backbenches, being led by former home secretary Suella Braverman who has demanded the Prime Minister move on from \"managerialism\" and show strong leadership, Sunak added: \"There's work to do and more progress to be made and I am determined that we will come together as a party and show the British people we are delivering for them.\"\n\nSunak's comments on a hung Parliament reflect analysis by leading psephologist Professor Michael Thrasher for 'Sky News', which suggested Labour would win 294 seats at a general election, short of the 326 for a majority.\n\nThe projection, which some other polling experts have dismissed, used the local election results to project a nationwide estimate of vote share at a general election.\n\nIt assumes everyone would vote the same way at a general election as in last week's local elections when smaller parties and Independent candidates tend to do better in local elections. It also does not consider what could happen in Scotland, instead using the results of the 2019 general election, while Labour is expected to do much better there this year.\n\nHowever, polling expert Professor Sir John Curtice told the BBC winning more seats in Scotland on its own probably would not be enough to secure a majority for Labour.\n\nMeanwhile, Sunak has averted any immediate threat to his leadership, as there is little appetite among the rebels in his camp to unleash another upheaval ahead of a general election - now around the corner and expected any time in the second half of the year.", "source": {"uri": "timesofindia.indiatimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Times of India"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rishi_Sunak", "type":

Some are motivated by their own self interest and patronage Rishi has. Some are deluded and some have just given up and don't think anything will make any difference and it would be just as bad if not worse with a new leader.\"\n\nAnd another told this paper: \"I think there is some concern that there is no clear candidate.\n\n\"Concern someone like Penny Mordaunt could get it and is unsound.\n\n\"The further damage that changing again could do and some are holding onto shreds of silver linings in the local election results in their areas.\"\n\nAnother said: \"Most of my colleagues are spineless cowards. And have given up trying to stop a Labour government. It's maddening. Most of them won't be back in Parliament.\"\n\nIn a bid to punch the Tory bruise, Reform UK leader Richard Tice said the PM's presentation to MPs appears to be an attempt to \"persuade Tory voters\" not to back his and Nigel Farage's right-wing challenger party.\n\nThe row erupted as Mr Sunak claimed that, while the Conservatives will lose the general election, Labour will fail to win an outright majority and Britain will be left with a hung parliament.\n\nOne Tory MP described the suggestion as \"wishful thinking\", while Labour Party chairman Anneliese Dodds said it was \"extraordinary\".\n\nMr Sunak pointed to Sky News analysis of the local election results which suggested Labour would be the largest party in a hung parliament. Elections expert Michael Thrasher said that if Labour's seven point local election lead over the Conservatives was repeated at a general election there would be a hung parliament.\n\nHowever, people tend not to vote the same way in a general election where independent and smaller party candidates do not fare as well, and the analysis did not factor in any Labour gains in Scotland off the back of ongoing SNP chaos.\n\n\"These results suggest we are heading for a hung parliament with Labour as the largest party,\" Mr Sunak told The Times. \"Keir Starmer propped up in Downing Street by the SNP, Liberal Democrats and the Greens would be a disaster for Britain.\"\n\nIt is an attempt to revive the message used successfully by David Cameron ahead of the 2015 general election warning voters would face an SNP-Labour \"coalition of chaos\" if they did not back the Tories.\n\nIt also came as Downing Street shelved plans for a summer general election, with an autumn vote now widely expected.\n\nFormer home secretary Suella Braverman has urged the prime minister to embrace more right-wing policies to win back voters ahead of the contest.\n\nBut she said a change of leadership was not a \"feasible prospect\", adding: \"There is no superman or superwoman out there who can do it.\"\n\nAmong the measures Ms Braverman has urged Mr Sunak to adopt to win back voters are further tax cuts and a cap on legal migration.", "source": {"uri": "independent.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Independent"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Keir Starmer propped up in Downing Street by the SNP, Liberal Democrats and the Greens would be a disaster for Britain.\"\n\nThe claim is a repeat of the campaign run successfully in 2015 against a co-called \"coalition of chaos\" which Tories said would see Ed Miliband propped up in power by the Scottish National Party.\n\nIt was based on an assessment by academics Colin Rallings and Michael Thrasher, who used the local election results to forecast the outcome of a general election in which all voters acted in the same way as they did at the locals - concluding that Labour would fall 32 seats short of a majority in Parliament.\n\nBut elections expert Sir John Curtice cautioned: \"The way that people vote in local elections doesn't necessarily exactly mirror the way that they would vote in a general election at least in terms of levels of support, and particularly the Liberal Democrats have long since done better. And it tends to be Labour that suffer more as a result.\"\n\nBoth the Lib Dems and the Greens outperformed their showing in opinion polls - suggesting there may be a large pool of people who will back the smaller parties at a local level but vote Labour when it comes to the general election, in order to get the Tories out of power.\n\nHealth minister Maria Caulfield claimed the Conservatives could take heart from the difference between local elections and national ones, telling Sky News: \"It's always difficult when you've been in Government and voters can send a message to a party in Government that they're unhappy about certain things with the safe knowledge that they still have a Conservative Government in control. It's very different come a general election where they really do have to make a choice.\"\n\nThat has long been at the heart of the Tory election message - that in a straight fight between Mr Sunak and Sir Keir Starmer, voters will end up rejecting the Labour leader.\n\nBut Ben Page of polling firm Ipsos told Times Radio: \"Keir Starmer isn't particularly popular, but it's always compared to what, if you look at how people rate Keir Starmer as best possible candidate for being Prime Minister with Rishi Sunak, he's got double the score of Rishi Sunak.\"\n\nHe said that Sir Keir's mediocre ratings were a \"silver lining\" for the Tories because \"people aren't particularly enamoured with Labour\", but added: \"Next to that is a cup of cold sick, which is basically that people are utterly fed up with the Conservatives.\"\n\nOther problems with the Ralling and Thrasher analysis include that the fact that it takes no account of potential changes in Scotland, where opinion polls currently suggest Labour could take well over 20 seats off the SNP.\n\nAnd any projection based on the local elections faces the problem that Reform UK stood in only a minority of council seats, making it hard to know how much they would damage the Tories in a general election.\n\nSir John told the BBC: \"We know from the opinion polls that Reform are now taking more votes off the Conservatives than Labour is. Reform only appeared in one in six of the wards - so therefore their impact was probably diminished.\"\n\nMr Sunak will continue to argue that the general election hangs in the balance. But unless the polls start to narrow soon, maintaining that message will get harder and harder.", "source": {"uri": "inews.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "inews.co.uk"}, "authors": [{"uri": "hugo_gye@inews.co.uk", "name": "Hugo Gye", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberal_Democrats_(UK)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Liberal Democrats (UK)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rishi_Sunak", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rishi Sunak"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keir_Starmer", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Keir Starmer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hung_parliament", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hung parliament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labour_Party_(UK)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Labour Party (UK)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservative_Party_(UK)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Conservative Party (UK)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/February_1974_United_Kingdom_general_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "February 1974 United Kingdom general election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottish_National_Party", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Scottish National Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Greens", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Australian Greens"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1970_United_Kingdom_general_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "1970 United Kingdom general election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ed_Miliband", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ed Miliband"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coalition_government", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Coalition government"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "General election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Downing_Street", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Downing Street"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maria_Caulfield", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Maria Caulfield"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Curtice", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "John Curtice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliament_of_the_United_Kingdom", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Parliament of the United Kingdom"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sky_News", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sky News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opinion_poll", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Opinion poll"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reform_UK", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Reform UK"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leader_of_the_Labour_Party_(UK)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Leader of the Labour Party (UK)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "BBC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scotland", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Scotland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Scotland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns_and_Elections", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns and Elections", "wgt": 27}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Conservatism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Conservatism", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Government/Parliaments_and_Legislatures", "label": "dmoz/Society/Government/Parliaments and Legislatures", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Online_Issues_Polls", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Online Issues Polls", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 96}], "image": "https://wp.inews.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/SEI_202461879.jpg?w=1200&h=675&crop=1", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9542201", "eventUri": "eng-9542201", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1529411764705882, "wgt": 187, "relevance": 1}

After the final votes were counted on Sunday, the Tories had lost control of 10 councils, more than 470 council seats and a totemic loss of West Midlands mayor Andy Street.\n\nThe party also lost 10 Police and Crime Commissioners to Labour, marking a potentially significant blow for the Conservatives if they aim to centre their next general election campaign on law and order.\n\nAppearing to concede for the first time that his party could be on course to lose its majority, Mr Sunak said the local election results \"suggest we are heading for a hung parliament with Labour as the largest party\".\n\nThe prime minister told The Times: \"Keir Starmer propped up in Downing Street by the SNP, Liberal Democrats and the Greens would be a disaster for Britain.\n\n\"The country does not need more political horse trading, but action.\"\n\nHe added: \"There is work to do and more progress to be made and I am determined that we will come together as a party and show the British people we are delivering for them.\"\n\nHis comments reflect analysis by leading psephologist Prof Michael Thrasher for Sky News - which suggested Labour would win 294 seats at a general election.\n\nThe projection, which has been dismissed by some polling experts, used the local election results to project a nationwide estimate of vote share at a general election.\n\nIt assumes everyone would vote in the same way at a general election as they did in last week's local elections, when smaller parties and independent candidates tend to do better in local elections.\n\nIt also does not take account of what could happen in Scotland, instead using the results of the 2019 general election, while Labour are expected to do much better there this year.\n\nPolling expert Prof Sir John Curtice said winning more seats in Scotland on its own probably would not be enough to secure a majority for Labour.\n\nHowever, he told the BBC the impact of Reform UK was \"diminished\" in the local elections as they only stood in one in six wards.\n\nWhere they did stand, the Conservative vote fell significantly, suggesting the party could have a greater impact in a general election, where they have pledged to field candidates in every seat across England, Scotland and Wales.\n\nHealth Minister Maria Caulfield acknowledged there were \"caveats\" around the projection.\n\nHowever, she claimed last week's results showed former Conservative voters were staying at home, rather than switching to Labour, and \"they want a reason to vote for us\".\n\nLabour has denied it is planning alliances with other parties in order to form a government at the next general election, expected in the second half of this year.\n\nSpeaking on BBC's Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg, Labour's election co-ordination Pat McFadden said there was now a \"sense of belief\" that his party could win.\n\nHe hailed the \"tremendous\" election results for the party, especially winning the West Midlands mayoral race which he said was \"beyond our expectations\".\n\nSpeaking on Sunday, former Home Secretary Suella Braverman said Mr Sunak's plan was \"not working\".\n\n\"There is no disguising the fact these have been terrible election results for the Conservatives,\" Mrs Braverman told the BBC.\n\nMr Sunak must \"change course\" towards more right-wing policies in order to win back Tory voters who are \"on strike\", she added.\n\nAlthough a frequent critic of the prime minister, Mrs Braverman did not call for Mr Sunak's replacement, arguing it would be \"impossible\" to change leaders so close to a general election.\n\nMrs Braverman is among several conservative voices who have come out to advocate for a rightward policy shift in light of the bleak local election results.\n\nMiriam Cates, co-chair of the New Conservatives group mostly made up of \"red wall\" MPs, from the party's 2019 intake, said her party must offer \"patriotism and national security\" to avoid falling into the \"abyss\".\n\nWriting in the Telegraph, Mr Cates called on Mr Sunak to ignore policies that \"serve an international elite\" and instead focus on drastically reducing immigration and reforming planning laws to boost house-building.\n\nFormer lead Brexit negotiator Lord David Frost said he believed it was \"too late\" to save the Conservative Party from \"electoral defeat at the next general election\".\n\nTo save the party Mr Sunak must produce \"more tax cuts, more spending cuts\" and a \"serious assault on the burden of net zero\", Lord Frost argued.\n\nHowever, Damian Green, chairman of the centrist One Nation Group of Conservative MPs, said \"suggesting that what we need to do is to move to the right is irrational in the face of the electorate\".\n\nSpeaking on BBC Radio 4's Westminster Hour, the former first secretary said: \"I would just observe the seats that we have lost in the past few days - we lost to parties to the left of us.\"\n\nConservative Party chairman Richard Holden told the same programme that voters wanted the party to put forward a \"clear vision for the country\".\n\n\"I think it is self-indulgent for us to be talking to ourselves and talking about ourselves at the moment,\" he said.", "source": {"uri": "ca.news.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Elections expert Michael Thrasher had said that if Labour's seven-point local election lead over the Conservatives was repeated at a general election then a hung parliament would be the result.\n\nChallenged over the claim on Monday, Mr Sunak said: \"The independent analysis shows that whilst of course this was a disappointing weekend for us, that the result of the next general election isn't a foregone conclusion and indeed actually is closer than, or the situation is closer than, many people are saying or indeed some of the opinion polls are predicting.\n\n\"And that's why I'm absolutely determined to fight incredibly hard for what I believe and for the future country that I want to build, and that's what I'm going to do.\n\n\"Fight for this country, fight for the things I believe and deliver for everyone on the things that matter to them.\"\n\nTories were shocked by the scale of the defeat, with 472 council seats lost and a dreadful result for the party in London, where Sadiq Khan was returned as the city's mayor for a third term.\n\nThe Independent revealed Mr Sunak has called MPs in for two mini summits with party chairman Richard Holden and campaign manager Isaac Levido, in an attempt to ease nerves on the back benches after the drubbing.\n\nBut a Tory MP told The Independent it was \"wishful thinking\", while Chris Hopkins, political research director at pollster Savanta, said it was \"completely disingenuous\".\n\nMr Hopkins told The Independent: \"Any suggestion that the country is headed for a hung parliament after this most recent set of local election results is either wilful ignorance and a tactic to show Conservative MPs and supporters that there's still something to play for, or a genuine misunderstanding of what has just played out across the country.\"\n\nIt came as Downing Street shelved plans for a summer general election, with a vote now widely expected in October or November.\n\nThe PM has also come under pressure from the Tory right, with ex-home secretary Suella Braverman urging him to change course to win back voters.\n\nBut, in a sign Tory plotters are throwing in the towel, she said a change of leadership was not a \"feasible prospect\", adding: \"There is no superman or superwoman out there who can do it.\"\n\nAmong the measures Ms Braverman has urged Mr Sunak to adopt to win back voters are further tax cuts and a cap on legal migration.\n\nAs furious plotters accused colleagues of \"giving up on beating Labour\" and \"accepting their fate\", the PM invited backbenchers to attend \"local elections presentations\" later this month.\n\nThe summits will be held by Mr Sunak, Mr Holden and Mr Levido. \"Both sessions will be an opportunity for colleagues to provide feedback, ask questions and receive an update on our campaign strategy,\" an email sent to Tory MPs and seen by The Independent, said.\n\nThey come as Sir Keir Starmer faces his own challenges, with trade union leaders warning that Labour cannot take their members' votes for granted in the upcoming general election if promises of a new package on rights have been betrayed.\n\nSpeaking to The Independent, TUC president Matt Wrack, who is also general secretary of the Fire Brigades Union (FBU), revealed that he and other union leaders have arranged a crunch meeting with the Labour leader.\n\nIt follows reports that Labour has \"watered down\" a policy document on workers' rights. This is denied strongly by the party. Trade unions will meet Sir Keir this month to \"compare and contrast\" the list of items they previously agreed with those that have made it into the document.\n\nSpeaking after the local election results, Mr Sunak told The Times: \"These results suggest we are heading for a hung parliament with Labour as the largest party.\n\n\"Keir Starmer propped up in Downing Street by the SNP, Liberal Democrats and the Greens would be a disaster for Britain.\"\n\nMr Sunak's claim about a hung parliament is an attempt to revive the message used successfully by David Cameron ahead of the 2015 general election warning voters would face an SNP-Labour \"coalition of chaos\" if they did not back the Tories.\n\nA slew of senior Conservatives told The Independent after the results that their colleagues are \"spineless\" for not trying to replace Mr Sunak, while others warned that another Tory leadership election would only do more damage to the party's fortunes.\n\nOne said: \"Some are standing down and don't care. Some are motivated by their own self-interest and patronage Rishi has. Some are deluded and some have just given up and don't think anything will make any difference and it would be just as bad if not worse with a new leader.\"\n\nAnd another told this paper: \"I think there is some concern that there is no clear candidate.\n\n\"Concern someone like Penny Mordaunt could get it and is unsound.\n\n\"The further damage that changing again could do and some are holding onto shreds of silver linings in the local election results in their areas.\"\n\nAnother said: \"Most of my colleagues are spineless cowards.

Elections expert Michael Thrasher said that if Labour's seven point local election lead over the Conservatives was repeated at a general election there would be a hung parliament.\n\nChallenged over the claim on Monday, Mr Sunak said: \"The independent analysis shows that whilst of course this was a disappointing weekend for us, that the result of the next general election isn't a foregone conclusion and indeed actually is closer than, or the situation is closer than, many people are saying or indeed some of the opinion polls are predicting.\n\n\"And that's why I'm absolutely determined to fight incredibly hard for what I believe and for the future country that I want to build, and that's what I'm going to do.\n\n\"Fight for this country, fight for the things I believe and deliver for everyone on the things that matter to them.\"\n\nTories were shocked by the scale of the defeat, with 472 council seats lost and a dreadful result for the party in London, where Sadiq Khan was returned as the city's mayor for a third term.\n\nThe Independent revealed he has called MPs in for two mini summits with party chairman Richard Holden and campaign manager Isaac Levido to ease nerves on the backbenches after the drubbing.\n\nBut a Tory MP told The Independent it was \"wishful thinking\", while Chris Hopkins, political research director at pollster Savanta, said it was \"completely disingenuous\".\n\nMr Hopkins told The Independent: \"Any suggestion that the country is headed for a hung parliament after this most recent set of local election results is either wilful ignorance and a tactic to show Conservative MPs and supporters that there's still something to play for, or a genuine misunderstanding of what has just played out across the country.\"\n\nIt came as Downing Street shelved plans for a summer general election, with a vote now widely expected in October or November.\n\nThe PM has also come under pressure from the Tory right, with ex-home secretary Suella Braverman urging him to change course to win back voters.\n\nBut, in a sign Tory plotters are throwing in the towel, she said a change of leadership was not a \"feasible prospect\", adding: \"There is no superman or superwoman out there who can do it.\"\n\nAmong the measures Ms Braverman has urged Mr Sunak to adopt to win back voters are further tax cuts and a cap on legal migration.\n\nAs furious plotters accused colleagues of \"giving up on beating Labour\" and \"accepting their fate\", the PM invited backbenchers to attend \"local elections presentations\" later this month.\n\nThe summits will be held by Mr Sunak, Mr Holden and Mr Levido. \"Both sessions will be an opportunity for colleagues to provide feedback, ask questions and receive an update on our campaign strategy,\" an email sent to Tory MPs, seen by The Independent, said.\n\nThey come as Sir Keir Starmer faces his own challenges, with trade union leaders warning that Labour cannot take their members' votes for granted in the upcoming general election if promises of a new package on rights have been betrayed.\n\nSpeaking to The Independent, TUC president Matt Wrack, who is also general secretary of the Fire Brigades Union (FBU), revealed that he and other union leaders have arranged a crunch meeting with the Labour leader.\n\nIt follows reports that Labour has \"watered down\" a policy document on workers' rights, denied strongly by the party. Trade unions will meet Sir Keir this month to \"compare and contrast\" the list of items they previously agreed with those that made it into the document.\n\nSpeaking after the local election results, Mr Sunak told The Times: \"These results suggest we are heading for a hung parliament with Labour as the largest party.\n\n\"Keir Starmer propped up in Downing Street by the SNP, Liberal Democrats and the Greens would be a disaster for Britain.\"\n\nMr Sunak's claim about a hung parliament is an attempt to revive the message used successfully by David Cameron ahead of the 2015 general election warning voters would face an SNP-Labour \"coalition of chaos\" if they did not back the Tories.\n\nA slew of senior Conservatives told The Independent after the results that their colleagues are \"spineless\" for not trying to replace Mr Sunak, while some warned another Tory leadership election would only do more damage to the party's fortunes.\n\nOne said: \"Some are standing down and don't care. Some are motivated by their own self interest and patronage Rishi has. Some are deluded and some have just given up and don't think anything will make any difference and it would be just as bad if not worse with a new leader.\"\n\nAnd another told this paper: \"I think there is some concern that there is no clear candidate.\n\n\"Concern someone like Penny Mordaunt could get it and is unsound.\n\n\"The further damage that changing again could do and some are holding onto shreds of silver linings in the local election results in their areas.\"\n\nAnother said: \"Most of my colleagues are spineless cowards.

After the final votes were counted on Sunday, the Tories had lost control of 10 councils, more than 470 council seats and a totemic loss of West Midland mayor Andy Street.\n\nThe party also lost 10 Police and Crime Commissioners to Labour, marking a potentially significant blow for the Conservatives if they aim to centre their next general election campaign on law and order.\n\nAppearing to concede for the first time that his party could be on course to lose its majority, Sunak said the local election results \"suggest we are heading for a hung parliament with Labour as the largest party\".\n\nHis comments reflect analysis by leading psephologist Professor Michael Thrasher for Sky News - which suggested Labour would win 294 seats at a general election.\n\nThe projection, which has been dismissed by some polling experts, used the local election results to project a nationwide estimate of vote share at a general election.\n\nSunak told The Times: \"Keir Starmer propped up in Downing Street by the SNP, Liberal Democrats and the Greens would be a disaster for Britain.\n\n\"The country does not need more political horse trading, but action. We are the only party that has a plan to deliver on the priorities of the people.\n\n\"I know the last few years have been tough, and I understand why people are frustrated.\n\n\"Losing good Conservative councillors and a mayor as fantastic as Andy Street who has done so much good for the West Midlands is of course bitterly disappointing.\n\n\"There is work to do and more progress to be made and I am determined that we will come together as a party and show the British people we are delivering for them.\"\n\nLabour had denied it was planning alliances with other parties in order to form a government at the next general election, expected in the second half of this year.\n\nSpeaking on BBC's Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg, Labour's election co-ordination Pat McFadden said there was now a \"sense of belief\" that his party could win.\n\nHe hailed the \"tremendous\" election results for the party, especially winning the West Midlands mayoral race which was \"beyond our expectations\".\n\n\"When people look at the Labour Party now, they can see a changed Labour Party compared to a few years ago,\" McFadden said.\n\n\"A Labour Party that is passing the essential tests of trust that the voters look for.\"\n\nSpeaking on Sunday, ex-home secretary Suella Braverman said Sunak's plan was \"not working\".\n\n\"There is no disguising the fact these have been terrible election results for the Conservatives,\" Braverman told the BBC.\n\nSunak must \"change course\" towards more right-wing policies in order to win back Tory voters who are \"on strike\", she added.\n\nAlthough a frequent critic of the prime minister, Braverman did not call for Mr Sunak's replacement, arguing it would be \"impossible\" to change leaders so close to a general election.\n\nBraverman was among several conservative voices who have come out to advocate for a rightward policy shift in light of the bleak local election results.\n\nMiriam Cates, co-chair of the New Conservatives group mostly made up of \"red wall\" MPs, from the party's 2019 intake, said her party must offer \"patriotism and national security\" to avoid falling into the \"abyss\".\n\nWriting in the Telegraph, Cates called on Sunak to ignore policies that \"serve an international elite\" and instead focus on drastically reducing immigration and reforming planning laws to boost house-building.\n\nFormer lead Brexit negotiator Lord David Frost said he believed it was \"too late\" to save the Conservative Party from \"electoral defeat at the next general election\".\n\nTo save the party Sunak must produce \"more tax cuts, more spending cuts\" and a \"serious assault on the burden of net zero\", Lord Frost argued.\n\nDamian Green, chairperson of the influential One Nation Group of Conservative MPs, said \"suggesting that what we need to do is to move to the right is irrational in the face of the electorate\".\n\nSpeaking on BBC Radio 4's Westminster Hour, the former first secretary said: \"I would just observe the seats that we have lost in the past few days - we lost to parties to the left of us.\"\n\nThe chairperson of the Conservative Party, Richard Holden, told the same programme that voters wanted the party to put forward a \"clear vision for the country\".\n\n\"I want to see lower taxes but they are going to be delivered in a sustainable way,\" he said.\n\n\"I think it is self-indulgent for us to be talking to ourselves and talking about ourselves at the moment. Whenever I go on the doorstep, I would agree with some others who have spoken, what people want to see, is [the Conservative Party] putting forward a clear vision for the country.\n\n\"I think we have seen a lot of that from the prime minister in the last few days: further welfare reform, building up on those universal credit changes which have fundamentally changed the way that welfare works in this county, and encouraging people into work - that has happened in the last 14 years, but we have to go further.\"", "source": {"uri": "rnz.co.nz", "dataType": "news", "title": "RNZ"}, "authors":

The country doesn't need more political horse-trading, but action. We are the only party with a plan to deliver on the priorities of the people,\" he insisted.\n\nHe went on to acknowledge the frustration of the voters because of a tough few years due to a cost-of-living crisis and soaring household bills, which had made them less inclined to vote for Tory councillors and mayors in the polls last Thursday.\n\n\"I know the last few years have been tough, and I understand why people are frustrated. Losing good Conservative councillors and a mayor as fantastic as Andy Street who has done so much good for the West Midlands is of course bitterly disappointing. But I am determined to show people that we are delivering for them, and standing up for our values,\" he said.\n\nAfter the final votes were counted on Sunday, the Tories had lost control of 10 councils and more than 470 council seats. They also lost 10 Police and Crime Commissioners, with most of the gains made by Labour and the Lib Dems who pushed the Tories to the third position.\n\nIn an apparent message for the rebellious voices from the Conservative backbenches, being led by former home secretary Suella Braverman who has demanded the Prime Minister move on from \"managerialism\" and show strong leadership, Sunak added: \"There's work to do and more progress to be made and I am determined that we will come together as a party and show the British people we are delivering for them.\" Sunak's comments on a hung Parliament reflect analysis by leading psephologist Professor Michael Thrasher for 'Sky News', which suggested Labour would win 294 seats at a general election, short of the 326 for a majority.\n\nThe projection, which some other polling experts have dismissed, used the local election results to project a nationwide estimate of vote share at a general election.\n\nIt assumes everyone would vote the same way at a general election as in last week's local elections when smaller parties and Independent candidates tend to do better in local elections. It also does not consider what could happen in Scotland, instead using the results of the 2019 general election, while Labour is expected to do much better there this year.\n\nHowever, polling expert Professor Sir John Curtice told the BBC winning more seats in Scotland on its own probably would not be enough to secure a majority for Labour.\n\nMeanwhile, Sunak has averted any immediate threat to his leadership, as there is little appetite among the rebels in his camp to unleash another upheaval ahead of a general election - now around the corner and expected any time in the second half of the year.

Fight for this country, fight for the things I believe and deliver for everyone on the things that matter to them.\"\n\nThe comments were the first time the Prime Minister has been seen in front of the cameras since all the council, mayoral, and police and crime commissioner results have been declared and the scale of Tory losses were laid bare.\n\nThe Conservatives won fewer councillors than not just Labour but also the Liberal Democrats. They also secured victories in just one of the 11 mayoral contests that were held.\n\nMr Sunak said it was \"obviously disappointing to lose Conservative councillors and a fantastic mayor for the West Midlands in Andy Street\", adding: \"I'm grateful to them for their public service and all their hard work.\n\n\"And look, for my part reflecting on it, I'm determined more than ever to demonstrate to the country that we are making progress on the areas that matter to them and we are going to deliver for them.\"\n\nDespite the losses, Mr Sunak's position as Prime Minister and Conservative leader appears safe after Tory rebels accepted the results were not dire enough to attempt to oust him.\n\nMr Sunak has instead faced criticism from all sides of the the party about which direction to take the Conservatives now.\n\nAsked about the divisions and his response, Mr Sunak said that what unites his colleagues is their collective values, pointing to policy drives recently announced.\n\nThe Prime Minister pointed to tax cuts in the spring Budget and Autumn Statement, Rwanda deportations flights that are due to get off the ground in July, and welfare reforms.\n\nHe also referred to his announcement last month to raise defence spending to 2.5 per cent of GDP by 2030, an approach that means an estimated \u00a375 billion of extra spending to then.\n\nThere was no indication in the short question and answer session with a TV reporter that the Prime Minister intends to change direction, despite the council losses and large poll deficit to Labour.\n\nThe analysis by the two Oxford academics, Colin Rallings and Michael Thrasher, estimated what each party would have got if the local election voting on Thursday had actually taken place across the country.\n\nIt estimated that Labour would have got 34 per cent of the vote share and the Tories 27 per cent - a lead of just nine points, which is lower than polling for the general election.\n\nUsing the local results for a general election prediction is problematic because people are more likely to vote for smaller parties at council elections.\n\nThe analysis also assumed there was no change in the Scottish results since Thursday's voting was only held in England and Wales, meaning the recent SNP collapse was not captured.\n\nThe Prime Minister jumped on the analysis to suggest on Monday that it meant there could be a hung parliament, meaning no party has overall House of Commons control.\n\nBut Sir John, the BBC's polling guru, told Radio 4's Today programme: \"We should be wary of these projections ... We know from the opinion polls that Reform is now taking more votes off the Conservatives than Labour is. Reform only appeared in one in six of the wards, so therefore their impact was probably diminished.\n\n\"Certainly, what you discover if you take the wards where Reform did stand, and look at what happened to the Conservative vote in those, the answer was the Conservative vote was down by 19 points.\n\n\"In other words, once you're looking at places where Reform were on the ballot paper, and as they threaten to be in the parliamentary election, the change in the parties looks remarkably like what you might expect.\"", "source": {"uri": "uk.news.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo

One Tory MP described it as \"wishful thinking\". Another said there was \"an almost irrefutable sense of 'time for a change'\", which no rhetorical sleight of hand will be able to reverse.\n\nOne former minister in Sunak's government said he did not think a hung parliament was likely, arguing the government should instead present a vision and narrative for the coming years \"that hangs our policies together\".\n\nSunak and his cabinet ministers this weekend cited a general election voting projection by Sky News based on the recent local election results, which suggested Labour would be unable to secure enough votes to form a majority.\n\nPolling expert John Curtice criticised Sky's methodology, however, and cautioned against extrapolating national poll outcomes from local results.\n\n\"It's quite long been the case, certainly since the late 1980s, that the way that people vote in local elections doesn't necessarily exactly mirror the way that they would vote in a general election,\" he told the BBC, noting that the Lib Dems, Greens and independents always tend to fare better.\n\nPat McFadden, Labour's campaign chief, downplayed the possibility of Labour forming a coalition with its opposition parties.\n\n\"Our aim is to win a majority, to govern, to meet the mood for change, and we're not planning any alliances or pacts with anyone,\" he told Sky on Sunday.", "source": {"uri": "ft.com",

for the West Midlands in Andy Street,\" the prime minister said.\n\n\"And I'm grateful to them for their public service and all their hard work.\n\n\"For my part, reflecting on it, I'm determined more than ever to demonstrate to the country that we are making progress on the areas that matter to them, and we are going to deliver for them.\"\n\nAsked about the disquiet from within his party about the direction the Conservatives are taking, Mr Sunak said: \"What unites all members of our party, MPs and beyond, are our values as Conservatives and the type of country that we want to build.\"\n\nIn the wake of the local election defeats, Mr Sunak was facing calls to tack both further right and further to the centre.\n\nMr Street called on the prime minister not to drift to the right, telling Sky News that he \"would definitely not advise that drift\".\n\n\"The message is clear: winning from that centre ground is what happens,\" he added.\n\nMeanwhile, former home secretary Suella Braverman wrote in the Daily Telegraph that \"the hole to dig us out of is the PM's, and it's time for him to start shovelling\".\n\nShe called for the Conservatives to take a tougher stance on tax, migration, small boats and law and order.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Listen above then tap here to follow Politics at Jack at Sam's wherever you get your podcasts \ud83d\udc48\n\nMr Sunak said: \"I'm

believe and deliver for everyone on the things that matter to them.\"", "source": {"uri": "uk.news.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo News UK"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

urged the prime minister to move to the right in response to the election defeats.\n\nRishi Sunak must change his political course to stay in power because there is no time to change Tory leaders, Suella Braverman has said following a string of disappointing local election results.\n\nThe senior Tory urged the Prime Minister to move to the right in response to the election defeats, which saw a shock Labor victory in the West Midlands mayoralty on Saturday night.\n\nLabour's Richard Parker won against the incumbent Conservative mayor, Andy Street, by just 1,508 votes.\n\nThe party also claimed victory in the London mayoral poll, with Sadiq Khan securing a historic third term, with a majority of some 275,000 votes over his Conservative rival Susan Hall.\n\n\"The plan is not working and I am in despair at these terrible results,\" former Conservative interior minister Ms Braverman told the BBC's Sunday With Laura Kuenssberg.\n\n\"I love my country, I care about my party and I want us to win, and I urge the Prime Minister to change course, reflect - with humility - on what voters are telling us and change the plan and the manner in which it is adopted. he communicates and directs us.\n\nAsked if she wanted to see a change in leadership, Ms Braverman said: \"I just don't think that's a feasible prospect at the moment, we don't have enough time and it's impossible to someone new to come and change our direction. fortunes to be honest.\n\n\"There is no superman or superwoman who can do it.\"\n\nInstead, she called on Rishi Sunak to \"own\" the outcome, adding: \"Therefore he must fix it.\" \"\n\nAmong the measures Ms Braverman urged the Prime Minister to adopt to win back voters are further tax cuts and a cap on legal immigration.\n\nDame Andrea Jenkyns, a former Conservative minister who submitted a letter of no confidence in Mr Sunak in November, suggested that former Prime Minister Boris Johnson should return to the front lines of politics to ease the misfortunes of the party.\n\nShe told Sky News' Sunday Morning With Trevor Phillips: \"I think now we have to fight Labour, I would like to see real common sense conservatism, honoring our manifesto commitments, I would like to see Boris's return to the frontline of politics, whether it's securing a seat in the next election or being at the center of our election campaign.\n\nTransport Secretary Mark Harper insisted the Conservatives still had \"everything to fight for\" ahead of the general election.\n\nHowever, he would not allow himself to be drawn into arguments over the future direction of the Conservative party.\n\nOutgoing West Midlands Mayor Mr Street had urged the Prime Minister to ignore calls from Tory rebels to turn to the right after the local election results and instead take a moderate stance.\n\nAsked by Sky News about Mr Street's remarks, Mr Harper said: \"What he's talking about there is what I just said.\n\n\"He talks about focusing on the priorities of the British people, that's what you do.\"\n\nIn a statement released after the attack in the West Midlands, the Prime Minister acknowledged that the result was \"disappointing\", but added that he would \"continue to work as hard as ever to lead Labour's fight and deliver a future better for our country.\n\nThe West Midlands poll, which the Tories were on course to win, was seen as a potential lifeline in an otherwise disastrous set of results for the Tories.\n\nThe Prime Minister had hoped a pair of victories - alongside Lord Houchen's as Tees Valley mayor - would be enough to fend off backbench Tory rebels.\n\nLabor leader Sir Keir Starmer hailed the result in the West Midlands as \"phenomenal\" and \"beyond our expectations\".\n\nThis came after his party dominated municipal elections across England - winning in Liverpool, South Yorkshire, West Yorkshire and Greater Manchester.\n\nResults from 106 of the 107 local councils that held elections on May 2 in England showed Labor winning 1,140 seats, an increase of more than 200.\n\nThe Liberal Democrats edged out the Conservatives into second place, winning 521 seats, an increase of almost 100.\n\nThe Conservatives are

Minister must move to the right for Tories to stay in power, warns Braverman", "body": "Rishi Sunak must change his political course to remain in power as there is no time to replace the Tory leader, Suella Braverman has said following a bruising set of local election results.\n\nThe senior Tory urged the Prime Minister to move to the right in response to the poll defeats, which saw a shock victory for Labour in the West Midlands mayoral contest on Saturday night.\n\nLabour's Richard Parker seized victory from outgoing Conservative mayor Andy Street by a mere 1,508 votes.\n\nThe party also stormed to victory in the London mayoral poll, with Sadiq Khan securing a historic third term in office, with a majority of some 275,000 over Conservative rival Susan Hall.\n\n\"The plan is not working and I despair at these terrible results,\" Conservative former home secretary Ms Braverman told the BBC's Sunday With Laura Kuenssberg.\n\n\"I love my country, I care about my party and I want us to win, and I am urging the Prime Minister to change course, to -- with humility -- reflect on what voters are telling us, and change the plan and the way that he is communicating and leading us.\"\n\nAsked about whether she wanted to see a change in leader, Ms Braverman said: \"I just don't think that is a feasible prospect right now, we don't have enough time and it is impossible for anyone new to come and change our fortunes to be honest.\n\n\"There is no superman or superwoman out there who can do it.\"\n\nInstead she called on Rishi Sunak to \"own\" the result, adding: \"Therefore he needs to fix it.\"\n\nAmong the measures Ms Braverman has urged the Prime Minister to adopt to win back voters are further tax cuts and a cap on legal migration.\n\nShe claimed Tory voters were currently \"on strike\", and warned: \"I talk to many of my colleagues who are privately demoralised and incredibly concerned about the prospects.\n\n\"At this rate we will be lucky to have any Conservative MPs at the next election.\"\n\nDame Andrea Jenkyns, a Conservative former minister who submitted a letter of no-confidence in Mr Sunak in November, meanwhile suggested former prime minister Boris Johnson should return to frontline politics to ease the party's woes.\n\nShe told Sky News's Sunday Morning With Trevor Phillips: \"I think now we've got to take the fight to Labour, I would like to see real common sense conservatism, honouring our manifesto commitments, I would like to see the return of Boris on the front line of politics, whether that's going for a seat in the next election and being front and centre of our election campaign.\"\n\nOutgoing West Midlands mayor Mr Street had urged the Prime Minister not to heed calls from Tory rebels to shift to the right following the local election results, and instead adopt a moderate position.\n\nIn a statement released after the blow in the West Midlands, the Prime Minister acknowledged the result was \"disappointing\", but added he would \"continue working as hard as ever to take the fight to Labour and deliver a brighter future for our country\".\n\nThe West Midlands contest, which the Tories were on course to win, was seen as a potential lifeline in an otherwise disastrous set of results for the Conservatives.\n\nThe Prime Minister had hoped a brace of wins -- alongside Lord Houchen's victory in the Tees Valley mayoralty -- could be enough to stave off rebellious Tory backbenchers.\n\nLabour leader Sir Keir Starmer hailed the result in the West Midlands as \"phenomenal\" and \"beyond our expectations\".\n\nIt came after his party dominated mayoral elections across England -- winning in Liverpool, South Yorkshire, West Yorkshire, and in Greater Manchester.\n\nWith the results of 107 councils in England that held elections on May 2 declared, Labour has won 1,158 seats, an increase of more than 232.\n\nThe Liberal Democrats beat the Tories into second place, winning 552 seats, up nearly 100.", "source": {"uri": "belfasttelegraph.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Belfast Telegraph"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

That would be similar to the situation when the Conservatives took over in a coalition with Liberal Democrats after the defeat of Labour's Gordon Brown 14 years ago.\n\nSunak's remarks were his fullest reaction yet to the drubbing in local elections, where Labour candidates for mayor pushed the Conservative out of office in the West Midlands and won a third term in London. Tories also lost at least 473 local councilors, while Labour picked up 185.\n\nSunak must call a vote by early 2025 but is widely expected to favor a poll in the autumn. Waiting may give the economy time to pick up steam after last year's recession, giving voters what Chancellor of the Exchequer Jeremy Hunt has called a \"feel-good factor\" if they vote later in the year.\n\nOfficial data due out later this week is likely to show gross domestic product expanded in the first quarter, confirming the recession has finished. While the Bank of England on Thursday is set to leave interest rates at a 16-year high, policymakers led by Governor Andrew Bailey are likely to talk about the prospect of cuts in the coming months that could ease the strain on household finances.\n\nThere's conflicting interpretations about how results for local offices might play out at the national level. While Sky predicts a hung Parliament, most forecasters expect Labour to win resoundingly.\n\nChris Hopkins, research director for polling firm Savanta, said the results put Labour on track for a resounding victory. \"The disdain the country has towards the Conservatives outweighs any doubts there is over Labour,\" he said.\n\nThe local elections had long been seen as a potential crisis point for Sunak, who has spent months trying to put down plots to oust him by members of his own party, who are worried about a consistent 20-point poll gap with Labour. The results largely confirmed the party's worst fears, although key Conservative plotters acknowledged on Friday that there was little appetite to change leaders for the third time in a single Parliament.\n\nSunak said he's \"absolutely determined to fight incredibly hard\" in the weeks leading up to the general election.\n\n--With assistance from Ailbhe Rea and Andrew Atkinson.", "source": {"uri": "bnnbloomberg.ca", "dataType": "news", "title": "BNN"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rishi_Sunak", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rishi Sunak"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labour_Party_(UK)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Labour Party (UK)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservative_Party_(UK)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Conservative Party (UK)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "London"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "London"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1970_United_Kingdom_general_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "1970 United Kingdom general election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hung_parliament", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hung parliament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloomberg_News", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bloomberg News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opinion_poll", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Opinion poll"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019_United_Kingdom_local_elections", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "2019 United Kingdom local elections"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberal_Democrats_(UK)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Liberal Democrats (UK)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeremy_Hunt", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jeremy Hunt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gordon_Brown", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gordon Brown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coalition_government", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Coalition government"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliament_of_the_United_Kingdom", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Parliament of the United Kingdom"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sky_News", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sky News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chancellor_of_the_Exchequer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chancellor of the Exchequer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mayor", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mayor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gross_domestic_product", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gross domestic product"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recession", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Recession"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Midlands_(county)", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "West Midlands (county)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "West Midlands (county)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Bailey_(banker)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Andrew Bailey (banker)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "General election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank_of_England", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bank of England"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interest_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Interest rate"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns_and_Elections", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns and Elections", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Conservatism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Conservatism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Online_Issues_Polls", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Online Issues Polls", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 96}], "image": "http://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/polopoly_fs/1.2069440!/fileimage/httpImage/image.png_gen/derivatives/landscape_620/image.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9542201", "eventUri": "eng-9542201", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.03529411764705892, "wgt": 160, "relevance": 1}

election.\n\nRishi Sunak has for the first time admitted the Conservatives may not win the next general election but has suggested Labour will not gain a majority, leading to a hung Parliament.\n\nHis comments come after the Tories lost 474 council seats in Thursday's local elections and failed to keep hold of the West Midlands mayoralty, which passed from Andy Street to Labour's Richard Parker.\n\nIn May 2010 when there was last a hung parliament the-then Labour prime minister, Gordon Brown, sought to hold on to power despite the Tories becoming the largest party.\n\nEventually, he handed over power to Lord David Cameron after the Tories hammered out a coalition deal with the Liberal Democrats, which led to Sir Nick Clegg becoming deputy prime minister.\n\nIn return, the Tories agreed to one of the Liberal Democrats' key demands, a referendum on proportional representation, which they lost.\n\nAt the 2015 election, Lord Cameron claimed Labour's leader Ed Miliband would go into coalition with the SNP's Nicola Sturgeon in the event of a hung parliament, and would offer major concessions to the Scottish nationalists.\n\nIn the event the Tories won a majority at the 2015 election.\n\nOn Monday Pat McFadden, Labour's national campaign coordinator, rejected Mr. Sunak's claims and said, \"Our aim is to win a majority, to govern, to meet the mood for change, and we're not planning any alliances or pacts with anyone.\"\n\nThe former home secretary, Suella Braverman, has become one of Mr. Sunak's harshest critics since she was sacked last year and on Sunday she urged him to change course.\n\nShe called on Mr. Sunak to pull Britain out of the European Court of Human Rights, reduce taxes and introduce a cap on legal migration.\n\nMr. Braverman said a change of leadership at this point was not \"feasible\" so close to an election and added, \"There is no superman or superwoman out there who can do it.\"\n\nMr. Street, who lost the mayoral race in the West Midlands, urged Mr. Sunak not to take the Conservative Party further to the right and claimed his successes in 2017 and 2021 had been built on, \"winning from that centre ground.\"\n\nHealth Minister Maria Caulfield appeared on Sky News on Monday and backed Mr. Sunak's prediction of a hung parliament.\n\nShe said: \"It's always difficult when you've been in government and voters can send a message to a party in government that they're unhappy about certain things with the safe knowledge that they still have a Conservative government in control.\n\n\"It's very different come a general election

That would be similar to the situation when the Conservatives took over in a coalition with Liberal Democrats after the defeat of Labour's Gordon Brown 14 years ago.\n\nSunak's remarks were his fullest reaction yet to the drubbing in local elections, where Labour candidates for mayor pushed the Conservative out of office in the West Midlands and won a third term in London. Tories also lost at least 473 local councilors, while Labour picked up 185.\n\nSunak must call a vote by early 2025 but is widely expected to favor a poll in the autumn. Waiting may give the economy time to pick up steam after last year's recession, giving voters what Chancellor of the Exchequer Jeremy Hunt has called a \"feel-good factor\" if they vote later in the year.\n\nOfficial data due out later this week is likely to show gross domestic product expanded in the first quarter, confirming the recession has finished. While the Bank of England on Thursday is set to leave interest rates at a 16-year high, policymakers led by Governor Andrew Bailey are likely to talk about the prospect of cuts in the coming months that could ease the strain on household finances.\n\nThere's conflicting interpretations about how results for local offices might play out at the national level. While Sky predicts a hung Parliament, most forecasters expect Labour to win resoundingly.\n\nChris Hopkins, research director for polling firm Savanta, said the results put Labour on track for a resounding victory. \"The disdain the country has towards the Conservatives outweighs any doubts there is over Labour,\" he said.\n\nThe local elections had long been seen as a potential crisis point for Sunak, who has spent months trying to put down plots to oust him by members of his own party, who are worried about a consistent 20-point poll gap with Labour. The results largely confirmed the party's worst fears, although key Conservative plotters acknowledged on Friday that there was little appetite to change leaders for the third time in a single Parliament.\n\nSunak said he's \"absolutely determined to fight incredibly hard\" in the weeks leading up to the general election.\n\n--With assistance from Ailbhe Rea and Andrew Atkinson.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek", "source": {"uri": "ca.finance.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo!

and Farage leading Tories lurch to the right", "body": "That outcome has become increasingly likely after the last set of UK local council elections were declared at the weekend, which point towards Keir Starmer leading a Labour government this autumn.\n\nBut the results were not so disastrous as to activate a planned back bench plot to unseat Rishi Sunak, with rebel MPs instead leaving the Prime Minister to \"own\" the looming defeat.\n\nFrom now until election day, most likely in October or November, there will be a battle over which direction the party takes to fight Labour in opposition.\n\nA divide is opening among Tories on whether to tack further to the right, with harsher migration and lower taxation to challenge the threat of Mr Farage's Reform UK party, or to move to the moderate centre where elections are generally won.\n\nAn indication that right-wingers are making the first move to take control has come after it was confirmed that disgraced former prime minister Boris Johnson had been in talks with Mr Farage, the Reform UK chief.\n\nWith Reform currently polling at about 15 per cent, with its tough immigration and hard Brexit policies, it looks set to take a considerable chunk of Conservative votes, potentially leaving the Tories with fewer than 200 MPs post-election.\n\nPolitical commentators believe Mr Johnson and others could then bring Mr Farage into the Conservatives to help make it a hard-right party.\n\nAllies of the pair have been in contact with Mr Johnson recently declaring he will choose a time to re-enter frontline politics, likely in a by-election within the next two years.\n\nHowever, a spokesman for Mr Johnson said his main priority was focusing on victory in Ukraine, writing a book and public speaking.\n\nNo mention was made of helping his former chancellor Mr Sunak win the next election but the current Prime Minister at least now knows the threat to unseat him - with any replacement becoming the fifth Tory premier in as many years - have receded.\n\nHe will draw on the few nuggets of optimism from the local elections in which the Conservatives managed to hold on to the Tees Valley mayoralty and did not finish third to Reform in the Blackpool by-election.\n\nA cut in interest rates in the coming months, a further decline in inflation and the first Rwanda deportation flights taking off could all help form a political miracle to overturn the Tories current 20-point polling deficit.\n\nAs Labour secured only 34 per cent of the local elections vote, with the Conservatives on 27 per cent, that led to the suggestion of a hung parliament in the general election, with Labour 32 seats short of a majority.\n\n\"These results suggest we are heading for a hung parliament, with Labour as the largest party,\" Mr Sunak told The Times. \"Keir Starmer propped up in Downing Street by the SNP, Liberal Democrats and the Greens would be a disaster for Britain.\"\n\nHowever, the results did not include Scotland, where Labour should do well given the ruling SNP's current political decline, while independents generally fare better in local contests\n\nLabour was also not helped by many Muslim voters turning against it for its failure to strongly condemn Israel over Gaza, although it did manage to hold on to the London mayoralty, with Sadiq Khan re-elected for a record third term.\n\nLess welcome for the Conservatives was the latest YouGov poll that put them on 18 per cent and Labour at 44 per cent.\n\nThat polling and poor election results, with the Conservatives losing 474 out of 989 councillors, led to right-wing rebels setting out their stall.\n\n\"The hole to dig us out is the PM's,\" said Suella Braverman, the hardline former home secretary, adding it was too late to change leader as not even a \"superman or superwoman\" could restore the party's fortunes.\n\n\"At this rate we will be lucky to have any Conservative MPs at the next election,\" she added.\n\nThe arch Brexiteer David Frost also wrote damningly of moderate Tories in The Daily Telegraph, stating that \"genuine Conservatives must now face the fact that we must prepare for disaster\".\n\nClearly Mr Sunak will have a substantial task to motivate his party when MPs return to Westminster on Tuesday.", "source": {"uri": "thenationalnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The National"}, "authors":

has insisted the result of the next general election \"isn't a foregone conclusion\" and that he is \"absolutely determined to fight\" on after a drubbing for the Tories in the local and mayoral polls.\n\nThe Prime Minister resisted calls from Conservative rebels to change his political course, saying he is \"determined more than ever to show the public that what we're doing is making a difference\".\n\nHe insisted his party is \"united\" on its values as he faced the cameras for the first time since the full release of results, which saw the Tories lose nearly 500 council seats, the West Midlands mayoral race and the Blackpool South by-election.\n\nThe claim was based on Sky News analysis of the local election results which suggested Labour would be the largest party in a hung Parliament, though voters in national polls tend to to behave differently, with fewer opting for smaller parties.\n\nMr Sunak told broadcasters during a visit to a north London community centre on Monday: \"The independent analysis shows that whilst of course this was a disappointing weekend for us, that the result of the next general election isn't a foregone conclusion, and indeed actually is closer than, or the situation is closer than, many people are saying or indeed some of the opinion polls are predicting.\n\n\"And that's why I'm absolutely determined to fight incredibly hard for what

Here we look at some key points of difference that need to be taken into account in any such forecast.\n\nMany polling experts are sceptical of the usefulness of extrapolating a potential national result from local elections. \"It is not an estimate of parties' general election prospects. It is not a poll either. It is an attempt to estimate how locals result would look if everyone in Great Britain voted,\" said Rob Ford, a politics professor at Manchester University.\n\nThe places that vote one year are politically different from those that vote in another set of local elections. This year's local council elections, for example, took place disproportionately in urban England outside London.\n\nAbout half of voters who will vote at the general election did not vote in the locals, and while it is hard to know which way those votes will fall, the national polls, which put Labour 20 points ahead, are generally the best indicator of what would happen if there was a general election tomorrow.\n\nAll the evidence suggests that people vote differently at local elections than they do in national polls, and are more likely to back smaller parties or independents in the former.\n\nThis time, about 23% went to parties other than Labour, the Tories and the Liberal Democrats. But while independent candidates do well in local races, they are rarely as successful in Westminster contests.\n\nThe Lib Dems also tend to get more votes at local elections, picking up 16% of the total this time, which far exceeds their performance in national polling.\n\nLast week's local elections only took place in England and Wales, so Rallings and Thrasher's analysis assumed there would be no change in results in Scotland.\n\nAt the last general election, Labour only won one seat there, a total doubled at the Rutherglen byelection in October. But the party's fortunes in Scotland have transformed amid turmoil in the SNP, which has just elected its third leader in 14 months, and Tory chaos at Westminster.\n\nThis time round, Labour is expected to win a bigger chunk of the 59 Scottish seats available. Senior party figures think they could take more than 20 seats. While that, on its own, would not make enough of a difference, based on Rallings and Thrasher's analysis, to win an overall majority, the Scottish seats would certainly help Labour get closer to the 326 needed to secure one.\n\nThe one race last Thursday where there was more obvious read-across to the national picture was the Blackpool South byelection, the only parliamentary contest on polling day.\n\nLabour won back the seat with the third-highest swing since the second world war. It was also the fifth time in the last year when the Tories have lost a Westminster byelection with a direct swing to Labour of more than 20%.\n\nThe Tories came second, beating Reform by just 117 votes. Their vote share collapsed by more than 30 points, which split more or less equally to Labour and Reform, and prompted nerves at Tory headquarters.\n\nIf the result was repeated nationally, the Blackpool South byelection would result in there being fewer than 100 Tory MPs after the general election.\n\nFor Labour, the locals were as much about where they won votes as about how many votes were won. The key test was how they performed in battleground areas.\n\nIts strategy of focusing resources on marginals, rather than trying to boost turnout in parts of the country where it has big majorities - such as Liverpool, London and Manchester - is likely to be repeated later this year.\n\nKeir Starmer's party will be bolstered by winning the East Midlands mayoralty, as it suggests a recovery in seats including Derby North, Ashfield and Bolsover, as well as by taking York and North Yorkshire in Sunak's own backyard.\n\nWhile the Tories' Ben Houchen hung on in Tees Valley, if the 16.7% swing to Labour was repeated at the general election, it would win all five seats in the region, including Darlington, Hartlepool and Redcar.\n\nIn the final days of the campaign, Labour switched extra resources from Tees Valley to the West Midlands, which is brimming with target seats. It paid off when it beat the Tories' Andy Street by just over 1,500 votes in a shock win.\n\nLabour is planning to target the south of England heavily at the election, after making gains in councils including Crawley, Swindon, Thurrock, Basildon, Southend and Rushmoor, which includes the garrison town of Aldershot.\n\nReform only stood in one in six of the council wards last week, suggesting that its impact at the general election could be greater, with the party leader, Richard Tice, pledging to stand a candidate in every constituency.\n\nIn the wards where the party did stand, the Conservative vote was down by 19 points, indicating that most of its votes later this year will come from the Tories. Labour experienced a slight boost in vote share in council wards where Reform stood.\n\nThe rightwing populist party failed to beat the Tories into second place in the Blackpool South byelection - if only just - and is so far not performing as well as Ukip did in the past. But Tory fears of a return by Nigel Farage to the political frontline could change that.\n\nRishi Sunak is attempting to redeploy the \"coalition of chaos\" attack line, one of the Tories' most successful political strategies in the past decade, which helped them secure a surprise majority at the 2015 election.\n\nBack then, the Tories relentlessly warned that Labour could do a deal with the SNP to gain power, with attack posters showing its then leader, Ed Miliband, sitting in the top pocket of Alex Salmond, who had been SNP leader until the Scottish independence referendum.\n\nAt the time, the opinion polls were pointing to a hung parliament. The strategy was seen to have convinced some voters, particularly those in the so-called blue wall who had previously backed the Liberal Democrats, to vote Tory.\n\nHowever, the best part of a decade of political chaos on the Conservatives' watch since then raises questions about the potential success of revisiting the strategy. From Brexit to Partygate to Liz Truss's disastrous mini-budget, it seems unlikely that voters will be convinced by Sunak's attempts.", "source": {"uri": "theguardian.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

as he insists election not a foregone conclusion", "body": "Rishi Sunak has insisted the result of the next general election \"isn't a foregone conclusion\" and that he is \"absolutely determined to fight\" on after a drubbing for the Tories in the local and mayoral polls.\n\nThe Prime Minister resisted calls from Conservative rebels to change his political course, saying he is \"determined more than ever to show the public that what we're doing is making a difference\".\n\nHe insisted his party is \"united\" on its values as he faced the cameras for the first time since the full release of results, which saw the Tories lose nearly 500 council seats, the West Midlands mayoral race and the Blackpool South by-election.\n\nMr Sunak stuck to his earlier prediction that the UK was on course for a hung Parliament, when challenged over the suggestion.\n\nThe claim was based on Sky News analysis of the local election results which suggested Labour would be the largest party in a hung Parliament, though voters in national polls tend to to behave differently, with fewer opting for smaller parties.\n\nMr Sunak told broadcasters during a visit to a north London community centre on Monday: \"The independent analysis shows that whilst of course this was a disappointing weekend for us, that the result of the next general election isn't a foregone conclusion, and indeed actually is closer than, or the situation is closer than, many people are saying or indeed some of the opinion polls are predicting.\n\n\"And that's why I'm absolutely determined to fight incredibly hard for what I believe and for the future country that I want to build, and that's what I'm going to do.\n\n\"Fight for this country, fight for the things I believe and deliver for everyone on the things that matter to them.\"\n\nFormer home secretary Suella Braverman has urged the Prime Minister to change course rightwards to win back voters, while Conservative moderates warned against Mr Sunak lurching away from the centre ground.\n\nAsked whether he would be making changes, Mr Sunak said: \"I'm determined more than ever to demonstrate to the country that we are making progress on the areas that matter to them and we are going to deliver for them.\"\n\nHe pointed to national insurance cuts, inflation coming down, sweeping welfare reforms, the Rwanda deportation scheme being implemented and the defence spending hike.\n\nHe evaded questions about pressure from different sides of his party, saying: \"What unites all members of our party, MPs and beyond, are our values as Conservatives and the type of country that we want to build.\"", "source": {"uri": "chesterstandard.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Chester Standard"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Our fantastic new mayor Richard Parker stands ready to deliver a fresh start for the West Midlands,\" Sir Keir said.\n\nHowever, in an effort to win back those who had deserted his party over Labour's stance on Gaza, he added: \"I say directly to those who may have voted Labour in the past but felt that on this occasion that they couldn't that across the West Midlands we are a proud and diverse community. I have heard you. I have listened. And I am determined to meet your concerns and to gain your respect and trust again in the future.\"\n\nLabour suffered losses to independents and George Galloway's Worker's Party of Britain in areas with large Islamic populations as a result of the war between Israel and Hamas.\n\nBut the party virtually swept the mayoral elections board across England, winning in Liverpool, South Yorkshire, West Yorkshire, and in Greater Manchester, where Andy Burnham returned to power.\n\nThe Tees Valley was the only remaining splash of blue left on the mayoral election map, where Lord Ben Houchen managed to cling to power despite a huge 14.1-point swing to Labour.\n\nLord Houchen's victory was also mired by allegations he had sought to distance himself from Rishi Sunak and the Conservative Party at large during his campaign.\n\nLosing Street, who is widely respected in the Tory Party and had an impressive track record of bringing investment into the West Midlands, is a body blow to the prime minister.\n\nDespite the drubbing, Sunak urged his party to stick with his leadership and his plan for government. In a statement, he said: \"It's been disappointing of course to lose dedicated Conservative councillors and Andy Street in the West Midlands, with his track record of providing great public services and attracting significant investment to the area, but that has redoubled my resolve to continue to make progress on our plan. So we will continue working as hard as ever to take the fight to Labour and deliver a brighter future for our country.\"\n\nResults are in from 106 of the 107 councils in England that held elections on 2 May, and Labour has won 1,140 seats, an increase of more than 200.\n\nThe Liberal Democrats beat the Tories into second place, winning 521 seats, up nearly 100.

We're working with what we've got.\"\n\nNadine Dorries, a former cabinet minister and high-profile critic of the prime minister, said it would be \"madness\" to try to replace Sunak before the general election, adding that it would make \"no difference\" to the result.\n\nShortly before midday on Friday, some of the Tory rebels gave up and headed for the pub, perhaps fitting given that some believe that much of the leadership speculation was a result of \"three-bottle lunches\" between rebels and members of the press.\n\nTory MPs hostile to Sunak claimed he had been saved by Ben Houchen hanging on in the Tees Valley mayoralty, albeit with a significantly reduced majority that, if translated at the general election, would see the party lose all five seats in the region.\n\nYet there had been no real expectation - despite Downing Street's best attempts to spin the opposite - of Labour taking the Tees Valley. And when the Tories lost the West Midlands mayoralty, a much closer contest, the long-threatened coup still didn't take place.\n\nEven Suella Braverman, whose allies are thought to be behind much of the plotting, admitted on the BBC that the Tories had run out of time to oust Sunak, adding that he now needs to \"own this and fix it\".\n\n\"Let me cut to the chase so no one wastes time over-analysing this: we must not change our leader. Changing our leader now won't work; the time to do so came and went,\" she added in the Sunday Telegraph, before prompting bemusement by adding: \"The hole to dig us out of is the PM's, and it's time for him to start shovelling.\"\n\nThe so-called \"grid of shit\" - a series of explosive interventions designed to further destabilise the prime minister - planned for this week has now been halted, giving Sunak space to try to get back on the front foot.\n\nHis problem, however, is that very few of his own MPs, including loyalists, believe they can win. Instead, they are discussing the likely scale of defeat, amid fears that the Tories could be on course for a Canada 1993-style wipe-out.\n\n\"Like most of my colleagues, I'm resigned to losing now,\" a former minister said. \"I just don't think there's anything we can do to shift the dial. We'll keep trying - we have to - but I'm far from optimistic.\"\n\nThere are still some Tories who believe they can narrow the gap and even deprive Labour of a majority, particularly if the public starts to feel the benefit of economic changes and gives the government credit for it.\n\nThey take some comfort from polling showing there is no great love for Keir Starmer, as well as Labour's own local election woes - their loss of some progressive support and the lack of trust over Gaza now evident in seats with high proportions of Muslim voters.\n\nEven Sunak himself has admitted, for the first time, that the best his party can expect is a hung parliament, with Labour the biggest party. \"Let's not kid ourselves,\" the Tory former minister added. \"It's now about the scale of losses.\"", "source": {"uri": "uk.news.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo News UK"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rishi_Sunak", "type": "person",

After 14 years of Tory chaos on our screens, is the long-running Downing Street farce finally coming to an end?\n\n\"The main character may change but the plot remains the same: failure, internal division and scandal. Rishi Sunak heads up the latest season, but he's too weak to make a difference...\"\n\nConflix also boasts several other titles parodying popular TV shows and movies, including \"14 Years Later\" (28 Days Later/28 Weeks Later), \"Nothing Works Anywhere All At Once\"(Everything Everywhere All At Once), \"Recession\" (Succession) and \"Broken Nation Street\" (Coronation Street).\n\nLabour also claim \"the average household will be \u00a3870 worse off under Rishi Sunak\", which they equate to six and a half years' worth of subscribing to Netflix on a standard plan.\n\nThe political stunt has since received considerable praise online:\n\nPrime Minister Rishi Sunak, meanwhile, has expressed his concerns over projections that the UK could be heading towards a hung parliament at the next general election, with Labour getting the most votes, but not enough to form a majority government.\n\nHe told The Times: \"Keir Starmer propped up in Downing Street by the SNP, Liberal Democrats and the Greens would be a disaster for Britain.\n\n\"The country doesn't need more political horse trading, but action. We are the only party that has a plan to deliver on the priorities of the people.\"", "source": {"uri": "indy100.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "indy100.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labour_Party_(UK)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Labour Party (UK)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tory", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tory"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rishi_Sunak", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rishi Sunak"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incumbent", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Incumbent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sadiq_Khan", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sadiq Khan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netflix", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Netflix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "London"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "London"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Midlands_(county)", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "West Midlands (county)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "West Midlands (county)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andy_Street", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Andy Street"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_the_United_Kingdom", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Prime Minister of the United Kingdom"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Downing_Street", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Downing Street"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1970_United_Kingdom_general_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "1970 United Kingdom general election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberal_Democrats_(UK)", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Liberal Democrats (UK)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keir_Starmer", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Keir Starmer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Majority_government", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Majority government"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hung_parliament", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hung parliament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronation_Street", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Coronation Street"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horse_trading", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Horse trading"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottish_National_Party", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Scottish National Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Greens", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Australian Greens"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Conservatism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Conservatism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Humor", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Humor", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://www.indy100.com/media-library/chaos-and-decline-labours-new-campaign-video-steps-up-attacks-on-tories.jpg?id=52178486&width=1200&height=600&coordinates=0%2C60%2C0%2C60", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9542201", "eventUri": "eng-9542201", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2010-05-06", "textStart": 640, "textEnd": 650}], "sentiment": -0.4352941176470588, "wgt": 131, "relevance": 1}

He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: \"We should be wary of these projections ... We know from the opinion polls that Reform is now taking more votes off the Conservatives than Labour is. Reform only appeared in one in six of the wards, so therefore their impact was probably diminished.\n\nGeneral election voting behaviour\n\n\"Certainly what you discover if you take the wards where Reform did stand, and look at what happened to the Conservative vote in those, the answer was the Conservative vote was down by 19 points... In other words, once you're looking at places where Reform were on the ballot paper and as they threaten to be in the parliamentary election, the change in the parties looks remarkably like what you might expect.\"\n\nSir John argued voting behaviour in local elections often differed from general elections, pointing to the Liberal Democrats and the Green Party regularly outperforming their national performances at council level.\n\nHe also noted that while the current polling picture in Scotland \"wouldn't make enough of a difference on its own\" to help Labour win a parliamentary majority of 326 seats, the Rallings-and-Thrasher analysis failed to consider the collapse in support for the Scottish National Party.\n\nThe political science professor said his own analysis showed a nine-point Labour lead and he could have also mapped the local election results to create a national picture, but added: \"We frankly decided not to do it, partly because we feel that maybe it wasn't necessarily the most reliable piece of information.\"\n\nMaria Caulfield, a junior health minister, on Monday cited the hung parliament projection and insisted it meant there was \"every chance\" that the Conservatives could win the next general election.\n\nTelegraph analysis has suggested Reform could be on course to cost the Conservatives dozens of seats at the next general election.

Here we look at some of the key differences to consider in such predictions.\n\nNational Vote Share\n\nMany polling experts are skeptical about the usefulness of extrapolating potential national results from local elections. This is not an estimate of the party's general election prospects. It's not even a poll. Rob Ford, a politics professor at the University of Manchester, said it was an attempt to estimate what local residents' results would look like if everyone in Britain voted.\n\nWhere you vote one year is politically different from where you vote in the next local election. For example, this year's local council elections were disproportionately held in British cities outside London.\n\nAbout half of the voters who will vote in a general election did not vote locally, and while it is difficult to know which way that vote will fall, national opinion polls, which generally put Labor 20 points ahead, are the best indicator of anything. If there was a general election tomorrow, this would have happened.\n\nsmall party\n\nAll evidence suggests that people vote differently in local elections than in national polls, and are more likely to support smaller parties or independents in the former.\n\nThis time around 23% were involved in a political party other than Labour, the Conservatives or the Liberal Democrats. However, while independent candidates do well in local primaries, they rarely succeed in Westminster primaries.\n\nThe Liberal Democrats also tend to win more votes in local elections, this time taking 16% of the total vote, far exceeding their performance in national opinion polls.\n\nThe Granite City\n\nBecause last week's local elections were held only in England and Wales, Rallings and Thrashers' analysis assumed there would be no change to the results in Scotland.\n\nAt the last general election Labor won just one seat, and October's Rutherglen by-election doubled its total. But the party's fortunes in Scotland changed amid turmoil in the SNP, which elected its third leader in 14 months, and Tory turmoil in Westminster.\n\nThis time Labor is expected to win more of Scotland's 59 seats. Senior party figures believe they could win 20 or more seats. Rallings and Thrashers' analysis shows that while that alone would not make a big enough difference to secure an overall majority, the Scottish seat would certainly help Labor get closer to the 326 needed to win one seat.\n\nBlackpool South by-election\n\nThe race where the national picture was more evident last Thursday was the Blackpool South by-election, the only parliamentary contest held on polling day.\n\nLabor regained the seat with its third highest approval rating since World War II. It was also the fifth time last year that the Conservatives were directly defeated by Labor by more than 20% of the vote in a Westminster by-election.\n\nThe Tories came in second, beating Reform by 117 votes. Their vote share collapsed by more than 30 points, leaving Labor and Reform more or less evenly split and causing anxiety at Tory headquarters.\n\nIf the result is repeated nationally, the Blackpool South by-election will result in the Tories having fewer than 100 MPs after the general election.\n\nSkip past newsletter promotions\n\nOur morning email breaks down the day's top stories to tell you what's happening and why it matters.\n\nPrivacy Policy: Our newsletter may contain information about charities, online advertising and externally funded content.

The key test was how it would perform in a battlefield area.\n\nThe strategy of focusing resources on disadvantaged areas rather than trying to increase turnout in some high-turnout areas such as Liverpool, London and Manchester is likely to be repeated later this year.\n\nKeir Starmers' party will be strengthened by a win in the East Midlands market, offering to win back seats including Derby North, Ashfield and Bolsover, and taking York and North Yorkshire in Sunak's backyard.\n\nWhile the Tories Ben Houchen are holding on in the Tees Valley, a repeat of the 16.7% swing to Labor at the general election would see them take all five seats in the region, including Darlington, Hartlepool and Redcar.\n\nIn the final days of the campaign, Labor shifted additional resources from the Tees Valley to the West Midlands, which is full of target seats. It paid off when he beat Tories Andy Street by just over 1,500 votes in a shock victory.\n\nLabor plans to target the south of England heavily in this election after winning council seats including Crawley, Swindon, Thurrock, Basildon, Southend and Rushmoor. These include the garrison town of Aldershot.\n\nbritish reform\n\nThe reforms only emerged in one of six council wards last week, suggesting their influence in the general election could grow as party leader Richard Tice pledges to run a candidate in every constituency.\n\nIn the party's ward, Conservative support fell 19 percentage points, suggesting most votes will come from the Conservatives later this year. Labor saw a slight increase in voter turnout in reform-supported council wards.\n\nThe right-wing populist party failed to beat the Tories into second place in the Blackpool South by-election, and so far has not performed as well as Ukip has done in the past. But Tory fears over Nigel Farage's return to the political forefront could change that.\n\nUnion of Chaos\n\nRishi Sunak is trying to reposition the chaotic attack line coalition, one of the Conservatives' most successful political strategies of the past decade, which helped them secure a surprise majority at the 2015 election.\n\nAt the time, the Conservatives issued a scathing warning that Labor could strike a deal with the SNP to gain power, with an attack poster showing party leader Ed Miliband sitting in the top pocket of Alex Salmond, who was SNP leader until the Scottish independence referendum. .\n\nAt the time, opinion polls pointed to a hung National Assembly. This strategy appears to have persuaded some voters, particularly those in the so-called blue wall who previously supported the Lib Dems, to vote Tory.\n\nBut the most significant part of a decade of political turmoil the Conservatives have seen since then raises questions about the potential success of a strategic review. From Brexit to Partygate and Liz Truss's disastrously small budget, it is unlikely voters will be convinced by Sunak's attempts.\n\nWhat Are The Main Benefits Of Comparing Car Insurance Quotes

The recent local elections in England have led to a sea change in the political landscape, with the Conservative Party witnessing a sharp decline in public support. The Conservatives, who handily won the last general election, now face significant gains from the opposition Labor Party across the country.\n\nIn the last big test before the next UK general election, all indicators point towards Labor returning to power after 14 years of wandering, while Sunak's Conservative Party has struggled to post significant successes , confirming that the electoral coalition that gave the party a big victory in the 2019 general election has frayed, if not completely dissolved, due to a series of political dramas and the cost of living crisis.\n\nOn the other hand, Labor leader Keir Starmer is finding validation in the election results, claiming a steady recovery from the party's 2019 low and positioning himself for a comfortable victory in the next general election.\n\nHere are five key takeaways from this crucial election.\n\nEven though the Conservatives lost around half of the 1,000 seats they held on the city council and suffered a huge defeat in the special parliamentary election in Blackpool South, a seaside resort in the northwest of England, it appears that Sunak will not yet face a revolt from anxiety. legislators from his party.\n\nThis was largely because the Conservative candidate for mayor of Tees Valley, in the north-east of England, held on, despite a very depressed vote. That helped ease some concerns despite losses elsewhere.\n\nHowever, the defeat of the Conservative incumbent mayor in the West Midlands could cause a fresh bout of nervousness among lawmakers increasingly concerned about their ability to retain their seats in a general election. Sunak is under pressure from different wings of the party to move further to the right or move towards the\n\nOverall, the results show that Sunak has not improved the Conservatives' overall position following the damage caused by the actions of his predecessors, Boris Johnson, who was effectively ousted and then replaced by Liz Truss, whose tenure n lasted only 49 days after his mandate. economic policies have shaken financial markets.\n\nWhen are the general elections likely to take place?\n\nIn the United Kingdom, the date of the general election rests in the hands of the Prime Minister. It is due to take place by January, and Sunak has repeatedly said his \"working assumption\" is that it will take place in the second half of 2024.\n\nAlso read: Why England's local polls are a test for Rishi Sunak's party and policies\n\nAlthough this could theoretically happen as early as July, most conservative lawmakers have indicated that the best time would be in the fall, when recent tax cuts could be accepted by voters, inflation would have fallen further and interest rates would have been reduced, helping to fuel the economy. a factor of economic well-being.\n\nWaiting until the fall could also give the government the opportunity to cut taxes again in another budget. The Conservatives also hope that the controversial plan to send some asylum seekers to Rwanda will have taken off and will be proven to act as a deterrent to those seeking to undertake the dangerous Channel crossing aboard small boats. from France to England.\n\nIn historical terms, Labor has a mountain to climb if it is to form the next government. His performance in the last general election in 2019 was the worst since 1935. Starmer attempted to return the party to the center of British politics after the leadership of veteran left-wing Jeremy Corbyn.\n\nStarmer's approach has worked if Thursday's results are anything to go by. Labor took control of councils in England that they had not held for decades and managed a massive move away from the Conservatives in Blackpool South, which, if repeated in the general election, would lead to a large majority.\n\nLabor won in areas that voted for Britain to leave the European Union in 2016 and where they were crushed by Brexit-backer Johnson, such as Hartlepool in northeast England and Thurrock in the south east of England. He also took control of Rushmoor, a leafy and militarily important council in southern England where he had never won, demonstrating that he has a large base of support.\n\nIt is fair to say that levels of enthusiasm are far lower than those which heralded the arrival of Labour's Tony Blair before the 1997 general election.\n\nThis may partly be explained by a more difficult economic context, but Starmer, a former human rights lawyer, lacks the brilliance of Blair.\n\nCould the election result in a landslide victory for Labor?\n\nIt will be hard.\n\nOne of the factors contributing to Blair's landslide victory in 1997 was so-called tactical voting, whereby some voters put aside their political preferences and voted for whoever had the best chance of defeating the party they favored. opposed the most. In 1997, it was the Conservatives.\n\nTactical voting re-emerged and was somewhat evident in Thursday's election, where Conservative candidates lost to other parties, not only Labor, but also the centrist Liberal Democrats and the Green Party.\n\nThe Conservatives could also be overwhelmed by the right, with the British Reform Party set to field candidates across Britain. In Thursday's election its presence was minimal, but where the party showed up it clearly took votes away from conservative candidates. This was remarkable in Blackpool South, where the Reform candidate almost usurped second place from the Conservatives.\n\nIf Reform, who claim to be tougher on issues such as immigration and Brexit, were to do as well in the general election, it could lead to other parties, notably Labour, defeating the Conservatives.\n\nIs Labour's position on the Gaza conflict a challenge?\n\nIt certainly looks like it.\n\nIn some areas with large Muslim populations, such as Blackburn and Oldham in northwest England, Labor candidates appear to have suffered from the leadership's decidedly pro-Israel stance on the Gaza conflict.\n\nLabour's vote share has clearly been affected, but the effect on its general election performance remains unclear, as seats with large Muslim populations generally have strong Labor majorities.", "source": {"uri": "exbulletin.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ExBulletin"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rishi_Sunak", "type": "person",

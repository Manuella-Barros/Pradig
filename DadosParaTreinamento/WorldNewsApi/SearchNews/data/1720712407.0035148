But, back in the '70s, wearing a beachwear was considered \"bold and unconventional\". Nonetheless, yesteryear actors like Sharmila Tagore, Parveen Babi, Zeenat Aman, and Dimple Kapadia defied societal norms by sporting them on screen. Among the actors, who broke the mould and donned a two-piece bikini in a movie, was Mumtaz, who wore the outfit in Feroz Khan's 1972 film, Apradh. In a recent interview, Mumtaz revealed that she had reservations about wearing it and had almost backed out of the scene due to self-consciousness about her \"heavy Iranian thighs.\" But after seeing the final cut, she surprised herself by feeling confident about her look.

I didn't want to wear a bikini, but I said yes only because of Feroz Khan. He promised me that he would edit out the scene if I didn't like it,\" the Do Raaste actor told Zoom. The actor further revealed that Khan not only made her comfortable but also gave her the confidence that she could look glamorous as the scene was crucial to the film. Mumtaz, who had earlier worn a swimming costume in Roop Tera Mastana, said, \"I wore a bikini for Feroz Khan. I didn't have confidence but he had confidence in me. I had a complex about my typical heavy Iranian thighs. He promised me, 'Agar tujhe accha nahin laga toh main hata doonga' (I will delete the scene if you disapprove of it). I knew I could trust him. If he promised me that he would cut the seen if I disapproved of it, I was sure he would not betray me. When I saw the scene, I felt that I was looking very nice. Later, I was approached by many producers with roles that demanded that I don the outfit, but I said no. Never wore a bikini after that.\u201d View this post on Instagram A post shared by Mumtaz Actress (@mumtaztheactress) The Roti actor has often spoken about Bollywood becoming a progressive place even as wearing a swimsuit today isn't considered a big deal for contemporary actors. \"Everything has changed so much. Today's heroines are so bold. We never used to wear such revealing clothes. Doesn\u2019t a woman look glamorous even in a saree if it is worn a bit low?\u201d she was quoted as saying in an interview published in SpotBoye.", "summary": "", "url": "https://indianexpress.com/article/entertainment/bollywood/mumtaz-says-she-was-self-conscious-but-feroz-khan-convinced-her-to-wear-a-bikini-in-apradh-i-could-afford-to-say-no-but-9381549/", "image": "https://images.indianexpress.com/2024/06/Mumtaz-edited-2-1.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-09 14:27:55", "author": "Entertainment Desk", "authors": ["Entertainment Desk"], "language": "en", "source_country": "in", "sentiment": -0.124}

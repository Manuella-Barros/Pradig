Tell us about yourself, your educational background. I am a graduate of Applied Ecology from Abubakar Tafawa Balewa University, Bauchi. I am the fifth child of five children. I hail from Orsu Local Government Area in Imo State. What was your experience like on the Nigerian talent show \u2018The Next Movie Star Reality Show\u2019 in 2014? Participating in the NMS reality TV show was my equivalent of film school, as I had no formal acting training. It was a transformative learning experience where I met many talented individuals. The competition also helped me build confidence, as I was the smallest male contestant considering my body size, but I proudly emerged as a runner-up. How did you feel when you won the 2024 AMVCA Trailblazer Award? Receiving the \u2018Trailblazer Award\u2019 was a truly surreal experience. I wasn\u2019t expecting it at all, as this award is usually the surprise of the night. But when they called my name, I was overwhelmed with gratitude and joy. I\u2019m so thankful to be recognised for the gift God has blessed me with \u2013 the ability to make a positive impact in my community. As I accepted the award, I couldn\u2019t help but shed a tear or two \u2013 tears of joy, tears of gratitude, and tears of hope for the future. This moment is a reminder that our hard work and dedication can lead to amazing opportunities, and I\u2019m excited to see what\u2019s next. Can you brief us on some of the challenges you faced in your acting career, and how you overcame them? Just like every other career path, acting has its own unique set of challenges, ranging from rejection and disappointment to a sometimes lack of direction and guidance. Additionally, there are times when financial struggles and family pressure can weigh heavily on an actor\u2019s shoulders. Despite all of these obstacles, I have tried to remain consistent and focused on my dream, while also taking time to enjoy the journey and learn as I go. It\u2019s not always easy, but I believe that persistence and dedication are key to overcoming the hurdles and achieving success in this field. I have been able to navigate the ups and downs of an acting career and continue to grow and develop as a professional. You were emotional when receiving the award, can you share with us what triggered the tears of joy? As I said, it was a surprise, it wasn\u2019t expected. I felt seen, heard, and appreciated; those feelings are gold, not necessarily the plaque. In all, God is good, and in His time, He makes all things beautiful. How do you see your career evolving in the next few years? Just as God has taken charge from the very beginning, I trust Him to continue guiding me on this journey. I am a dreamer, and I have faith that God brings dreams to fruition. He takes the seeds of hope and possibility that I plant, nurtures them with His love and wisdom, and brings them to life in ways beyond what I could have imagined. I am grateful to be a part of His plan, and I know that with Him by my side, even the biggest dreams can become a reality. What advice would you give to aspiring actors who are trying to break into the industry? If you are convinced that you have the talent to take on this career, then take it on with all you\u2019ve got and stay consistent. Get comfortable with getting rejections, because you will get a lot of them. Keep evolving, and in all you do, involve God.", "summary": "<div style=\"margin-bottom:20px;\"><img width=\"333\" height=\"465\" src=\"https://independent.ng/wp-content/uploads/Chimezie-Imo.jpg\" class=\"attachment-post-thumbnail size-post-thumbnail wp-post-image\" alt=\"\" decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://independent.ng/wp-content/uploads/Chimezie-Imo.jpg 333w, https://independent.ng/wp-content/uploads/Chimezie-Imo-215x300.jpg 215w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 333px) 100vw, 333px\" /></div>\u00a0Nigerian actor, Chimezie Imo in this exclusive interview shared his experience in the entertainment industry, including a transformative time on the Nigerian talent show, \u2018The Next Movie Star Reality Show\u2019, in 2014.

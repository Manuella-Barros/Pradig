Instead, he'll be leaving late Thursday.\n\nPence is still scheduled to travel to Panama, where he will meet with the country's president and tour the newly enlarged Panama canal before returning to Washington.\n\nVice President Mike Pence is skirting questions about President Donald Trump's Tuesday press conference. But he says he stands with the president.\n\nPence was asked during a trip to Chile whether he agrees with Trump that there were good people among the white supremacists who protested in Charlottesville over the weekend and whether, as the president said, there was blame on both sides.\n\nPence did not answer the questions, but, said \"What happened in Charlottesville was a tragedy.\" He pointed to comments he'd made Sunday night, saying: \"I stand with the president, and I stand by those words.\"\n\nPence also said that, while he's in Chile, \"Our hearts are in Charlottesville\" where a funeral for the woman killed during the protest is being held.\n\nVice President Mike Pence is calling on Chile to \"break all diplomatic and commercial ties\" to North Korea.\n\nPence says he made the request during a meeting with Chilean president Michelle Bachelet (bah-cheh-LET') Wednesday.\n\nHe's making the same ask of Peru, Mexico and Brazil.\n\nNorth Korea has no diplomatic offices or banking institution in Chile, but the two countries do have a trade relationship.\n\nPence says, \"We are beginning to see progress\" when it comes to North Korea, but says that \"much more\" must still be done.\n\nThe Trump administration has been trying to pressure Pyongyang to halt its nuclear and ballistic missile program.\n\nVice President Mike Pence is meeting with Chilean President Michelle Bachelet after arriving in the country.\n\nPence headed from the airport to La Moneda presidential palace in Santiago, where the two exchanged greetings before private meetings.\n\nThey'll also be delivering a joint statement and having lunch together.\n\nPence is scheduled to meet with U.S. embassy staff and their families before delivering remarks at a dinner on advancing prosperity and economic growth in the hemisphere.\n\nPence is on a weeklong trip to Latin America that has included stops in Colombia and Argentina.\n\nVice President Mike Pence's isn't expected to take questions from reporters after meeting with Chile's president -- even though Pence's public schedule had listed a \"joint press conference\" with Michelle Bachelet (bah-cheh-LET').\n\nPence spokesman Jarrod Agen tells reporters traveling with Pence that the leaders had never intended to take questions, at the Chileans' request.\n\nThat means Pence won't face more questions about President Donald Trump's response to violence between white supremacists and counter-demonstrators last weekend in Charlottesville, Virginia. On Tuesday, Trump blamed \"both sides\" for the violence.\n\nPence is on a weeklong trip to Latin America to build ties with the region and speak out against the growing crisis in Venezuela.\n\n___\n\nThis story deletes reference to North Korea in 2:35 p.m. item to correct focus of meeting to South Asia.", "id": "9544023", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-16", "title": "The

The vice president even felt compelled to address Thursday's terror attack in Barcelona.\n\nThe way Pence presented himself in Latin America has helped to further fuel rumors that he is poised to make a presidential run in 2020, as the New York Times reported earlier this month. The vice president vehemently denied the claims at the time, but news also surfaced this week that he launched a personal PAC in May, something no other White House second-in-command has done so soon into the job.\n\nThis week's trip, and how Pence handled his duties, may be an indication of his ambitions for 2020.\n\nSunday:\n\nPence met with Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos in Cartegena, where both commented on the political crisis in neighboring Venezuela.\n\n\"I've told Vice President Pence the possibility of military intervention shouldn't even be considered,\" Santos said during a joint news conference, an apparent reference to President Trump's comment that a \"military option\" was possible for the U.S. in Venezuela. \"The Latin American continent, every country in Latin America, would not favor any form of military intervention and that is why we are saying we are intent on looking into other measures, some of which are already underway and others to be implemented in the future.\"\n\nPence weighed in with a measured response, saying the U.S. has \"many options\" for Venezuela and that the administration would work with its Latin American allies toward \"a peaceable solution.\"\n\n\"In Venezuela, we're seeing the tragedy of tyranny play out before our eyes,\" he said. \"Venezuela is sliding into dictatorship, and as President Trump has said, the United States will not stand by as Venezuela crumbles.\"\n\nThe vice president also commented on the situation in Charlottesville, calling out the media for criticizing Trump over comments he made about \"both sides\" inciting violence. But Pence also called the white nationalists at the rally to task -- something the president was slow to do.\n\n\"We have no tolerance for hate and violence from white supremacists, neo-Nazis or the KKK,\" Pence said. \"These dangerous fringe groups have no place in American public life and in the American debate, and we condemn them in the strongest possible terms.\"\n\nMonday:\n\nPence visited the Calvary Chapel in Cartagena, where he met with faith leaders and Venezuelan families. His wife, Karen Pence, helped lead a prayer circle, where she prayed for \"comfort to the Venezuelan refugees.\"\n\nThe vice president and his wife also spent time with the migrants, listening to their emotional stories. Reporters were not able to hear their conversations, but watched the vice president comfort several women, including at least one who was seen wiping away tears.\n\nHe said he heard \"heartbreaking\" stories of their struggle for food and doubled down on statements he made the previous day.\n\n\"President Trump's made it very clear we will not stand by while Venezuela collapses into dictatorship,\" Pence said, arguing that \"a failed state in Venezuela threatens the security and prosperity of our entire hemispheres and the people of the United States.\"\n\nTuesday:\n\nPence met with Argentine President Mauricio Macri in Buenos Aires and praised the leader for his \"bold reform agenda,\" hailing the country as a model for the region, in contrast to the downward spiral of Venezuela.\n\nWhile speaking at the city's old stock exchange building, Pence attempted to reassure Argentina that Trump's \"America First\" policy does not mean \"America alone,\" arguing that a more prosperous Latin America will lead to a more prosperous U.S.\n\n\"When Latin America embraces economic reforms, Latin America succeeds and so does the United States,\" he said.\n\nWednesday:\n\nPence headed to Santiago, Chile, for a meeting with President Michelle Bachelet. Although the vice president was not scheduled to take questions from reporters, he came to Trump's defense when asked about comments on Charlottesville that the president made a day earlier at Trump Tower.\n\nWhen asked whether he agrees with Trump that there were good people among the white supremacists who protested in Charlottesville and whether, as the president said, there was blame on both sides, Pence said, \"What happened in Charlottesville was a tragedy.\" He pointed to comments he'd made Sunday night, saying: \"I stand with the president, and I stand by those words.\"\n\nEarlier in the day, Pence also called on Chile to \"break all diplomatic and commercial ties\" with North Korea.\n\nThe vice president also announced he would cut his trip short by one day, so he can attend a meeting at Camp David on Friday with Trump and the president's national security team.\n\nThursday:\n\nThe vice president made Panama the final stop on his tour. He visited the newly expanded Panama Canal after delivering public remarks in response to the terror attack in Barcelona that killed at least 13 people and left more than 80 wounded.\n\n\"Whoever is responsible should know the United States of America, along with our allies, will find and punish those responsible and drive the evil of radical Islamic terror from the face of the Earth,\" Pence said.\n\nPerry Chiaramonte is a reporter for FoxNews.com.

Ivan Alvarado/Reuters\n\nAs the debate surrounding President Donald Trump's response to the white supremacist rally in Charlottesville, Virginia reached a fever pitch on Wednesday, Vice President Mike Pence said that he stands by Trump's words.\n\nPence also announced that he will fly back to the US tomorrow, ending his trip to Latin America a day early.\n\nPence, who defended the president's controversial remarks over the weekend and attacked the media for criticizing them, ignored a reporter's questions about Trump's free-wheeling Tuesday press conference, in which he equated the white supremacist marchers with the anti-racist protesters opposing them.\n\nA reporter asked Pence whether he agreed with the president's claim that there were \"very fine people\" among the white supremacist protesters, whether Pence agrees with the removal of Confederate statues from public squares, and whether Confederate army leader Robert E.

(Erica Canepa/Bloomberg News)\n\nSANTIAGO, Chile -- Vice President Pence is cutting short his Latin America trip by one day to return to Washington for a strategy meeting Friday at Camp David with President Trump and the national security team.\n\nPence also has canceled two scheduled political appearances on Saturday in Virginia -- a campaign stop with Republican gubernatorial nominee Ed Gillespie of Virginia and a speech at the Americans for Prosperity summit. The vice president canceled the appearances to make himself available over the weekend to work on national security matters, according to aides.\n\nPence was scheduled to spend most of the day Thursday in Panama City and remain overnight there before returning home to Washington on Friday. But instead he will depart Panama on Thursday following a tour of the newly expanded Panama Canal, returning to Washington in time for the Camp David session.\n\nPence spent Wednesday in Santiago, meeting with Chilean President Michelle Bachelet to discuss a range of issues, including trade and security. Pence said he pressured Bachelet and her country to take a tougher stand against North Korea, in light of that country's nuclear provocations.\n\n\"We strongly urge Chile today -- and we urge Brazil, Mexico and Peru -- to break all diplomatic and commercial ties to North Korea,\" Pence said at a joint news conference with Bachelet.\n\nPence suggested that Chile reclassify Chilean wine as a luxury good to prevent North Korea from obtaining the commodity and converting it into hard currency to fund its military.\n\n[Pence is Trump's global translator, spinning his pronouncements to soothe allies]\n\nBachelet did not directly address Pence's request, though she did state her country's opposition to North Korea's nuclear weapons program. She said that Chile backs six-party talks with North Korea, involving South Korea, the United States, China, Russia and Japan, to find \"a peaceful path to a peaceful Korean Peninsula without nuclear weapons.\"\n\nPence said the United States is committed to bringing \"the full range of American power, economic and diplomatic,\" to bear until North Korea abandons its nuclear program.\n\n\"As President Trump has made clear, the era of strategic patience is over,\" Pence said.\n\nThe vice president added: \"We are beginning to see progress with dealing with North Korea's provocations and pursuit of a nuclear ballistic-missile program, but more must still be done.

North Korean leader Kim Jong Un later delayed the decision to fire the missiles, a move Trump praised earlier on Wednesday.\n\nThe governments of countries Pence mentioned mostly said they did not have immediate plans to break off ties. Brazil, the region's largest economy, opened an embassy in Pyongyang in 2009 while North Korea has an embassy in Brasilia. \"Brazil follows the decisions of multilateral organizations,\" a spokesman for the Foreign Ministry said when asked if Brasilia would break off trade and diplomatic ties.\n\nPeru's Prime Minister Fernando Zavala said in a news conference the country had not been formally asked to break ties by the United States and would evaluate the issue at the right time. Lima, which has condemned North Korea's missile tests in the past, asked North Korea to reduce its embassy personnel a couple of months ago over an unrelated matter, a government source said.\n\nThe Mexican government did not have an immediate comment in response to Pence. North Korea has an embassy and a consulate in Mexico, while Mexico is accredited to Pyongyang from its Seoul embassy. Trade between Latin American countries and North Korea is not significant.\n\nBrazil, the region's largest economy, had just $2.1 million worth of exports - mainly coffee, meat, tobacco and leather - and $8.7 million of imports with North Korea in 2016, according to government figures.\n\nLast year Bolivia, which does not have diplomatic relations, imported $1.16 million of goods from North Korea, mostly machinery, and exported $7,000 largely of alpaca and llama products, official data showed.\n\nChile has a joint arrangement of diplomatic relations with North Korea and China but has not presented credentials for four years, according to Pence. \"I've requested of Bachelet today to terminate that relationship,\" he said.\n\nPence said he would \"especially welcome\" Chile reclassifying its wine exports as a luxury good, which would bring it under the umbrella of United Nations sanctions against the isolated country. Chile is the world's leading wine exporter outside of Europe.\n\nNeighboring Argentina, Latin America's No.3 economy, said it has no diplomatic relations with North Korea. The leftist governments of Cuba and Venezuela, meanwhile, have remained largely quiet on the current standoff, although the North Korean ambassador to Venezuela recently said the two countries were interested in boosting relations.\n\nPence said that there were recent glimmers of hope on the North Korea situation. \"Our administration has been marshalling the support of nations around the world, and as the president acknowledged this morning, we are beginning to see progress in dealing with North Korea's provocations,\" he said.\n\nPence also reiterated recent comments that Latin America \"should do more\" on Venezuela, where over 120 people have been killed since anti-government protests began in April. Trump's comments last week that a \"military option\" was on the table for Venezuela caused shockwaves through the region.\n\n\"Chile will not support coups or military intervention,\" said Bachelet at the news conference. \"In the case of sanctions, we will support any measures adopted by the UN Security Council.\" Pence is on his third stop of a Latin America tour that also included Argentina and Colombia. He said he would end the trip \"a little bit early\" on Thursday after visiting Panama.\n\nFor all the latest World News, download Indian Express App\n\nTags: Mike Pence", "id": "9602039", "details":

The vice president was far more forceful in his denunciation that evening than was his boss on Saturday.\n\n[Pence: 'We have no tolerance for ... white supremacists, neo-Nazis or the KKK']\n\nWith Trump drawing intense criticism for failing to single out white supremacists following Saturday's events, Pence told reporters in Cartagena: \"We have no tolerance for hate and violence, from white supremacists, neo Nazis or the KKK. These dangerous fringe groups have no place in American public life.\"\n\nPence made his Wednesday comments in Santiago following a bilateral meeting at the presidential palace with Chilean President Michelle Bachelet. The two leaders delivered prepared remarks at a news event, and then Bachelet left the room without taking any questions from journalists.

Leaders across the region made clear to Pence that they strongly rejected the suggestion.\n\n\"Chile will do its utmost to support Venezuela to find a peaceful way out,\" Chilean President Michelle Bachelet said Wednesday. \"But Chile will not support military interventions, nor coup d'\u00e9tat.\"\n\nIn Panama, a major financial center, Pence and Varela said they discussed commercial and security ties, as well as drug trafficking, illegal migration and money laundering.\n\nIn remarks after their meeting, Pence said Panama was an \"invaluable\" U.S. partner, and thanked the country for its efforts to seize illegal drugs and partner on border security.", "id": "9797815", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-18", "title": "Pence tours Panama Canal as he wraps up Latin America trip", "image": "https://cmgfeeds.cmgdigital.com/photo/2017/08/17/Panama_US_Pence_Trip_12167_8888890_ver1.0_1280_720.jpg", "extractedDates": null, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-18", "concepts": [{"location": {"label": {"eng": "Republic of Chile"}, "type": "country"}, "score": 2, "id": "45", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chile", "label": {"eng": "Republic of Chile"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"label": {"eng": "Republic of Panama"}, "type": "country"}, "score": 4, "id": "173", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panama", "label": {"eng": "Republic of Panama"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "country"}, "score": 4, "id": "233", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"label": {"eng": "Venezuela"}, "type": "country"}, "score": 3, "id": "238", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venezuela", "label": {"eng": "Venezuela"}, "type": "loc"}, {"label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}, "id": "302942", "score": 3, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump"}, {"label": {"eng": "President of Chile"}, "id": "303186", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_Chile"}, {"location": null, "score": 3, "id": "303245", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_America", "label": {"eng": "Central America"}, "type": "loc"}, {"label": {"eng": "Coup d'\u00e9tat"}, "id": "303506", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coup_d'\u00e9tat"}, {"label": {"eng": "President of the United States"}, "id": "304262", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_the_United_States"}, {"label": {"eng": "Money laundering"}, "id": "304331", "score": 1, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Money_laundering"}, {"label": {"eng": "Rhetoric"}, "id": "304537", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhetoric"}, {"location": null, "score": 3, "id": "304656", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin_America", "label": {"eng": "Latin America"}, "type": "loc"}, {"label": {"eng": "Illegal immigration"}, "id": "305151", "score": 1, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illegal_immigration"}, {"label": {"eng": "Illegal drug trade"}, "id": "305488", "score": 1, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illegal_drug_trade"}, {"label": {"eng": "Dictatorship"}, "id": "308413", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dictatorship"}, {"label": {"eng": "Michelle Bachelet"}, "id": "312410", "score": 2, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michelle_Bachelet"}, {"location": null, "score": 3, "id": "313490", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Asia", "label": {"eng": "South Asia"}, "type": "loc"}, {"label": {"eng": "Juan Carlos Varela"}, "id": "314009", "score": 4, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juan_Carlos_Varela"}, {"label": {"eng": "Camp David"}, "id": "323686", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camp_David"}, {"label": {"eng": "Government of Venezuela"}, "id": "352536", "score": 3, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_of_Venezuela"}], "location": null, "categories": [{"wgt": 100, "id": 164, "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 289, "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Health", "uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Health"}], "time": "00:05:00"}

North Korean leader Kim Jong Un later delayed the decision to fire the missiles, a move Trump praised earlier on Wednesday.\n\nThe governments of countries Pence mentioned mostly said they did not have immediate plans to break off ties. Brazil, the region's largest economy, opened an embassy in Pyongyang in 2009 while North Korea has an embassy in Brasilia.\n\n\"Brazil follows the decisions of multilateral organizations,\" a spokesman for the Foreign Ministry said when asked if Brasilia would break off trade and diplomatic ties.\n\nPeru's Prime Minister Fernando Zavala said in a news conference the country had not been formally asked to break ties by the United States and would evaluate the issue at the right time.\n\nLima, which has condemned North Korea's missile tests in the past, asked North Korea to reduce its embassy personnel a couple of months ago over an unrelated matter, a government source said.\n\nThe Mexican government did not have an immediate comment in response to Pence. North Korea has an embassy and a consulate in Mexico, while Mexico is accredited to Pyongyang from its Seoul embassy.\n\nTrade between Latin American countries and North Korea is not significant.\n\nBrazil, the region's largest economy, had just $2.1 million worth of exports - mainly coffee, meat, tobacco and leather - and $8.7 million of imports with North Korea in 2016, according to government figures.\n\nLast year Bolivia, which does not have diplomatic relations, imported $1.16 million of goods from North Korea, mostly machinery, and exported $7,000 largely of alpaca and llama products, official data showed.\n\nChile has a joint arrangement of diplomatic relations with North Korea and China but has not presented credentials for four years, according to Pence.\n\n\"I've requested of Bachelet today to terminate that relationship,\" he said.\n\nPence said he would \"especially welcome\" Chile reclassifying its wine exports as a luxury good, which would bring it under the umbrella of United Nations sanctions against the isolated country. Chile is the world's leading wine exporter outside of Europe.\n\nNeighboring Argentina, Latin America's No.3 economy, said it has no diplomatic relations with North Korea.\n\nThe leftist governments of Cuba and Venezuela, meanwhile, have remained largely quiet on the current standoff, although the North Korean ambassador to Venezuela recently said the two countries were interested in boosting relations.\n\nPence said that there were recent glimmers of hope on the North Korea situation.\n\n\"Our administration has been marshalling the support of nations around the world, and as the president acknowledged this morning, we are beginning to see progress in dealing with North Korea's provocations,\" he said.\n\nPence also reiterated recent comments that Latin America \"should do more\" on Venezuela, where over 120 people have been killed since anti-government protests began in April.\n\nTrump's comments last week that a \"military option\" was on the table for Venezuela caused shockwaves through the region.\n\n\"Chile will not support coups or military intervention,\" said Bachelet at the news conference. \"In the case of sanctions, we will support any measures adopted by the UN Security Council.\"\n\nPence is on his third stop of a Latin America tour that also included Argentina and Colombia. He said he would end the trip \"a little bit early\" on Thursday after visiting Panama.", "id": "9621798", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-17", "title": "U.S. VP Pence urges Latin American nations to

Trump lit a firestorm of condemnation on Aug. 15, when he appeared to confer legitimacy on white supremacists and neo-Nazis who clashed with counter-demonstrators at a violent rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, last weekend.\n\nSenator Bob Corker, a Tennessee Republican who once considered joining Trump's administration, said Thursday that Trump has yet to demonstrate the characteristics needed to serve in his job and called for \"radical changes\" in the White House. And in the wake of his comments earlier this week, Trump has seen a flood of corporate chief executives abandon him, forcing him to shut down three business-advisory panels he touted often.\n\nRepublican Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina said Wednesday Trump was \"dividing Americans, not healing them.\" House Speaker Paul Ryan and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell tried to distance themselves from Trump's remarks blaming both sides in the violence by issuing statements condemning white supremacy.\n\nYet Pence, a former governor and congressman, has taken a starkly different tone than that coming from most Republicans in Washington, who have criticized the president or avoided coming to his defense. It's a fine line he's walking; at 58, Pence is trying to protect a long political career ahead while maintaining Trump's trust.\n\nThe controversy over Charlottesville may be the biggest test of Pence's loyalty so far. Asked on Sunday about the deadly protests, Pence gave a scripted condemnation on white supremacist groups and racism. In Santiago on Wednesday, Pence called what happened in Charlottesville a tragedy -- a woman was killed by a man who allegedly plowed his muscle car into counterprotesters, and two police officers monitoring the melee died when their helicopter crashed.\n\nPence wouldn't say whether he agreed with Trump's assessment that there were probably some \"very fine people\" in the group of neo-Nazis and white supremacists that day.\n\n\"What happened in Charlottesville was a tragedy, and the president has been clear on this tragedy and so have I,\" Pence said. \"I spoke at length about this heartbreaking situation on Sunday night in Colombia, and I stand with the president, and I stand by those words.\"\n\nAt stops in Colombia, Argentina, Chile and Panama, Pence trumpeted the president's statement that \"America first doesn't mean America alone\" before talking up the importance of free trade. Pence characterized Trump's pledge to \"rip up\" the North American Free Trade Agreement as a process to modernize it.\n\n\"What the world has seen, under President Donald Trump, is an American president who is once again embracing our historic role as leader of the free world without apology,\" Pence said during a joint appearance with Argentine President Mauricio Marci in Buenos Aires Tuesday.\n\nPence returns to Washington Friday morning and will leave later in the day for a meeting at Camp David to discuss troop plans for Afghanistan.", "id": "9816845", "details": {}, "date":

His spokesman Marc Lotter told CNN, \"He's cutting the trip short to do Camp David with the President and the national security team.\" The meeting is scheduled to take place on Friday.", "id": "9556194", "details": {"gpCnt": 4}, "date": "2017-08-16", "title": "Pence won't say if he agrees with Trump ", "image": "http://i2.cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/170816153833-mike-pence-super-tease.jpg", "extractedDates": null, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-16", "concepts": [{"location": {"label": {"eng": "Brazil"}, "type": "country"}, "score": 2, "id": "30", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brazil", "label": {"eng": "Brazil"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"label": {"eng": "Republic of Chile"}, "type": "country"}, "score": 4, "id": "45", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chile", "label": {"eng": "Republic of Chile"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"label": {"eng": "Republic of Colombia"}, "type": "country"}, "score": 3, "id": "48", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colombia", "label": {"eng": "Republic of Colombia"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"label": {"eng": "Korea, Democratic People's Republic Of"}, "type": "country"}, "score": 2, "id": "120", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Korea", "label": {"eng": "Korea, Democratic People's Republic Of"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"label": {"eng": "Mexico"}, "type": "country"}, "score": 2, "id": "157", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexico", "label": {"eng": "Mexico"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"label": {"eng": "Republic of Peru"}, "type": "country"}, "score": 2, "id": "174", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peru", "label": {"eng": "Republic of Peru"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"label": {"eng": "Venezuela"}, "type": "country"}, "score": 2, "id": "238", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venezuela", "label": {"eng": "Venezuela"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "Charlottesville"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 3, "id": "200134", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlottesville,_Virginia", "label": {"eng": "Charlottesville"}, "type": "loc"}, {"label": {"eng": "Twitter"}, "id": "302546", "score": 2, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter"}, {"label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}, "id": "302942", "score": 4, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump"}, {"label": {"eng": "President of Chile"}, "id": "303186", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_Chile"}, {"label": {"eng": "President of the United States"}, "id": "304262", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_the_United_States"}, {"label": {"eng": "Cnn.com"}, "id": "304269", "score": 4, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNN"}, {"label": {"eng": "Journalist"}, "id": "304358", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Journalist"}, {"location": null, "score": 2, "id": "304656", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin_America", "label": {"eng": "Latin America"}, "type": "loc"}, {"label": {"eng": "Mike Pence"}, "id": "304965", "score": 4, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Pence"}, {"label": {"eng": "Neo-Nazism"}, "id": "305262", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neo-Nazism"}, {"label": {"eng": "Diplomacy"}, "id": "305325", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diplomacy"}, {"label": {"eng": "Vice President of the United States"}, "id": "305919", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States"}, {"label": {"eng": "Confederate States of America"}, "id": "305960", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confederate_States_of_America"}, {"label": {"eng": "White supremacy"}, "id": "305969", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_supremacy"}, {"label": {"eng": "Mauricio Macri"}, "id": "310100", "score": 2, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mauricio_Macri"}, {"label": {"eng": "Michelle Bachelet"}, "id": "312410", "score": 4, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michelle_Bachelet"}, {"label": {"eng": "Korean Peninsula"}, "id": "317580", "score": 1, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korean_Peninsula"}, {"label": {"eng": "President of Argentina"}, "id": "320842", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_Argentina"}, {"label": {"eng": "Al Gore"}, "id": "323536", "score": 1, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al_Gore"}], "location": null, "categories": [], "time": "20:04:00"}

She opposes U.S. President Donald Trump's assertion last week that a \"military option\" was on the table to oust Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro from power.\n\nHer words were echoed earlier during Pence's trip by the presidents of Colombia and Argentina. Pence will travel to Panama on Thursday, the final stop of his Latin American tour.\n\nThe reactions of his hosts have forced Pence to soften his stance. While he again cited Trump's threat of military intervention, he also spoke of \"peaceful\" alternatives.\n\n\"As President Trump has said just a few days ago, the United States has 'many options for Venezuela.' But the president also remains confident that working with all our allies across Latin America, we can reach a peaceful solution to the crisis facing the Venezuelan people,\" Pence said.\n\nMeanwhile, Chilean Foreign Minister Heraldo Munoz rejected Pence's request to severe diplomatic relations with the DPRK, in retaliation for Pyongyang's nuclear program.\n\n\"We are not considering breaking off diplomatic ties with North Korea. We respect the request by the United States, but Chile is maintaining its ties,\" Munoz said.\n\nChile has \"strictly applied all of the sanctions decreed by the (United Nations) Security Council against\" the DPRK and the two countries have not exchanged ambassadors, he said.\n\n\"So they are, I would say, very low-level ties, but we are not contemplating breaking them off,\" Munoz said.\n\nPence has called on several Latin American countries to join U.S. efforts to isolate the DPRK.\n\n\"We strongly urge Chile today, and we urge Brazil, Mexico, and Peru to break all diplomatic and commercial ties with North Korea (DPRK),\" Pence said.\n\nBachelet expressed her \"concern\" about the DPRK's nuclear program, but called for stepping up diplomatic efforts to diffuse tensions.",

More than delivering Trump's messages, Pence is repackaging them with a decidedly sober and diplomatic spin.\n\nPeter Wehner, an adviser in President George W. Bush's White House, said Pence is traveling around the world like \"the butler who cleans up the spilled milk and rug stains.\"\n\nKeenly aware of how much Trump demands loyalty, Pence has been careful not to allow any substantive daylight between their positions, even though their rhetoric diverges.\n\nAfter Trump alarmed leaders across the hemisphere by threatening military action in Venezuela, whose authoritarian government has plunged the nation into political crisis and economic collapse, Pence labored to all but erase the specter of U.S. intervention.\n\nAlthough the president reserves \"many options,\" Pence said, he of course wants to restore democracy in Venezuela through \"a peaceable solution,\" such as diplomacy and targeted economic sanctions. \"What the world heard last week in the voice of President Donald Trump was resolve and determination,\" he said.\n\nTrump has enforced strict migration policies, banning refugees from Syria and other majority-Muslim countries from entering the United States.\n\nYet when Pence stopped by a church in Cartagena, Colombia, to meet with a few dozen people who had fled neighboring Venezuela, the vice president said that Trump \"sent me here with a message of compassion.\" He pointed out the United States' \"long and storied history of generosity with regard to refugee populations.\"\n\nTrump has framed his presidency around two words - \"America first\" - a slogan that has led U.S. allies to conclude that the United States was ceding its leadership position around the world.\n\nBut Pence has sought to assure allies, as he put it in remarks Wednesday alongside Chile's president here in Santiago, that \"America first does not mean America alone.\"\n\nAnd on trade, Trump routinely rails against agreements that he believes harm U.S. workers. \"Bad deals,\" he thunders, or \"stupid trade.\" But consider Pence's choice of words in a Tuesday speech to business and political elites in Buenos Aires: \"As President Trump often says, every deal can be improved.\"\n\nThen there is the case of Charlottesville, Virginia. Pence opened his trip in Cartagena on Sunday, the day after a spate of violence in Virginia. At his joint news conference with Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos, Pence was asked about the sharp criticism of Trump for not directly condemning white supremacists.\n\nHe defended Trump.\n\n\"President Trump clearly and unambiguously condemned the bigotry, violence and hatred which took place on the streets of Charlottesville,\" Pence said. Then, using far tougher language than Trump had, Pence added: \"We have no tolerance for hate and violence, from white supremacists, neo-Nazis or the KKK. These dangerous fringe groups have no place in American public life.\"\n\nIn the 14 months since Trump tapped him to be his running mate, Pence has regularly explained and excused Trump's comments and actions - to fellow Republican elected officials and to the national media, as well as to world leaders.\n\n\"Vice President Pence's role has developed into him becoming the administration's top Trump translator - calmly communicating and reinforcing Trumpology to the GOP economic and social base, members of Congress and the business community,\" said Scott Reed, a fixture of the Republican establishment and the chief strategist at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.\n\nWehner, now a senior fellow at the Ethics and Public Policy Center, said he could not think of an analogous time in American history when a vice president has so deliberately sought to explain the president around the world.\n\n\"The fact that he has to do so is a commentary on the sad state of affairs we're in,\" Wehner said. Arguing that the president has \"a disordered mind,\" he added, \"Trump will say what he wants, and any effort by Pence to interpret Trump's comments will come off as an exercise in futility. It will be like trying to piece together a shattered mirror.\"\n\nSome Republican strategists see clear benefits for the country in Pence's adopted role.\n\n\"Credit goes to Trump for extending authority, autonomy and an all-inclusive portfolio to his vice president, and credit goes to the vice president for always, to quote Vice President Cheney, 'salute smartly,' \" said Mary Matalin, a former adviser to Dick Cheney.\n\nGOP strategist Alex Conant, who advised the presidential campaign of Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., said Pence is \"an invaluable asset for President Trump.\"\n\n\"While Trump is inconsistent and unfocused, Pence's presence is reassuring to allies on [Capitol] Hill and overseas,\" Conant said. \"The more Trump listens to Pence, the better it will be for his presidency.\"\n\nDuring a visit Tuesday to Quinta de Olivos, the presidential compound outside of Buenos Aires, Pence was asked by a journalist whether each time Trump \"steps on his own message,\" such as with his threat of military action in Venezuela, it results in the vice president having \"work to do\" overseas.\n\nFor a moment, Pence appeared taken aback by the question. But after collecting his thoughts, the vice president answered by heaping praise on Trump, saying, \"We have an American president who says what he means and means what he says.\"\n\n\"President Trump, in a very real sense, I believe, has brought the kind of broad-shouldered leadership to the world stage that has been lacking for too long, and the world welcomes it,\" Pence said. \"And it's my great honor to be able to represent him around the world.\"", "id": "9584134", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-16", "title": "Pence acts like Trump's global translator", "image":

North Korean leader Kim Jong Un later delayed the decision to fire the missiles, a move Trump praised earlier on Wednesday.\n\nThe governments of countries Pence mentioned mostly said they did not have immediate plans to break off ties. Brazil, the region's largest economy, opened an embassy in Pyongyang in 2009 while North Korea has an embassy in Brasilia.\n\n\"Brazil follows the decisions of multilateral organizations,\" a spokesman for the Foreign Ministry said when asked if Brasilia would break off trade and diplomatic ties.\n\nPeru's Prime Minister Fernando Zavala said in a news conference that the United States had not formally asked the country to break ties and would evaluate the issue at the right time.\n\nLima, which has condemned North Korea's missile tests in the past, asked North Korea to reduce its embassy personnel a couple of months ago over an unrelated matter, a government source said.\n\nThe Mexican government did not have an immediate comment in response to Pence. North Korea has an embassy and a consulate in Mexico, while Mexico is accredited to Pyongyang from its Seoul embassy.\n\nTrade between Latin American countries and North Korea is not significant.\n\nBrazil, the region's largest economy, had just $2.1 million worth of exports - mainly coffee, meat, tobacco, and leather - and $8.7 million of imports with North Korea in 2016, according to government figures.\n\nLast year Bolivia, which does not have diplomatic relations, imported $1.16 million of goods from North Korea, mostly machinery, and exported $7,000 largely of alpaca and llama products, official data showed.\n\nChile has a joint arrangement of diplomatic relations with North Korea and China but has not presented credentials for four years, according to Pence.\n\n\"I've requested of Bachelet today to terminate that relationship,\" he said.\n\nPence said he would \"especially welcome\" Chile reclassifying its wine exports as a luxury good, which would bring it under the umbrella of United Nations sanctions against the isolated country. Chile is the world's leading wine exporter outside of Europe.\n\nNeighboring Argentina, Latin America's No.3 economy, said it has no diplomatic relations with North Korea.\n\nThe leftist governments of Cuba and Venezuela, meanwhile, have remained largely quiet on the current standoff, although the North Korean ambassador to Venezuela recently said the two countries were interested in boosting relations.\n\nPence said that there were recent glimmers of hope on the North Korea situation.\n\n\"Our administration has been marshalling the support of nations around the world, and as the president acknowledged this morning, we are beginning to see progress in dealing with North Korea's provocations,\" he said.\n\nPence also reiterated recent comments that Latin America \"should do more\" in Venezuela, where over 120 people have been killed since anti-government protests began in April.\n\nTrump's comments last week that a \"military option\" was on the table for Venezuela caused shockwaves through the region.\n\n\"Chile will not support coups or military intervention,\" said Bachelet at the news conference. \"In the case of sanctions, we will support any measures adopted by the UN Security Council.\"\n\nPence is on his third stop of a Latin America tour that also included Argentina and Colombia. He said he would end the trip \"a little bit early\" on Thursday after visiting Panama.", "id": "9602324", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-17", "title": "Pence urges Latin American nations to isolate

She opposes U.S. President Donald Trump's assertion last week that a \"military option\" was on the table to oust Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro from power.\n\nHer words were echoed earlier during Pence's trip by the presidents of Colombia and Argentina. Pence will travel to Panama on Thursday, the final stop of his Latin American tour.\n\nThe reactions of his hosts have forced Pence to soften his stance. While he again cited Trump's threat of military intervention, he also spoke of \"peaceful\" alternatives.\n\n\"As President Trump has said just a few days ago, the United States has 'many options for Venezuela.' But the president also remains confident that working with all our allies across Latin America, we can reach a peaceful solution to the crisis facing the Venezuelan people,\" Pence said.\n\nMeanwhile, Chilean Foreign Minister Heraldo Munoz rejected Pence's request to severe diplomatic relations with the DPRK, in retaliation for Pyongyang's nuclear program.\n\n\"We are not considering breaking off diplomatic ties with North Korea. We respect the request by the United States, but Chile is maintaining its ties,\" Munoz said.\n\nChile has \"strictly applied all of the sanctions decreed by the (United Nations) Security Council against\" the DPRK and the two countries have not exchanged ambassadors, he said.\n\n\"So they are, I would say, very low-level ties, but we are not contemplating breaking them off,\" Munoz said.\n\nPence has called on several Latin American countries to join U.S. efforts to isolate the DPRK.\n\n\"We strongly urge Chile today, and we urge Brazil, Mexico, and Peru to break all diplomatic and commercial ties with North Korea (DPRK),\" Pence said.\n\nBachelet expressed her \"concern\" about the DPRK's nuclear program, but called for stepping up diplomatic efforts to diffuse

More than delivering Trump's messages, Pence is repackaging them with a decidedly sober and diplomatic spin.\n\nPeter Wehner, an adviser in President George W. Bush's White House, said Pence is traveling around the world like \"the butler who cleans up the spilled milk and rug stains.\"\n\nKeenly aware of how much Trump demands loyalty, Pence has been careful not to allow any substantive daylight between their positions, even though their rhetoric diverges.\n\nVice President Pence said in Buenos Aires, Aug. 15, he was confident of reaching a \"peaceable\" solution for Venezuela with economic and diplomatic pressure on the Maduro regime. (Reuters)\n\nAfter Trump alarmed leaders across the hemisphere by threatening military action in Venezuela, whose authoritarian government has plunged the nation into political crisis and economic collapse, Pence labored to all but erase the specter of U.S. intervention.\n\nAlthough the president reserves \"many options,\" Pence said, he of course wants to restore democracy in Venezuela through \"a peaceable solution,\" such as diplomacy and targeted economic sanctions. \"What the world heard last week in the voice of President Donald Trump was resolve and determination,\" he said.\n\n[Pence praises Argentina as a model partner while raising pressure on Venezuela]\n\nTrump has enforced strict migration policies, banning refugees from Syria and other majority-Muslim countries from entering the United States.\n\nYet when Pence stopped by a church in Cartagena, Colombia, to meet with a few dozen people who had fled neighboring Venezuela, the vice president said that Trump \"sent me here with a message of compassion.\" He pointed out the United States' \"long and storied history of generosity with regard to refugee populations.\"\n\nTrump has framed his presidency around two words -- \"America first\" -- a slogan that has led U.S. allies to conclude that the United States was ceding its leadership position around the world.\n\nBut Pence has sought to assure allies, as he put it in remarks Wednesday alongside Chile's president here in Santiago, that \"America first does not mean America alone.\"\n\nAnd on trade, Trump routinely rails against agreements that he believes harm U.S. workers. \"Bad deals,\" he thunders, or \"stupid trade.\" But consider Pence's choice of words in a Tuesday speech to business and political elites in Buenos Aires: \"As President Trump often says, every deal can be improved.\"\n\nThen there is the case of Charlottesville. Pence opened his trip in Cartagena on Sunday, the day after a spate of violence in Virginia. At his joint news conference with Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos, Pence was asked about the sharp criticism of Trump for not directly condemning white supremacists.\n\nHe defended Trump.\n\n\"President Trump clearly and unambiguously condemned the bigotry, violence and hatred which took place on the streets of Charlottesville,\" Pence said. Then, using far tougher language than Trump had, Pence added: \"We have no tolerance for hate and violence, from white supremacists, neo-Nazis or the KKK. These dangerous fringe groups have no place in American public life.\"\n\nIn the 14 months since Trump tapped him to be his running mate, Pence has regularly explained and excused Trump's comments and actions -- to fellow Republican elected officials and to the national media, as well as to world leaders.\n\n\"Vice President Pence's role has developed into him becoming the administration's top Trump translator -- calmly communicating and reinforcing Trumpology to the GOP economic and social base, members of Congress and the business community,\" said Scott Reed, a fixture of the Republican establishment and the chief strategist at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.\n\n[Pence vows to end 'the tragedy of tyranny' in Venezuela through 'peaceable means']\n\nWehner, now a senior fellow at the Ethics and Public Policy Center, said he could not think of an analogous time in American history when a vice president has so deliberately sought to explain the president around the world.\n\n\"The fact that he has to do so is a commentary on the sad state of affairs we're in,\" Wehner said. Arguing that the president has \"a disordered mind,\" he added, \"Trump will say what he wants, and any effort by Pence to interpret Trump's comments will come off as an exercise in futility. It will be like trying to piece together a shattered mirror.\"\n\nSome Republican strategists see clear benefits for the country in Pence's adopted role.\n\n\"Credit goes to Trump for extending authority, autonomy and an all-inclusive portfolio to his vice president, and credit goes to the vice president for always, to quote Vice President Cheney, 'salute smartly,'\u2009\" said Mary Matalin, a former adviser to Richard B. Cheney.\n\nGOP strategist Alex Conant, who advised the presidential campaign of Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.), said Pence is \"an invaluable asset for President Trump.\"\n\n\"While Trump is inconsistent and unfocused, Pence's presence is reassuring to allies on [Capitol] Hill and overseas,\" Conant said. \"The more Trump listens to Pence, the better it will be for his presidency.\"\n\nDuring a visit Tuesday to Quinta de Olivos, the presidential compound outside of Buenos Aires, Pence was asked by a journalist whether each time Trump \"steps on his own message,\" such as with his threat of military action in Venezuela, it results in the vice president having \"work to do\" overseas.\n\nFor a moment, Pence appeared taken aback by the question. But after collecting his thoughts, the vice president answered by heaping praise on Trump, saying, \"We have an American president who says what he means and means what he says.\"\n\n\"President Trump, in a very real sense, I believe, has brought the kind of broad-shouldered leadership to the world stage that has been lacking for too long, and the world welcomes it,\" Pence said. \"And it's my great honor to be able to represent him around the world.\"", "id": "9546688", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-16", "title": "Pence is Trump's global translator, spinning his pronouncements to

But in visits this week to Colombia, Argentina and Chile, Pence has acted more like Trump's translator.\n\nAgain and again, the vice president's statements have sounded somewhat discordant from the ones his boss has been delivering back home. More than delivering Trump's messages, Pence is repackaging them with a decidedly sober and diplomatic spin.\n\nKeenly aware of how much Trump demands loyalty, Pence has been careful not to allow any substantive daylight between their positions, even though their rhetoric diverges.\n\nAfter Trump alarmed leaders across the hemisphere by threatening military action in Venezuela, whose authoritarian government has plunged the nation into political crisis and economic collapse, Pence labored to all but erase the specter of US intervention.\n\nAlthough the president reserves \"many options,\" Pence said, he of course wants to restore democracy in Venezuela through \"a peaceable solution,\" such as diplomacy and targeted economic sanctions. \"What the world heard last week in the voice of President Donald Trump was resolve and determination,\" he said.\n\nTrump has enforced strict migration policies, banning refugees from Syria and other majority-Muslim countries from entering the United States. Yet when Pence stopped by a church in Cartagena, Colombia, to meet with a few dozen people who had fled neighboring Venezuela, the vice president said that Trump \"sent me here with a message of compassion.\" He pointed out the United States' \"long and storied history of generosity with regard to refugee populations.\"\n\nTrump has framed his presidency around two words -- \"America first\" -- a slogan that has US allies concluding the United States was ceding its global leadership. But Pence has sought to assure allies, as he put it in remarks Wednesday alongside Chile's president here in Santiago, that \"America first does not mean America alone.\"\n\nAnd on trade, Trump routinely rails against agreements that he believes harm US workers. \"Bad deals,\" he thunders, or \"stupid trade.\" But consider Pence's choice of words in a Tuesday speech to business and political elites in Buenos Aires: \"As President Trump often says, every deal can be improved.\"\n\nThen there is the case of Charlottesville, Va. Pence opened his trip in Cartagena the day after the violence in Virginia. At his joint news conference with Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos, Pence was asked about the sharp criticism of Trump for not directly condemning white supremacists.\n\n\"President Trump clearly and unambiguously condemned the bigotry, violence and hatred which took place on the streets of Charlottesville,\" Pence said. Then, using far tougher language than Trump had, Pence added: \"We have no tolerance for hate and violence, from white supremacists, neo-Nazis or the KKK. These dangerous fringe groups have no place in American public life.\"\n\nIn the 14 months since Trump tapped him to be his running mate, Pence has regularly explained and excused Trump's comments and actions -- to fellow Republican elected officials and to the national media, as well as to world leaders.\n\nSome Republican strategists see clear benefits for the country in Pence's adopted role.\n\n\"Credit goes to Trump for extending authority, autonomy and an all-inclusive portfolio to his vice president, and credit goes to the vice president for always, to quote Vice President Cheney, 'salute smartly,'\u200a\" said Mary Matalin, a former adviser to Dick Cheney.\n\nGOP strategist Alex Conant, who advised the presidential campaign of Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., said: \"While Trump is inconsistent and unfocused, Pence's presence is reassuring to allies on [Capitol] Hill and overseas. The more Trump listens to Pence, the better it will be for his presidency.\"\n\nDuring a visit Tuesday to Quinta de Olivos, the presidential compound outside of Buenos Aires, Pence was asked by a journalist whether each time Trump \"steps on his own message,\" such as with his threat of military action in Venezuela, it results in the vice president having \"work to do\" overseas.\n\nFor a moment, Pence appeared taken aback by the question.

Pence had originally planned to stay in the Central American country Thursday night but will cut his trip short so he can attend a meeting on South Asia at Camp David.\n\nPence has spent much of his visit working to assure Latin American allies that the United States remains invested in the region despite President Donald Trump's \"America first\" rhetoric. He's also urged leaders in the region to intensify pressure on the Venezuelan government, which many fear is on the cusp of dictatorship and civil war.\n\nThat mission was complicated by Trump's surprise suggestion right before Pence left that a \"military option\" might be on the table for Venezuela. Leaders across the region made clear to Pence that they strongly rejected the suggestion.\n\n\"Chile will do its utmost to support Venezuela to find a peaceful way out,\" Chilean President Michelle Bachelet said on Wednesday. \"But Chile will not support military interventions, nor coup d'\u00e9tat.\"\n\nIn Panama, a major financial center, Pence is expected to discuss commercial and security ties with the country, including a new trade agreement. Other topics that could come up include drug trafficking, illegal migration and money laundering.\n\nPence's discussions with Varela will focus on U.S.-Panamanian cooperation to strengthen security, along with opportunities for new trade and investment, according to the Panama Foreign Ministry.\n\nCopyright 2017 The Associated Press.

That, says a senior Latin American official, describes his region's attitude to the government of President Donald Trump. What Latin American leaders do not feel is fear, awe or a sense of shared ambition to do great things. Lexington is in Panama, in the press pool accompanying Mike Pence on the final leg of a four-country tour of the region, also taking in Colombia, Argentina and Chile.\n\nThe single most striking impression of this tour is its smallness. Mr Pence, a man so disciplined and loyal to his boss that his favourite phrase is \"As President Trump has said\", has asked each government in turn for modest, and in some cases puzzling, things. He has not described grand visions for pan-American cooperation of the sort once espoused by President George H.W. Bush, who called for a free trade area of the Americas stretching from Alaska to Patagonia.\n\nMr Pence has focused on policies that matter immediately to Mr Trump back home: sanctions on North Korea, more pressure on the autocratic left-wing regime in Venezuela, or better local access for specific American products and services (as agreed through the bilateral trade deals Mr Trump prefers, believing that one-on-one negotiations give him the winning hand). To a remarkable extent, his hosts have not feared ignoring Mr Pence in places where those American requests make no sense or do not match local priorities.\n\nOn Wednesday Mr Pence met the Chilean president, Michele Bachelet. In his own words he strongly urged her, along with the leaders of Brazil, Mexico, and Peru, to break all diplomatic and commercial ties with North Korea. In a brief meeting at the presidential palace of La Moneda he told the press that America would \"especially welcome\" a move by Chile to reclassify exports of Chilean wine as luxury goods, which would bring them under existing UN sanctions aimed at curbing imports of items like fancy cars for the ruling North Korean elite.\n\nThis request startled Chilean officials. Chile's trade with North Korea's regime is minimal and the country barely has diplomatic relations with Kim Jong-Un, the hereditary despot: the Chilean ambassador is based in Beijing. Perhaps most importantly, it is not clear to Chile why countries severing diplomatic relations will help bring about the goal that matters most: pressuring North Korea to abandon its nuclear weapons programme. Indeed, Mr Pence was asked in Santiago whether Team Trump wanted countries to close their embassies in North Korea, and whether that might include China.\n\nMr Pence, a smart man of conventionally hawkish views, offered a reply that was not entirely convincing as he tried to channel the bombast of his boss, a thoroughly unconventional foreign policy actor. He noted, correctly, that North Korea has used \"delay and feigned negotiations\" for years while working to obtain usable nuclear weapons and a ballistic missile programme. Mr Trump had declared that era over, Mr Pence said. Now his vice-president was calling on America's friends around the world \"to continue to use the economic and diplomatic tools that they have to further isolate North Korea\". He said that America believed it would \"facilitate a peaceful outcome\" if Chile and others formally terminated their diplomatic relations with North Korea.\n\nLeaving Santiago at dawn this morning for Panama, the local newspapers carried the response. \"Chile rejects the USA's request to break relations with North Korea,\" read the front page of El Mercurio. Inside, the paper recorded the blunt words of Heraldo Mu\u00f1oz, the foreign minister: Chile is \"not contemplating\" cutting diplomatic ties with North Korea. The report on the Pence visit, carried on an inside page, also noted Ms Bachelet's public rejection of comments by Mr Trump that America's options for restoring democracy in Venezuela include military operations -- a nonsensical claim from a purely military point of view, and a political provocation that even pro-American leaders have felt obliged to denounce at every stop in the Pence visit.\n\nMs Bachelet told her guest publicly that while her government supports peaceful means to restore democracy in Venezuela, Chile will never support either coups d'\u00e9tats or military interventions in that country. Listeners in the region understood why Ms Bachelet included talk of coups: her own father, Alberto Bachelet, was an air force officer who served the government of Salvador Allende that was toppled in an American-backed coup in 1973. Brigadier-General Bachelet died in prison in 1974.\n\nThat history is a reminder that the Trump administration is far from the first to have testy relations with Latin America, and it would be unfair to claim that previous American presidents have devoted long hours to ambitious, beautifully crafted policies for the region. Latin American diplomats have long witnessed American officials flying in to pursue a handful of narrow topics of interest to the president of the day, whether that meant the war on drugs, counter-terrorism, free trade or climate change.\n\nEven so, today's levels of mutual indifference startle long-time practitioners. Mr Trump proudly boasts that he will treat foreign policy like a series of real-estate deals, negotiating one on one with other countries to extract concessions and bring back jobs to America. As it happens, Mr Pence's national security staff, recruited from the Pentagon and other agencies, wins high marks from foreign diplomats. But there is a myopia to the approach they are tasked with selling. This president, foreign officials lament, seems neither to know nor to care that the whole region is made anxious and unhappy by Mr Trump's scorn for Mexico, his threats to tear up the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) with Mexico and Canada, and his cancellation of America's membership of the Trans-Pacific Partnership, an ambitious trade pact that includes some countries in Latin America.\n\nEven as Mr Pence, a free-trader by instinct, talked loyally at each stop about how his boss's favoured bilateral trade pacts will generate jobs and investments across the Western hemisphere, that fragmented approach left him talking about small achievements.\n\nIn Cartagena, Colombia, standing next to the pro-American president, Juan Manuel Santos, Mr Pence was pleased to announce an agreement to allow Colombian Hass avocados into the American market, and to expand Colombian access for \"US rough rice.\" In Argentina, flanked by President Mauricio Macri, an economic reformer and American ally, Mr Pence talked up the quality of American pork -- \"I come from an agricultural state,\" he noted -- and reported that talks are underway to sell more of it in Argentina. As if conscious that this sounded a bit footling for a presidential press conference, Mr Pence added: \"We also discussed the interest in exporting and importing beef on both sides. And, of course, lemon exports from Argentina were a topic.\" Two days after Mr Pence's visit to Buenos Aires, the White House announced that American pork will be allowed into Argentine markets.\n\nMeanwhile, Chinese officials are a constant presence in Latin American capitals, as they sign new commercial deals, offer hefty investments and seek to build new networks of influence across the Pacific region.\n\nMr Pence spoke of some large topics. In each country he visited, he pledged that Mr Trump would not stand by as Venezuela \"slides into dictatorship\", and talked of how America and its allies in the Western hemisphere were bound together by a common concern for human rights and democracy. That is as it should be. But Mr Pence's Latin American hosts know that his boss in Washington has heaped praise on strongmen and autocrats from Russia to Turkey, Egypt and the Philippines. They also know that the American sanctions that would really hurt Venezuela, involving the two countries' large trade in oil, would cause fuel prices to rise for American drivers. As a result, Mr Trump is seen as something of a paper tiger.\n\nAll of this means that the prevailing attitude in the region can look like resentment of Trump's America, without much fear. It is telling that the only protest against Mr Pence seen on this trip, a candle-lit vigil opposite his hotel in Santiago, turned out to be staged by American expats from the Chilean branch of Democrats Abroad. These earnest teachers, lawyers and students held placards asking Mr Pence to take a stand against Mr Trump's disturbing reluctance to single out white nationalists in America for special condemnation.\n\nMr Pence's favourite catchphrase when abroad is that \"America First does not mean America alone.\" This is meant to be a promise that, though Mr Trump was elected to put American prosperity and security ahead of all other concerns, his country is still willing to play a leading role in the world. Alas, if global disillusionment with Mr Trump deepens much more, that promise to avoid \"America alone\" may start to sound more like a plea.", "id": "9793422", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-17",

Brazil, the region's largest economy, opened an embassy in Pyongyang in 2009 while North Korea has an embassy in Brasilia.\n\n\"Brazil follows the decisions of multilateral organizations,\" a spokesman for the Foreign Ministry said when asked if Brasilia would break off trade and diplomatic ties.\n\nPeru's Prime Minister Fernando Zavala said in a news conference the country had not been formally asked to break ties by the United States and would evaluate the issue at the right time.\n\nLima, which has condemned North Korea's missile tests in the past, asked North Korea to reduce its embassy personnel a couple of months ago over an unrelated matter, a government source said.\n\nThe Mexican government did not have an immediate comment in response to Pence. North Korea has an embassy and a consulate in Mexico, while Mexico is accredited to Pyongyang from its Seoul embassy.\n\nTrade between Latin American countries and North Korea is not significant.\n\nBrazil, the region's largest economy, had just $2.1 million worth of exports - mainly coffee, meat, tobacco and leather - and $8.7 million of imports with North Korea in 2016, according to government figures.\n\nLast year Bolivia, which does not have diplomatic relations, imported $1.16 million of goods from North Korea, mostly machinery, and exported $7,000 largely of alpaca and llama products, official data showed.\n\nChile has a joint arrangement of diplomatic relations with North Korea and China but has not presented credentials for four years, according to Pence.\n\n\"I've requested of Bachelet today to terminate that relationship,\" he said.\n\nPence said he would \"especially welcome\" Chile reclassifying its wine exports as a luxury good, which would bring it under the umbrella of United Nations sanctions against the isolated country. Chile is the world's leading wine exporter outside of Europe.\n\nNeighboring Argentina, Latin America's No.3 economy, said it has no diplomatic relations with North Korea.\n\nThe leftist governments of Cuba and Venezuela, meanwhile, have remained largely quiet on the current standoff, although the North Korean ambassador to Venezuela recently said the two countries were interested in boosting relations.\n\nPence said that there were recent glimmers of hope on the North Korea situation.\n\n\"Our administration has been marshalling the support of nations around the world, and as the president acknowledged this morning, we are beginning to see progress in dealing with North Korea's provocations,\" he said.\n\nPence also reiterated recent comments that Latin America \"should do more\" on Venezuela, where over 120 people have been killed since anti-government protests began in April.\n\nTrump's comments last week that a \"military option\" was on the table for Venezuela caused shockwaves through the region.\n\n\"Chile will not support coups or military intervention,\" said Bachelet at the news conference. \"In the case of sanctions, we will support any measures adopted by the UN Security Council.\"\n\nPence is on his third stop of a Latin America tour that also included Argentina and Colombia. He said he would end the trip \"a little bit early\" on Thursday after visiting Panama.\n\nThis article appears in: Stocks , World Markets , Economy , Politics", "id": "9596114", "details": {},

North Korean leader Kim Jong Un later delayed the decision to fire the missiles, a move Trump praised earlier on Wednesday.\n\nTrade between Latin American countries and North Korea is not significant.\n\nBrazil, the region's largest economy, had just $2.1 million worth of exports -- mainly coffee, meat, tobacco and leather -- and $8.7 million of imports with North Korea in 2016, according to government figures. North Korea has an embassy in Brasilia and Brazil opened an embassy in Pyongyang in 2009.\n\n\"Brazil follows the decisions of multilateral organizations,\" a spokesman for the Foreign Ministry said when asked if Brasilia would break off trade and diplomatic ties.\n\nPeru had not been directly asked by the United States to break ties with North Korea and was not currently planning any action, a government source said.\n\nPeruvian President Pedro Pablo Kuczynski awaits Chile's President Michelle Bachelet at the Government Palace in Lima, July 7, 2017. Thomson Reuters\n\nLima, which has condemned North Korea's missile tests in the past, asked it to reduce its embassy personnel a couple of months ago over an unrelated matter, said the source.\n\nChile has a joint arrangement of diplomatic relations with North Korea and China but has not presented credentials for four years, according to Pence.\n\n\"I've requested of Bachelet today to terminate that relationship,\" he said.\n\nPence said he would \"especially welcome\" Chile reclassifying its wine exports as a luxury good, which would bring it under the umbrella of United Nations sanctions against the isolated country. Chile is the world's leading wine exporter outside of Europe.\n\nNeighboring Argentina, Latin America's no.3 economy, said it has no diplomatic relations with North Korea.\n\nThe leftist governments of Cuba and Venezuela, meanwhile, have remained largely quiet on the current standoff, although the North Korean ambassador to Venezuela recently said the two countries were interested in boosting relations.\n\nPence said that there were recent glimmers of hope on the North Korea situation.\n\n\"Our administration has been marshalling the support of nations around the world, and as the President acknowledged this morning, we are beginning to see progress in dealing with North Korea's provocations,\" he said.\n\nAP\n\nPence also said Latin America \"should do more\" on Venezuela, where over 120 people have been killed since anti-government protests began in April. He reiterated recent comments that the United States is keen to work together with other countries in Latin America \"to achieve a peaceable solution.\"\n\nTrump's comments last week that a \"military option\" was on the table for Venezuela caused shockwaves through the region.\n\n\"Chile will not support coups or military intervention,\" said Bachelet at the press conference. \"In the case of sanctions, we will support any measures adopted by the UN Security Council.\"\n\nPence is on his third stop of a Latin America tour that also included Argentina and Colombia. He said he would end the trip \"a little bit early\" on Thursday after visiting Panama.\n\n(Reporting by Rosalba O'Brien; additional reporting by Anthony Boadle in Brasilia, Bruno Federowski and Brad

He referenced coments he made from Columbia Sunday night about the \"heartbreaking situation.\"\n\n\"I stand with the President and I stand by those words,\" said Pence.\n\nThe Vice President then went on to say:\n\nToday, while I'm here in Chile, our hearts are in Charlottesville because just a few short hours ago, family and friends gathered to say farewell to a remarkable young woman, Heather Heyer. And we've been praying. We've been praying for God's peace and comfort for her family and her friends and her loved ones. And we're also praying that in America that we will not allow the few to divide the many.\n\nThe strength of the United States of America is always strongest, as the President has said so eloquently, when we are united around our shared values, and so it will always be.\n\nBut let me say, it's about the strength of the United States of America that the President sent me here to Latin America. And as we prepare to end our trip a little bit early, tomorrow, after we stop in Panama, I leave here greatly encouraged that across South America and Central America, with the United States and Canada, that there is a, this is a new era here in the new world. Chile is a shining example of a nation that first chose economic freedom decades ago and now is experiencing a vibrant democracy. And it's inspiring nations across Latin America who have followed Chile's lead.

Trump said \"both sides\" were to blame for the violence that ensued at a white nationalist-run rally in Charlottesville, Virginia last weekend.\n\nAt a press conference on Tuesday, a reporter asked Pence three questions, all of which he effectively dodged. The first question was whether Pence agreed with Trump that there were good people among the white supremacist protesters, the second was whether Confederate statues should be removed, and the third was whether Robert E. Lee should be considered in the \"same pantheon\" as George Washington.\n\nPence took a beat and evaded all three questions entirely, saying:\n\n\"What happened in Charlottesville was a tragedy and the president has been clear on this tragedy and so have I. I spoke at length about this heartbreaking situation on Sunday night in Colombia and I stand with the president and I stand by those words.\"\n\nPence is currently in Chile, a stop on a South American trip that he has announced he's cutting short to return to the U.S. on Thursday.\n\n.@VP responds to Trump's comments that there were \"fine people\" among white supremacist groups and \"blame on both sides\" in Charlottesville. pic.twitter.com/GFwRvEUGF9 -- ABC News Politics (@ABCPolitics)\n\nAugust 16, 2017\n\nPence also said that despite being in Chile, \"our hearts are in Charlottesville\" and paid tribute to the 32-year-old woman who was killed in the protests.\n\n\"Just a few short hours ago, the family and friends gathered to say farewell to a remarkable young woman, Heather Heyer,\" he said.\n\n\"We've been praying, we've been praying for God's comfort for her family and her friends and we are also praying in America, we will not allow the few to divide the many,\" he said. \"The strength of the United States of America is always strongest, as the President has said so eloquently, when we are united. Around our shared values and so it will always be.\"\n\nSince his statements in Chile, Pence has canceled a planned appearance he had scheduled for Saturday with Ed Gillespie, who is currently the GOP nominee for governor of Virginia. Gillespie tweeted on Wednesday that the \"white supremacists and neo-Nazis who invaded [Charlottesville] espouse reprehensible views that have no redeeming value whatsoever.\"\n\nTrump's comments during the Tuesday press conference, which was supposed to be about infrastructure, have united both Democrats and Republicans in saying the president needs to do more to fight against white supremacists.

It's not their (our) fault. However dismal one's view of current American politics, Trump is sure to expose it, with a tweet or the lack of one, as a naive and rosy fantasy. Each day, we adjust our sights down. Each day, the president forces our gaze lower.\n\nSome conservatives might take comfort in the prospect -- wish, really -- of a President Mike Pence assuming office before the current occupant's term is up. The Indiana Republican is as dull and serviceable a politician as Trump is bizarre and broken. Pence can recite the social conservative catechism by heart and, until he signed on to the Trump carnival, held conventional conservative views on trade and taxes and decency.\n\nI wouldn't say I'm a big Pence fan. But everything's relative. He doesn't approach each hour as a mortal threat to precarious manhood, and it's hard to imagine Pence groping women, or bragging to others that he did. When Nazis went on a homicidal rampage, Pence's response, aside from the requisite media bashing that all Trump White House employees must engage in, seemed both professional and perturbed, suggesting he did not, on the whole, approve of murderous thugs.\n\nCompared with the daily degradation that is President Trump, a Pence White House looks better than good; it looks grand. I'm consistently perplexed when others don't share my enthusiasm for the humdrum Hoosier. Liberal friends recoil when I point out the upsides, including the observation that Pence shows no outward signs of sociopathy -- as if our recent experience hasn't taught us what a superb qualification that is for the presidency.\n\nOne of the chief liberal concerns about Pence was voiced in June by Democratic Senator Al Franken of Minnesota, who told the International Business Times that Pence, \"in terms of a lot of domestic policy certainly would be worse than Trump.\" He went on to point out that Pence was instrumental in promoting some of Trump's worst Cabinet appointees. If Pence was indeed responsible for dreadful Cabinet picks such as the Environmental Protection Agency's Scott Pruitt, then President Pence surely couldn't do any worse than Vice President Pence already did.\n\nLikewise, Pence's domestic policy priorities have largely been adopted by Trump, whose political survival may depend on continued support from Christian conservatives. Supreme Court Justice Neil Gorsuch, who was confirmed by the Senate in April, is the kind of smart, rigid conservative Pence would've nominated himself. On social issues such as abortion or transgender rights, it's hard to see where Pence would've differed from Trump, who reinstituted restrictions on international abortion funding and tweeted a ban on transgender troops without even consulting the Pentagon.\n\nPence annoys liberals because he seems like a stock movie character -- a pinched little sex-phobic Chamber of Commerce preacher harboring a shocking secret that he can't bear to face. I don't know anything about Pence's soul or his secret longings. But with Trump's sprawling indiscipline and gross appetites perpetually on display, a little self-repression doesn't sound so bad.\n\nOn foreign policy, there's little chance Pence would be as dangerous and bumbling as Trump, who is a few decades late to the realization that China is not much interested in advancing U.S. interests on the Korean peninsula, and last week clumsily handed a weapon to Venezuelan leader Nicolas Maduro. (After Trump foolishly mused about using force in Venezuela, Maduro used the threat of Yanqui imperialism to thrash his democratic opponents.)\n\nA Pence presidency would also have a clarifying effect for voters choosing our next president, separating Trumpism from conservatism, and making it impossible for Republicans to distance themselves from the former even when it looks like the deranged, identical twin of the latter.\n\nIf Trump goes down in a ball of fiery corruption, or if we learn that his abiding admiration for Vladimir Putin stems from an even more unsavory source than Trump's jackboot reveries, Pence will have difficulty escaping the rubble. He did, after all, aid and abet the catastrophe.\n\nMeanwhile, a transition from Trump to Pence would be like switching to the occasional aspirin after having been force-fed a diet of LSD. This trip has been too strange and it's already gone on too long. A drab, conservative mediocrity moving into the Oval Office may not be our best chance to make America great again.

Mike Pence on Wednesday called on Brazil, Mexico and other Latin American powers to break off economic and diplomatic ties with North Korea over Pyongyang's missile threats.\n\n\"We strongly urge Chile today and we urge Brazil and Mexico and Peru to break all diplomatic and commercial ties to North Korea,\" Pence told a press conference alongside Chilean President Michelle Bachelet.\n\n\"We would especially welcome Chile reclassifying exports of Chilean wine... as a luxury good under current US sanctions to prevent North Korean from obtaining these commodities and converting them into hard currency that support the regime.\"\n\nBachelet did not respond publicly to Pence's request but expressed concern at North Korea's ballistic weapons program.\n\nShe called on parties \"to renew all the diplomatic efforts and conversations... to the North, South Korea, China, the Russian Federation -- in order to have a Korean peninsula without nuclear weapons.\"\n\nNorth Korea's leader Kim Jong-Un on Tuesday backed off from a threat to fire missiles towards the US territory of Guam.\n\nPence was visiting Chile on the third stop of a tour of Latin American countries to boost trade ties and rally them over the crisis in Venezuela.\n\nHe said he had decided \"to end our trip a little bit early tomorrow after we stop in Panama\" on the last leg of the trip.\n\nPence may be needed back home.\n\nIn Washington, US President Donald Trump was in the eye of a political storm Wednesday after his remarks on unrest at rallies by white supremacists and counter-protesters in Charlottesville.\n\nThe White House said Trump and Pence will meet Friday with his national security team at Camp David, as he mulls whether or not to send more American troops to war-ravaged Afghanistan.\n\nShare Tweet Whatsapp Email\n\nShare\n\nUS urges LatAm powers to isolate N.Korea - Yahoo7 Pinterest Tumblr", "id": "9561907", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-16", "title": "US urges

It's not their (our) fault. However dismal one's view of current American politics, Trump is sure to expose it, with a tweet or the lack of one, as a naive and rosy fantasy. Each day, we adjust our sights down. Each day, the president forces our gaze lower.\n\nSome conservatives might take comfort in the prospect -- wish, really -- of a President Mike Pence assuming office before the current occupant's term is up. The Indiana Republican is as dull and serviceable a politician as Trump is bizarre and broken. Pence can recite the social conservative catechism by heart and, until he signed on to the Trump carnival, held conventional conservative views on trade and taxes and decency.\n\nI wouldn't say I'm a big Pence fan. But everything's relative. He doesn't approach each hour as a mortal threat to precarious manhood, and it's hard to imagine Pence groping women, or bragging to others that he did. When a went on a homicidal rampage, Pence's response, aside from the requisite media bashing that all Trump White House employees must engage in, seemed both professional and perturbed, suggesting he did not, on the whole, approve of murderous thugs.\n\nCompared with the daily degradation that is President Trump, a Pence White House looks better than good; it looks grand. I'm consistently perplexed when others don't share my enthusiasm for the humdrum Hoosier. Liberal friends recoil when I point out the upsides, including the observation that Pence shows no outward signs of sociopathy -- as if our recent experience hasn't taught us what a superb qualification that is for the presidency.\n\nOne of the chief liberal concerns about Pence was voiced in June by Democratic Senator Al Franken of Minnesota, who told the International Business Times that Pence, \"in terms of a lot of domestic policy certainly would be worse than Trump.\" He went on to point out that Pence was instrumental in promoting some of Trump's worst Cabinet appointees. If Pence was indeed responsible for dreadful Cabinet picks such as the Environmental Protection Agency's Scott Pruitt, then President Pence surely couldn't do any worse than Vice President Pence already did.\n\nLikewise, Pence's domestic policy priorities have largely been adopted by Trump, whose political survival may depend on continued support from Christian conservatives. Supreme Court Justice Neil Gorsuch, who was confirmed by the Senate in April, is the kind of smart, rigid conservative Pence would've nominated himself. On social issues such as abortion or transgender rights, it's hard to see where Pence would've differed from Trump, who reinstituted restrictions on international abortion funding and tweeted a ban on transgender troops without even consulting the Pentagon.\n\nPence annoys liberals because he seems like a stock movie character -- a pinched little Chamber of Commerce preacher harboring a shocking secret that he can't bear to face. I don't know anything about Pence's soul or his secret longings. But with Trump's sprawling indiscipline and gross appetites perpetually on display, a little self-repression doesn't sound so bad.\n\nOn foreign policy, there's little chance Pence would be as dangerous and bumbling as Trump, who is a few decades late to the realization that China is not much interested in advancing U.S. interests on the Korean peninsula, and last week clumsily handed a weapon to Venezuelan leader Nicolas Maduro. (After Trump foolishly mused about using force in Venezuela, Maduro used the threat of Yanqui imperialism to thrash his democratic opponents.)\n\nA Pence presidency would also have a clarifying effect for voters choosing our next president, separating Trumpism from conservatism, and making it impossible for Republicans to distance themselves from the former even when it looks like the deranged, identical twin of the latter.\n\nIf Trump goes down in a ball of fiery corruption, or if we learn that his abiding admiration for Russian President Vladimir Putin stems from an even more unsavory source than Trump's jackboot reveries, Pence will have difficulty escaping the rubble. He did, after all, aid and abet the catastrophe.\n\nMeanwhile, a transition from Trump to Pence would be like switching to the occasional aspirin after having been force-fed a diet of LSD. This trip has been too strange and it's already gone on too long. A drab, conservative mediocrity moving into the Oval Office may not be our best chance to make America great again. But it's the nearest one at hand.\n\nBloomberg View\n\nFrancis Wilkinson writes editorials on politics and U.S. domestic policy for Bloomberg View. He was executive editor of the Week.

In more normal times, Mr Pence would make an unlikely object of global fascination. Missionary-earnest and sternly conservative, he wears his loyalty to Donald Trump like a blank mask. There is no Trump provocation that the vice-president cannot explain away: usually in tones of mild, head-shaking disappointment, as if others lack the good sense to trust his boss. But even as Mr Pence defends his president and his America First agenda, he sounds enough like an old-school Reagan Republican -- praising free-trade pacts, lauding NATO and chiding leftist strongmen for trampling the rule of law -- that foreign allies cannot help but dream.\n\nTo us, says an official from one of four Latin American countries hosting Mr Pence from August 13th to 18th, this vice-president somehow represents all the institutions of America, not just this White House. He sounds like the senators we meet, and we know he is liked by many Republicans in Congress. Also, says the official, lowering his voice, Mr Pence could be president one day. Given the legal and political briars that entangle Mr Trump after just seven months in office, that is a fair point.\n\nA Trumpian controversy was awaiting Mr Pence at his first stop, Colombia. That country's centrist president, Juan Manuel Santos, had every interest in giving his American visitor a cordial welcome. Mr Santos needs allies as he nurses a fragile economy and implements an unpopular peace agreement with FARC rebels. Mr Santos hosted Mr Pence and his wife Karen for an open-air dinner in the port city of Cartagena, in the grounds of a coral-stone mansion. Blue macaws and high-flying frigatebirds wheeled overhead. Modest trade deals were announced: America will accept more Colombian avocados, Colombia will buy more Yanqui rice. Mr Santos endorsed American calls for tougher sanctions on Venezuela's leftist rulers, as they slide closer to dictatorship. But as a politician in a continent haunted by memories of American-backed coups, and stalked today by left-wing populists, Mr Santos had no choice but to address comments made by Mr Trump, a few days earlier, suggesting that options for restoring democracy in Venezuela include military force. \"Friends have to tell each other the truth,\" Mr Santos told his guest. A military option should not \"even be considered\".\n\nIn reply, Mr Pence relied on a favourite gambit: selectively quoting Mr Trump to make his boss sound more like Reagan than Rambo. Indeed, Mr Trump said that America has \"many options for Venezuela\", soothed Mr Pence. But the president remains confident that, working with Latin American allies, peaceful ways will be found to restore Venezuelan democracy. What the world heard was \"resolve and determination\" from Mr Trump, the vice-president added, in case anyone thought they had heard America's president indulging in blustering war-talk that makes no military sense, gives Venezuela's rulers a propaganda win, and makes life harder for his own allies. As night fell over Cartagena Mr Pence reached for a line that he uses often to explain Trumpian foreign policy. Under President Trump, the government will always put American's security and prosperity first, he said: but \"America First does not mean America alone.\"\n\nThe electoral mandate won by Mr Trump weighs heavily on Mr Pence. At each overseas stop the former governor of Indiana, congressman and conservative radio host works to convey to foreigners the anger of Trump voters back home. In Colombia he talked of illegal drugs poisoning American children and instructed his host: \"Mr President, this must end.\" For television viewers back home, he explained why faraway crises matter, carefully casting a failed Venezuelan state as a threat not just to democracy, but to American borders and security, as chaos sent murderous drug gangs and migrants north.\n\nYet Mr Pence also strains to present Trump's America as a benevolent superpower, untempted by isolationism. In Cartagena he bowed his head, eyes closed, as Mrs Pence led a prayer circle with Venezuelans taking refuge at an American-backed evangelical church. \"The president sent me here with a message of compassion,\" Mr Pence told them, visibly moved. Nobody was awkward enough to ask how that squares with his boss's fear-mongering against refugees, or frequent praise for despotic strongmen elsewhere in the world. In Buenos Aires Mr Pence praised President Mauricio Macri for lowering trade tariffs, without mentioning Mr Trump's threats to slap tariffs on imports. Mr Pence hailed Argentina's role in the World Trade Organisation, though his boss calls that body \"another one of our disasters\".\n\nSwagger fixes everything\n\nIf pressed on such contradictions, Mr Pence has an answer: overall, Mr Trump's tough talk makes the world safer. Citing the recent UN Security Council vote to sanction North Korea, and pan-American efforts to put pressure on Venezuela, Mr Pence claimed in Buenos Aires that Mr Trump had \"brought the kind of broad-shouldered leadership to the world stage that has been lacking for too long, and the world welcomes it.\"\n\nLoyalty is a noble quality. Public loyalty is also key when working for Mr Trump, a vengeful and insecure man. Both facts may explain why Mr Pence quotes the president constantly and deferentially stresses the \"high honour\" of representing him.\n\nTravel lifts the mask a bit. Like many nationalists, Mr Trump does not greatly care that foreign countries have politics, too. Mr Pence is more alive to questions of foreign opinion, which is why he labours to present the world with the most constructive version of his boss. That very act of selective editing reveals something of the vice-president's own preferences. More than his boss, he seems to believe in certain core principles. But to what end? Access to power means little if unaccompanied by courage.", "id": "9824640", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-18", "title": "Travels with Mike Pence", "image":

After visiting Argentina and Chile, he will travel to Panama Thursday.\n\n\"The presence of a high foreign official in our country creates expectations about what his visit will bring, what agreements will be signed, what positive impact will remain,\" Laborde said.\n\nHowever, as Laborde sees it, Pence would not be discussing any trade deals or investment plans.\n\n\"Just at the moment that Venezuela sees its Constituent Assembly at work and there is quiet in the streets, when the opposition has accepted to take part in the October regional elections, Pence arrives in Latin America to increase the pressure,\" he added.\n\nOn Tuesday, Pence said to reporters in Argentina that Washington will continue to put economic and political pressure on Venezuela. He also thanked Argentinean president for his \"regional leadership\" in investigating Venezuelan officials later targeted with U.S. sanctions, and for \"suspending Venezuela from Mercosur,\" the South American trade bloc, in a bid to isolate the country's government.\n\nWashington, which backs the right-wing opposition in Venezuela, claims that Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro has destroyed democracy by electing the National Constituent Assembly to amend the Constitution, a mechanism that Venezuela's charter provides as a means of modifying or updating laws.\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump last week said he would not rule out a \"military option\" to oust Maduro and his ruling United Socialist Party from power, a claim that was seen as a sudden escalation of Washington's response to Venezuela's crisis.\n\nAccording to Laborde, Pence is seeking to include Argentina, along with Colombia, Brazil and Peru, in a possible military alliance to stop the \"dictatorship of Maduro.\"\n\nHowever, since Trump threatened a military option, Latin American leaders have closed ranks to rule out any such plan.\n\nPeru has voiced its rejection of any kind of threats or use of force unauthorized by the United Nations, and called for dialogues among related parties on Saturday.\n\nPence's tour has also been shadowed by opposing voices from his host countries.\n\nColombian President Juan Manuel Santos said on Sunday that a military intervention \"shouldn't even be considered,\" and called for a negotiated solution to the crisis.\n\nArgentinean President Mauricio Macri on Wednesday also dismissed the use of force in Venezuela.\n\nOn Monday, Maduro has called for international talks to resolve differences and counter the U.S. aggression, and asked members of the Community of Latin American and Caribbean States \"to put peace, dialogue and the solution of Latin American affairs on the table, so we can continue to be a land of peace.\"\n\nLaborde, in his interview, noted that \"Mike Pence is coming to ask us to join a very dangerous escalation for our country, only benefiting North American interests.\"", "id": "9643329", "details": {}, "date":

Could a decision on the war in Afghanistan be in the offing?\n\n\"We prepare to end our trip a little bit early tomorrow in Panama,\" Pence told reporters Wednesday in Santiago, Chile. Pence's press secretary, Marc Lotter, tells me the vice president \"will be joining the president on Friday at Camp David for a national security meeting on South Asia.\" The White House first announced the Camp David meeting Wednesday morning. Lotter did not respond to my question as to whether President Donald Trump requested that Pence return early.\n\nAsked what prompted Friday's meeting, Michael Anton, a spokesman for the National Security Council, said \"It's a meeting to discuss South Asia strategy and other topics.\" What's included in the NSC's definition of \"South Asia\"? I'm told India, Pakistan, and Afghanistan.\n\nThe president has for months had before him a decision to make on America's continued military involvement in Afghanistan. Trump is divided on what to do largely because his White House advisers are split, as my colleague Peter Boyer reports in the current issue of THE WEEKLY STANDARD.\n\n\"Key members of the Trump administration's war council met with the president on August 10 at the summer White House in Bedminster, N.J., and presented him with a trio of options for the 16-year-old conflict, according to senior government officials,\" Boyer reported. \"These range from an open-ended mission for a beefed-up American military force to a near-complete withdrawal of American forces.\"\n\nThe White House won't say if Friday's meeting is meant to resolve the Afghanistan question.\n\nBannon Watch -- Steve Bannon, the former Breitbart chairman and top aide to President Trump, seems to have been on the brink of exiting the White House for a few days. Now, there's more evidence that Bannon may not be long for the West Wing: an \"exit interview\" of sorts with an unlikely interlocutor.\n\nLiberal journalist Robert Kuttner of the American Prospect says he received a call from Bannon Tuesday in which the White House adviser \"unloaded\" about everything from China to the internal politics of the administration. Read Kuttner's whole account, but the part about North Korea is the most shocking -- Bannon effectively undercuts the president's own words on the subject.\n\n\"Contrary to Trump's threat of fire and fury, Bannon said: 'There's no military solution [to North Korea's nuclear threats], forget it. Until somebody solves the part of the equation that shows me that ten million people in Seoul don't die in the first 30 minutes from conventional weapons, I don't know what you're talking about, there's no military solution here, they got us.'\"\n\nThat alone is enough justification for chief of staff John Kelly to fire Bannon. Jonathan Swan of Axios reports that Bannon himself did not believe he was giving an Kuttner an interview to be published, but at times it reads like the intentional venting of a frustrated aide on his way out the door.\n\nEarlier this week Mike Pence traveled to Colombia and Argentina before arriving in Chile. He had been scheduled to leave his final stop on the trip, Panama, on Friday.\n\nSpeaking to the press at the Chilean presidential palace, Pence said he was \"greatly encouraged\" by what he has seen in his travels across the region.\n\n\"I leave here greatly encouraged that across South America and Central America and with the United States and Canada that this is a new era here in the New World,\" he said. \"Chile is a shining example of a nation that first chose economic freedom decades ago and now is experiencing vibrant democracy. I return from this trip more encouraged than ever that not only will our commerce grow, strengthening jobs and opportunities in America, strengthening prosperity across Latin America.\"\n\nPence also took note of the unrest and crisis in Venezuela, where the Trump administration has recently sanctioned several government officials, including President Nicolas Maduro. \"I truly do believe that the unity that I have experienced in our determination to ensure that we will not permit a failed state in Venezuela in this hemisphere,\" Pence said.\n\nMark It Down -- \"[Trump] is not interested in a mere tweaking of a few provisions of a couple of provisions and a couple of updated chapters. We feel that NAFTA has fundamentally failed many, many Americans and needs major improvement.\" - Robert Lighthizer, U.S. Trade Representative, August 16, 2017.\n\nTrump Tweet of the Day\n\nWhat is the Trump administration's ideal level of legal immigration? I asked an administration official that Wednesday, but couldn't get a straightforward answer.\n\n\"What the president said during the campaign is bring immigration down to historical norms,\" said the official, who noted that the average foreign-born population of the United States during the twentieth century was less than 10 percent, but is now above 14 percent.\n\nThe official also mentioned the proposed RAISE Act, co-sponsored by GOP senators David Perdue and Tom Cotton and supported by the White House, which plans to cut legal immigration by about half (or a little more than 500,000 new permanent residents) in a decade.\n\nHope Springs -- Hope Hicks has been named the interim White House communications director, a job that's never quite been defined in the Trump administration. Initially held by Sean Spicer (playing the dual role of press secretary), the job fell to GOP veteran Mike Dubke, who tried to implement some kind of order to the communications operation. That failed, and the job remained unfilled until Anthony Scaramucci's 10-day tour last month.\n\nHicks is a natural fit for the job, even if it is (supposedly) temporary. Fiercely loyal to the Trump family, she has the absolute trust of the three most important people in the White House: Ivanka Trump, Jared Kushner, and the president himself. After serving as the campaign's press secretary, Hicks entered the White House as the director of strategic communications. But as one of her West Wing colleagues put it to me, her communications portfolio has been to work on behalf of -- and protect -- the Trump family.\n\nThis is quite the tale of a small-town newspaper's epic screw-up that seems to have haunted those involved in the two decades since. Jeff Pearlman does a superb job telling the story of a journalism goof gone wrong.", "id": "9681636", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-17", "title": "White House Watch: President Trump Gets Ready to

Pence has recently visited Georgia and the Baltic States. Now Mike Pence tours Latin America.\n\n\"Our Western Hemisphere is a key priority for our administration. Our values are the same, our interests are intertwined, and our futures are forever linked,\" Pence said in Argentina. \"A prosperous Latin America means a more prosperous United States of America,\" he added.\n\nLeftist anti-Americanism has been receding lately against the backdrop of the chronic disease - omnipresent corruption. One could see this happening in Argentina, Brazil, some other Central American countries.\n\nEvents took the most dramatic turn in Venezuela - the main front of the struggle between nationally oriented left-wing forces seeking to wrest control of national wealth from the hands of American capital and comprador forces bribed by American monopolies.\n\nThe victory of President Maduro and his Constitutional Assembly will mean the success of the left and the defeat of the United States. The victory of the parliament will revive absolute power of Washington.\n\nThis is how the US administration views the situation. It is no coincidence that President Trump prefaced Pence's visit to Latin America with arguments about the possibility of military intervention in the name of \"freedom and democracy\" in Venezuela. This showed that Washington is still ready for anything to preserve its positions in the region.\n\nThe response to Donald Trump's threats was predictable: Venezuela's neighbours, even the ones that oppose actions of President Maduro, declared the military scenario unacceptable.\n\nThis, in principle, could be regarded as the defeat of the White House. Yet, Pence, who tries to look as peace-loving as possible, obtains an opportunity to demand support from Latin Americans for sanctions against Maduro and the imposition of the blockade of Venezuela in exchange for the USA's refusal to fight the Caracas regime.\n\nApparently, this is the goal of Mike Pence's tour. In addition to the Venezuelan problems, he actively discusses issues of trade and economic cooperation between America and Colombia, Argentina, Chile, and Panama. Interestingly, when Mike Pence arrived in Latin America, Foreign Minister of Bolivia Fernando Huanacuni arrived in Moscow.\n\nBolivia is one of the most anti-American countries in the region. Along with Venezuela, Bolivia maintains close relations with Russia. Fernando Huanacuni invited President Putin to visit Bolivia in the autumn, when the country hosts the Forum of Gas Exporting Countries (GECF).\n\nAs we can see, Latin America no longer appears to be the back yard of the United States, where Washington can do whatever it wants. Not all countries of the region are united in their rejection of Maduro's policy, and not all of them look up to America. In addition to Venezuela and Bolivia, Nicaragua, Cuba and Ecuador do not intend to back down to the United States either.\n\nIn these circumstances, Mike Pence's tour looks more like an inspection trip on the eve of another escalation of confrontation. Washington clearly intends to deepen the split between the states of the region.", "id": "9734791", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-17", "title": "Mike Pence inspects Latin America that longer remains

Por ello, al margen de lo positivo del inter\u00e9s de Washington en Am\u00e9rica Latina y de que se tratara del primer encuentro de la presidenta Michelle Bachelet con un alto representante del gobierno del presidente Donald Trump, lo cierto es que \u00e9sta no pudo abstraerse del contexto en que se estaba llevando a cabo. Por ello, dej\u00f3 en evidencia una clara discrepancia de opiniones entre la autoridad norteamericana y el gobierno chileno tanto en el tema venezolano como en relaci\u00f3n a la posici\u00f3n de Chile frente al r\u00e9gimen norcoreano.\n\nPese a que existi\u00f3 coincidencia en la necesidad de encontrar una soluci\u00f3n a la crisis que enfrenta Venezuela y, tanto el vicepresidente como la presidenta Bachelet destacaron la importancia de la declaraci\u00f3n de Lima firmada por 12 pa\u00edses de la regi\u00f3n y en la que se desconoce la Asamblea Constituyente y se condena al r\u00e9gimen de Nicol\u00e1s Maduro por las reiteradas violaciones a los derechos humanos y al quiebre del orden democr\u00e1tico en el pa\u00eds, hubo una clara diferencia en el \u00e9nfasis con que ambos abordaron el tema. Mientras Pence conmin\u00f3 a \"hacer m\u00e1s\" y agreg\u00f3 que \"Venezuela se est\u00e1 deslizando hacia una dictadura y como dijo el Presidente Trump 'EE.UU. no se quedar\u00e1 quieto viendo c\u00f3mo Venezuela se desmorona'\", la Presidenta Bachelet volvi\u00f3 a evitar una condena m\u00e1s directa al r\u00e9gimen de Maduro y se limit\u00f3 a insistir en su rechazo a una intervenci\u00f3n militar.\n\nLo mismo sucedi\u00f3 en el caso de Corea del Norte frente al cual el vicepresidente de Estados Unidos ven\u00eda con la misi\u00f3n espec\u00edfica de solicitarle al gobierno chileno el quiebre de las relaciones con ese pa\u00eds, v\u00ednculos que en todo caso se mantienen relativamente congelados, ya que desde hace a\u00f1os no se ha acreditado a ning\u00fan embajador en Pyongyang. Sin embargo, la respuesta del canciller fue clara: \"No tenemos contemplado cortar relaciones diplom\u00e1ticas con Corea del Norte\". Al margen de que la estrategia elegida por Washington para buscar un frente com\u00fan contra Kim Jong un no fue la adecuada, porque ese tipo de solicitudes deben hacerse por cauces diplom\u00e1ticos reservados -lo que hac\u00eda previsible la respuesta chilena-, lo cierto es que el hecho obliga al gobierno a explicar la raz\u00f3n de la existencia y mantenci\u00f3n de relaciones con un r\u00e9gimen como el de Corea del Norte.\n\nSin embargo, al margen de las claras diferencias que evidenci\u00f3 la visita del vicepresidente de Estados Unidos en el \u00e1mbito pol\u00edtico resultan positivas las se\u00f1ales dadas en el plano econ\u00f3mico, en especial por su compromiso con el camino de cooperaci\u00f3n y apertura comercial.

politics, VP Pence has one of the worst records on equality of any President or Vice President in recent memory.\n\nThe Governor of Indiana stirred up international outrage in 2015 when he signed Indiana's controversial 'Religious Freedom Restoration Act', giving businesses the right to discriminate against gay people on the grounds of religion.\n\nPence claimed the law was intended to \"protect\" organisations from having to provide services for same-sex weddings, saying: \"I support the freedom of religion for every Hoosier [Indiana citizen] of every faith.\n\n\"The Constitution of the United States and the Indiana Constitution both provide strong recognition of the freedom of religion but today, many people of faith feel their religious liberty is under attack.\"\n\nLast year appeared unable to answer when asked whether it should be legal to fire people because of their sexuality.\n\nIn a clip, Pence was asked: \"Yes or no: do you believe gay and transgender people should be able to be fired from their jobs just for that reason only?\"\n\nAfter an awkward ten-second silence, Pence attempted to stall, responding: \"It's a great privilege to be your Governor.\"\n\nFudging a response, he said: \"My position as I expressed in the state of the State address is that we are a state with a constitution, and as you know... that constitution has very strong safeguards for freedom of conscience and freedom of religion.\"\n\nJust a few months ago Pence confirmed plans to roll back Barack Obama's executive protections on LGBT rights, so that \"the transgender bathroom issue can be resolved with common sense at the local level\".\n\nHe said: \"This is such an example of an administration that seems to have... there's no area of our lives too small for them to want to regulate, no aspect of our constitution too large for them to ignore.\n\n\"Donald Trump and I both believe these questions can be resolved with common sense at the local level.\"\n\n\"These issues are resolved in the state of Indiana whenever they come up, and they should be resolved, for the safety and well-being of our children first and foremost, their privacy and rights, and with common sense. Donald Trump and I simply believe all of these issues are best resolved at the state level, by communities.\"\n\nHe added: \"Washington has no business intruding on the operation of our local schools. It's just one more example of the heavy hand of this administration, and Donald Trump and I will stand by that common-sense people that when it comes to our kids, and the operation of our schools, those decisions should be made at the local level.\n\n\"Washington DC has no business imposing its bill and its values on communities around the nation.\"\n\nGovernor Pence previously suggested that HIV prevention funding be drained in order to fund state-sponsored 'gay cure' therapy.\n\nOn a 2000 Congressional campaign website, he wrote: \"Congress should support the reauthorization of the [HIV funding] Ryan White Care Act only after completion of an audit to ensure that federal dollars were no longer being given to organisations that celebrate and encourage the types of behaviours that facilitate the spreading of the HIV virus. Resources should be directed toward those institutions which provide assistance to those seeking to change their sexual behaviour.\"", "date": "2017-08-18", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 100, "id": 41, "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal_Information", "wgt": 100, "id": 123, "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal Information"}], "concepts": [{"location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "loc", "id": "233"}, {"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "District of Columbia"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington,_D.C.", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "District of Columbia"}, "type": "loc", "id": "180884"}, {"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Indiana"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Indiana"}, "type": "loc", "id": "208514"}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "302557", "label": {"eng": "Law"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "id": "302942", "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 4, "id": "302944", "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barack_Obama", "type": "person", "score": 2, "id": "302950", "label": {"eng": "Barack Obama"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religion", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "303332", "label": {"eng": "Religion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "304262", "label": {"eng": "President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homosexuality", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "304374", "label": {"eng": "Homosexuality"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gay", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "304544", "label": {"eng": "Gay"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Walt_Disney_Company", "type": "org", "score": 3, "id": "304900", "label": {"eng": "The Walt Disney Company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Pence", "type": "person", "score": 4, "id": "304965", "label": {"eng": "Mike Pence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor_of_Indiana", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "304970", "label": {"eng": "Governor of Indiana"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evangelicalism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "304971", "label": {"eng": "Evangelicalism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transgender", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "305013", "label": {"eng": "Transgender"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HIV", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "id": "305275", "label": {"eng": "HIV"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "305919", "label": {"eng": "Vice President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bible", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "305970", "label": {"eng": "Bible"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Same-sex_marriage", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "306056", "label": {"eng": "Same-sex marriage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homophobia", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "306872", "label": {"eng": "Homophobia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LGBT_rights_by_country_or_territory", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "306874", "label": {"eng": "LGBT rights by country or territory"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heterosexuality", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "310490", "label": {"eng": "Heterosexuality"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LGBT", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "311925", "label": {"eng": "LGBT"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_of_religion", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "318105", "label": {"eng": "Freedom of religion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Constitution", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "318106", "label": {"eng": "United States Constitution"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religious_Freedom_Restoration_Act", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "368752", "label": {"eng": "Religious Freedom Restoration Act"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Funny_or_Die", "type": "org", "score": 3, "id": "370694", "label": {"eng": "Funny or Die"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitution_of_Indiana", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "398293", "label": {"eng": "Constitution of Indiana"}}]}], "totalResults": 251, "pages": 251}}}

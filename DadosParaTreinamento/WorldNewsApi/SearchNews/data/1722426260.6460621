Dr Paul van der Westhuizen, men\u2019s health lead for home health test provider Medichecks, has warned men to get wise on their hormone levels for Alcohol Awareness Week from July 1 \u2013 with one drink in particular upsetting their hormone balance. Excess amounts of the \u2018female hormone\u2019 oestrogen can trick the brain into thinking it has too much testosterone and cause the body to reduce its production, possibly leading to symptoms like low mood and energy, reduced libido, and erectile dysfunction. And changes to our food chain and environment have upped the risk of absorbing extra oestrogen from outside the body. \u201cWhile we typically label hormones as male or female, the fact is men and women make both types of hormones in different levels,\u201d said Dr van der Westhuizen. \u201cThe different volumes of these hormones are what distinguishes the sexual characteristics of men and women. \u201cOestrogen is the collective name for a group of hormones which are mainly responsible for developing the female reproductive system, but men also produce oestrogen in small amounts. Oestradiol is the strongest of these and in men it\u2019s responsible for regulating libido, erectile function, and sperm production. \u201cOestradiol levels in men can be raised due to excess body fat, or linked to an age-related decline in testosterone. High levels of oestrogen in men can cause a negative feedback loop in the brain, causing it to think the body has too much testosterone and lowering its testosterone production in response. \u201cHigh and low oestrogen levels are relatively rare in healthy men, but they could be on the rise. It\u2019s recently come to light that changes in the food chain and our environment has upped the risk of exogenous (or external) oestrogens entering the body and raising oestrogen levels \u2013 with alcohol, and especially beer, being a key source. \u201cWe all know alcohol can have profound effects on the body, but especially the hormones - it can decrease testosterone levels and encourage the body to turn testosterone into oestrogen. Alcohol also contributes to higher body fat through its own calorie content, and unhealthy eating behaviours associated with drinking. The resulting \u2018beer belly\u2019 also encourages the body to turn testosterone into oestrogen, doubling up on the negative effects. \u201cSymptoms of raised oestrogen levels include loss of libido, infertility, and excess growth of breast tissue; the so-called \u2018man boobs\u2019. If you\u2019re experiencing these symptoms, a testosterone and oestradiol blood test can be a good way to see if your hormones are out of balance.\u201d", "summary": "There's a risk of symptoms like low mood and energy, reduced libido and erectile dysfunction", "url": "https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/news/health/doctor-tells-men-one-thing-29436981", "image": "https://i2-prod.birminghammail.co.uk/incoming/article29369940.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_FILES-BRITAIN-LIFESTYLE-PUBS.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-29 05:00:00", "author": "Steven Smith", "authors": ["Steven Smith"], "language": "en", "source_country": "gb", "sentiment": 0.047}

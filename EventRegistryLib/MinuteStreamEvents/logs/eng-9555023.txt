We are going to put Kano-Daura next year, Faira to Maradi in 2026, and Dutse to Kano in 2026.\n\n\"It is not this one that is ready for freight. You know, the inspection is in two phases, the one we did today, we inspected Kaduna to Kano, Kano to Daura, and Daura to Maradi.\n\n\"The one for Kaduna to Kano, the contractor is CCECC. We are going to put the freight, hopefully in the next month, from Lagos to Kano on the narrow gauge.\n\n\"We inspected the rail line from the existing narrow gauge to Dala Inland Dry Port because that is where we are going to drop the containers. That one still stands; by May or late June, we are going to put that corridor into freight from Lagos to Kano.\n\n\"By this, it will bring the cost of business down. We will reduce the menace of road traffic accidents. We will save our highways, and the multiplier effect is on the GDP growth of the country.\n\n\"I visited Kaduna-Kano, the site towards Dala Inland Dry Port in Kano. And from there, we proceeded to Kano-Maradi; we are now in Kazaure; we passed through Dambata to Kazaure; and we are proceeding to Daura to inspect the Federal University of Transportation in Daura.\"", "source": {"uri": "vanguardngr.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Vanguard"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kano_(city)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kano (city)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China_Civil_Engineering_Construction_Corporation", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "China Civil Engineering Construction Corporation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dala,_Nigeria", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Dala, Nigeria"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dala, Nigeria"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Nigeria"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Senate_of_Nigeria", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Senate of Nigeria"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard-gauge_railway", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Standard-gauge railway"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Federation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daura", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Daura"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Daura"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Nigeria"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kano_State", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kano State"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Kano State"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Nigeria"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kazaure", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kazaure"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Kazaure"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Nigeria"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nigeria", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nigeria"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Nigeria"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maradi,_Niger", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Maradi, Niger"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Maradi, Niger"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Niger"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narrow-gauge_railway", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Narrow-gauge railway"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_growth", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Economic growth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dutse", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dutse"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dutse"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Nigeria"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaduna", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kaduna"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Kaduna"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Nigeria"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lagos", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lagos"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Lagos"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Nigeria"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Transportation_and_Logistics", "label": "dmoz/Business/Transportation and Logistics", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Transportation_and_Logistics/Rail", "label": "dmoz/Business/Transportation and Logistics/Rail", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Transportation_and_Logistics/Marketplaces", "label": "dmoz/Business/Transportation and Logistics/Marketplaces", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Real_Estate/Inspection", "label": "dmoz/Business/Real Estate/Inspection", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Transportation", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Transportation", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 78}], "image": "https://cdn.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/image-161.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9555023", "eventUri": "eng-9555023", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3176470588235294, "wgt": 452987757, "relevance": 2}], "totalResults": 6, "page": 1, "count": 1, "pages": 6}}}

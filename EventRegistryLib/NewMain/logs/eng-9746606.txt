McCarthy becoming starting QB", "body": "J.J. McCarthy is readying to report to his first NFL training camp. He and the other Vikings rookies will show up Sunday. That's the only given for this quarterback.\n\nHe has no idea whether he'll be the Vikings starter at the end of camp. And Minnesota coach Kevin O'Connell isn't dictating a timetable for when to choose McCarthy or Sam Darnold, an off-season signee.\n\nO'Connell, an NFL quarterback turned head coach, told ESPN when McCarthy might be ready to start. He said it depends on when McCarthy's \"comfort level\" with the Vikings offense and \"his ability to then translate it to adverse situations and difficult aspects of playing quarterback in the NFL aren't magnified by inexperience.\"\n\nO'Connell added: \"But I want to be very clear that the expectation is for this player to not be perfect. ... He's going to have growing pains, he's going to learn on the fly. I'm not trying to remove that aspect of it, either, but [deciding when he will play] is not something you can write up on a board. It's a feeling.\"\n\nThe Vikings head coach might get that feeling sometime in training camp, which starts next week. Or, it may not come until the Vikings are several games into their season. However, barring injury, it will come. Minnesota traded up with the Jets to land McCarthy, who led Michigan to a national title, with the 10th pick of the draft.\n\nThe Vikings are in a transition season. They decided to move on from Kirk Cousins rather than re-signing the 36-year-old veteran. Cousins, who ruptured his Achilles last October, then signed with the Falcons. Coincidentally, the Falcons choice of quarterbacks nearly threw a scare in the Vikings, but for a different reason. Atlanta, with pick No. 8 in the draft, selected Michael Penix Jr., although they had Cousins. Minnesota needed to figure out if it needed to trade up to nine and not 10 to secure McCarthy.\n\nThe rookie signed his NFL contract Friday. He agreed to a four-year deal worth $21.85 million. It's fully guaranteed. Because McCarthy was a first-round pick, his contract comes with a fifth-year option.\n\nBy next week, he'll be competing with Darnold. He's the former USC star who was the third pick of the 2018 draft. Darnold has bounced around the NFL, going from the Jets to the Panthers and then to the 49ers. San Francisco coach Kyle Shanahan liked Darnold, but the 49ers preferred Brock Purdy. That left the door open for Darnold to sign with the Vikings.\n\nO'Connell told ESPN he's not going to push for McCarthy to start before he's ready.\n\n\"I don't know if it's the former quarterback in me or not,\" O'Connell said. \"But I do feel an obligation to have the best interests of not only J.J. but our entire team, at heart, when we make that decision.\"", "source": {"uri": "on3.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "On3"}, "authors": [{"uri": "suzanne_halliburton@on3.com", "name": "Suzanne Halliburton", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_O'Connell_(American_football)", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kevin O'Connell (American football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Quarterback"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vikings", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Vikings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_coach", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Head coach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kirk_Cousins", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kirk Cousins"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sam_Darnold", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sam Darnold"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michigan_Wolverines_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Michigan Wolverines football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draft_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Draft (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "ESPN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Penix_Jr.", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Michael Penix Jr."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brock_Purdy", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Brock Purdy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyle_Shanahan", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kyle Shanahan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USC_Trojans_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "USC Trojans football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco_49ers", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "San Francisco 49ers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "San Francisco"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "San Francisco"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Atlanta, Georgia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Atlanta, Georgia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Ten-Pin", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Ten-Pin", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Candlepin", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Candlepin", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://on3static.com/uploads/dev/assets/cms/2024/03/01110432/Copy-of-Michigan-Thumbnail-2024-03-01T120238.694.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9746606", "eventUri": "eng-9746606", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.02745098039215688, "wgt": 208, "relevance": 1}

According to ESPN's Adam Schefter, the contract will be a four-year, $21.85 million deal that is fully guaranteed. McCarthy, who was selected No. 10 overall in the 2024 NFL Draft from Michigan, will receive a $12.71 million signing bonus. The contract also includes a fifth-year team option, ensuring the Vikings control McCarthy's future with the team beyond the initial four years.\n\nDespite trading up for J.J. McCarthy in the draft, the Vikings do not expect him to start training camp as the team's quarterback. Head coach Kevin O'Connell announced earlier this month that Sam Darnold's performance at OTAs has earned him the No. 1 job.\n\nO'Connell views McCarthy, a two-year starter at Michigan, as a work in progress. He emphasized that while McCarthy has great potential, he still has areas to develop before taking on the starting role.\n\n\"But I want to be very clear that the expectation is for this player to not be perfect,\" O'Connell said. \"He's going to have growing pains, he's going to learn on the fly.

McCarthy has been the No. 3 quarterback at practice, trailing Sam Darnold and veteran backup Nick Mullens. The Vikings also have 2023 fifth-round pick Jaren Hall in the mix.\n\nDarnold brings significant experience, with 56 career starts and a 21-35 record. Last year, he made one start for the San Francisco 49ers. Originally the Jets' third overall pick in the 2018 draft, Darnold played three seasons in New York before joining the Carolina Panthers. Over his career, he has amassed 12,064 passing yards, 63 touchdowns, and 56 interceptions.\n\n\"I would say Sam would be the guy I would look to based on the spring he's had and, really, where he's at in his career and his quarterback journey,\" O'Connell said.\n\nMinnesota views Darnold as a legitimate competitor for the starting role, not just a backup if McCarthy isn't ready by Week 1.

The last thing that Minnesota head coach Kevin O'Connell wants to do is throw McCarthy out there when he is not ready as there appears to be some regrets with his time as offensive coordinator for the Washington Commanders where they started first-round pick Dwayne Haskins in Week 4 in 2019 when he was not ready.\n\n\"When we selected him, we had a lot of confidence in what he could become under the right circumstances and development and timetable,\" O'Connell said according to Kevin Seifert of ESPN. \"And that didn't exactly end up being the mindset just a few short months later.\"\n\nO'Connell runs down when Vikings will start McCarthy\n\nO'Connell is looking to take the time of McCarthy becoming the No. 1 quarterback that himself and general manager Kwesi Adofo-Mensah know he can be. Last season for the Wolverines, McCarthy threw for 2,991 yards, 22 touchdowns, and four interceptions leading the program to a perfect 15-0 record.\n\nCurrently on the Vikings roster, they have four quarterbacks including McCarthy with the others being the likely starter in former first round pick in Sam Darnold, Nick Mullens, and Jaren Hall, the latter two who started games last season. However, there is no doubt that the ultimate plan is for McCarthy to take over the reigns at some point as O'Connell went into detail to express what would need to happen for the Vikings to pull the trigger and make him the starting quarterback per ESPN.\n\n\"The comfort level that he has within our offense and his ability to then translate it to adverse situations and difficult aspects of playing quarterback in the NFL aren't magnified by inexperience,\" O'Connell said.\n\n\"But I want to be very clear that the expectation is for this player to not be perfect,\" O'Connell continued. \"He's going to have growing pains, he's going to learn on the fly. I'm not trying to remove that aspect of it, either, but [deciding when he will play] is not something you can write up on a board. It's a feeling.\"\n\nMcCarthy of concerns about Vikings job security in relation to McCarthy\n\nHowever, it also must be thought about the job security of such people as O'Connell and Adofo-Mensah where if the rebuild is not going well, they could jump the gun early and make McCarthy go out to the field earlier than expected. On the other hand, the 39-year old head coach for the Vikings since 2022 says that \"those circumstances cannot affect what J.J.'s development plan is\" especially since he reveals that he has an \"obligation to have the best interests\" of the rookie since he was a former quarterback himself.\n\n\"It's just more about what is in the best interest of the organization,\" O'Connell said. \"Those circumstances cannot affect what J.J.'s development plan is or any other player on the team for that matter. It just can't be something that selfishly ever impacts that decision.\n\n\"That really won't change,\" O'Connell continued. \"Because, and I don't know if it's the former quarterback in me or not, but I do feel an obligation to have the best interests of not only J.J. but our entire team, at heart, when we make that decision.\"\n\nVikings hoping McCarthy can bring back winning ways for Minnesota\n\nThe NFC North is only getting better and since they took a step backwards last year, mostly due to the health of the previously mentioned Cousins, they are banking on McCarthy becoming the face of the franchise. It seemed as if Minnesota got the player they wanted as they had a litter to pick from in what was a quarterback-heavy draft though they probably would have to move up for a top guy since they were the 10th pick.\n\n\"I believe in J.J. McCarthy,\" O'Connell said. \"But to get him in the building the right way under the right circumstances, and having another first-round pick like Dallas Turner helps that.\"\n\n\"What people don't understand about the quarterback-selection process,\" O'Connell continued, \"is that it's not just the quarterback themselves. It's: 'What does the rest of the picture look like with that quarterback?'\"\n\nVikings general manager has faith in O'Connell's plan for McCarthy\n\nEither way, it seems as if the organization is bought in to the plan that O'Connell has for McCarthy to truly become the quarterback everybody is hoping to be. One major figure who has that \"faith\" is the Vikings general manager who believes they can mold McCarthy into the player that can take the team over the hump.\n\n\"Those things [O'Connell] talked about are the reason why I have so much faith in him,\" Adofo-Mensah said. \"to take a mold-and-play like [McCarthy] with talent and traits that are as high-end as anybody, and mold him into that player we want him to be.\n\n\"A lot of times when we go back over history,\" Adofo-Mensah continued. \"And we say, 'These quarterbacks have missed.' There's a lot of hands that are dirty in that regard, and we're going to make sure that our hands are clean and give him the best opportunity he can to be the best player he can be in this offense.\"\n\nMcCarthy bought into offensive scheme of O'Connell\n\nBesides the head coach, the general manager, and others, one person that also has to be bought in to the plan for it to work is McCarthy himself who has the pressure now to take the franchise to the stratosphere. On the other hand, he feels comfortable where he is currently at, ever since O'Connell pitched his offense to McCarthy and others at Michigan's pro day according to ESPN.\n\n\"It was the way [O'Connell] presents the install,\" McCarthy said, \"the way he compartmentalizes everything about how to look at this play individually and how to make it more relatable to what your knowledge is and how you can smoothly and efficiently step into this playbook.\n\n\"That was something that was truly unique,\" McCarthy continued. \"Because you go around to so many defensive coaches like [Washington's] Dan Quinn and [New England's] Jerod Mayo, and being able to have that relationship as former QB and current QB, it's truly special and it means a lot.\"\n\nAt any rate, it should be an interesting season for the Vikings as they look to improve after a 7-10 record last season which put them third in the NFC North. They start the upcoming season on the road against the New York Giants on Sunday, Sept. 8.", "source": {"uri": "clutchpoints.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ClutchPoints"}, "authors": [{"uri":

This is a spot that has seen a lot of change for the purple since last season ended but there's also quite a bit to be excited about here.\n\nIf you want to refresh your memories by taking a look at our defensive line and inside linebacker previews before we move on to the outside linebackers, they're linked right there.\n\nOutside linebackers on the roster\n\nWhen this team started Training Camp a year ago, the top three players at the outside linebacker position were Danielle Hunter, D.J. Wonnum, and Marcus Davenport. All three of those players have departed, and the top of the depth chart is now filled with three players that should give Vikings' fans a lot to be excited about.\n\nGreenard was the Vikings' first signing of the free agency period, agreeing to a four-year pact worth around $18 million/year. The Vikings are betting on his upside after the 2023 he put together for the Houston Texans. He put up 12.5 sacks last season to lead the Houston defense and is going to be counted on to lead the pass rush in Minnesota this year. Greenard has had some injury problems in the past, including playing just eight games in 2022 because of a calf injury and missing four games in 2021 with a foot issue. If he stays healthy, he has the potential to be a force for Brian Flores' defense.\n\nFellow free agent signee Andrew Van Ginkel is coming off of an injury that ended his 2023 season in early January. He's rehabbing a Lisfranc injury, and though there are a few rumblings that he could start Training Camp on the Physically Unable to Perform List it sounds like he'll be ready fairly early on. Van Ginkel is also coming off of his best NFL season, as the former fifth-round pick collected six sacks and 20 quarterback pressures in 2023. Like Greenard, the Vikings are also betting that Van Ginkel will continue to improve in his new scheme.\n\nThe Vikings made a bold move in the 2024 NFL Draft to secure the services of Dallas Turner, and it's not hard to see why. Going into draft night, Turner was widely considered the best defensive player in his class. Fortunately for the Vikings, the unprecedented run of offensive players taken at the top of Round One pushed Turner down to the point that the Vikings felt comfortable making a trade up for him. The 2023 SEC Defensive Player of the Year, Turner will inevitably be compared to Danielle Hunter and has that sort of potential. If Van Ginkel's injury lingers longer than anticipated, he could get his opportunity sooner rather than later, but will almost certainly make an impact right away as a situational pass rusher at the very least.\n\nPat Jones is heading into his contract year with the Vikings, and while he's shown the occasional flash over his first three seasons, he hasn't shown any real consistency. Given who's ahead of him on the depth chart at this point, I'm not sure how many more opportunities he's going to get with the Vikings. He'll probably end up staying with the team as a depth piece but I'd be surprised if this wasn't his last season with the purple.\n\nA lot of Vikings fans, myself included, are looking forward to seeing Gabriel Murphy get his opportunity this preseason. Graded by most outlets as a mid-round pick in the 2024 NFL Draft, Murphy somehow fell out of the Draft completely and made his way to Minnesota as an undrafted free agent. After striking gold with Ivan Pace Jr. last year, the hope is that the Vikings have hit the UDFA jackpot again. If you want a more complete breakdown of Murphy, you can read Warren's piece on him from a few days ago right here.\n\nSpeaking of UDFAs, Andre Carter II is back and hoping for more of an opportunity than he managed to get last season. After making the initial 53-man roster, Carter appeared in 12 games and actually played twice as many defensive snaps as Brian Asamoah, who we talked about in yesterday's preview piece. The book on Carter was that he needed to get stronger, so we'll see what kind of magic a full season in an NFL strength and conditioning program has done for him.\n\nJihad Ward is the definition of a journeyman, as he heads into his eighth season and makes the Vikings his seventh NFL stop. He's spent the past two seasons with the New York Giants and appeared in all 34 regular season games for the team over those two years. He had a career-high in sacks with the Giants last year with five, and it will be interesting to see if he can pin down a role with the Vikings. The team might be more interested in the upside of someone like Murphy or Carter than they are in an aging veteran like Ward.\n\nOwen Porter signed with the Vikings as an undrafted free agent from Marshall and is going to have an uphill battle to make the squad. He could be a practice squad candidate. The same could be said for Bo Richter, though Richter playing at Air Force should give him a leg up in my thoroughly unbiased opinion. Richter was injured for a good portion of the offseason program, however, so he's a little behind the curve going into Training Camp.\n\nThat's a look at the outside linebacking corps for the Vikings as we head into Training Camp, folks.

McCarthy signing rookie deal worth $21 million", "body": "J.J. McCarthy during a summer offseason practice with the Vikings. / Image courtesy of the Minnesota Vikings\n\nMinnesota Vikings fans can collectively breathe a sigh of relief.\n\nESPN's Adam Schefter reported Friday that the Vikings and J.J. McCarthy have finally come to terms on the quarterback's rookie deal. McCarthy is signing a four-year, $21.85 million contract that is fully guaranteed, witch Schefter saying the deal includes a $12.71 million signing bonus.\n\nMcCarthy was one of three remaining first-round draft picks yet to sign a rookie contract, with the others being teammate Dallas Turner and Bengals lineman Amarius Mims. There had been growing concern about the lack of movement on a deal with McCarthy as Vikings training camp approached. Now those fears can be put to rest.\n\nAs the 10th overall pick in the 2024 draft, McCarthy is seen as the Vikings' quarterback of the future. Head coach Kevin O'Connell has been hesitant to rush the rookie this offseason, saying McCarthy has to clear 'benchmarks' before being able to take meaningful snaps. O'Connell wrapped up team OTA's by saying that former No. 3 overall pick Sam Darnold \"would be the guy\" he looks to get starting snaps heading into camp.\n\nThat's not to say McCarthy doesn't have a chance of impressing this summer. O'Connell said in a Friday radio interview that he is looking forward to a \"competitive\" camp between Darnold and McCarthy.", "source": {"uri": "si.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sports Illustrated"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota_Vikings", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota Vikings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adam_Schefter", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Adam Schefter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rookie", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Rookie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draft_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Draft (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Quarterback"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "ESPN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_O'Connell_(American_football)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kevin O'Connell (American football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signing_bonus", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Signing bonus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Training_camp", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Training camp"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turner_Broadcasting_System", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Turner Broadcasting System"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cincinnati_Bengals", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cincinnati Bengals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_coach", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Head coach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sam_Darnold", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sam Darnold"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cheerleading", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cheerleading", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice/Email_Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice/Email Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 93}], "image": "https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_crop,w_1100,h_618,x_0,y_0/c_fill,w_1440,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/images/voltaxMediaLibrary/mmsport/inside_the_vikings/01j10nz11b0cyb933h1a.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9746606", "eventUri": "eng-9746606", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.04313725490196085, "wgt": 192, "relevance": 1}

It appears they have figured out a process that works for both sides with the pay structure not yet known.\n\nMcCarthy getting his contract signed is huge for the Vikings. He will be in a competition with Sam Darnold for the starting quarterback job, but the reality is that McCarthy is in a competition with himself. He will be considered for the starting quarterback job once he hits certain benchmarks rather than directly competing with Darnold.\n\nMcCarthy is set to report to training camp on Sunday afternoon.

Because of the number of players at the positions, we're going to break them down into inside linebackers and outside linebackers. Our focus today will be on the inside players. The Vikings' main roster page lists players as either LB or OLB, so everyone with OLB will be in tomorrow's article.\n\nIf you'd like to go back and check out yesterday's look at the defensive line before you check out this piece, you can find it right here.\n\nInside linebackers on the roster\n\nCashman comes to the team as one of the big signings they made in free agency. A star at both Eden Prairie High School and the Minnesota Golden Gophers, he returns to his home state after starting his career with the New York Jets and spending the past two years with the Houston Texans. Cashman was the Texans' leading tackler last season and will step into the spot vacated by Jordan Hicks' departure. He had a PFF grade of 83.7 last season, which was fifth among all linebackers. Hopefully Cashman can continue on his upward trajectory and give the Vikings a formidable inside linebacker tandem.\n\nThe other half of that tandem, Ivan Pace Jr., exploded onto the scene for the Vikings last season. An undrafted free agent, Pace started 11 of 17 games for the Vikings and recorded 102 tackles. He even captured a Defensive Player of the Week Award, getting that honor in the Vikings' 3-0 victory over Las Vegas. Pace did enough in his rookie season to show that he should be a player the Vikings plan to build around for the long-term. I don't think we're going to see a sophomore slump for Pace or anything like that, and it will be interesting to see how he continues to develop in Brian Flores' defense.\n\nBrian Asamoah was a player that a lot of folks were excited about towards the end of his rookie season, but he's kind of gotten lost. He's yet to start a game in his first two seasons (though he's appeared in 29 games) and played just 4%. . .yes, four percent. . .of the team's defensive snaps last season. He's appeared in more than 60% of the team's special teams plays over his first two seasons, but you would generally expect more from a third-round pick than what Asamoah has shown over his first two seasons. This is going to be a make-or-break year for him.\n\nKamu Grugier-Hill has been around the block a few times. He was drafted in 2016 and the Vikings are his seventh NFL stop. He has a history with Brian Flores, as he played for the Miami Dolphins in 2020 while Flores was the head coach there. He played in all 17 games for the Carolina Panthers last season and got five starts. Grugier-Hill doesn't really seem to be the sort of player a team is going to be able to rely on as any sort of long-term answer, but he hopefully won't be called on in that capacity.\n\nAbraham Beauplan might have the best name on the Vikings' roster. At the very least, he's on the short list in that category. He suffered an injury during Training Camp last year and was placed on injured reserve. He wound up getting waived with an injury settlement, with the Vikings re-signing him to the practice squad in January. Beauplan could potentially be a player the Vikings want to develop, and it wouldn't be surprising to see him back on the practice squad again this year.\n\nK.J. Cloyd comes to the Vikings as an undrafted free agent from Miami (FL). Cloyd started half of the Hurricanes' games in 2023 and collected 42 tackles, including 6.5 tackles for loss. That's about all I can tell you about him, unfortunately. There isn't a whole lot out there about him in the way of scouting reports, though The Athletic pointed out that he did have an interception of J.J. McCarthy in the team's first practice.\n\nDallas Gant is another undrafted free agent, having played his college ball at Toledo. Gant was a first-team All-MAC performer in 2022 and 2023 and transferred to Toledo after starting his college career at The. . .dramatic pause. . .Ohio State University. The book on Gant appears to be that he's more of a run stopper than a coverage linebacker. We'll see if he can make enough of an impression on the coaching staff in Training Camp to garner a practice squad spot.\n\nThose are the inside linebackers for our Minnesota Vikings as we get closer to the start of Training Camp, folks.

He is expected to compete with veteran Sam Darnold for the starting job, though coach Kevin O'Connell has said the Vikings will not rush McCarthy into action before he's ready.\n\nBefore McCarthy assumes the starting job, O'Connell told ESPN the 21-year-old must demonstrate \"the comfort level that he has within our offense and his ability to then translate it to adverse situations and difficult aspects of playing quarterback in the NFL aren't magnified by inexperience\" before he takes the reins.\n\n\"But I want to be very clear that the expectation is for this player to not be perfect,\" O'Connell said. \"He's going to have growing pains, he's going to learn on the fly.

McCarthy / Image courtesy of Minnesota Vikings\n\nMinnesota Vikings head coach Kevin O'Connell is \"looking forward\" to a \"competitive\" camp between quarterbacks J.J. McCarthy and Sam Darnold.\n\nMinnesota filled the void left by Kirk Cousins' offseason departure with former No. 3 overall pick Sam Darnold and rookie J.J. McCarthy, who the team selected with the 10th overall pick in the draft. O'Connell spoke glowingly of what he's seen from his rookie QB during a Friday appearance on KFAN's The Power Trip Morning Show.\n\n\"J.J.'s been absolutely awesome. When you're drafting a quarterback you've got to be all in. We spent a lot of time, energy, traveling around the country spending time with these guys that we wanted to really evaluate and consider bringing to our team,\" said O'Connell. \"From the moment that I got a chance to meet JJ, obviously his season at Michigan, the success he's had at every level of football, it all kind of makes sense when you meet the kid. Everything he's been since he's been here as part of our team, since we were fortunate enough to draft him, has been that. I'm really, really excited about where he's going to go. My hope is that he's a Minnesota Vikings quarterback for a really long time. He's doing everything in his power, I'm sure he's going to have a great training camp.\"\n\nO'Connell has so far been hesitant to say when Vikings fans could see McCarthy take meaningful snaps, mentioning several times throughout the team's offseason activities that the rookie needs to clear 'benchmarks' before getting to take the field. Throughout minicamp and OTAs Darnold primarily took first-team snaps and O'Connell ended OTAs by saying Darnold \"would be the guy\" he looks to as the team's QB1 based on the \"spring he's had and the career he's had.\"\n\nThat's not to say there isn't a chance McCarthy takes the reigns at some point during his rookie season. The Vikings selected McCarthy with the 10th overall selection, placing a lot of pressure on the QB and organization for success. O'Connell said there was some \"nervous moments\" as quarterbacks started flying off the board during the draft but that they were ultimately \"very fortunate\" to land McCarthy.\n\nOn when he thinks McCarthy will be ready to take over the Vikings' high-powered offense, O'Connell said it's about seeing consistency from the rookie.\n\n\"I know me, personally, as the playcaller I have so much dialogue with these guys. Mentally you'll kind of know, at least when he's ready to go out there and truly take the reigns and run with it,\" said O'Connell. \"I think it's one of those things, physically it's not going to be much for J.J., just because he's very, very talented, has a really strong arm, very accurate. At this point he's just working through some techniques and fundamentals of footwork and timing of how we run our offense. I think it's going to be a matter of consistency. Putting some good days together. Then getting some opportunities in the preseason games and really showing where he's at.\"\n\nO'Connell noted his own short-lived career is having an influence on how he wants to develop McCarthy. As a fourth-round draft pick by the Patriots in 2008, O'Connell was brought in to back up Tom Brady. In the middle of his second training camp with the Patriots, O'Connell was waived. He then spent the next few years bouncing around the league before the calls stopped coming ahead of the 2012 season.\n\n\"Ultimately, I'm pretty sensitive to the quarterback journey,\" O'Connell said. \"You look at our quarterback room right now and a guy like Sam Darnold, what his quarterback journey was and types of situations that maybe weren't ultimately conducive to him becoming the best version of himself. I think he's learned from a lot of those things and now has an opportunity to apply all those things he's learned in a pretty darn good situation, throwing to Justin Jefferson and Jordan [Addison] and T.J. [Hockenson] and the rest of our guys.\"\n\nMinnesota has a roster that is set up to compete right now. Darnold was brought in as a bridge until McCarthy is ready and clears all of O'Connell's benchmarks. How long that will be ultimately rests on former Michigan quarterback.\n\n\"I think with J.J. it's just going to be a matter of, it really is the good ole boring clich\u00e9 of 'one day at a time.' And as he grows, gets that comfort zone and we really build an offense that is quarterback friendly, I think we've done that here. I think it's just a matter of putting it together a day at a time and then having that confidence in himself to feel like we can go out on a Sunday and attack an opponent with every facet of our offense,\" O'Connell said.\n\nMcCarthy, Darnold and the Vikings begin training camp July 27.", "source": {"uri": "si.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sports Illustrated"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_O'Connell_(American_football)", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kevin O'Connell (American football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draft_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Draft (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota_Vikings", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota Vikings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rookie", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rookie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Quarterback"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sam_Darnold", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sam Darnold"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kirk_Cousins", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kirk Cousins"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_coach", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Head coach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "American football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Training_camp", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Training camp"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_England_Patriots", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "New England Patriots"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vikings", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Vikings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michigan", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Michigan"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Michigan"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justin_Jefferson", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Justin Jefferson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Brady", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tom Brady"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exhibition_game", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Exhibition game"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 91}], "image": "https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_crop,w_1919,h_1079,x_0,y_0/c_fill,w_1440,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/images/voltaxMediaLibrary/mmsport/inside_the_vikings/01j35s3c9vs18ejj24x1.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9746606", "eventUri": "eng-9746606", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-27", "textStart": 4745, "textEnd": 4752}], "sentiment": 0.2705882352941176, "wgt": 184, "relevance": 1}

McCarthy added 632 rushing yards and 10 rushing touchdowns on 161 carries.\n\nMinnesota traded up to select McCarthy with the 10th pick in this year's draft, but the current expectation is for the rookie sit behind NFL veteran Sam Darnold in 2024. The Vikings signed Darnold to a one-year deal worth $10 million this offseason after their previous starter, Kirk Cousins, departed to sign with the Atlanta Falcons.\n\n- Enjoy more Michigan Wolverines coverage on Michigan Wolverines On SI -\n\nFormer Michigan QB J.J.

Those decisions were largely influenced by general manager Kwesi Adofo-Mensah and head coach Kevin O'Connell. The pressure for a positive outcome this season is clearly on both men.\n\nBut as far as the players are concerned, there are a number of candidates who will bear the most responsibility for the team's results this season. After letting Cousins walk away and sign with the Atlanta Falcons, the Vikings have brought in Sam Darnold to serve as their starting quarterback -- at least until rookie J.J. McCarthy is ready to take over as QB1.\n\nDarnold appears to be a decent place holder, but there is nothing in his past performances to indicate that he can lead this team consistently in the first month or two of the season. The Vikings are up against it in the first part of the season, as they follow a reasonable season opener against the New York Giants with tough games against the San Francisco 49ers, Houston Texans and Green Bay Packers before going to London to play the New York Jets.\n\nA start of 1-3 seems quite likely before the Vikings go overseas. Once they return, they will host the defending NFC North champion Detroit Lions before going on the road against the Rams for a Thursday night game.\n\nThe belief here is that Darnold will start all of those games and it seems almost certain that the team will be below .500 at that point.\n\nMcCarthy to take over in November for Vikings\n\nThe rookie from Michigan may be pushing Darnold well before this point, but O'Connell will not want to put him into the starting lineup until the team has a much better chance of competing and winning. The second half of the season will not be easy, but it should provide far more opportunities for wins than the first seven games.\n\nMcCarthy should be a fast learner and he is extremely competitive. He also proved to be a sharp passer who could make big plays against top opponents during his career with the Wolverines. Performing well against elite teams was Cousins' undoing with the Vikings and it appears to be McCarthy's top asset as he begins his professional career.\n\nHowever, the NFC North is not the Big Ten, and he may need some time before he is performing consistently. He is likely to flash his skills and put a few memorable plays together, but he is not likely to bear the full responsibility for the outcome of the season during his rookie season. That is not what Adofo-Mensah and O'Connell want, and they should be able to control the environment enough to protect their long-term investment in McCarthy.\n\nJustin Jefferson is the best receiver in the NFL, and he will have to prove it every week\n\nJustin Jefferson has demonstrated through his first four seasons in the NFL that he is the best receiver in the league. That is the opinion of multiple coaches and executives throughout professional football, and the Vikings decided to reward him in the offseason with a 4-year, $140 million contract.\n\nThat kind of financial remuneration brings quite a bit of responsibility and pressure. The key to team performance is usually based on quarterback play, but the Vikings are going with a placeholder and a rookie at that position, so the pressure in this case falls to Jefferson.\n\nNot only must he produce at a very high level, he must make his biggest plays when the game is on the line against Minnesota's best opponents.\n\nHe has been up to this in the past, with his signature game coming in the 2022 season on the road against the Buffalo Bills. He made an incredible fourth-down catch late in the game that gave the Vikings a chance to win, and they were able to come through with the victory. He must make huge catches all year if the team is going to surprise observers and play winning football.\n\nJefferson was limited last year by a hamstring injury that forced him to miss seven games, but he still caught 68 passes for 1,074 yards and 5 touchdowns. More than 36 percent of his receptions went for 20 yards or more, and that indicates how dangerous he is.\n\nSince his rookie season in 2020, Jefferson has 29 100-yard games, and that leads all NFL receivers.\n\nThe pressure is clearly on Jefferson to carry the team on his shoulders.

McCarthy Has 'Open-Ended' Timeline to Become Vikings' Starting QB", "body": "The Minnesota Vikings aren't putting any pressure on J.J. McCarthy to become their starting quarterback.\n\nPer ESPN's Kevin Seifert, Vikings head coach Kevin O'Connell is both publicly and privately saying that McCarthy has an \"open-ended\" timetable to take over as the starter.\n\nMinnesota signed Sam Darnold as a free agent to serve as a potential bridge quarterback if the coaching staff determines McCarthy isn't ready for a starting role when the season begins.\n\nThe Vikings are planning to have a competition between Darnold and McCarthy in training camp and preseason. O'Connell has said they want to create a \"competitive environment\" at every position, but particularly at quarterback.\n\nMcCarthy was a polarizing prospect in the 2024 NFL draft. He had tremendous success as a two-year starter on a loaded Michigan team. The 21-year-old only attempted 713 passes in three seasons with the Wolverines.\n\nBy comparison, three quarterbacks drafted ahead of McCarthy -- Caleb Williams, Jayden Daniels and Michael Penix Jr. -- all had more than 1,000 pass attempts in college.\n\nB/R NFL scout Derrik Klassen described McCarthy as a \"point-and-shoot thrower over the middle with just enough creativity and athleticism to be interesting.\"\n\nAll of this is to say there will likely be a steep developmental curve for McCarthy in the NFL. The Vikings have a terrific support system in place around him with two dynamic offensive tackles and a group of pass-catchers that includes Justin Jefferson, Jordan Addison and T.J. Hockenson.\n\nO'Connell has established himself as one of the best offensive play-calling head coaches in the NFL.\n\nThe Vikings have an early bye in Week 6 after playing against the New York Jets in London on Oct. 6. They could use that as a point to start McCarthy if he doesn't win the job in training camp, but giving him as much time as necessary to ensure he's fully ready to go when he gets on the field is the smart long-term play for the organization.", "source": {"uri": "bleacherreport.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Bleacher Report"}, "authors": [{"uri": "adam_wells@bleacherreport.com", "name": "Adam Wells", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_O'Connell_(American_football)", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kevin O'Connell (American football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota_Vikings", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota Vikings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Quarterback"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michigan_Wolverines_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Michigan Wolverines football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_agent", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Free agent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "ESPN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_coach", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Head coach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sam_Darnold", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sam Darnold"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caleb_Williams", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Caleb Williams"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Penix_Jr.", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Michael Penix Jr."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jayden_Daniels", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jayden Daniels"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draft_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Draft (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scout_(sport)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Scout (sport)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jordan_Addison", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jordan Addison"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justin_Jefferson", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Justin Jefferson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T._J._Hockenson", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "T.

McCarthy", "body": "(Minneapolis, MN) - The Vikings have built a team ideal for any quarterback - a talented head coach in Kevin O'Connell, an elite receiving core of Justin Jefferson, T.J. Hockenson and Jordan Addison, and the protection of a strong offensive line.\n\nWith the opportunity to take on this position are veteran journeyman Sam Darnold, and rookie first-rounder J.J. McCarthy. While O'Connell announced that the plan would be for Darnold to start for the team, it is only a matter of time before McCarthy takes the reins.\n\nAfter a successful career with now-Chargers coach Jim Harbaugh at Michigan that concluded with a national title, McCarthy was the 5th quarterback taken off the board in the 2024 NFL Draft.\n\nThough Minnesota is looking to develop the young signal caller, his draft position means that he is bound to start sooner or later, after all this isn't really a Jordan Love situation, Sam Darnold is no Aaron Rodgers, and there is no longer a Kirk Cousins to learn from.\n\nThe Vikings coaching and management has seen top-tier talent peeter out in the big leagues when thrust on the field day one, and are looking to avoid that with McCarthy. \"I don't know if it's the former quarterback in me or not, but I do feel an obligation to have the best interests of not only J.J. but our entire team, at heart, when we make that decision [to start him]\" said O'Connell.\n\nThe head coach also added that \"the expectation is for this player to not be perfect,\" understanding no amount of practice can iron out all the growing pain. \"He's going to learn on the fly. I'm not trying to remove that aspect of it either, but [starting] is not something you can write up on a board. It's a feeling.\"\n\nFans will see when that \"feeling\" strikes O'Connell this season or at all. The Vikings are not expected to be playing for much with two playoff teams in their division and a revamped Bears squad on the rise.

Mandatory Credit: Thomas Shea-USA TODAY Sports\n\nThe Minnesota Vikings and J.J.

McCarthy signed a four-year, fully-guaranteed contract worth $21.85 million", "body": "After the 2023 season, the Minnesota Vikings and QB Kirk Cousins agreed to go their separate ways. Cousins signed a lucrative long-term deal with Atlanta. Leaving the Vikings with choices. Would they find a QB through free agency or use one of their two first-round picks to draft one?\n\nMinnesota chose the latter option and drafted former Michigan QB and 2023 national champion, J.J. McCarthy. The 21-year-old was the fifth QB to go off the board in the first round. He was the fifth QB taken in the first 10 picks. ESPN's Adam Schefter announced that Vikings rookie QB J.J. McCarthy signed a four-year, fully guaranteed contract worth $21.85 million.\n\nThe Minnesota Vikings have to trade up in the 2024 NFL Draft to select QB J.J. McCarthy. Caleb Williams, Jaden Daniels, Drake Maye, and Michael Penix Jr. were all picked before McCarthy. Options for the Vikings at QB started to become slim and they had to act fast on McCarthy. He's not the most polished QB in this class, but he's a proven winner when he has the right group of players around him. Head coach Kevin O'Connell knows that McCarthy is going to be a work in progress.\n\nThat's why the team brought in veteran QB Sam Darnold. There's a strong chance that McCarthy is not the Vikings QB to start Week 1. Minnesota's bye is in Week 6. Darnold could start the first five games of the season, giving J.J. McCarthy more time to learn the offense and get ready to make his first start. If the rookie is ready, he could take over after the bye and start the final 12 games of the 2024 season.\n\nAt Michigan, J.J. McCarthy's best season was 22 touchdowns for 2,991 yards and four interceptions in 2023. While modern-day college football offenses love to pass the ball, McCarthy played on a run-first team. The young QB will need to adjust to the playcalling of the NFL and be ready to pass the ball more. It will be interesting to see how J.J. McCarthy plays for the Vikings after he was doubted coming out of Michigan. He's a proven winner but does the QB have what it takes to succeed at the next level?", "source": {"uri": "sportslens.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sportslens.com"}, "authors": [{"uri": "zach_wolpin@sportslens.com", "name": "Zach Wolpin", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kirk_Cousins", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kirk Cousins"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota_Vikings", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota Vikings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Quarterback"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/College_football_national_championships_in_NCAA_Division_I_FBS", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "College football national championships in NCAA Division I FBS"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draft_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Draft (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rookie", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rookie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_agent", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Free agent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michigan", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Michigan"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Michigan"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Atlanta, Georgia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Atlanta, Georgia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caleb_Williams", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Caleb Williams"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Penix_Jr.", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Michael Penix Jr."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_O'Connell_(American_football)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kevin O'Connell (American football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bye_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bye (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adam_Schefter", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Adam Schefter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "ESPN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_coach", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Head coach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/College_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "College football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interception", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Interception"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Touchdown", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Touchdown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sam_Darnold", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sam Darnold"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Ten-Pin", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Ten-Pin", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Candlepin", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Candlepin", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://sportslens.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/J.J.-McCarthy-Vikings-pic.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9746606", "eventUri": "eng-9746606", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1686274509803922, "wgt": 169, "relevance": 1}

McCarthy (9) celebrates from the sidelines during the fourth quarter against the Washington Huskies in the 2024 College Football Playoff national championship game at NRG Stadium. Mandatory Credit: Kirby Lee-USA TODAY Sports / Kirby Lee-USA TODAY Sports\n\nAll of the 2024 NFL Draft first round quarterbacks are now under contract after the Minnesota Vikings and J.J. McCarthy have crossed the finish line.\n\nThere is, however, one small wrinkle in regards to McCarthy's deal with Minnesota.\n\nWhile X (formerly known as Twitter) user PrettyRickey213 is not a verified source, he has been leaking inside scoops throughout free agency and the draft this offseason. PrettyRickey213 has been adamant that a huge contention between McCarthy and the Vikings was the payout of his signing bonus.\n\nThe apparent insider has now stated the Vikings wilted on their end and paid out the entirety of McCarthy's signing bonus upfront to get the deal across the finish line. This is the first time the Vikings have ever done that.\n\nMcCarthy was guaranteed the full amount of that bonus regardless of whether or not it was spread across four years or paid out day one, but it is an interesting wrinkle that his camp was able to get the deal done. As a result now, McCarthy will not be forced into a holdout as the Vikings get ready for minicamp.\n\n-- Enjoy more free NFL Draft coverage with NFL Draft on SI --\n\nMORE NFL DRAFT NEWS", "source": {"uri": "si.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sports Illustrated"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota_Vikings", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota Vikings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Quarterback"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NRG_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NRG Stadium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_Huskies", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Washington Huskies"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michigan_Wolverines", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Michigan Wolverines"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/College_football_national_championships_in_NCAA_Division_I_FBS", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "College football national championships in NCAA Division I FBS"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/College_Football_Playoff", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "College Football Playoff"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Houston", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Houston"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Houston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signing_bonus", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Signing bonus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draft_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Draft (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_agent", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Free agent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sports_Illustrated", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sports Illustrated"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Ten-Pin", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Ten-Pin", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Candlepin", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Candlepin", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_crop,w_7154,h_4024,x_0,y_149/c_fill,w_1440,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/images/ImagnImages/mmsport/nfl_draft/01j365cvmwarn3y8mdg2.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9746606", "eventUri": "eng-9746606", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.5137254901960784, "wgt": 166, "relevance": 1}

There is, obviously, a football-related component to the crash that ended his life nearly two weeks ago. But I'm not about to go into that in this space. I'm just going to take a moment to lament the fact that a young man who went through a lot to finally get his opportunity in the NFL isn't going to get to see those dreams realized. It's incredibly tragic, made more so by the fact that the crash was completely preventable and happened because of the irresponsibility of another individual. Rest in peace, Khyree.\n\nWith that, let's move on to the rest of the cornerback preview.\n\nCornerbacks on the roster\n\nThe team's official roster page lists Najee Thompson as a cornerback but since we learned he's moving to safety we'll put him into the safety preview instead. It's not going to change much of the eval but that's where he'll be.\n\nOne of last year's big free agent signings, Byron Murphy Jr. had a pretty solid season for the Vikings in 2023. He missed the last three games with an injury, and it probably isn't a coincidence that his absence coincides with the defense completely falling apart. Murphy isn't a \"shutdown\" corner or anything like that, but he's certainly well above average and has the versatility to play either the slot or the outside, which I'm sure Brian Flores appreciated. The team will be looking for him to pick up where he left off last season.\n\nMekhi Blackmon seemed to get better as the season went on in his first campaign and could make a move to supplant Murphy as the team's top corner at some point this season. The expectations for him have certainly increased, and if he can meet those expectations the Minnesota secondary should be significantly better. Pro Football Focus has made him a member of their All-Breakout Team for this season, so it isn't just Vikings fans who are expecting him to take the next step.\n\nThe Vikings turned some heads in free agency when they signed veteran Shaq Griffin to a one-year deal. Griffin has some Pro Bowl pedigree but has had issues over the past couple of seasons, including missing most of the 2022 season with the Jacksonville Jaguars with a back injury. After parting ways with the Jags, he had stops in Houston and Carolina. Griffin is at his best in off-coverage, which makes him a solid fit for what Flores wants to do with the secondary. He's a fairly low-risk, potentially high-reward signing for a secondary that needs some bolstering.\n\nAkayleb Evans has been consistently inconsistent over the past couple of seasons. He's had moments where he looks like he could be an upper-level NFL cornerback and follows those moments up by getting badly beaten or missing an important tackle. I don't know if he was dealing with injuries or what it might have been, but he almost looked disinterested towards the end of last season. As it stands now, it appears he's the fourth cornerback on the depth chart. He has plenty of talent and if the Vikings should lose one of those top three guys they could do worse than having Evans waiting to step in.\n\nLike his draftmate, Lewis Cine, Andrew Booth Jr. might be running out of chances. He got a decent amount of snaps towards the end of last season and was a lot better than he was for most of his rookie year, which might be damning with faint praise. He's now in his third NFL season, and with a pretty firmly established group in front of him, he's going to need to have a pretty good Training Camp to prove that he still belongs on this roster. I don't know if he gets cut, since I think he's been a decent special teams player, but I don't know how much of a role he has in the defense at this point, either.\n\nDwight McGlothern is a player that a lot of folks appear to be keeping an eye on. He wound up going undrafted, which surprised a lot of people. He was the highest-graded overall cornerback by Pro Football Focus this past season, which makes him not getting his name called on Draft weekend even more surprising. He has good size for a cornerback, but despite that his abilities in run support are a bit lacking. You can read a full breakdown of McGlothern's game courtesy of Warren right here.\n\nJaylin Williams was on the practice squad for much of last season, though he was brought up to the active roster a couple of times late in the year. He didn't play a lot of snaps and I'm not sure if he figures into the long-term future of the team. Of course, I've been wrong about players before, but given how far down the depth chart he is I don't know how much we can hope for.\n\nThe same can be said of A.J. Green III, who the Vikings signed to a futures contract after the end of last season. Green has been in the league since 2020 and has appeared in 34 games for the Cleveland Browns over the past four seasons. However, he only appeared in three games last season and the Browns didn't seem terribly interested in keeping him around. From this perspective, he's definitely on the outside looking in as far as a roster spot is concerned.\n\nThat's a look at the cornerback position for the Minnesota Vikings, folks. We'll finish things up tomorrow with the safety spot. There might be a piece on the team's specialists before Training Camp gets underway if time permits.\n\nWhat do you think of the cornerback room heading into Training Camp, folks?", "source": {"uri": "dailynorseman.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Norseman"}, "authors": [{"uri": "christopher_gates@dailynorseman.com", "name": "Christopher Gates", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota_Vikings", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota Vikings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cornerback", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cornerback"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_agent", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Free agent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jackson,_Mississippi", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jackson, Mississippi"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Jackson, Mississippi"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian_Flores", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Brian Flores"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mekhi_Blackmon", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mekhi Blackmon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akayleb_Evans", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Akayleb Evans"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tackle_(gridiron_football_position)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tackle (gridiron football position)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pro_Football_Focus", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pro Football Focus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shaquille_O'Neal", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Shaquille O'Neal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pro_Bowl", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pro Bowl"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacksonville_Jaguars", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jacksonville Jaguars"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Houston", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Houston"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Houston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lewis_Cine", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lewis Cine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Booth_Jr.", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Andrew Booth Jr."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Practice_squad", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Practice squad"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A._J._Green", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "A.

McCarthy signs HUGE rookie contract with Minnesota Vikings", "body": "Matt Hartwell Matt covers all things Michigan football related for Maize n Brew and runs the social media accounts.\n\nFormer Michigan Wolverines quarterback J.J. McCarthy has officially inked a deal with the Minnesota Vikings, solidifying his place as their next franchise quarterback. McCarthy signed a four-year, fully-guaranteed contract worth $21.85 million, which includes a $12.7 million signing bonus and a fifth-year option, according to ESPN's Adam Schefter.\n\nThe Vikings' decision to trade up and select McCarthy with the No. 10 overall pick in the 2024 NFL Draft underscored their determination to bring in the Michigan star. This move was anticipated, as Minnesota had been closely linked with McCarthy before the draft and conducted a private workout with him.\n\nMinnesota's trade was a minor shift from No. 11 to No. 10, a strategic move given the early selection of quarterbacks Caleb Williams (No. 1), Jayden Daniels (No. 2), Drake Maye (No. 3) and Michael Penix Jr. (No. 8).\n\nMcCarthy led the Wolverines to the National Championship, showcasing his talents in an exceptional final season. McCarthy shined despite questions about his ceiling, largely due to Jim Harbaugh's offense relying heavily on a robust defense and running attack. He completed 72.3 percent of his passes for 2,991 yards, 22 touchdowns and only four interceptions, while also contributing 202 yards and three touchdowns rushing.\n\nMcCarthy's knack for avoiding critical turnovers complemented Michigan's team dynamic perfectly, and this skillset is expected to translate well to the NFL. In Minnesota, McCarthy is surrounded by a talented cast, including Justin Jefferson, Jordan Addison, T.J. Hockenson and Aaron Jones.\n\nAs McCarthy transitions to the NFL, Wolverines fans will undoubtedly follow his journey closely.

His talent and enthusiasm will most certainly be missed.\n\nHere is each player's outlook heading into camp....\n\nOn paper the Vikings' 2023 offseason signing looks like he did not have a particularly productive year, grading 60th out of 80 starting corners in PFF grade and allowing a 102.0 QB rating on throws into his coverage. But there is some context required. First, he only allowed 17 catches on 29 targets and an 88.4 rating after Week 3 and he was asked to take on a heavy workload with the majority of his snaps on the outside and playing a lot of off zone coverage that required him to come downhill and make high-difficulty tackles. This year the Vikings have vowed to play more man coverage and get him into the slot more often, which appeared to be the original plan last year before Josh Metellus emerged (and they struggled to find outside corner help).\n\nWe will be looking for any hints that Murphy Jr.'s assignment has been adjusted to fit his skills a little better than last season.\n\nOnce upon a time (2019) Griffin was considered a major part of Seattle's operation but after playing out only two years of his three-year, $40 million deal with the Jaguars and then bouncing between Houston and Carolina last year the Vikings picked him up for just $4.5 million on a one-year contract.\n\nDespite the modest dollar figure, it appears the Vikings are looking to Griffin to be their starting outside corner. Based on his past that could either work out very well and they could find a free agency steal or it could end up being a stretch. Griffin hasn't played over 500 snaps since 2021 and has 61.9 and 67.0 PFF coverage grades over the last two seasons.\n\nCan he become a Brian Flores reclamation project at 29 years old? The first hints of whether that's possible will come in camp.\n\nShaq Griffin / Image courtesy of the Minnesota Vikings\n\nThe rookie from USC quietly put together a strong rookie season. He graded by PFF as the third best rookie at his position and had the fourth most pass breakups. Blackmon allowed an 87.8 QB rating on 44 throws into his coverage and recorded the highest PFF tackling grade of all NFL corners.\n\nThat was in 434 snaps. Now his challenge is to continue that level of performance with an increased workload.\n\nThrough 15 weeks, Evans was ranked as PFF's 26th best corner (out of 70). He allowed only 16 receptions into his coverage at that point and was starting to look like a solid outside corner option for the future. But once Murphy Jr. went down with injury and the Vikings played tough competition everything fell apart. Evans ranked 84th of 84 corners that played at least 70 snaps over the final three weeks of the season.\n\nIs there a competition between Evans, Griffin and Blackmon or did the 2022 fourth-rounder fall so far out of favor with his play in Weeks 16-18 that Flores is focused elsewhere? Having a player on the bench who is capable of starting over long periods is a plus that the Vikings haven't had for some time but it seemed midway through last season they might be looking at a long-term starter rather than above average depth. Will anything in camp change that viewpoint?\n\nGoing into camp last year it didn't seem that Thompson had a snowball's chance in Minnesota summer but he proved to be a highly aggressive special teamer and earned the belief of special teams coordinator Matt Daniels. He ended up making the 53-man roster and playing 193 snaps on 'teams. The gunner position is not always easy to find so if Thompson continues his hard-hat stylings this year, particularly in the preseason games, he has a very good chance at being on the club again.\n\nThere are pluses and minuses to Booth Jr.'s 2023 campaign. On the positive side, he was not injured during the year, which was a major issue in his rookie season. When he did get an opportunity to play, the results weren't bad. He graded slightly above average in coverage and the longest pass he allowed in his direction was just 11 yards. The downside is that he was active and still barely played. Booth Jr. only saw a total of 151 snaps despite appearing in every game. The 2022 second-round pick only played more than 20 defensive snaps in three games, while regularly appearing on special teams.\n\nWe can only mildly call this a make-or-break camp for Booth Jr. because they are unlikely to cut him due to his ability to play special teams and provide some caliber of depth. It is only make-or-break from the perspective of the ex-Clemson corner becoming more than a highly-drafted bench player. If he can prove to Flores that he can handle a different style than he was drafted to play (in Ed Donatell's defense) than he could have a shot to play more than we expect heading into camp.\n\nThe undrafted free agent appeared in three games and played 24 total snaps in 2023. He came out of Indiana as a UDFA last year with a reputation as a smart, hard-nosed player and gained enough of the team's attention during camp to hang around on the practice squad. They liked enough of what they saw to bring him back, which means that the ex-Hoosier has a shot to make the 53 as depth.\n\nQuite possibly the most interesting UDFA going into camp this year, McGlothern is a 6-foot-2 corner with a nose for the football. He racked up eight career interceptions and made All-SEC second team in 2022. How did he go undrafted? Injuries last season and some issues with tackling and penalties may have turned teams away in the draft but he flashed some potential in minicamp to be intrigued.\n\nGreen III signed with Cleveland as a UDFA in 2020 and played 319 snaps with the Browns between 2021 and 2022 but saw very limited action on special teams last year. At 26 there isn't much upside to talk about with Green III but he might be able to fight for a practice squad job at a position that regularly has lots of injuries.\n\nIn minicamp there didn't appear to be much rotating going on with the cornerback group -- Griffin appeared to be locked into the starting job. Is there anything that Booth Jr. could do during the summer to take the job from the veteran free agent? Over the last two years we have only seen small flashes of the talent that earned Booth Jr. a high draft pick (and he was ranked even higher on draft boards in 2022 but dropped due to injury). Is this the year we see it consistently? Or will he fade into the background again?\n\nThere are remaining veteran free agents like Stephon Gilmore and Adoree Jackson still on the market. Will the Vikings make a last-minute addition or get a look at their corners on the field for a few weeks before deciding whether to make phone calls? That might depend on how much they buy into Griffin and the depth players.\n\nMaybe Ivan Pace Jr.'s success made us believe a little too much in the idea that the Vikings could land a standout undrafted free agent every year but we are always on the lookout for intriguing players who could eventually develop into something down the road and McGlothern's size and skillset put him at the top of the list this year.", "source": {"uri": "si.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sports Illustrated"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pro_Football_Focus", "type":

McCarthy: 'Tough kid, makes all the throws'", "body": "Michigan quarterback J.J. McCarthy points down the field during the second half of the College Football Playoff national championship game against Washington at NRG Stadium in Houston, Texas on Monday, Jan. 8, 2024. / Melanie Maxwell / USA TODAY NETWORK\n\nFormer Minnesota quarterback Brad Johnson knows a thing or two about being a QB in the NFL. Johnson, a 15-year pro, had two different stints with the Vikings. He started his career with Minnesota and played for the Vikings from 1994-1998 before being traded to Washington. He won a Super Bowl with Tampa Bay in 2002 before heading back to Minnesota from 2005-06. Johnson has the sixth-most passing yards in Vikings' history with 11,098 passing yards.\n\nHe was recently on Minnesota Tim's Podcast, and he was asked about the new Minnesota quarterback, J.J. McCarthy. The former Michigan signal caller was 27-1 as the starting quarterback, led the Wolverines to two-straight Big Ten titles, and won the National Championship in 2024. Johnson doubled down on McCarthy's winning ways. He also made it a point to emphasize McCarthy played under Jim Harbaugh and was well taught from that standpoint.\n\n\"The kids only had success in his life,\" started Johnson. \"From high school through college -- tough kid, makes all the throws. He's still young and he has a chance to have a long, long career. So I'm excited for J.J. McCarthy and his opportunity to play at this level and to play for the Vikings. If I had a choice last year in the draft, like where I wanted to go, it would've been the Minnesota Vikings. So I think J.J.'s in a great situation. He can learn from extremely great coaches and have some players in that QB room that have had that experience also that have played. He can kind of be ready for when his time comes. He's been well taught with Jim Harbaugh at Michigan. You win a national championship -- you've gone through something. But he's still young and got to give him time to grow. It's going to be fun to watch his career.\"\n\nAs Johnson mentioned, McCarthy was drafted into a perfect situation with the Vikings. Minnesota might've signed Sam Darnold this offseason with all intentions of starting him this year and allowing McCarthy to sit and learn. But that's not in McCarthy's DNA. He's going to fight and be ready for when No. 9 is called into the game. He will have an abundance of talent around him with the likes of Justin Jefferson, Jordan Addison, and T.J. Hockenson. Head coach Kevin O'Connell is one of the most quarterback-friendly coaches in the league and will help McCarthy grow as a quarterback.\n\nMost Michigan fans aren't happy McCarthy is playing against the Detroit Lions twice a year, but at the same time, be happy that McCarthy landed in one of the most perfect spots for his development. If the Vikings and O'Connell were able to make the offense move with Josh Dobbs, Nick Mullens, and Jaren Hall last year when Kirk Cousins went down -- imagine what they can do with McCarthy's skill set.\n\n- Enjoy more Michigan Wolverines coverage on Michigan Wolverines On SI -\n\nBig Ten coach on Ohio State: 'It's certainly beat Michigan or bust'\n\nAlex Orji is becoming the leader Michigan

McCarthy, Vikings Agree to 4-Year, $22M Guaranteed Rookie Contract", "body": "The Minnesota Vikings reportedly have their next franchise quarterback under contract.\n\nJ.J. McCarthy and the Vikings agreed to terms Friday on a four-year, fully-guaranteed deal worth $21.85 million, including a $12.7 million signing bonus, according to ESPN's Adam Schefter. The contract includes a fifth year option.\n\nMinnesota made it clear it wanted the Michigan product when it traded up to select him with the No. 10 overall pick of the 2024 NFL draft.\n\nThat the Vikings ended up with McCarthy didn't come as a surprise, as they were connected to him before the draft. They also conducted a private workout with him, according to ESPN's Adam Schefter.\n\nThey ultimately only moved up from No. 11 to No. 10 to get him with other quarterbacks going in the top eight in Caleb Williams (No. 1), Jayden Daniels (No. 2), Drake Maye (No. 3) and Michael Penix Jr. (No. 8).\n\nMcCarthy was one of the more intriguing storylines going into the draft, as he led the Wolverines to the College Football Playoff national championship and was largely excellent in his final collegiate season even if there were question marks about his overall ceiling because he wasn't asked to do too much in Jim Harbaugh's offense.\n\nMichigan largely relied on a strong defense and running back Blake Corum, but McCarthy still completed 72.3 percent of his passes for 2,991 yards, 22 touchdowns and four interceptions while adding 202 yards and three scores on the ground.\n\nHis ability to avoid critical turnovers worked perfectly as part of a team with Corum and the formidable defense.\n\nAnd it will also work perfectly in Minnesota if he can replicate that since he will once again be surrounded with plenty of talent.\n\nJustin Jefferson, Jordan Addison, T.J. Hockenson and Aaron Jones make up as strong of a group of surrounding playmakers as a rookie quarterback could ask for, and McCarthy will simply be tasked with getting the ball into their hands and avoiding mistakes.\n\nThat is something he consistently did at Michigan, so the partnership with the Vikings makes plenty of sense.", "source": {"uri": "bleacherreport.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Bleacher Report"}, "authors": [{"uri": "scott_polacek@bleacherreport.com", "name": "Scott Polacek", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draft_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Draft (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota_Vikings", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota Vikings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michigan_Wolverines_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Michigan Wolverines football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adam_Schefter", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Adam Schefter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Quarterback"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "ESPN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signing_bonus", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Signing bonus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drake_Maye", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Drake Maye"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caleb_Williams", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Caleb Williams"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Penix_Jr.", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Michael Penix Jr."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jayden_Daniels", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jayden Daniels"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/College_football_national_championships_in_NCAA_Division_I_FBS", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "College football national championships in NCAA Division I FBS"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/College_Football_Playoff", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "College Football Playoff"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jordan_Addison", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jordan Addison"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blake_Corum", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Blake Corum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justin_Jefferson", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Justin Jefferson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T._J._Hockenson", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "T.

McCarthy becoming QB1 can't be written on a board, it's a feeling", "body": "Late in Minnesota's offseason program, head coach Kevin O'Connell told reporters that veteran Sam Darnold would be the team's starting quarterback heading into training camp over the team's rookie No. 10 overall pick J.J. McCarthy.\n\nBut given McCarthy's draft status, it's clear that the Michigan product will take over as QB1 sooner than later.\n\nIn a long piece from Kevin Seifert of ESPN detailing the Vikings' transition from Kirk Cousins to McCarthy under O'Connell and G.M. Kwesi Adofo-Mensah, the head coach noted that his previous experiences with coaching young QBs have left him more cautious. To that end, O'Connell has left the timetable for McCarthy becoming Minnesota's starter open-ended.\n\nO'Connell said McCarthy will be ready when \"the comfort level that he has within our offense and his ability to then translate it to adverse situations and difficult aspects of playing quarterback in the NFL aren't magnified by inexperience.\n\n\"But I want to be very clear that the expectation is for this player to not be perfect. ... He's going to have growing pains, he's going to learn on the fly. I'm not trying to remove that aspect of it, either, but [deciding when he will play] is not something you can write up on a board. It's a feeling.\"\n\nIn their two seasons together, O'Connell and Adofo-Mensah have compiled a 20-14 record with one NFC North title. While the Vikings were in the hunt for a postseason berth late in the season despite Kirk Cousins' Achilles tear in 2023, the team still finished 7-10. In the NFL, it's not out of the realm of possibility that O'Connell's job status could come into question with a poor record in 2024.\n\nBut O'Connell said his priority is putting McCarthy in the best position to succeed.\n\n\"It's just more about what is in the best interest of the organization,\" O'Connell said. \"Those circumstances cannot affect what J.J.'s development plan is or any other player on the team for that matter. It just can't be something that selfishly ever impacts that decision.\n\n\"That really won't change because, and I don't know if it's the former quarterback in me or not, but I do feel an obligation to have the best interests of not only J.J. but our entire team, at heart, when we make that decision.\"", "source": {"uri": "nbcsports.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NBC Sports"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_O'Connell_(American_football)", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kevin O'Connell (American football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_coach", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Head coach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Quarterback"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kwesi_Adofo-Mensah", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kwesi Adofo-Mensah"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Training_camp", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Training camp"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kirk_Cousins", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kirk Cousins"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draft_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Draft (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota_Vikings", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota Vikings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rookie", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rookie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "ESPN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sam_Darnold", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sam Darnold"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michigan", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Michigan"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Michigan"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball_postseason", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball postseason"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NFC_North", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NFC North"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Achilles_tendon", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Achilles tendon"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 96}], "image": "https://nbcsports.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/d080436/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3150x1772+0+0/resize/1440x810!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fnbc-sports-production-nbc-sports.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F33%2F7c%2F38f4560c4cc8b02898454cd9d2c1%2Fhttps-delivery-gettyimages.com%2Fdownloads%2F2151833471", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9746606", "eventUri": "eng-9746606", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.003921568627450966, "wgt": 146, "relevance": 1}

McCarthy, biggest concerns for 2024 and more", "body": "It's almost time, folks. Time for daily press conferences and hourly observations spamming your social media feeds. Time for another Minnesota Vikings training camp.\n\nIt seems like you're ready -- or at least mildly excited with low expectations. That's the vibe that came across in our annual survey.\n\nMore than 1,700 of you filtered through the questions and provided your thoughts. Thank you for that. The engagement ticked up from last year, which is much appreciated.\n\nI compiled the results and compared them to last year, especially when the questions were similar. Light blue highlights the response offered by most of you.\n\nWithout further ado, here are the responses:\n\nOne of the most interesting aspects of this survey is comparing the year-over-year results, and we'll do that throughout. Last year, nearly half of you thought the Vikings were moving in the right direction. This year's results were even more optimistic.\n\nThis offseason appears to weigh heavily in the minds of readers. Most felt like the 2023 offseason was middling; a \"3\" was the most popular answer at this time last year. This year, more than 75 percent of you landed on the positive side of the aisle. Moving on from Kirk Cousins seemed to satisfy many, and the free-agent decisions, for the most part, have gone over well.\n\nThe starkest difference between these responses and last year's was the feeling about O'Connell. He received rave reviews last year, but the trust has heightened even after a less-than-successful, injury-plagued, 7-10 season. Some offered criticisms of the head coach, specifically involving the team's turnover issues and struggles in the run game. Broadly, though, you appear to be believers in his leadership style and presence as the front-facing figure of the team.\n\nOpinions about ownership did not change. Most of you are positive about the Wilfs' commitment; the number of respondents with a \"high level of trust\" rose from last year.\n\nAs for Adofo-Mensah, tepid feelings remain, which I'll expand on in the following section.\n\nIn the short-answer portion of the survey, those who mentioned Adofo-Mensah often cited his lack of draft production. Some focused on Adofo-Mensah, while others questioned the scouting staff. Altogether, most of you seem to think -- rightfully, I believe -- that the narrative about his drafting ability (or lack thereof) hinges on the futures of J.J. McCarthy and Dallas Turner.\n\nThere is a clear difference, too, in your feelings about extensions regarding the general manager and the head coach. O'Connell? If the Wilfs extended his contract tomorrow, the overwhelming response would be satisfaction.\n\nOn this side of the computer, I was most curious about what you'd say about your expectations for 2024. Would you be OK with a six-win season? Is making the playoffs the bar for success? The answer lies somewhere in the middle of those two worlds, which, in my opinion, reflects the fan base's level of awareness. Hope does not abound for 2024, specifically.\n\nBut for 2025 and beyond?\n\n\"They're two years and a top cornerback away from making a deep playoff run,\" one of you said.\n\n\"I think we all need to recognize the moves made are for the next four years,\" another said. \"Not just this year.\"\n\nImpossible as that is for the team to admit publicly, it's probably true. And in terms of what the future holds, you think there's plenty of reason for hope. There was almost a 10 percent increase this year in readers thinking the Vikings will win the Super Bowl in the next 10 years. Maybe that's a byproduct of the moves made this offseason. Maybe it's mere delusion. It's interesting regardless of the reason.\n\nMaybe I'm ignorant to have assumed these results would be flipped. Waiting until 2025 for McCarthy to start felt more like the reality than a fan preference. Apparently, it's not. This is a sign that you're willing to be patient with the Vikings' first-round pick, so long as they get it right.\n\nA few of you wrote some form of \"trust the process\" with McCarthy and don't want the team to react on a whim during the season. It's an easy message to get behind in the spring and summer, but it might be harder to stick to during the season. How the Vikings approach McCarthy's introduction to the NFL is one of the most fascinating questions of 2024, and, at least initially, it appears as if their slow-play messaging has hit the right note with fans.\n\nI laughed out loud at one respondent's message: \"I'm not afraid of anyone.\" Point taken. Thank you. Rightfully, though, many of you have a healthy respect for the Lions. They return offensive coordinator Ben Johnson, added a couple of dynamic press-man cornerbacks in the draft and returned essentially all of their pivotal players.\n\nThey're a roadblock for the Vikings, and it's clear that the other question marks are pretty evenly dispersed. Cornerback depth and the strength of the Vikings' lines of scrimmage are major questions. You seem to think Darnold will be solid enough. There's some excitement surrounding Aaron Jones. None of these results were surprising, especially the fact that most of you would like to see the team add another receiver.\n\nHow about that? Almost half of the respondents didn't attend a game in 2023. This isn't a statement about the game day experience, although ticket prices were deemed too expensive. The reasons for the lack of attendance are likely location, the comfort at home and the team's abundance of injuries down the stretch. If you chose not to attend the at-home shellacking against the Packers on Dec. 31, bravo. Good choice.\n\n* Competent people.

McCarthy will start when it's in 'best interests of not only J.J. but our entire team' - CBSSports.com", "body": "It sounds like Sam Darnold is going to start Week 1, and possibly longer than that\n\nOne of the most interesting quarterback situations to watch this offseason was that of the Minnesota Vikings. They entered the offseason with Kirk Cousins set to hit free agency, and not much behind him in the way of a backup plan. When Cousins took a big contract from the Atlanta Falcons, Minnesota set its next plan in motion. The first step was signing former Jets, Panthers, and 49ers quarterback Sam Darnold as a stop-gap option. The second stop was moving up very slightly in the first round of the draft for former Michigan star J.J. McCarthy.\n\nVikings coach Kevin O'Connell told Darnold about the team's quarterback plans on draft day, and informed him that he was likely to be the team's starter in Week 1. Indeed, Darnold knew when he signed a one-year, $10 million deal with Minnesota that the team was likely to draft a quarterback, and that he was still likely to start to open the season -- and perhaps longer, via ESPN.\n\n\"It's just more about what is in the best interest of the organization,\" O'Connell said of when the team will transition McCarthy into the starting role. \"Those circumstances cannot affect what J.J.'s development plan is or any other player on the team for that matter. It just can't be something that selfishly ever impacts that decision.\n\n\"That really won't change because, and I don't know if it's the former quarterback in me or not, but I do feel an obligation to have the best interests of not only J.J. but our entire team, at heart, when we make that decision.\"\n\nWhen that might be isn't necessarily clear, and O'Connell said the team doesn't have a definitive timeline for when it will happen. It's going to be about \"the comfort level that he has within our offense and his ability to then translate it to adverse situations and difficult aspects of playing quarterback in the NFL aren't magnified by inexperience,\" he said.\n\nO'Connell also wanted to make sure he kept expectations in check for when McCarthy does see the field. Rookie quarterbacks who find immediate success are the exception, not the rule, and even with a strong infrastructure like the one the Vikings have -- featuring O'Connell as the play-caller and Justin Jefferson, Jordan Addison, T.J. Hockenson, Aaron Jones, and Ty Chandler among the weapons, along with a strong offensive line -- there shouldn't be an assumption that McCarthy will hit the ground running immediately.\n\n\"I want to be very clear that the expectation is for this player to not be perfect,\" O'Connell said. \"He's going to have growing pains, he's going to learn on the fly. I'm not trying to remove that aspect of it, either, but [deciding when he will play] is not something you can write up on a board.

Kwesi Adofo-Mensah was the new general manager, and Los Angeles Rams offensive coordinator Kevin O'Connell was a finalist for the Vikings' vacant head-coaching job.\n\nIt was the afternoon of Jan. 31, 2022, and members of the team's search committee -- owner/president Mark Wilf, chief operating officer Andrew Miller and executive vice president of football operations Rob Brzezinski, among others -- sat around a conference table in a Southern California hotel. They largely just listened as Adofo-Mensah and O'Connell talked for more than three hours. About a third of the conversation was devoted to the most pressing need facing the franchise: quarterback.\n\nO'Connell was emphatic. The Vikings could win with Kirk Cousins in 2022, and perhaps beyond. It wasn't time to replace him yet. Adofo-Mensah agreed but wanted to know more. Whenever that time came, how should they do it? What type of player would O'Connell want? And how should he be developed?\n\nO'Connell spoke from his expansive background. He had been a star quarterback at San Diego State, a third-round pick in the 2008 draft, an NFL backup for five years and an assistant coach for another seven.\n\nIn between, O'Connell had worked as a private coach for draft-hopeful quarterbacks. He knew how prospects exaggerate their strengths and hide their weaknesses. So he laid out a process for cutting through that fa\u00e7ade. The end result, he said, was a marriage that required adjustments from all participants. \"Marriage: it's that serious,\" Adofo-Mensah said later.\n\nMore than anything, however, O'Connell emphasized pragmatism. At one point during the conversation, O'Connell compared two quarterbacks. Deshaun Watson and Matthew Stafford, he said, approached the game from entirely different skill sets. But ultimately, he said, \"they both get to first-and-10.\"\n\nThat phrase stuck with Adofo-Mensah, who understood in the moment that O'Connell was flexible and thoughtful enough to accept what he considered the reality of quarterback acquisition. Most drafts don't have a transcendent prospect like Andrew Luck or Joe Burrow, and most teams don't get their first choice. A true draft assessment hinges on how many of its quarterbacks can get your offense to first-and-10, and what environment they need around them to expand their impact to championship levels.\n\nO'Connell got the job. Two years later, the Vikings set themselves up for a highwire task this offseason: Parting ways with Cousins and finding his short- and long-term replacements, all in the span of two months. They made Michigan's J.J. McCarthy the fifth quarterback selected in the 2024 draft (No. 10 overall), in the process working as hard to protect their draft capital as they did to secure McCarthy. There was no celebration until they had maneuvered to select Alabama linebacker Dallas Turner -- one of the draft's best pass-rushers -- seven picks later.\n\n\"I believe in J.J. McCarthy,\" O'Connell told ESPN, \"but to get him in the building the right way under the right circumstances, and having another first-round pick like Dallas Turner helps that.\"\n\nESPN spent the offseason tracking the Vikings' quarterback transition, one that took them through intense negotiations with Cousins, included a check-in on the Los Angeles Chargers' Justin Herbert and the acquisition of a second first-round pick that ultimately helped secure Turner rather than McCarthy. It featured a set of five private workouts around the country, one big surprise and the first top-10 quarterback pick in team history (Fran Tarkenton was picked No. 11 overall in 1960).\n\nInterviews with coach, executive and agent sources in and around the organization revealed a two-year process built around the probability the Vikings would never have a draft position high enough to call their own shot and would need a multifaceted plan to succeed with whomever they landed.\n\n\"What people don't understand about the quarterback-selection process,\" O'Connell said, \"is that it's not just the quarterback themselves. It's: 'What does the rest of the picture look like with that quarterback?'\"\n\nNFL TEAMS RARELY pull off a quarterback transition without some lean years in between, and ESPN's Football Power Index projects the Vikings to win 6.8 games in 2024 -- an unavoidable and uncomfortable fact as both Adofo-Mensah and O'Connell enter the third year of four-year contracts. They had hoped Cousins would bridge them to the next quarterback, but the bridge to McCarthy has now fallen to veteran Sam Darnold, a once-elite prospect himself who is now with his fourth team in seven seasons.\n\nMcCarthy's moment might not come as soon as the Vikings hope. O'Connell, scarred by Washington's botched development of quarterback prospect Dwayne Haskins during his tenure there as quarterbacks coach and offensive coordinator, laid out for ESPN his plan to ensure that McCarthy won't have to play until he is ready.\n\n\"Those things [O'Connell] talked about are the reason why I have so much faith in him,\" Adofo-Mensah said. \"to take a mold-and-play like [McCarthy] with talent and traits that are as high-end as anybody, and mold him into that player we want him to be.\n\n\"A lot of times when we go back over history and we say, 'These quarterbacks have missed.' There's a lot of hands that are dirty in that regard, and we're going to make sure that our hands are clean and give him the best opportunity he can to be the best player he can be in this offense.\"\n\nThe Vikings' hiring of Adofo-Mensah and O'Connell in 2022 coincided with one of the worst quarterback classes in recent draft history. The best QB has been the San Francisco 49ers' Brock Purdy, whom the Vikings had hoped to sign as an undrafted free agent, sources told ESPN in the fall.\n\nInstead, the 49ers drafted Purdy with the final pick of the draft to avoid a bidding war. No other member of the class is likely to start in 2024, and the top two selected -- the Pittsburgh Steelers' Kenny Pickett and the Atlanta Falcons' Desmond Ridder -- have already moved on to new teams.\n\nO'Connell shut down some mild internal sentiment to take a flier on a quarterback that spring. He has since jokingly referred to himself as the Vikings' \"quarterback killer\" in draft discussions.\n\n\"I have had to, in a lot of ways, fight off some mistakes from being made,\" O'Connell said during an appearance this spring at the \"Faith & Life\" lecture series in Plymouth, Minnesota, which was posted on YouTube. \"Mainly because the evaluation process I go through. Hope and faith are wonderful things, but I do not like them to necessarily be strategies.\"\n\nO'Connell was correct about the 2022 class, and the Vikings' success with Cousins that season ensured another year would pass before finding his successor. Their 13-4 record left them with the No. 23 overall pick, and the top three quarterbacks were off the board by No. 4. They did select Jaren Hall in the fifth round, at No. 164 overall, but were realistic about his slim chances of developing into a long-term starter.\n\nThat pushed the conversation to the 2024 draft. Close observers understood that Adofo-Mensah was already hedging his financial bet with Cousins in 2022, having added only one year to the quarterback's contract. Negotiations in 2023 led to a compromise agreement that would allow Cousins to enter the 2024 free agent market without being subjected to the franchise tag.\n\nCousins responded with perhaps the best first half of a season in his career. He was tied for the NFL lead with 18 touchdown passes and ranked second with 2,331 passing yards when he tore his right Achilles tendon in Week 8. The injury hit the franchise hard. People throughout the organization believed O'Connell had elevated Cousins' game and set him on a course for a late-career blossoming as a genuine top-10 NFL quarterback. They knew his injury would heal well before the start of the 2024 season and, according to multiple sources, genuinely wanted him to return as their starter.\n\nPlayers young and old shared that sentiment. Receiver Justin Jefferson said Cousins' return would be \"perfect.\" Right tackle Brian O'Neill wanted Cousins back with \"one thousand million percent\" certainty.\n\nNO ONE IN the building wanted Cousins back more than O'Connell, who had built a relationship with the quarterback based on positive feedback and truth-telling.\n\nWith that backdrop, O'Connell leveled with Cousins after the season: The Vikings' 3-6 record after his injury had exposed the dangers of not looking beyond a 36-year-old quarterback. With their best draft position (No. 11 overall) in a decade, the team had decided to tap into a deep 2024 quarterback class and find its next starter. But no one -- not ownership, not Adofo-Mensah and not O'Connell -- wanted the rookie to play right away. Cousins would be their starter in 2024 and possibly longer.\n\nIt would be a tough sell, and the Vikings were already considering their next steps. At the combine, they checked with the Chargers on Herbert's availability. It was the kind of call many NFL teams make to a team that has changed leadership. Adofo-Mensah had worked with new Chargers coach Jim Harbaugh when they were both with the 49ers from 2013 to '14, and was well aware of Harbaugh's preference for a run-based offensive scheme. The Chargers did not want to move Herbert, but the Vikings' interest was a sign for league observers about Cousins' looming availability.\n\nCousins had said publicly and privately that he wanted to finish his career in Minnesota, but he also made clear he wanted the structure of a new contract -- the guaranteed money, in other words -- to reflect that the Vikings wanted the same thing. \"It's not about the dollars,\" Cousins said in January, \"But it is about what the dollars represent.\"\n\nInternally, the Vikings knew they couldn't make that commitment. Adofo-Mensah wanted what he refers to as \"optionality.\" There was too much value in a rookie quarterback's contract, with its low salary cap impact, to overlap it with a long-term veteran deal. His final offer, delivered at the NFL combine at the end of February, was a deal that fully guaranteed Cousins' 2024 salary and offered partial guarantees for 2025. Cousins, who would later say he wanted to avoid what amounted to a \"year-to-year\" contract, turned it down.\n\nBy that time, there were rampant public reports the Falcons were readying a massive contract offer that would meet Cousins' expectations for an end-of-career agreement. He accepted their four-year offer, with two fully guaranteed years and part of a third, as confirmation the Falcons wanted him as their long-term starter. As it turned out, the Falcons were also planning to draft their next quarterback, Michael Penix Jr. at No. 8 overall. They just didn't tell Cousins.\n\nThe Vikings moved full speed into a new era.\n\nEVEN BEFORE THE combine, O'Connell had his plan for identifying the Vikings' next quarterback and then refined it with input from coaches and members of the personnel department. If it went well, it would be the only quarterback replacement plan he would employ with the Vikings. That would also be true if it didn't go well. The same went for Adofo-Mensah. Both of their careers would likely rest on the shoulders of the quarterback they ultimately drafted.\n\nThe Vikings would deemphasize the players' scripted pro days and instead conjure as realistic of a job interview as possible. In those private workouts, O'Connell and staff would evaluate each player in the Vikings' offensive scheme. It was important to conduct the process in the quarterback's familiar football environments so the Vikings could observe how each interacted with people they already were comfortable with.\n\nSo after bidding farewell to Cousins, and agreeing to terms with Darnold two days later, they went to work.\n\nA combination of McCown, Phillips and assistant offensive coordinator/assistant quarterbacks coach Grant Udinski would monitor each pro day, while a larger group would follow a more expansive itinerary that coincidentally would start with McCarthy on March 29 in Ann Arbor, Michigan. The traveling party, which jetted on one of owner Zygi and Mark Wilf's private planes, included Adofo-Mensah, O'Connell, Phillips, McCown, Udinski, senior vice president of player personnel Ryan Grigson and passing game coordinator/tight ends coach Brian Angelichio. On a few occasions, the group was joined by some of the Wilfs' adult children.\n\nThe schedule varied based on availability, but most days began with O'Connell teaching a series of plays from the Vikings' playbook in a classroom at each school's football facility. For roughly an hour, he would review expectations for footwork, progression and eye placement, among other minutiae. O'Connell stressed his intent as a playcaller for each play.\n\nMcCarthy later said the experience was a significant part of why he considered Minnesota his top potential destination.\n\n\"It was the way [O'Connell] presents the install,\" he said, \"the way he compartmentalizes everything about how to look at this play individually and how to make it more relatable to what your knowledge is and how you can smoothly and efficiently step into this playbook.\n\n\"That was something that was truly unique because you go around to so many defensive coaches like [Washington's] Dan Quinn and [New England's] Jerod Mayo, and being able to have that relationship as former QB and current QB, it's truly special and it means a lot.\"\n\nFrom there, the group would go to a practice field and pull in receivers and other skill position players who were available to participate. Phillips and Angelichio would coach those players, adding to the realism of the environment, as they went through the plays. The receivers were not part of the initial install, so part of the evaluation was watching how each quarterback guided -- or didn't guide -- them through rough patches.\n\nIn McCarthy's case, the Vikings' scouting and film review had been limited by a Michigan offense that asked him to throw an average of 22.1 passes per game, the fourth fewest by a first-round quarterback in his final full college season over the past 20 years. But as part of their evaluation, they filtered his throws into what O'Connell referred to as \"weighty downs\" -- particularly third downs and red zone attempts -- to help compare his most important plays to other first-round prospects who had more overall attempts.\n\nIn some cases, McCarthy had more attempts in those situations than some of those other passers. As they watched him during his private workout, the Vikings saw a degree of decisiveness and arm strength that in their opinion rivaled any of the draft's top six quarterbacks.\n\n\"I left there very, very confident in my evaluation of J.J,\" O'Connell said, \"and if anything, felt even stronger about it.\"\n\nOF SOMEWHAT LESS importance, but still a priority, was the team's assessment of each quarterback's interactions with the people he encountered on his home turf. When he walked on the practice field, did he simply nod and say hello to the receivers? Or did he gather them and express enthusiasm, creating an immediate miniteam? In many cases, current players were working out or lifting weights around the time of the Vikings' workouts. Did they stop and watch? Were they interested in the quarterback's performance?\n\nMcCarthy's big personality gave him an advantage in such situations. The same was true for a task the Vikings assigned each quarterback: Take us to eat -- lunch, in most cases -- at a place of your choosing. (The Vikings paid.) What type of place would the quarterback select? Was it on campus, and if so, how did the students and other patrons respond to him? Would the employees recognize him and know his order, or had he chosen a place to avoid crowds?\n\nMcCarthy selected Zingerman's Deli, the famous eatery a brief walk from Michigan's central campus. The group did not call ahead, and they walked into a crowded weekday lunch hour, said Miles Bolton, a front-of-house staff member who was there that day. McCarthy took photos with fans who recognized him as the group waited in line to place orders. \"He was really gracious in taking time to pose for pictures and interact with fans,\" Bolton said.\n\nIn most cases, the Vikings arranged the seating for O'Connell and McCown to sit on either side of the quarterback, ensuring he could speak freely with the people he had already interacted with the most. \"You definitely have to be careful about putting too much emphasis on that kind of stuff,\" O'Connell said. \"You can't say, 'Hey, he was awkward at dinner, so we can't draft him.' You use it as a sliver of the total evaluation.\"\n\nEach visit was followed by an intense review on the plane ride, either back to Minnesota or to the next quarterback stop, while the day was still fresh in the group's mind.\n\nThe trip to Michigan was followed by stops in Seattle to see Penix; Eugene, Oregon, for Bo Nix; and then Chapel Hill, North Carolina, for Drake Maye. The final stop was April 18 in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, to visit with Jayden Daniels. The Vikings also met with South Carolina's Spencer Rattler, Tulane's Michael Pratt and Tennessee's Joe Milton III at the NFL combine.\n\nWHEN THEY RETURNED to Minnesota, it was time to stack their draft board and assign values to each quarterback. How many of the QB prospects would they be willing to give up extra draft assets to acquire? And how many would they accept at or close to their spot at No. 11, with the benefit of additional acquisitions?\n\nEven before the trip commenced, Adofo-Mensah began maneuvering to give himself what he again referred to as \"optionality.\" On March 15, he acquired an additional first-round draft pick (No. 23 overall, from the Houston Texans). Given the cost of the trade -- second-round picks in 2024 and 2025, plus a 2024 sixth-rounder, while getting a 2024 seventh-rounder from the Texans -- the move was widely regarded as the first step in making a bigger jump for a quarterback near the top of the draft.\n\nIn several public appearances, Adofo-Mensah insisted the deal had no specific intent -- an expected line from an NFL general manager who didn't want to give away his strategy. But as it turned out, he truly believed it.\n\nEven before the private workouts, the Vikings knew they liked enough of the quarterback class to conclude they would be within striking distance of several. They also knew they would like some more than others and wanted to have enough assets to move up into the top three spots of the draft if the opportunity arose. If it didn't, and the Vikings wound up drafting a quarterback at No. 4 or later, Adofo-Mensah thought the Texans trade would help him surround that quarterback with another blue-chip talent.\n\n\"We went over our scenarios,\" he said, \"and thought this was a really good way to position ourselves.\"\n\nWHEN DRAFT DAY arrived, the Vikings had multiple possibilities in play. First, though, O'Connell sought out a symbolic but important meeting. He called Darnold into his office at 10:30 a.m. and walked him through the team's plan.\n\nDarnold had signed a one-year, $10 million contract and had long understood the Vikings would likely draft a quarterback. \"No matter what happens,\" he said upon arriving, \"I'm going to compete.\" But Darnold was his likely Week 1 starter and, based on how the draft fell, perhaps for much longer.\n\nThe conversation lasted 45 minutes. Darnold told O'Connell he appreciated the candor but that it wasn't necessary. After all, Darnold, the No. 3 overall pick by the New York Jets in 2018, had lost starting spots with two teams in his first five seasons and had spent his sixth as a backup with the 49ers. No one owed him anything.\n\n\"I just felt it was very important for me to look him in the eye and say exactly the reality of this,\" O'Connell said.\n\nReality was also sinking in for some of the scenarios the Vikings had laid out. There was a strong possibility three quarterbacks would be off the board before they had a chance to make a trade offer, creating the likelihood they would be drafting at or near their original spot at No. 11.\n\nIt was clear that Caleb Williams and Daniels would be drafted with the first two picks by the Chicago Bears and Washington Commanders, respectively. That left the third spot, where the New England Patriots were intent on drafting Maye unless a team overwhelmed them with an offer.\n\nThe Vikings really liked Maye, and they were willing to forfeit the ability to surround him with an additional player at No. 23 in order to get him. Their offer to the Patriots was substantial. According to ESPN's Mike Reiss, the Vikings' final proposal included three first-round picks -- No. 11, No. 23 and their top pick in 2025 -- but with a request for two of the Patriots' midround picks in return. It was not enough to tempt the Patriots.\n\n\"It's always about walkaway prices,\" Adofo-Mensah said, speaking generally about draft trades. \"Your only leverage in the negotiation is your willingness to do something else. So I've got to say, 'I will not do this because I would rather do these three other things and make our team better.' It's got to mean something.\"\n\nIN PREPARATION FOR not moving into the top three, Adofo-Mensah called Jets general manager Joe Douglas before the draft to map out a potential move to No. 10 if necessary. Then the waiting game began.\n\nMcCarthy was next on the Vikings' priority list, ahead of Penix. Many around the league had paired Penix's downfield mentality and quick release with O'Connell's offensive philosophy, but the Vikings felt confident McCarthy had similar capacities. Michigan's offense simply hadn't asked him to use them. And at 21, three years younger than Penix, McCarthy had more potential for growth.\n\nBut their relatively similar evaluations left the Vikings more confident in resisting the urge to move up. No team with picks between No. 4-10 needed a quarterback. Would another team trade into that group for McCarthy or Penix? It was possible, the Vikings assessed, but even if one were selected, the other should be in range for the Vikings. At one point during the draft, Adofo-Mensah turned to Grigson and said sarcastically he was \"supposed to trade the whole farm\" for No. 4, according to a video posted by the Vikings.\n\nAs it turned out, the Falcons surprised everyone by selecting Penix at No. 8 despite having signed Cousins a month earlier. Now the Vikings were focused on the Bears' No. 9 spot. They knew they could make a trade with the Jets at No. 10 to get McCarthy, if needed. But there was another nagging thought among some decision-makers. Would the Bears be cutthroat enough to trade out -- despite their well-known interest in receiver Rome Odunze -- to block the NFC North rival Vikings from getting him?\n\nThe Seattle Seahawks had met twice with McCarthy, once at the combine and then after his pro day, and new head coach Mike MacDonald had been Michigan's defensive coordinator during McCarthy's first season in Ann Arbor (2021). ESPN's Mel Kiper Jr. had gone so far as to match McCarthy and the Seahawks in his first 2024 mock draft.\n\nThe Vikings' draft room remained tense until the Bears drafted Odunze. Adofo-Mensah finalized the deal with the Jets for No. 10, giving New York fourth- and fifth-round picks with a seventh-rounder in return, to swap first-round picks and submit McCarthy's name.\n\n\"You're always sweating a little bit with that one pick in between,\" he said, \"but this business is about taking a little risk and trying to get a reward, and I think we got that in the end.\"\n\nDenver Broncos coach Sean Payton later suggested that he had bluffed the Vikings into moving up, out of concern that he would move from No. 12 to No. 10 and select McCarthy ahead of the Vikings. But based on their accumulation of draft insight, the Vikings were confident that Payton preferred Oregon's Nix, whom he drafted at No. 12.\n\nBack in the draft room, Adofo-Mensah turned his attention to a trade that would flip the No. 23 pick into No. 17, which he used to select Turner.\n\nTHE VIKINGS MOVED through their spring practices with Darnold atop the depth chart, and O'Connell confirmed the obvious in mid-June: Darnold would open training camp as the Vikings' No. 1 quarterback. For the first time under Adofo-Mensah and O'Connell, the Vikings appear set to bring four quarterbacks to camp -- Darnold, McCarthy, veteran backup Nick Mullens and Hall, the 2023 fifth-rounder -- perhaps an extra step to prevent McCarthy from playing before he is ready.\n\nO'Connell brings scar tissue to the job of developing McCarthy. As Washington's offensive coordinator in 2019, O'Connell had a front seat to the franchise's botched work with first-round draft pick Dwayne Haskins. Despite initial plans to take a methodical approach to his development, coach Jay Gruden put Haskins on the field in Week 4 -- long before he was ready. Haskins struggled for two seasons, was released in 2021 and spent his final NFL season as the Steelers' No. 3 quarterback. (Haskins died in April 2022 after being struck by a truck in Fort Lauderdale, Florida)\n\n\"When we selected him, we had a lot of confidence in what he could become under the right circumstances and development and timetable,\" O'Connell said, \"and that didn't exactly end up being the mindset just a few short months later.\"\n\nThe Vikings have started at the beginning, by revamping some of McCarthy's footwork. In particular, they have him putting his left foot forward and right foot back when in the shotgun, as opposed to the \"square\" stance that some passers and teams use. That early work has demonstrated McCarthy is a \"pretty coachable player,\" McCown said.\n\nAssuming McCarthy doesn't win the starting job in training camp, the Vikings' schedule has a natural transition point: A bye after their Week 5 trip to London to play the Jets. Publicly and privately, O'Connell has left McCarthy's timetable open-ended.\n\nMcCarthy will be ready, O'Connell said, when \"the comfort level that he has within our offense and his ability to then translate it to adverse situations and difficult aspects of playing quarterback in the NFL aren't magnified by inexperience.\n\n\"But I want to be very clear that the expectation is for this player to not be perfect,\" O'Connell said. \"He's going to have growing pains, he's going to learn on the fly. I'm not trying to remove that aspect of it, either, but [deciding when he will play] is not something you can write up on a board. It's a feeling.\"\n\nThe job will test the self-preservation instincts most every NFL coach and general manager stare down at some point in their careers. O'Connell and Adofo-Mensah have given the franchise a future to build toward, but how much of the present can they sacrifice as they reach the midpoint of their contracts? During their tenure, the Vikings have a 20-14 record in the regular season and are 0-1 in the playoffs in the increasingly tough NFC North.\n\n\"It's just more about what is in the best interest of the organization,\" O'Connell said. \"Those circumstances cannot affect what J.J.'s development plan is or any other player on the team for that matter. It just can't be something that selfishly ever impacts that decision.\n\n\"That really won't change because, and I don't know if it's the former quarterback in me or not, but I do feel an obligation to have the best interests of not only J.J. but our entire team, at heart, when we make that decision.\"\n\nOF THE VIKINGS' 22 projected offensive and defensive starters, 18 have at least four years of experience. But their veteran core has largely accepted the short-term uncertainty of this transition, none more so than safety Harrison Smith. The team's longest-tenured player, Smith restructured his deal to return for a 13th season two days after Cousins' departure.\n\nThe pair had developed what Smith called a \"pretty cool relationship,\" and in fact, Cousins stopped at Smith's home in Knoxville, Tennessee, while driving with his family to Atlanta. But Smith said it isn't his nature to assume Cousins' departure, and the tenure of Darnold and McCarthy, means the Vikings have sacrificed their ability to compete this season.\n\n\"I've always felt it's the opposite,\" Smith said. \"If you're a competitor and you have faith in your abilities and what's going on around you, that should always be your mentality. And this year is no exception.\n\n\"I kind of like it sometimes when it's like this. Not that I'm playing to prove people wrong, but it's kind of fun sometimes. The league is so volatile every year. You can think you're making the best decision in going here and doing this and doing that, and it rarely plays out how you think it's going to play out.\"\n\nSmith was not alone. Receiver Justin Jefferson texted McCarthy the night he was drafted, symbolically ceding his \"J.J.\" nickname to smooth out the rookie's arrival, and later agreed to a four-year contract extension. O'Neill, who in January said he wanted Cousins to return \"one thousand million percent,\" said in April that it's \"not my job\" to project the impact of personnel moves. \"My job is to block people,\" he said. \"Life moves on. It's a business. It's time to get to work and time to push this thing in the right direction.\"\n\nAnd defensive tackle Harrison Phillips, entering his seventh NFL season, acknowledged the history of quarterback transitions but noted there are always exceptions, such as Baker Mayfield's success last season with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers.\n\n\"I'm getting older,\" Phillips said, \"and in Year 7, I probably have less years in front of me than behind me, so my window to win a Super Bowl is narrowing. But I'm extremely optimistic about the moves they've made. ... I don't know how the whole thing is going to come to a conclusion, but I think we are going to win a lot of football games with Sam as the captain of the ship. The veterans here are going to be like, 'Yeah, we're going to roll with this.' People have confidence in the moves they've made.\"\n\nLIKE MOST NFL teams, the Vikings produced and published nearly 30 minutes of behind-the-scenes video of their draft room. None of it included the kind of celebration you might expect at the successful end of a two-year journey. After completing the trade with the Jets, Adofo-Mensah smiled, stood up and said: \"We've never picked a quarterback in the top 10,\" his way of saying the deck had been cleared for selecting McCarthy.\n\n\"We got it?\" a member of the personnel staff asked him.\n\n\"You've still got all your picks, man,\" O'Connell told him, noting the Vikings had drafted their quarterback without giving up the second of their two first-round picks.\n\nFinally, team executives circled the room and shook hands. They stood and clapped as the pick was announced.\n\n\"Proud of you, bro,\" O'Connell told Adofo-Mensah.\n\nIt wasn't time to pop champagne, however. Now it was first-and-10, and the work was just beginning.", "source": {"uri": "espn.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ESPN.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

McCarthy the Minnesota Vikings' first choice in NFL Draft?", "body": "The Minnesota Vikings went into the NFL Draft enamored with North Carolina quarterback Drake Maye. They made efforts to move up for him but the New England Patriots weren't willing to budge and selected him third overall.\n\nAfter the top three quarterbacks were taken, who did the Vikings prefer. SKOR North's Judd Zulgad, who also writes for us here at The Sporting News, believes that they preferred Washington quarterback Michael Penix Jr.\n\nPenix ended up going to the Atlanta Falcons at eighth overall and the Vikings selected Michigan quarterback J.J. McCarthy two picks later.\n\nESPN's Kevin Seifert wrote a long piece breaking down the Vikings' path to getting their quarterback of the future and discussed this exact thing. However, Seifert came to a different conclusion from Zulgad, saying that Penix was not their first choice after Maye.\n\nMcCarthy was next on the Vikings' priority list, ahead of Penix. Many around the league had paired Penix's downfield mentality and quick release with O'Connell's offensive philosophy, but the Vikings felt confident McCarthy had similar capacities. Michigan's offense simply hadn't asked him to use them. And at 21, three years younger than Penix, McCarthy had more potential for growth.\n\nWho ends up being correct? Honestly, I don't think it matters at this point. Penix is a talented player who unfortunately ended up in a poor situation.

Of the 257 players drafted in April, 254 have agreed to terms. The missing three include Michigan quarterback J.J. McCarthy and Alabama linebacker Dallas Turner, who were picked 10th and 17th, respectively, by Minnesota on April 25.\n\nThe other draft choice who hasn't given his rookie deal the OK is Georgia offensive tackle Amarius Mims, chosen at No. 18 by the Cincinnati Bengals.\n\nThe unsigned players' representatives aren't haggling with the Vikings over the size or length of their contracts. Their values are predetermined, based on the NFL's salary cap of $255.4 million for the 2024 season and this year's rookie compensation pool in a formula spelled out in the Collective Bargaining Agreement between the league and its players association.\n\nMcCarthy is due a four-year, $21.855 million contract. Turner's deal will be worth $15.767 million over four years. Like all first-round selections, the contracts will include a team option for a fifth season and will be fully guaranteed.\n\nRELATED: NFL TRAINING-CAMP ROSTER REVIEW: ALABAMA\n\nMcCarthy and Turner participated in the Vikings' offseason program. But training camp involves contract drills, which are prohibited during the offseason work. With the risk of injury higher, players without contracts usually are reluctant to take part.\n\nRookie holdouts have been rare in the NFL since the 2011 CBA put the draft-pick pay scale into place. So what's the holdup for the unsigned players?\n\nThe Vikings and the players' representatives haven't said.\n\nThe sticking points to getting rookie deals signed by NFL Draft picks under the current structure usually involve offsets and signing-bonus payments.\n\nAn offset in a contract means if a team releases a player while owing him money, it can subtract the salary received from his new team from the amount owed to the player. Players don't want offset provisions in their contracts because they make more money without it.\n\nBy its name, a signing bonus would imply payment when the player signs the contract. But teams aren't required to pay the full amount at signing, and the especially large signing bonuses of early draft picks typically haven't been.\n\nFor example, last year's No. 3 pick, Alabama All-American Will Anderson Jr. received 85 percent of his $22.609 million signing bonus within 15 days of signing his contract, then got the rest on Oct. 15.\n\nBut that's been changing for first-round quarterbacks. In 2023, quarterbacks went first, second and fourth in the draft, and all received their signing bonuses in lump-sum payments.\n\nSouthern Cal quarterback Caleb Williams, the No. 1 choice in this year's draft, agreed on his contract terms with the Chicago Bears this week, and reports indicate he'll get his full signing bonus of $25.537 million in a single payment.\n\nMcCarthy's contract carries a signing bonus of $12.7 million, Turner's signing bonus is $8.2 million. Minnesota has not typically fulfilled large signing bonuses in a single payment.\n\nMinnesota's veteran players are scheduled to report to training camp on Tuesday, with the Vikings' first full-team practice set for Wednesday.\n\nMinnesota starts its three-game preseason schedule on Aug. 10 against the Las Vegas Raiders. The Vikings kick off the regular season on Sept. 8 against the New York Giants.\n\nFOR MORE OF AL.COM'S COVERAGE OF THE NFL, GO TO OUR NFL PAGE", "source": {"uri": "al.com", "dataType": "news",

However, general manager Kwesi Adofo-Mensah also pressed O'Connell on his thoughts about the future at quarterback for Minnesota. Sure, the team wasn't looking to move on from Cousins then. But, when the time came, what was O'Connell looking for in a quarterback to succeed Cousins and, more importantly, lead the Vikings to their first Super Bowl win?\n\n\"What people don't understand about the quarterback-selection process,\" O'Connell said. \"It's that it's not just the quarterback themselves. It's: 'What does the rest of the picture look like with that quarterback?'\"\n\nThat methodology led to Minnesota not taking a quarterback in the 2022 NFL Draft right after they hired O'Connell and only taking Jaren Hall in the fifth round of the 2023 NFL Draft. O'Connell's offensive scheme brought new life to the Vikings on offense, with the personnel surrounding Cousins to make him one of the NFL's top quarterbacks. But after a ruptured Achilles tendon midway into the 2023-24 season, the earlier conversations began to set the eventual breakup between Cousins and the Vikings into motion.\n\nWhy the Vikings were ready to move on from Kirk Cousins\n\nEven with things in motion, members within the Vikings organization still hoped Cousins would remain the starting quarterback. No one wanted it more than O'Connell, who had built a genuine relationship with Cousins. People throughout the organization believed O'Connell had elevated Cousins' game and set him on a course for a late career, blossoming into a genuine top-10 NFL quarterback.\n\nBut with Cousins being so injury-prone and in his late 30s, along with the Vikings going 3-6 without him last season, the conversation regarding moving on from the quarterback came to a head, especially after Minnesota's record gave them a top first-round pick.\n\nThings only got even heavier once Cousins, who wanted to finish his career in Minnesota, made it clear that he wanted his money guaranteed by the Vikings in a possible contract. That not-so-subtle demand was a non-starter for Minnesota, and when Atlanta swooped in with a contract that met what Cousins was looking for, the train left the station and never returned.\n\nThat train took Cousins to the Falcons, who signed him to a four-year offer, with two fully guaranteed years and part of a third, confirming that Atlanta wanted him as their long-term starter. Meanwhile, the Vikings checked in on Justin Herbert's availability but eventually moved on to sign Sam Darnold, who will serve as the bridge to McCarthy they had hoped Cousins would've been.\n\nBut Cousins didn't want to be a temporary quarterback. He wanted to be firmly entrenched as the long-term starter. Cousins wouldn't get that in Minnesota, which led him to Atlanta - especially after the Falcons made an offer the Vikings would never match.", "source": {"uri": "clutchpoints.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ClutchPoints"}, "authors": [{"uri": "evan_dammarell@clutchpoints.com", "name": "Evan Dammarell", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_O'Connell_(American_football)", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kevin O'Connell (American football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kirk_Cousins", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kirk Cousins"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota_Vikings", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota Vikings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Quarterback"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kwesi_Adofo-Mensah", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kwesi Adofo-Mensah"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_manager", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "General manager"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Bowl", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Super Bowl"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_coach", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Head coach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Achilles_tendon", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Achilles tendon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sam_Darnold", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sam Darnold"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Atlanta, Georgia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Atlanta, Georgia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Transportation_and_Logistics/Moving_Services", "label": "dmoz/Business/Transportation and Logistics/Moving Services", "wgt": 5}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Employment/Careers", "label": "dmoz/Business/Employment/Careers", "wgt": 5}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Alternative_Lifestyles", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Alternative Lifestyles", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Moving_and_Relocating", "label": "dmoz/Home/Moving and Relocating", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Moving_and_Relocating/Moving", "label": "dmoz/Home/Moving and Relocating/Moving", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 78}], "image": "https://wp.clutchpoints.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/7625223255.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9746606", "eventUri": "eng-9746606", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1294117647058823, "wgt": 130, "relevance": 1}

McCarthy was supposedly the quarterback the Vikings wanted when he was selected in the first round of this year's draft, at least that was the stance the team took after Caleb Williams, Jayden Daniels and Drake Maye were off the board.\n\nThe Vikings were not overly interested in Michael Penix, who was curiously selected eighth by the Atlanta Falcons. They also knew that Williams and Daniels would be off the board by the time they took McCarthy with the 10 pick.\n\nThe Vikings had tried to trade up with the New England Patriots for the No. 3 pick - as did the New York Giants - but they refused to be held up by New England and stuck with their spot.\n\nAs camp is about to begin, McCarthy is already listed as the No. 2 quarterback on the team, behind place holder Sam Darnold and ahead of veteran backup Nick Mullens. The expectation is that McCarthy -- who just signed a 4-year, $21.8 million contract -- will have time to learn the system and he won't be inserted into the starting lineup until midseason at the earliest.\n\nThat is certainly a possibility, but McCarthy is an extremely competitive individual and he is not about to be limited by perception. Once training camp opens and he has a chance to show what he can do, McCarthy is going to fight. He earned his starting position with Michigan and led the team to two consecutive appearances in the College Football Playoffs and one national championship. He is not going to take backup status lying down.\n\nHead coach Kevin O'Connell has made it clear that he does not want to rush McCarthy into the starting lineup and his ascension to a starting position won't happen until he gives the Vikings a better chance to win games than Darnold.\n\n\"It's just more about what is in the best interest of the organization,\" O'Connell said. \"Those circumstances cannot affect what J.J.'s development plan is or any other player on the team for that matter. It just can't be something that selfishly ever impacts that decision.\n\n\"That really won't change because, and I don't know if it's the former quarterback in me or not, but I do feel an obligation to have the best interests of not only J.J. but our entire team, at heart, when we make that decision.\"\n\nThat is exactly the attitude that a head coach should have. His biggest responsibility is to make his team competitive. He is invested in McCarthy's development as an NFL-ready quarterback, but he is more invested in winning games for the Vikings.\n\nHowever, McCarthy is not about to except being the second-best quarterback on the team. He is going to fight from Day 1 - rookies report to camp Sunday for the Vikings - to show that he will be the best quarterback the franchise has to offer.\n\nIt will not be an easy fight, as Darnold has support from O'Connell and throughout the organization. The head coach believes that the six years of experience Darnold has and his performance in the offseason makes him a solid presence for the Vikings.\n\n\"I would say Sam would be the guy I would look to based upon the spring he's had and really where he's at in his quarterback journey,\" O'Connell said. \"He's been able to come in and really hit the ground running and really kind of take advantage of a competitive situation.\"\n\nMcCarthy knows where he stands at this point. He knows he is going to have to blow away the competition to become a starting quarterback for the Vikings.\n\nIt's a battle that will be compelling throughout the summer.", "source": {"uri": "forbes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Forbes"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Quarterback"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vikings", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Vikings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota_Vikings", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota Vikings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drake_Maye", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Drake Maye"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caleb_Williams", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Caleb Williams"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jayden_Daniels", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jayden Daniels"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_O'Connell_(American_football)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kevin O'Connell (American football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draft_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Draft (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starting_lineup", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Starting lineup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_England_Patriots", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New England Patriots"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_England", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New England"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New England"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Giants", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York Giants"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta_Falcons", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Atlanta Falcons"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nick_Mullens", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nick Mullens"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michigan_Wolverines_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Michigan Wolverines football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/College_football_national_championships_in_NCAA_Division_I_FBS", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "College football national championships in NCAA Division I FBS"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/College_Football_Playoff", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "College Football Playoff"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_coach", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Head coach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sam_Darnold", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sam Darnold"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 95}], "image": "https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/667ed6b7c08a1dacd1ab790a/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=600&width=1200&fit=bounds", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9746606", "eventUri": "eng-9746606", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1294117647058823, "wgt": 459185260, "relevance": 2}

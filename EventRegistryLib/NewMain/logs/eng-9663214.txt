That could only really happen in nature with replication through an intermediate animal.\"\n\nGarry also defended gain-of-function research during the hearing, arguing that it has had some beneficial impact, though he noted that it does need \"appropriate safeguards and restrictions.\"\n\nLawmakers and pundits have used several, often evolving, definitions for gain-of-function research in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic. The American Society for Microbiology defines it as techniques \"used in research to alter the function of an organism in such a way that it is able to do more than it used to do.\"\n\nWhen research is \"responsibly performed\" on highly transmissible and pathogenic viruses, it can lead to advances in public health and national security, Garry testified.\n\n\"Without gain-of-function research, we'd have no Tamiflu. Without gain-of-function research, we wouldn't have a vaccine to prevent cancer caused by infection by the human papilloma virus,\" Garry said. \"And without gain-of-function research, we won't be able to identify how novel viruses infect us. And if we don't know how they infect us, we cannot develop appropriate treatments and cures for the next potential pandemic creating virus.\"\n\nNew Hampshire Democratic Sen. Maggie Hassan raised several questions about whether there's enough oversight of how the United States spends research dollars as well as what mechanisms are in place to monitor how private entities conduct certain types of research.\n\n\"While their research has the potential to cure diseases and boost our economy, unless they accept federal funding, there is very little federal oversight to ensure that private labs are engaged in safe and ethical research,\" she said.\n\nKoblentz from George Mason University said there is much less oversight of biosafety and biosecurity for private research facilities that don't receive federal funding.\n\n\"In order to expand the scope of oversight to all privately funded research, (it) would require legislative action,\" Koblentz said.\n\nCongress, he said, should establish a national bio-risk management agency that would have authority over biosafety and biosecurity \"regardless of the source of funding.\"\n\n\"At the end of the day, it shouldn't matter where the funding comes from in terms of making sure this research is being done safely, securely and responsibly,\" Koblentz said.\n\nKentucky Republican Sen. Rand Paul, ranking member on the committee, said the panel will hold an upcoming hearing specifically on gain-of-function research, including what steps Congress should take to ensure it doesn't put the public at risk.\n\nCommittee Chairman Gary Peters, a Michigan Democrat, said during the hearing that lawmakers \"must learn from the challenges faced during this pandemic to ensure we can better protect Americans from future potential biological incidents.\"\n\n\"Our government needs the flexibility to determine the origins of naturally occurring outbreaks, as well as potential outbreaks that could arise from mistakes or malicious intent,\" Peters said.\n\nUtah Republican Sen. Mitt Romney, after listening to some of the debate, expressed exasperation that so much attention is going toward what caused the last pandemic and not on how to prepare for the next one.\n\n\"Given the fact that it could have been either, we know what action we ought to take to protect from either,\" Romney said. \"And so why there's so much passion around that makes me think it's more political than scientific, but maybe I'm wrong.\"\n\nThe United States, he said, shouldn't be funding gain-of-function research and should \"insist\" that anyone who receives federal funding follow the standards of the International Organization for Standardization.", "source": {"uri": "penncapital-star.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Pennsylvania Capital-Star"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jennifer_shutt@penncapital-star.com", "name": "Jennifer Shutt", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SARS-CoV-2", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "SARS-CoV-2"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spillover_infection", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Spillover infection"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Coronavirus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Intelligence_Community", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States Intelligence Community"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Virus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Investigations_into_the_origin_of_COVID-19", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Investigations into the origin of COVID-19"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gain-of-function_research", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Gain-of-function research"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bat", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Bat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wuhan_Institute_of_Virology", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wuhan Institute of Virology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huanan_Seafood_Wholesale_Market", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_H._Ebright", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Richard H.

(Photo by Al Bello/Getty Images)\n\nWASHINGTON -- Scientists debated the origins of COVID-19 this week, trading barbs over whether the bulk of evidence available points to a natural spillover event from a wild animal or a virus designed in a lab and then let loose through an inadvertent leak.\n\nThe hearing Tuesday in front of the U.S. Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee was part of ongoing efforts in Congress to apply the lessons learned during the pandemic to prevent or blunt the next outbreak.\n\nGregory Koblentz, associate professor and director of the Biodefense Graduate Program at George Mason University in Virginia, said during the two-hour hearing that debate continues in the scientific community about the origins.\n\n\"The possibility that SARS-CoV-2 was deliberately developed as a biological weapon has been unanimously rejected by all U.S. intelligence agencies,\" Koblentz testified. \"While the intelligence community is divided on the origin of the pandemic, most of the agencies have determined that the virus was not genetically engineered.\"\n\nResidents in Wuhan, China, were first diagnosed with \"an atypical pneumonia-like illness\" in December 2019, according to a COVID-19 timeline from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nInitial cases all appeared linked to the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market at the time, though there has since been much speculation about the types of research taking place at the Wuhan Institute of Virology.\n\nKoblentz said he believes the available evidence points to a spillover event from an animal, though he added a \"research-related accident can't be ruled out at this time.\"\n\nThe lack of transparency and data from the Chinese government has significantly hindered scientists' efforts to unify around the origin of COVID-19, he said.\n\nRichard Ebright, board of governors professor of chemistry and chemical biology and laboratory director at the Waksman Institute of Microbiology at Rutgers University in New Jersey, testified he believes a \"large preponderance of evidence indicates SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, entered humans through a research incident.\"\n\nEbright also leveled criticism at fellow panelist Robert Garry, who, along with a handful of co-authors, published an opinion article in the journal Nature Medicine in March 2020, titled \"The proximal origin of SARS-CoV-2.\"\n\nIn the commentary, Garry and the other scientists wrote, \"we do not believe that any type of laboratory-based scenario is plausible.\"\n\nEbright said during Tuesday's hearing that the opinion article represented \"scientific misconduct up to and including fraud,\" a characterization that Garry rejected during the hearing.\n\n\"The authors were stating their opinion, but that opinion was not well-founded,\" Ebright said. \"In March of 2020, there was no basis to state that as a conclusion, as opposed to simply being a hypothesis.\"\n\nGarry, professor and associate dean of the School of Medicine at Tulane University in Louisiana, argued on behalf of the spillover event during the hearing, testifying that the virus likely didn't move directly from a bat to humans, but went to an unidentified intermediary animal.\n\n\"The bat coronaviruses are viruses that are spread by the gastrointestinal route,\" Garry said. \"For a virus like this to become a respiratory virus -- it's just going to require too many mutations, too many changes for a bat virus to spill directly over to a human being. That could only really happen in nature with replication through an intermediate animal.\"\n\nGarry also defended gain-of-function research during the hearing, arguing that it has had some beneficial impact, though he noted that it does need \"appropriate safeguards and restrictions.\"\n\nLawmakers and pundits have used several, often evolving, definitions for gain-of-function research in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic. The American Society for Microbiology defines it as techniques \"used in research to alter the function of an organism in such a way that it is able to do more than it used to do.\"\n\nWhen research is \"responsibly performed\" on highly transmissible and pathogenic viruses, it can lead to advances in public health and national security, Garry testified.\n\n\"Without gain-of-function research, we'd have no Tamiflu. Without gain-of-function research, we wouldn't have a vaccine to prevent cancer caused by infection by the human papilloma virus,\" Garry said. \"And without gain-of-function research, we won't be able to identify how novel viruses infect us. And if we don't know how they infect us, we cannot develop appropriate treatments and cures for the next potential pandemic creating virus.\"\n\nNew Hampshire Democratic Sen. Maggie Hassan raised several questions about whether there's enough oversight of how the United States spends research dollars as well as what mechanisms are in place to monitor how private entities conduct certain types of research.\n\n\"While their research has the potential to cure diseases and boost our economy, unless they accept federal funding, there is very little federal oversight to ensure that private labs are engaged in safe and ethical research,\" she said.\n\nKoblentz from George Mason University said there is much less oversight of biosafety and biosecurity for private research facilities that don't receive federal funding.\n\n\"In order to expand the scope of oversight to all privately funded research, (it) would require legislative action,\" Koblentz said.\n\nCongress, he said, should establish a national bio-risk management agency that would have authority over biosafety and biosecurity \"regardless of the source of funding.\"\n\n\"At the end of the day, it shouldn't matter where the funding comes from in terms of making sure this research is being done safely, securely and responsibly,\" Koblentz said.\n\nKentucky Republican Sen. Rand Paul, ranking member on the committee, said the panel will hold an upcoming hearing specifically on gain-of-function research, including what steps Congress should take to ensure it doesn't put the public at risk.\n\nCommittee Chairman Gary Peters, a Michigan Democrat, said during the hearing that lawmakers \"must learn from the challenges faced during this pandemic to ensure we can better protect Americans from future potential biological incidents.\"\n\n\"Our government needs the flexibility to determine the origins of naturally occurring outbreaks, as well as potential outbreaks that could arise from mistakes or malicious intent,\" Peters said.\n\nUtah Republican Sen. Mitt Romney, after listening to some of the debate, expressed exasperation that so much attention is going toward what caused the last pandemic and not on how to prepare for the next one.\n\n\"Given the fact that it could have been either, we know what action we ought to take to protect from either,\" Romney said. \"And so why there's so much passion around that makes me think it's more political than scientific, but maybe I'm wrong.\"\n\nThe United States, he said, shouldn't be funding gain-of-function research and should \"insist\" that anyone who receives federal funding follow the standards of the International Organization for Standardization.", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SARS-CoV-2", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "SARS-CoV-2"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spillover_infection", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Spillover infection"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Coronavirus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Virus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Investigations_into_the_origin_of_COVID-19", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Investigations into the origin of COVID-19"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gain-of-function_research", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Gain-of-function research"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Intelligence_Community", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States Intelligence Community"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bat", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Bat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wuhan_Institute_of_Virology", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wuhan Institute of Virology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huanan_Seafood_Wholesale_Market", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_agent", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Biological agent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate_Committee_on_Homeland_Security_and_Governmental_Affairs", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York (state)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biodefense", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Biodefense"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Mason_University", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "George Mason University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_engineering", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Genetic engineering"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_community", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Scientific community"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nature_(journal)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nature (journal)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long_Island", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Long Island"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Long Island"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Health_Organization", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "World Health Organization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centers_for_Disease_Control_and_Prevention", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Centers for Disease Control and Prevention"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theodore_Roosevelt", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Theodore Roosevelt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virginia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Virginia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Virginia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wuhan", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wuhan"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Wuhan"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_H._Ebright", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Richard H.

natural COVID-19 origin", "body": "A panel of scientists fiercely debated Tuesday whether COVID-19 stemmed from a laboratory accident or naturally spread from animals to humans, with one expert declaring there was \"zero\" evidence for a natural origin of the pandemic that killed millions around the world.\n\nRutgers University molecular biologist Dr. Richard Ebright said in his opening statement before the Senate Homeland Security Committee that the \"large preponderance of evidence indicates SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID, entered humans through a research incident.\"\n\nEbright, who was joined in arguing for the so-called \"lab-leak theory\" by Dr. Stephen Quay, a former professor at Stanford University School of Medicine, added that \"no -- zero -- secure evidence points to COVID's natural origins.\"\n\n\"The probability this actually came from nature based on these features is one in a million,\" Quay concurred.\n\nCOVID-19 emerged in Wuhan, China, more than 800 miles from \"the closest bats harboring SARS-CoV-2 live viruses that could have served as progenitors,\" he noted.\n\nThe now-debarred Wuhan Institute of Virology (WIV) conducted US-funded, gain-of-function research on SARS-like bat viruses between 2014 and 2021.\n\nDuring that research period, the WIV conducted \"the world's largest research program on bat SARS viruses\" and had \"the world's largest collection of bat SARS viruses,\" Ebright added.\n\nAdditionally, the Rutgers prof said, the Wuhan lab had conducted experiments with SARS viruses that had a \"high pandemic potential\" in the four years before COVID-19 -- and just one year earlier, had run research with the genetically modified SARS viruses \"that match in detail the features of SARS-CoV-2.\"\n\nThat research was funded by a more than $4 million National Institutes of Health (NIH) grant to the since-suspended Manhattan-based public health nonprofit EcoHealth Alliance, about half a million dollars of which directly flowed to WIV.\n\nEcoHealth lost its status as a federal grantee for likely violating biosafety standards with its WIV project, titled \"Understanding the Risk of Bat Coronavirus Emergence,\" and failing to immediately report the experiments, which resulted in a modified virus that was 10,000 times more infectious.\n\nEcoHealth, led by Dr. Peter Daszak, has denied that the experiments constituted gain-of-function research -- despite testimony from NIH principal deputy director Dr. Lawrence Tabak last month stating that it was.\n\nQuay in his opening remarks said that scientists \"dependent on NIH or NIAID funding may have pressure to publicly agree with orthodoxies,\" such as arguing against SARS-CoV-2 escaping a research lab.\n\nThat implicated one of the panel's other witnesses, Dr. Robert Garry, who has received NIH funding and authored a controversial scientific paper -- prompted by then-National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) Director Dr. Anthony Fauci -- in early 2020 to debunk the lab leak theory.\n\nEbright in his opening remarks noted that the paper, \"The proximal origin of SARS-CoV-2,\" was published in March 2020 as \"an opinion piece,\" not backed by available evidence, and completely disproven by \"private communications\" of the authors that were released last year by the House Select Subcommittee on the Coronavirus Pandemic.\n\n\"Four of the authors of that paper,\" he said, \"in their private communications show clearly that they knew the conclusion that they state in that article is invalid.\"\n\nScientists have twice requested the retraction of the paper, Ebright added, suggesting that its authors were guilty of \"scientific misconduct\" and potentially fraud.\n\nBoth Garry, a professor and associate dean at Tulane University School of Medicine, and Gregory Koblentz, an associate professor and director of the Biodefense Graduate Program at George Mason University, argued against the theory during the Senate hearing.\n\n\"I firmly believe the available evidence indicates that the spillover happened naturally likely at the seafood market in Wuhan, China,\" Garry testified, without immediately explaining the evidence that led him to that conclusion.\n\nIn subsequent questioning, the Tulane professor admitted that \"we don't know\" whether the WIV had the virus, and \"we don't have the evidence from the Chinese\" that points either way.\n\n\"I am first and foremost a scientist, and I will adhere to the scientific method, so I will continue to evaluate the evidence and reassess the validity of my scientific hypotheses regarding the origin since I've spoken to you,\" Garry told panel members, adding later that he still stood by the 2020 paper arguing against the lab leak.\n\n\"Natural spillovers have multiple markets,\" Quay pointed out at another point, referencing facts related to the earlier SARS virus that ripped through China beginning in 2002.\n\nKoblentz noted that the US intelligence community remained \"divided\" about the origins of COVID-19, but the theory that it \"was deliberately developed as a biological weapon has been unanimously rejected by all US intelligence agencies.\"\n\nThe rare bipartisan congressional investigation into COVID origins was presided over by the committee's chairman, Sen. Gary Peters (D-Mich.), and ranking member, Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.), who is also a doctor.\n\n\"The COVID-19 pandemic was one of the worst public health crises that our country has ever faced,\" Peters said in his opening statement. \"We lost more than 1 million Americans to the virus. ... Today's hearing is intended to examine the available scientific evidence related to the virus.\"\n\n\"Given the likelihood that the Chinese government may never fully disclose all the information they have about the initial COVID-19 outbreak, we must use the scientific information available to better prepare for future potential pandemics,\" Peters affirmed.\n\nPaul in his opening remarks highlighted the \"private doubts\" of many of the lab leak opponents -- who smeared those skeptical of a natural origin as \"conspiracy theorists.\"\n\n\"The cover up went beyond public statements, federal agencies and key officials withheld and continue to conceal crucial information from both Congress and the public,\" Paul said, thanking Peters for joining him in leading the committee hearing.\n\n\"HHS and NIH have not produced documents related to the gain of function research that the chairman and I requested over a year ago,\" he added, \"and they're still resisting.\"", "source": {"uri": "nypost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "New York Post"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SARS-CoV-2", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "SARS-CoV-2"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SARS", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "SARS"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Coronavirus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bat", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Institutes_of_Health", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "National Institutes of Health"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Virus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wuhan", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Wuhan"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Wuhan"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rutgers_University", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Rutgers University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gain-of-function_research", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gain-of-function research"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wuhan_Institute_of_Virology", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wuhan Institute of Virology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_H._Ebright", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Richard H.

Mitt Romney (R-UT) departs from a luncheon at the National Republican Senatorial Committee building in Washington on June 13, 2024. (Anna Moneymaker/Getty Images)\n\nThe blame is on the Chinese regime no matter how COVID-19 arose, said Sen. Mitt Romney (R-Utah).\n\n\"Whether it was from a wet market, or the Wuhan lab, China's to blame. Both those things were in China,\" he said at a Senate Homeland Security and Government Affairs Committee hearing examining evidence on the origins of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, on June 18.\n\n\"They should take responsibility for it and should have opened themselves up to complete disclosure.\"\n\nSince the virus emerged from China's Wuhan city and ballooned into a global pandemic, Beijing has repeatedly deflected responsibility, demanding critics look elsewhere around the world for possible sources of the disease.\n\nIt has meanwhile muffled whistleblowers and refused to hand full data to outside investigators, including experts of the World Health Organization, even as it proclaims itself \"open and transparent\" on the origins issue.\n\nThe question remains whether the virus existed in Wuhan before the pandemic broke out, and for how long.\n\n\"It's just one of the many things that we're missing that we would like to get from the Chinese government,\" said Dr. Robert Garry, a professor of microbiology and immunology at Tulane University.\n\nIn terms of the Wuhan Institute of Virology, which is at the center of lab leak suspicions, outside experts are still hoping to review records about the research the lab is conducting, medical surveillance on the facility's researchers, and maintenance operations for the biocontainment equipment, to determine whether there were signs of accidents or the virus's laboratory escape.\n\n\"The Chinese government has chosen to be opaque about what they have and what they know, in a way that has frustrated people involved with looking at this in terms of assessing both the natural zoonotic spillover pathway and also looking at the lab accident pathway,\" said Gregory Koblentz, director of the biodefense graduate program at George Mason University.\n\nBoth Dr. Garry and Mr. Koblentz lean in favor of a natural origins theory. Dr. Garry was one of the co-authors of a Nature article titled \"The proximal origin of SARS-CoV-2,\" which plays down the likelihood that the virus originated in a lab.\n\nDr. Steven Quay, founder of the clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company Atossa Therapeutics, pointed to circumstantial evidence such as the Wuhan lab's links to the military, the takedown of the lab's virus sequence database in September 2019, and the shipment of vials of dangerous pathogens to the lab prior to the outbreak as factors that raised his suspicion.\n\nThe COVID-19 virus genome contains unique features such as a furin cleavage site in its spike protein that has been linked to the virus' high infectivity. Some U.S. scientists had proposed to experiment with this feature on coronavirus genomes in 2018 in collaboration with the Wuhan Institute of Virology.\n\nDr. Quay also noted the proteins of opening reading frame 8 in the SARS-CoV-2 genome, an accessory protein that researchers say functions to block one's body from presenting symptoms of infection, which he described as \"highly unusual\" and \"highly synthetic.\"\n\n\"The probability that SARS-2 came from nature, based on these features, is one in a billion,\" he said.\n\nWith no definitive evidence on the virus's origin, lawmakers and witnesses at the hearing agree that there should be stricter guardrails over gain-of-function research, or the manipulation of a pathogen that can enhance its pandemic potential.\n\n\"In this category of research, which is the most significant in terms of consequences, and potentially existential risk, there is almost no regulation with force of law,\" said Dr. Richard Ebright, a molecular biologist at Rutgers University. \"That needs to change.\"\n\nRegarding accountability, Sen. Roger Marshall (R-Kan.) called for a \"9/11-style commission\" to probe the issue.\n\n\"There's too many bright lights here. There's too many cameras, it's too political,\" he told NTD, a sister outlet of The Epoch Times. \"We need to get this outside of Washington, D.C., and investigate this.\n\n\"The most important thing we're doing is trying to prevent this from happening again.\"", "source": {"uri": "ntd.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NTD"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Coronavirus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Virus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitt_Romney", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mitt Romney"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wuhan", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Wuhan"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Wuhan"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SARS-CoV-2", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "SARS-CoV-2"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wuhan_Institute_of_Virology", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wuhan Institute of Virology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Republican_Senatorial_Committee", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National Republican Senatorial Committee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wet_market", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wet market"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whistleblower", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Whistleblower"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Health_Organization", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "World Health Organization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_of_China", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Government of China"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Homeland_Security", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of Homeland Security"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington,_D.C.", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beijing", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Beijing"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Beijing"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_lab_leak_theory", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "COVID-19 lab leak theory"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spillover_infection", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Spillover infection"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biocontainment", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Biocontainment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biodefense", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Biodefense"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tulane_University", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tulane University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zoonosis", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Zoonosis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Mason_University", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "George Mason University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microbiology", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Microbiology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genome", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Genome"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunology", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Immunology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nature_(journal)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nature (journal)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surveillance", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Surveillance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gain-of-function_research", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gain-of-function research"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_H._Ebright", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Richard H.

Ron Johnson (R-Wisc.), a member of the Senate Committee on Homeland Security & Governmental Affairs, to Robert Garry Jr., PhD, associate dean of the Tulane University School of Medicine in New Orleans. \"You bear that responsibility for violating the public's trust from your scientific misconduct and fraud.\"\n\nGarry was a co-author of a letter published in Nature Medicine in March 2020 suggesting that SARS-CoV-2 likely occurred naturally -- such as by transmission from one animal to an intermediary animal, and then to humans -- rather than as a result of an accidental lab leak.\n\nDuring Tuesday's hearing, Garry testified that in the letter, often referred to as the \"proximal origins\" paper, \"we didn't put anything ... that we didn't believe was true. The conclusions of that paper have held up very well. In fact, there's been an abundance of scientific evidence that has come forward since then to support all the conclusions, everything we wrote in that paper, so there's no fraud.\"\n\nAnother witness, Richard Ebright, PhD, laboratory director at Rutgers University's Waksman Institute of Microbiology in Piscataway, New Jersey, also criticized the paper. \"We know that compelling evidence has been presented as a result of congressional inquiry in the House that four of the authors of that paper [including Garry] in their private communications show clearly that they knew the conclusion that they stated in that article was invalid,\" he said.\n\nEbright, a proponent of the \"lab leak\" theory, argued that researchers should \"never, under any circumstances, in a scientific journal state conclusions that you know to be unsound. That represents scientific misconduct up to and including fraud, and the paper in question has been recommended for review of retraction.\"\n\nThe witnesses and senators went back and forth about how the virus -- which was first observed in the city of Wuhan in China -- originated. \"The wildlife trade in China was the only enterprise in the world comparable in size to the United States cattle industry,\" said Garry. \"Multiple spillovers of SARS-CoV, the first SARS, occurred in 2002 through 2004, and they came from the Chinese wildlife trade. Evidence similarly indicates that this likely happened again with SARS-CoV-2 in 2019.\"\n\nNot so, said Steven Quay, MD, PhD, CEO of Atossa Therapeutics and a former faculty member of the Stanford University School of Medicine in California. With COVID-19, \"457 animals were tested in the [Wuhan] market. Zero were found to be infected.\" That compares with SARS-1, \"with 92 animals, 100% infected.\"\n\nIn addition, \"the wildlife vendors in SARS-1 were all infected,\" said Quay. \"We have 10 vendors here [in the Wuhan market]; none of them are infected.\"\n\nSen. Mitt Romney (R-Utah) tried to take a conciliatory approach. \"There's a lot of energy and passion around 'was it from an animal or was it a lab leak?' and I must admit, I don't understand why,\" he said, noting that the answer will likely never be known. The fact that \"there's so much passion around it makes me think it's more political than scientific.\"\n\nIn any event, \"it strikes me that, based on what I've heard, we shouldn't be financing gain-of-function research,\" he said. Generally, \"gain-of-function\" refers to research involving a genetic mutation in an organism, such as a virus, that confers a new or enhanced ability upon it. It is the type of research that is said to be performed at the Wuhan Institute of Virology.\n\nBut Garry defended gain-of-function research, arguing that in some cases it advances public health and national security. \"Without gain-of-function research, we'd have no Tamiflu,\" he said in his opening testimony. \"Without gain-of-function research, we wouldn't have a vaccine to prevent cancer caused by infection by the human papillomavirus, and without gain-of-function research, we won't be able to identify how novel viruses infect us, and if we don't know how they infect us, we cannot develop appropriate treatments and cures for the next potential pandemic-creating virus.\"\n\nSen. Maggie Hassan (D-N.H.), the lone Democrat to attend the hearing besides Committee Chairman Sen. Gary Peters (D-Mich.), asked what could be done to more tightly regulate private research labs that don't rely on government funding.\n\n\"The oversight of privately funded research is much less than that of federally funded research in terms of both biosafety, biosecurity, and 'dual-use' research oversight,\" said Gregory Koblentz, PhD, director of the Biodefense Graduate Program at George Mason University in Fairfax, Virginia. (\"Dual use\" refers to research that could be used for either beneficial or harmful purposes.)\n\n\"What we've seen in the area of dual-use research oversight, for example, in the most recent policy that the Biden administration released only applies to federally funded research,\" he said. \"However, there is the ability for federal agencies to require their grant recipients to apply this policy to all research, including research that's privately funded,\" although it might require using special authorities only available to certain agencies.\n\nAsked by Peters what the U.S. could do to prevent future outbreaks, the witnesses had a few ideas. Quay suggested establishing an independent review board that would operate outside of NIH to regulate certain types of research.\n\nEbright agreed with the idea of independent review, adding that \"improvements in oversight need to be codified in law so they are enforceable with the rule of law.

That could only really happen in nature with replication through an intermediate animal.\"\n\nGarry also defended gain-of-function research during the hearing, arguing that it has had some beneficial impact, though he noted that it does need \"appropriate safeguards and restrictions.\"\n\nLawmakers and pundits have used several, often evolving, definitions for gain-of-function research in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic. The American Society for Microbiology defines it as techniques \"used in research to alter the function of an organism in such a way that it is able to do more than it used to do.\"\n\nWhen research is \"responsibly performed\" on highly transmissible and pathogenic viruses, it can lead to advances in public health and national security, Garry testified.\n\n\"Without gain-of-function research, we'd have no Tamiflu. Without gain-of-function research, we wouldn't have a vaccine to prevent cancer caused by infection by the human papilloma virus,\" Garry said. \"And without gain-of-function research, we won't be able to identify how novel viruses infect us. And if we don't know how they infect us, we cannot develop appropriate treatments and cures for the next potential pandemic creating virus.\"\n\nOversight of funding, research\n\nNew Hampshire Democratic Sen. Maggie Hassan raised several questions about whether there's enough oversight of how the United States spends research dollars as well as what mechanisms are in place to monitor how private entities conduct certain types of research.\n\n\"While their research has the potential to cure diseases and boost our economy, unless they accept federal funding, there is very little federal oversight to ensure that private labs are engaged in safe and ethical research,\" she said.\n\nKoblentz from George Mason University said there is much less oversight of biosafety and biosecurity for private research facilities that don't receive federal funding.\n\n\"In order to expand the scope of oversight to all privately funded research, (it) would require legislative action,\" Koblentz said.\n\nCongress, he said, should establish a national bio-risk management agency that would have authority over biosafety and biosecurity \"regardless of the source of funding.\"\n\n\"At the end of the day, it shouldn't matter where the funding comes from in terms of making sure this research is being done safely, securely and responsibly,\" Koblentz said.\n\nKentucky Republican Sen. Rand Paul, ranking member on the committee, said the panel will hold an upcoming hearing specifically on gain-of-function research, including what steps Congress should take to ensure it doesn't put the public at risk.\n\nThe next pandemic\n\nCommittee Chairman Gary Peters, a Michigan Democrat, said during the hearing that lawmakers \"must learn from the challenges faced during this pandemic to ensure we can better protect Americans from future potential biological incidents.\"\n\n\"Our government needs the flexibility to determine the origins of naturally occurring outbreaks, as well as potential outbreaks that could arise from mistakes or malicious intent,\" Peters said.\n\nUtah Republican Sen. Mitt Romney, after listening to some of the debate, expressed exasperation that so much attention is going toward what caused the last pandemic and not on how to prepare for the next one.\n\n\"Given the fact that it could have been either, we know what action we ought to take to protect from either,\" Romney said. \"And so why there's so much passion around that makes me think it's more political than scientific, but maybe I'm wrong.\"\n\nThe United States, he said, shouldn't be funding gain-of-function research and should \"insist\" that anyone who receives federal funding follow the standards of the International Organization for Standardization.", "source": {"uri": "idahostatejournal.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Idaho State Journal"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SARS-CoV-2", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "SARS-CoV-2"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spillover_infection", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Spillover infection"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Coronavirus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Intelligence_Community", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States Intelligence Community"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Virus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Investigations_into_the_origin_of_COVID-19", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Investigations into the origin of COVID-19"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gain-of-function_research", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Gain-of-function research"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bat", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Bat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wuhan_Institute_of_Virology", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wuhan Institute of Virology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huanan_Seafood_Wholesale_Market", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_agent", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Biological agent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate_Committee_on_Homeland_Security_and_Governmental_Affairs", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biodefense", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Biodefense"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Mason_University", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "George Mason University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_engineering", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Genetic engineering"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_community", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Scientific community"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centers_for_Disease_Control_and_Prevention", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Centers for Disease Control and Prevention"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_of_China", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Government of China"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virginia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Virginia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Virginia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wuhan", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wuhan"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Wuhan"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_H._Ebright", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Richard H.

At question was a set of private messages that year between him and other scientists in which Garry expressed doubts about the likelihood of the virus\u2019s natural transmission.\n\n\u201cDespite these private doubts, publicly these so-called experts and their allies were dismissing the lab leak theory as a conspiracy,\u201d said Senator Rand Paul, a Republican from Kentucky and ranking member on the committee. Paul also highlighted private comments made by Anthony Fauci, who during the pandemic led the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases; Francis Collins, then director of the National Institutes of Health; and Kristian Andersen, an evolutionary biologist at Scripps Research and Garry\u2019s co-author on the four-year-old paper.\n\nGarry, in response, said that at the outset of writing the article, he did not rule out three possible pathways: direct spillover from bat to human, spillover from bat to human via an intermediate animal and a leak resulting from a research incident. As more evidence came to light, however, he said it became clear that the spill \u201chappened naturally, likely at the Huanan seafood market in Wuhan, China\u201d, adding that he would continually re-evaluate this conclusion if new evidence came to light.\n\nTuesday\u2019s hearing, featuring four scientists as witnesses, is the latest in a long line of congressional hearings about Covid-19\u2019s origins, but the first conducted by the Democratic-led Senate.\n\nEarlier this month, Fauci testified before the House select subcommittee on the coronavirus. During questioning by Republican lawmakers, the retired immunologist refuted allegations that he was part of a Covid-19 origins cover-up and that he funded research that sparked the pandemic. Republicans have alleged that Fauci and Collins exerted pressure on Garry and other scientists to disprove the lab leak theory.\n\nThe panel of scientists convened on Tuesday represented different sides of the Covid-19 origins debate, with two \u2013 Steven Quay, CEO of Atossa Therapeutics and former professor at Stanford University, and Richard Ebright, a molecular biologist at Rutgers University \u2013 supporting the lab leak theory. Garry and Gregory Koblentz, a biodefence scholar at George Mason University, represented the natural spillover side, with Koblentz noting that a lab-related incident \u201ccannot be ruled out\u201d.\n\nQuay and Ebright also pushed for greater limits on \u201cgain of function\u201d research \u2013 a risky type of research often involving tweaking genetic make-up and typically disfavoured by those supporting the theory that the Covid-19 virus was engineered.\n\n\u201cThat research creates threats, and those threats are existentially risky threats,\u201d Ebright said. Garry, on the other hand, noted the necessity of the research to developing vaccines and treatments to life-threatening diseases.\n\nDespite the disagreements on display, lawmakers and scientists alike acknowledged that the roots of Covid-19 would never be known with certainty.\n\nSenator Mitt Romney, Republican of Utah, questioned the value of debating the matter if it was impossible to know with absolute certainty.\n\n\u201cWhether it was from a wet market or the Wuhan lab, China\u2019s to blame,\u201d Romney said.\n\nOthers said that better answers relied on getting more information from the Chinese government.\n\n\u201cA key obstacle to [a] more definitive conclusion is the lack of transparency exercised by the Chinese government,\u201d said Koblentz, noting that Beijing has not shared the raw data from samples taken from Wuhan.\n\nHe added: \u201cRarely is it possible to identify the exact sequence of events that led to the first human infection that sparked a pandemic.\u201d\n\nWitnesses also proposed a range of actions for Congress to take, including increasing oversight over privately funded research and strengthening the US\u2019s bio-surveillance system.\n\nAccording to a declassified report released last year, four US intelligence agencies and the National Intelligence Council believe the virus was transferred from animals to humans. The Department of Energy and the FBI support the lab leak theory, the former doing so with \u201clow confidence\u201d and the latter with \u201cmoderate confidence\u201d. Two others, including the CIA, declined to make an assessment.", "source": {"uri": "scmp.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "South China Morning Post"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_lab_leak_theory", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "COVID-19 lab leak theory"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Coronavirus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_S._Fauci", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Anthony S.

Most agencies suspect the virus outbreak began naturally, with the Energy Department and FBI intelligence units reporting the virus most likely escaped from the Wuhan laboratory.\n\nChina's government has adamantly denied the lab leak theory and thwarted international investigators from learning details of the virus origin. The regime removed an online database at the Wuhan Institute that could have provided clues to the outbreak, the scientists at the hearing said.\n\nThe Biden administration also blocked lawmakers from obtaining information from records and documents related to the virus origin, senators said.\n\nCommittee Chairman Seen. Gary Peters, Michigan Democrat, said finding the cause of the COVID pandemic was a matter of national security and that the government needed to better protect Americans from future biological incidents.\n\nKentucky Sen. Rand Paul, the committee's ranking Republican, said the critical question to be learned is whether the virus emanated from the laboratory.\n\n\"Do we know for certain that came from the lab? No. But there's a preponderance of evidence indicating that it may have come from the lab,\" Mr. Paul said.\n\nMr. Paul said early on in the pandemic a group of American scientists, including Dr. Anthony Fauci who until recently was the federal government's leading virus expert, worked aggressively to label the notion of a laboratory source for the SARS-COV-2 virus an unfounded conspiracy theory. Today, the origin of the virus from the Wuhan Institute of Virology is one of two leading theories. The second is an animal source for the virus.\n\nPrivate emails among federal health authorities in the early weeks of the pandemic show that many scientists worked behind the scenes in medical journals and social media to discredit all public discussion of the Wuhan laboratory as an origin point, Mr. Paul said.\n\n\"The cover-up went beyond public statements. Federal agencies and key officials withheld and continue to conceal crucial information from both Congress and the public,\" he said.\n\nSteven Quay, a virus specialist formerly at Stanford University, and Richard Ebright, a virus expert at Rutgers University, told lawmakers there is no evidence supporting the theory that the virus originated in animals in China. Both these scientists said the preponderance of evidence convinced them the virus began at the Wuhan Institute of Virology, emanating from risky \"gain of function\" research there and the collection of a large number of bat coronaviruses at the lab.\n\nThe SARS-COV-2 virus that causes COVID is a bat coronavirus.\n\nBut two other virus experts testifying Tuesday, Gregory Koblentz from George Mason University and Robert Garry from Tulane University, said they are convinced the virus most likely began at the Huanan wild animal market in Wuhan. Dr. Koblentz said the available evidence points most strongly to an animal origin, although a research-related accident cannot be ruled out and criticized what he said was the failure to share key data by China's Communist regime.\n\n\"A key obstacle to more definitive conclusion is the lack of transparency exercised by the Chinese government which affects assessments of both potential pathways to the pandemic,\" he said. \"Until there's an independent international transparent investigation, it's unlikely we'll be able to come up with a more definitive conclusion.\"\n\nDr. Koblentz said it is difficult to pin down the origin of a pandemic and the hunt often takes years.\n\nDr. Garry said the first SARS-related outbreak in China in 2004 came from the wildlife animal trade and therefore the pandemic likely started again from animals at the Huanan seafood market in Wuhan.\n\nSamples obtained at the southwest corner of the market included genetic material from raccoon dogs and palm civets that Dr. Garry said showed \"commingling\" with the SARS-COV-2 virus that is \"not compatible with a lab leak.\"\n\nSix reasons to suspect the lab\n\nDr. Quay, in his testimony, identified six reasons the virus came from the laboratory, including evidence the virus was circulating in Wuhan and other parts of the world months before a case surfaced at the wild animal market.\n\n\"The evidence includes the calculation of the time for the most recent common ancestor; hospital overloads in Wuhan; antibodies and patients from Italy, Spain in the U.S.; wastewater samples from Brazil; sick athletes at the October Wuhan military games; school closings in Wuhan, and dozens of documented patients,\" Dr. Quay said. \"This dismisses out of hand the market as the origin.\"\n\nDr. Ebright said he based his view of a laboratory leak on publicly available documents, press reports and scientific papers and his research experience work on experience and work on biosafety, biosecurity and bio-risk management regarding work on pathogens.\n\nFour key facts supported his assessment, including the fact that COVID emerged in Wuhan, a city 800 miles from the closest area harboring a SARS-COV-2-like virus that could have been a cause for the actual pandemic virus. The Wuhan Institute of Virology also was conducting the world's largest research program on SARS-like viruses and had the largest collection of viruses similar to SARS-COV-2, including one that is very similar to the actual virus.\n\nThe evidence points \"away from a natural origin of COVID,\" he said. \"And Wuhan's status as the global epicenter of research on bat SARS viruses points toward a research origin of COVID.\"\n\nAlso, virus research proposals presented to the National Institute of Health and the Pentagon's Defense Advanced Research Agency by a contractor \"make an extremely strong case, a smoking gun, for research origin,\" he said.\n\nDr. Garry came under fire from Republicans during the hearing for his role in producing an opinion article in a medical journal dismissing the lab leak theory in the earliest days of the COVID outbreak.\n\nSen. Josh Hawley, Missouri Republican, criticized Dr. Garry for his role in organizing a group of scientists who attempted to discredit the lab leak theory in a 2020 Nature Medicine article.\n\n\"You said at the time that definitively SARS-COV-2 is not a laboratory construct,\" Mr. Hawley said. \"Of course, our own government key agencies have concluded otherwise.\"\n\nMr. Hawley said Dr. Fauci used the Nature article to \"mobilize\" the federal government to censor people and have them silenced on social media for discussing the laboratory leak theory.\n\n\"I think one of the worst things that happened in the COVID era is that our own government deliberately withheld information from us from the American people, tried to propagandize the American people, used the arms and agencies of government to actively censor Americans who dared to question the propaganda and they're still lying to us,\" Mr. Hawley said.\n\nMr. Hawley said he sponsored legislation that was passed by Congress requiring the declassification of intelligence on the virus origin, but the government so far has refused to make the information available.\n\nDr. Garry responded that he agrees that more intelligence information should be released and defended his role in writing the Nature article.\n\n\"All we did was write a paper in Nature Medicine, 3,000 words,\" he said.\n\nMr. Peters, the committee chair, said China has provided \"relatively little or nothing\" on the virus' origin. Dr. Koblentz said China could provide a range of information that would be useful for determining the origin of the pandemic.\n\nThe information could include virus samples from the Wuhan market and elsewhere in Wuhan and other areas on animal samples.\n\nThe Chinese have released some information but not raw data. China also should provide records of research at the Wuhan Institute and medical surveillance on researchers and maintenance records on the operation of bio containment equipment, Dr. Koblentz said.\n\nThe Chinese government has denied the virus came from the Wuhan Institute of Virology and has accused the United States of introducing the virus in China through the military games in Wuhan and through frozen food -- both theories that the U.S. government has rejected.", "source": {"uri": "washingtontimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Washington Times"}, "authors": [{"uri": "bill_gertz@washingtontimes.com", "name": "Bill Gertz", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SARS-CoV-2", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "SARS-CoV-2"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_lab_leak_theory", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "COVID-19 lab leak theory"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wuhan_Institute_of_Virology", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Wuhan Institute of Virology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Coronavirus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rand_Paul", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rand Paul"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Virus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_government_of_the_United_States", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Federal government of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wuhan", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Wuhan"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Wuhan"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidency_of_Joe_Biden", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Presidency of Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate_Committee_on_Homeland_Security_and_Governmental_Affairs", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bat", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Energy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of Energy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intelligence_agency", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Intelligence agency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_security", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National security"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Bureau_of_Investigation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Federal Bureau of Investigation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kentucky", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kentucky"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Kentucky"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michigan", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Michigan"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Michigan"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gain-of-function_research", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gain-of-function research"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic_in_mainland_China", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "COVID-19 pandemic in mainland China"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gary_Peters", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gary Peters"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nyctereutes", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nyctereutes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_H._Ebright", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Richard H.

Some U.S. scientists had proposed to experiment with this feature on coronavirus genomes in 2018 in collaboration with the Wuhan Institute of Virology.\n\n\"The probability that SARS-2 came from nature, based on these features, is one in a billion,\" he said.\n\nWith no definitive evidence on the virus's origin, lawmakers and witnesses at the hearing agree that there should be stricter guardrails over gain-of-function research, or the manipulation of a pathogen that can enhance its pandemic potential.\n\n\"In this category of research, which is the most significant in terms of consequences, and potentially existential risk, there is almost no regulation with force of law,\" said Dr. Richard Ebright, a molecular biologist at Rutgers University. \"That needs to change.\"\n\nRegarding accountability, Sen. Roger Marshall (R-Kan.) called for a \"9/11-style commission\" to probe the issue.\n\n\"There's too many bright lights here. There's too many cameras, it's too political,\" he told NTD, a sister outlet of The Epoch Times. \"We need to get this outside of Washington, D.C., and investigate this.\n\n\"The most important thing we're doing is trying to prevent this from happening again.\"", "source": {"uri": "theepochtimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "www.theepochtimes.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Coronavirus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Virus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wuhan", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Wuhan"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Wuhan"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SARS-CoV-2", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "SARS-CoV-2"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wuhan_Institute_of_Virology", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wuhan Institute of Virology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wet_market", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wet market"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_of_China", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Government of China"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Homeland_Security", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of Homeland Security"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitt_Romney", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mitt Romney"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beijing", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Beijing"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Beijing"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_lab_leak_theory", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "COVID-19 lab leak theory"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spillover_infection", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Spillover infection"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biocontainment", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Biocontainment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biodefense", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Biodefense"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tulane_University", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tulane University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zoonosis", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Zoonosis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Mason_University", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "George Mason University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microbiology", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Microbiology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genome", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Genome"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunology", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Immunology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surveillance", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Surveillance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gain-of-function_research", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gain-of-function research"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus_spike_protein", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Coronavirus spike protein"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_H._Ebright", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Richard H.

Garry, professor and associate dean of the School of Medicine at Tulane University, Steven Quay, chief executive officer at Atossa Therapeutics, Inc., and Richard Ebright, professor of chemistry and chemical biology and laboratory director at Waksman Institute of Microbiology.\n\nIn his opening statement, Sen. Gary Peters (D-MI), the chairman of the committee, opined that investigating Covid's origins is an essential task for ensuring the United States' preparedness for future threats to public health and national security.\n\nRanking member Sen. Rand Paul (R-KY) also said in his opening statement,\n\nUnderstanding the origin of the COVID-19 pandemic is not just about assigning blame -- it's about learning from what happened so we can prevent future, more deadly pandemics and the negative societal consequences associated with them. My goal is to uncover the truth, implement necessary safeguards, and prevent a tragedy of this magnitude from happening again.\n\nThe four witnesses then gave their own opening statements. Koblentz and Garry both argued that Covid-19 was a result of a natural zoonotic \"spillover\" event at the Wuhan wet market, while Quay and Ebright defended the lab leak theory.\n\nThroughout the hearing, Garry in particular was grilled by the committee senators over a paper he co-wrote in Nature Medicine entitled \"The proximal origin of SARS-CoV-2\" in March of 2020. The paper has been accessed nearly six million times on Nature Medicine's website alone since its publication, and was extremely impactful in the early days of Covid response.\n\nIn the paper, Garry argued against the notion that Covid-19 could have come from a lab in Wuhan, although, at the hearing, he claimed that \"I am first and foremost a scientist and I will adhere to the scientific method. So I will continue to evaluate the evidence and reassess the validity of my scientific hypotheses.... I look forward to continuing the scientific debate in peer reviewed materials with other scientists, including those here today.\"\n\nSen. Ron Johnson (R-WI) questioned Garry on the upwards of $25 million he has received in federal grants following the publication of his proximal origins paper, accusing the scientist of being motivated by money rather than doing science for the common good. Garry was visibly uncomfortable during this exchange.\n\nJohnson proceeded to hold up a stack of over 50 redacted pages from more than 4,000 of Dr. Anthony Fauci's documented NIH emails that his staff had to submit Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests to obtain. Johnson said, \"In terms of the cover-up, my guess is the smoking gun exists somewhere under these heavy redactions.\" Garry did not respond.\n\nSen. Josh Hawley (R-MO) in particular took issue with Garry's paper, which Ebright, in his opening statement, had called \"an opinion piece.\"\n\n\"You said at the time that definitively SARS-CoV-2 is not a laboratory construct,\" Sen. Hawley said, also noting that the FBI and Energy Department have both \"concluded otherwise.\"\n\n\"On the basis of this, Dr. Fauci and others cited this piece and went out to use it to mobilize our own government to censor people who ask questions,\" Hawley went on. \"People lost their jobs because of this. Do you regret being part of this effort, this propaganda effort?\"\n\n\"I was simply just writing a paper about our scientific opinions about where this virus came from,\" Garry replied.\n\n\"Oh no, you weren't,\" Hawley retorted. He then read portions of Garry's private email correspondence into the congressional record. \"February 2nd, 2020, you wrote, 'I really can't think of a plausible, natural scenario where you can get from the bat virus, or one very similar to it, to this.... I just can't figure out how this gets accomplished in nature. It's stunning. Of course, in the lab, it would be easy.'\"\n\nPaul also emphasized the discrepancies of what leading scientists and federal officials said in the years since the pandemic began to the public versus what they said in private/ \"The cover-up went beyond public statements,\" he said. \"Federal agencies and key officials withheld and continue to conceal crucial information from both Congress and the public.\"\n\nThe senators turned to Quay and Ebright to uncover the scientific evidence behind the lab leak theory. In his opening statement, Ebright went so far as to say there is \"no -- zero -- secure evidence [that] points to Covid's natural origins.\"\n\nAccording to Ebright, the Wuhan lab had obtained SARS viruses that had a \"high pandemic potential\" four years before the Covid-19 pandemic, and just one year earlier had performed research that genetically modified the viruses \"that match in detail the features of SARS-CoV-2.\"\n\nEbright also noted that the \"smoking gun\" evidence for a lab origin of Covid-19 came from a separate EcoHealth proposal to the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), that proposed the same feature of a \"furin cleavage site\" in the virus. Ebright said that \"SARS-CoV-2 is the only one of more than 800 known SARS viruses that possess a furin cleavage site.\"\n\nPeter Daszak, the president of EcoHealth, downplayed the degree of Chinese cooperation in its DARPA proposal, falsely claiming that the experiments would take place in a North Carolina research lab \"under very high safety conditions,\" Quay revealed.\n\nYet \"the marginal comments in drafts -- that were only obtained through [Freedom of Information Act requests] -- said that Wuhan would lead the project since it was going to be 'cheaper' and 'faster,'\" Quay added.\n\nEbright also used his hearing appearance to argue against gain-of-function research at large -- a topic that Sen. Mitt Romney (R-UT) brought up in his questions to the witnesses. Ebright said, \"It's important to emphasize that the research in question has no -- zero -- civilian practical applications.\"\n\nHe continued, \"Gain-of-function research on potential pandemic pathogens is not used and does not contribute to the development of vaccines, and is not used and does not contribute to the development of drugs.\"\n\nPaul asked Ebright at one point whether his support for the lab leak hypothesis was a \"crazy Republican partisan,\" given that proponents of the theory are often accused of being \"right-wing conspiracy theorists.\"\n\n\"I'm a registered Democrat. I voted for Biden. I have a Biden sign on my lawn and have a Biden bumper sticker,\" Ebright announced, earning laughs from the audience gathered in the hearing room.", "source": {"uri": "theamericanconservative.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The American Conservative"}, "authors": [{"uri": "anastasia_kaliabakos@theamericanconservative.com", "name": "Anastasia Kaliabakos", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Coronavirus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wuhan", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Wuhan"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Wuhan"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SARS-CoV-2", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "SARS-CoV-2"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_lab_leak_theory", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "COVID-19 lab leak theory"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nature_Medicine", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Nature Medicine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wet_market", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Wet market"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josh_Hawley", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Josh Hawley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spillover_infection", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Spillover infection"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gary_Peters", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gary Peters"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_H._Ebright", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Richard H.

To answer this question, let's revisit the early days of the pandemic and examine what some of Anthony Fauci's inner circle said privately about the origins of the virus -- discussions that were only revealed through Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) litigation.\n\nEvolutionary biologist Kristian Andersen wrote, \"The lab escape version of this is so friggin' likely to have happened because they were already doing this type of work and the molecular data is fully consistent with that scenario.\"\n\nEpidemiologist Ian Lipkin stressed the \"nightmare of circumstantial evidence to assess\" regarding the possibility of inadvertent release given the scale of bat coronavirus research pursued in Wuhan, China.\n\nVirologist Bob Garry said at the time, \"I really can't think of a plausible natural scenario when you get from the bat virus, or one very similar to it, COVID-19 where you insert exactly four amino acids, 12 nucleotides, and all have to be added at the exact same time to gain this function. I just can't figure out how this gets accomplished in nature.\" According to Garry, \"it's not crackpot to suggest this could have happened, given the gain of function research we know was happening in Wuhan.\"\n\nEven Ralph Baric, world-famous gain-of-function researcher and collaborator with Wuhan Institute of Virology doctor Shi Zhengli, admitted, \"So [the Wuhan Institute of Virology has] a very large collection of viruses in their laboratory. And so it's -- you know -- proximity is a problem. It's a problem.\"\n\nFederal court orders reveal that Fauci himself privately acknowledged concerns about gain-of-function research in Wuhan and \"mutations in the virus that suggest it might have been engineered\" just days before he commissioned the Proximal Origin paper.\n\nDespite these private doubts, publicly, these so-called experts and their allies were dismissing the lab leak theory as a conspiracy. Within days, Andersen, Lipkin, and Garry were putting the final touches on what will be remembered as one of the most remarkable reversals in modern history.\n\nIn their Proximal Origin paper, these scientists concluded, \"We do not believe that any type of laboratory-based scenario is plausible.\" Media pundits parroted this narrative, while social media platforms censored discussions about the lab leak, labeling it as misinformation and stifling open discourse about the virus's origins.\n\nThe cover-up went beyond public statements. Federal agencies and key officials withheld and continue to conceal crucial information from both Congress and the public.\n\nFor instance, David Morens of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) deleted emails that could have contained valuable insights into early discussions of how and where the virus originated, and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI) failed to comply with a law passed by Congress unanimously to declassify information on the origins of COVID-19. The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and the NIH have not produced documents related to gain-of-function research that Senate Homeland Security Chair Gary Peters (D-Mich.) and I requested nearly a year ago. And just last week, a House committee released its findings that the HHS and the NIH engaged in a deliberate, prolonged effort to deceive the committee about certain gain-of-function research experiments the agencies funded.\n\nThanks to brave whistleblowers, we've learned that EcoHealth Alliance partnered with the Wuhan Institute of Virology on an NIH grant to conduct research to make viruses more dangerous. It was revealed that three scientists who worked at the Wuhan Institute fell sick with COVID-like symptoms in the fall of 2019. Additionally, a brave whistleblower revealed that in 2018, EcoHealth, the Wuhan Institute of Virology, and the University of North Carolina submitted a proposal to the military research agency DARPA to insert a furin cleavage site remarkably similar to COVID-19 into bat coronaviruses, a modification expected to make the virus more lethal.\n\nThese revelations have provided crucial evidence on the origins of COVID-19. In fact, both the FBI and the Department of Energy now conclude that COVID-19 resulted from a lab.\n\nThe American people deserve complete transparency on the origins of COVID-19. The pandemic killed millions of people and shut down global economies. Our federal and state governments used the pandemic as a justification to strip Americans of their civil liberties and freedoms.

Quay, M.D., Ph.D. -- CEO of Atossa Therapeutics Inc. and former faculty member at Stanford University's School of Medicine -- and Richard H. Ebright, Ph.D., professor of chemistry and chemical biology and lab director at the Waksman Institute of Microbiology at Rutgers University.\n\nQuay -- who began by telling the committee he was speaking \"as an independent scientist\" with no relevant financial ties -- explained that the genome of SARS-CoV-2 has seven features that would be expected to be found in a virus constructed in a laboratory and which are not found in viruses from nature.\n\n\"The statistical probability of finding each feature in nature can be determined,\" Quay said, \"and the combined probability that SARS2 came from nature is less than one in a billion.\"\n\nEbright said his extensive research and gathering of documents likewise pointed toward a lab leak.\n\nHe also said the \"gain-of-function\" research on potentially dangerous pathogens -- like the experiments underway at the Wuhan Institute when COVID-19 emerged -- \"has no civilian application\" but is easy for researchers to do and make money doing.\n\n\"Researchers undertake it because it is fast,\" Ebright said, \"it is easy, it requires no specialized equipment or skills, and it was prioritized for funding and has been prioritized for publication by scientific journals.\"\n\n\"These are major incentives to researchers worldwide, in China and in the U.S.,\" he pointed out.\n\nMoreover, gain-of-function research is largely unregulated, Ebright said.\n\nThere needs to be an independent agency that oversees and regulates this risky research, he said.\n\n\"Only after there is an acknowledgment,\" Ebright said, \"that there is a very real possibility -- not a remote possibility, but a very real possibility -- of a lab origin will there be the political will to impose regulation on this scientific community that has successfully resisted and obstructed regulation for two decades.\"\n\nEbright added, \"I see this acknowledgment today in a bipartisan fashion among members of this committee.\"\n\nWhen asked how important it is that legislators pass a law to regulate gain-of-function research, Ebright said it's a \"matter of survival.\"", "source": {"uri": "sgtreport.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "SGT

It was the first in a series of Senate hearings regarding the dangerous threats associated with high-risk biological research and technology.\n\nOn Tuesday, Paul provided significant evidence to support his claim that COVID originated from the Wuhan Institute of Virology. This included assessments of the virus and the pandemic by government agencies such as the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Department of Energy, reinforcing claims that COVID came from a lab leak. Paul also provided private communications from Dr. Anthony Fauci's associates, which was only revealed after Freedom of Information Act requests and litigation. These revelations are arguably some of the most substantial evidence that supports the theory that COVID originated from a lab.\n\nConsider just some of the damning remarks uncovered in Paul's quest to find the truth that was provided in a press release about the hearing.\n\n\"The lab escape version of this is so friggin' likely to have happened because they were already doing this type of work and the molecular data is fully consistent with that scenario,\" said Kristian Andersen, an evolutionary biologist at Scripps Research.\n\nThis \"version,\" as Andersen called it, was also embraced by virologist Robert Garry of Tulane University School of Medicine.\n\n\"[I] really can't think of a plausible natural scenario when you get from the bat virus, or one very similar to it, COVID-19 where you insert exactly four amino acids, 12 nucleotides, and all have to be added at the exact same time to gain this function,\" Garry said. \"I just can't figure out how this gets accomplished in nature.\"\n\nThe admission from a renowned virologist that he isn't sure how \"this gets accomplished in nature\" is a powerful revelation discovered and made public by the Senate hearing. It's a statement that the public needs to hear -- and hear repeatedly if need be. Garry also suggested that the lab leak was plausible, given his knowledge of the research he knew was occurring in Wuhan.\n\n\"It's not crackpot to suggest this could have happened, given the gain of function research we know was happening in Wuhan,\" Garry said in one of the statements unearthed by the Senate committee.\n\nOther comments were of similar messaging and tone.\n\nW. Ian Lipkin, the John Snow Professor of Epidemiology at the Mailman School of Public Health at Columbia University, was concerned about the \"nightmare of circumstantial evidence to assess\" regarding lab leak possibilities, especially since there was a significant amount of bat coronavirus research being conducted at Wuhan, according to the release.\n\nMoreover, Ralph Baric, cited as a \"world-famous gain-of-function researcher\" and collaborator with a doctor at Wuhan, conceded that Wuhan's research and practices could have caused the virus to be released.\n\n\"So they [the Wuhan Institute of Virology] have a very large collection of viruses in their laboratory,\" Baric said in comments that were discovered for evidence in the hearing. \"And so it's -- you know -- proximity is a problem. It's a problem.\"\n\nThese revelations should give everyone pause and raise numerous red flags. They also run counter to many of the narratives people were told at the height of the pandemic. They raise many questions, including whether or not people can trust the so-called experts or \"the science\" when they speak to the people in the country. Or are they saying one thing in public and a completely different thing in private?\n\n\"So the hearing today is to try and find out whether or not we can get to the truth,\" Paul said. \"Do we know for certain it came from the lab? No, but there's a preponderance of evidence indicating that it may have come from the lab. Do we know viruses have come from animals in the past? Yes, they've come from animals in the past.\"\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM THE WASHINGTON EXAMINER\n\nPaul also listed some reasons why he believes COVID came from a lab and not an animal.\n\n\"There's no animal reservoir,\" Paul said. \"There's no animal handlers with antibiotics. There's a lot of reasons why there are indications that this could have come from the lab.\"\n\n\"This is the discussion we'll have today. This is a discussion that's long in coming,\" Paul said. \"It's been over three years that we've been asking for this. But this is great. This is good. We'll have scientists on both sides of this issue, and I hope we have a spirited debate.\"", "source": {"uri": "washingtonexaminer.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Washington Examiner"}, "authors": [{"uri": "christopher_tremoglie@washingtonexaminer.com", "name": "Christopher Tremoglie", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_lab_leak_theory", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "COVID-19 lab leak theory"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Coronavirus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Virus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wuhan", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Wuhan"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Wuhan"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wuhan_Institute_of_Virology", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wuhan Institute of Virology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_S._Fauci", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Anthony S.

Rand Paul (R-Ky.) during a 2021 hearing about SARS-CoV-2 possibly escaping through a lab accident.\n\n\"The smear campaign soon boiled over into conspiracy theories,\" the former National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) chief and ex-White House chief medical adviser claims. \"One of the most appalling examples of this was the allegation, without a shred of evidence, that an NIAID grant to the EcoHealth Alliance (EHA) with a subgrant to the Wuhan Institute of Virology (WIV) in China funded research that caused the COVID pandemic.\"\n\n\"At a May 11 [2021] Senate HELP Committee hearing, Senator Rand Paul fed the conspiracy theory, which he amped up further at the subsequent HELP hearing on July 20,\" he goes on. \"I was shocked and incensed by this totally inappropriate accusation.\"\n\nFauci also claims Paul \"was essentially holding me personally responsible for the creation of the virus that caused the COVID pandemic, saying, 'You're trying to obscure responsibility for four million people dying around the world from a pandemic.'\"\n\n\"We don't know that [SARS-CoV-2] didn't come from the lab, but all the evidence is pointing that it came from the lab, and there will be responsibility for those who funded the lab, including yourself,\" Paul said at the time.\n\nOmitted from the account is Fauci's unequivocal response to Paul: \"Senator Paul, with all due respect, you are entirely, entirely and completely incorrect ... the NIH [National Institutes of Health] has not ever and does not now fund gain-of-function research in the Wuhan Institute.\"\n\nThough Fauci has stuck by that claim in subsequent congressional hearings, NIH principal deputy director Dr. Lawrence Tabak told members of the House Select Subcommittee on the Coronavirus Pandemic last month that US taxpayers did fund gain-of-function research on bat SARS viruses at the WIV.\n\nManhattan-based EcoHealth has denied that its work met the controlling definition for that research -- or that the experiments could have led to the pandemic.\n\nA spokesperson told The Post Thursday that Tabak's \"testimony was clearly in error.\"\n\nEarlier this week, two scientific experts testified before another Senate committee that evidence points to the experiments at the Wuhan lab as the most likely cause of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nMembers of the Royal Society and US National Academy of Sciences had even \"singled out\" the WIV's work in 2015 as the \"most likely of all research in the world to trigger a pandemic,\" noted one of the experts, Rutgers University molecular biologist Dr. Richard Ebright.\n\nFauci has denied that he had ever smeared lab-leak proponents as conspiratorial in congressional testimony this year -- despite prompting a scientific paper in early 2020 aimed at debunking them -- and insists he has an \"open mind\" about COVID origins.\n\n\"I've not used that language,\" he said when asked during a January transcribed interview whether he agreed with NIH Director Dr. Francis Collins that the lab leak theory was a \"destructive conspiracy.\"\n\n\"It's a possibility,\" he added. \"I think that in and of itself isn't inherently a conspiracy theory, but some people spin off things from that that are kind of crazy.\"\n\n\"Fauci continues to resort to ad hominem attacks instead of arguments of substance,\" Paul told The Post Thursday.\n\n\"The preponderance of evidence points to a lab leak: no identified animal reservoir, lack of genetic diversity in viral RNA sequence, and a furin cleavage site in COVID-19 never before found in this family of viruses,\" he said. \"Even Fauci in private admitted the lab leak was plausible and not a conspiracy theory.\"\n\nNIH, which oversees NIAID, awarded more than $500,000 to EcoHealth between 2014 and 2020 that was funneled toward risky viral research at the Wuhan Institute of Virology.\n\nTabak revealed in an October 2021 letter to Congress that the \"limited experiment\" tested whether \"spike proteins from naturally occurring bat coronaviruses circulating in China were capable of binding to the human ACE2 receptor in a mouse model.\"\n\nThe research resulted in a modified virus that was 10,000 times more infectious in lungs, 1 million times more infectious in brains and three times more lethal in humanized lab mice, Ebright testified earlier this week, based on NIH disclosures of the experiment.\n\nCollins has said the resulting virus was \"genetically far distant from SARS-CoV-2,\" but another EcoHealth proposal, which was never funded, is seen as a potential way in which the virus could have been created.\n\nIn drafts of that proposal, EcoHealth Alliance President Dr. Peter Daszak also encouraged collaborators to downplay Wuhan researchers' involvement.\n\nThe WIV has since been barred for the next 10 years from receiving US funding, and EcoHealth has been suspended and proposed for debarment based on failing to report on or explain why the research, which \"likely violated protocols of the NIH regarding biosafety,\" was not gain-of-function.\n\nDaszak testified to the House COVID subcommittee last month that he had not received any samples from the Wuhan lab since before the pandemic.\n\nAt Senate hearing earlier this week, Dr. Robert Garry, who argued SARS-CoV-2 spread from animals to humans naturally, also acknowledged that the Chinese have not provided any results of their research in that time period, despite requests from the US.\n\nThe Post has reached out to Fauci's publisher, Viking, for

Mitt Romney (R-Utah) asked why there's \"so much energy\" around the question of whether the pandemic began in a lab or spilled over from a natural source.\n\n\"We'll never be 100 percent sure about one or the other,\" said Romney. \"Given that it could have been either, we know what action we need to take to protect from either....One, we should clean up the wet markets. And two, tighten the labs.\"\n\nIn recent months, the idea that COVID might have originated from a lab, and specifically the Wuhan Institute of Virology, has been upgraded in the discourse from a \"conspiracy theory\" to a plausible explanation for how the pandemic began.\n\nSimultaneously, people who are often skeptical or agnostic about a lab leak have argued that definitively answering the question of COVID's origins is of secondary importance. Rather, we should be focused on preventing the next pandemic.\n\nIn this vein, last month, the Biden administration released new guidance for how research-funding agencies like the National Institutes of Health (NIH) should vet proposed experiments involving pathogens of enhanced pandemic potential -- the subset of so-called \"gain of function\" research that could potentially cause a disease outbreak via a lab leak.\n\nThis new guidance \"will enable the oversight system for research involving biological agents and toxins to better address these risks,\" reads the text of the White House's new policy.\n\nCritics of the new policy argue that it suffers from the same flaws that undermined past government guidance on the funding of potentially pandemic-causing gain-of-function research.\n\n\"The administration says that this is done. 'We've issued some guidance, we've changed some of the recommendations from NIH, and we've fixed the problem',\" Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) tells Reason. \"The problem is that's sort of the fox fixing the problems for regulating the hen house.\"\n\nThe federal government has gone through multiple policies intended to subject gain-of-function research on potential pandemic pathogens to some risk-benefit analysis and to prevent funding of the most dangerous experiments.\n\nThat includes the Obama administration's pause on gain-of-function research funding in 2014 and the later Framework for Guiding Funding Decisions about Proposed Research Involving Enhanced Potential Pandemic Pathogens (P3CO) in 2017.\n\nBoth the Obama administration pause and the P3CO framework have widely been considered to be ineffective. Both policies ultimately left the NIH in charge of deciding which of the experiments it funds should get additional, outside review.\n\nUnder the now-superseded P3CO framework, the NIH sent only three research proposals up the chain to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) for risk-benefit analysis. The NIH greenlit everything else that plausibly should have been sent up the chain for review.\n\nMost controversially, that includes NIH-funded research conducted by the New York-based nonprofit EcoHealth Alliance at the Wuhan Institute of Virology in Wuhan, China, which involved creating hybrid SARS-like viruses capable of infecting human lung cells.\n\nProponents of the lab leak origins of COVID point to this research as likely leading to the creation of the SARS-CoV-2 virus in the Wuhan lab. This research would pretty plainly seem to implicate both the 2014 pause and the later P3CO framework. But when the NIH became aware of EcoHealth's work creating new viruses, it continued to fund the work without ever sending its experiments up the chain for additional review.\n\nEven skeptics of the lab leak origins of COVID-19 argue that the NIH's continued funding of EcoHealth's Wuhan work revealed a weakness in federal oversight of pandemic research.\n\nThe Biden administration has since stripped EcoHealth of federal funding over its failure to report all of its experiments to its NIH funders and its failure to properly oversee the work of its subgrantees at the Wuhan lab.\n\nThe Biden administration's new policy on the funding of pandemic research is intended to correct for these flaws in the past system by expanding the list of pathogens and biological agents of potential concern and making it more explicit when the NIH should send research involving those pathogens up the chain to the HHS for additional, department-level review.\n\n\"There is a little bit more clarity that anything that's identified [as a potential pandemic pathogen] needs to be sent directly up to department-level review,\" Gregory Koblentz, a biosafety expert and George Mason University professor who testified at this week's Senate COVID origins hearing, told Reason back in May.\n\nNevertheless, he says, \"there's still a lot of latitude for researchers and for the funding agencies, to decide if something is an experiment of concern,\" he said. \"There's still going to be a lot of judgment calls. There's still going to be a lot of room for decisions that might not be unanimous.\"\n\nIn that way, the Biden administration's latest policy would seem to suffer from the same core flaws of the Obama administration pause and the P3CO framework: The NIH and the researchers it funds are still in the position to decide which experiments get additional review and which don't.\n\n\"The people that are overseeing the research need to be independent of the grant-making process,\" says Paul. \"If you're receiving and dispensing [research] grants, which runs into billions of dollars, you're conflicted. It's just too hard for you to make the decision.\"\n\nPaul is currently drafting legislation that would create an independent body tasked with vetting potentially dangerous pandemic research.\n\nThe scientists who are the most publicly skeptical of a lab leak origin of COVID-19 will often argue that overly zealous oversight of government research funding could unnecessarily hamper life science research.\n\n\"You're going to really cripple the biomedical research enterprise\" if you define gain-of-function research subject to additional regulation too broadly, said Robert Garry, a researcher and associate dean of medicine at Tulane University, at the hearing earlier this week.\n\nGarry was one of the authors of the influential, controversial \"proximal origin\" piece published in Nature in March 2020 that dismissed the idea that SARS-CoV-2 could have been man-made.\n\nRecently uncovered communications show the authors of the proximal origins paper, including Garry, were much more open to the idea of a lab leak in their private conversations than they were in drafting that paper.\n\nThe fact that those conducting and funding potentially dangerous pandemic research have for so long successfully resisted independent oversight of their work is why the investigation into the lab leak origins of COVID is so important, argues Richard Ebright, a molecular biologist and professor at Rutgers University who testified at the hearing this week.\n\n\"Only after there is an acknowledgment that there is a very real possibility, not a remote possibility, of a lab origin, will there be a political will to impose regulation on this scientific community that has successfully resisted and obstructed regulation for two decades,\" he said in response to Romney's question about why a lab leak matters.", "source": {"uri": "reason.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Reason"}, "authors": [{"uri": "christian_britschgi@reason.com", "name": "Christian Britschgi", "type": "author",

Here's what Utah Sen. Mitt Romney says", "body": "Lisa has been a Deseret News reporter for more than 30 years, covering Utah's Olympics and politics.\n\nSen. Mitt Romney called for an end to funding gain of function research during a contentious Senate hearing Tuesday on the origins of COVID-19, saying no one will every know with certainty whether the virus responsible for millions of deaths was created in a Chinese lab or emerged from a market selling live animals.\n\n\"We know what action we ought to take to protect from either. So why there's so much passion around it makes me think it's more political than scientific but maybe I'm wrong,\" the Utah Republican said during his questioning of the expert witnesses appearing before the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee.\n\nRomney said he wants China to take responsibility for COVID-19.\n\n\"Whether it was from a wet market or the Wuhan lab, China is to blame. Both those things were in China. So if we're looking for someone to blame, we know who it is. It's the Chinese, and they should take responsibility for it and should have opened themselves up to complete disclosure,\" he said.\n\nWhat's not as clear, Romney suggested, is what's fueling the continued debate over the origin of the virus.\n\n\"There's a lot of energy and passion around, was it from an animal or was it a lab leak. And I must admit, I don't understand why there's so much energy around that. It strikes me that we'll never be 100% sure, I presume, about one or the other.\" he said, adding, \"we'll always be a little uncertain.\"\n\nThe action Romney wants Congress to take is putting an end to funding for what's known as gain of function research, sometimes described as supercharging viruses and other pathogens, making them more dangerous. He said there appears to be \"no particular reason for it other than military warfare. We shouldn't do that anyway.\"\n\nLabs that receive funding for research should also have to follow international standards, Romney said, as well as a \"clean up\" of wet markets where live, wild animals such as raccoon dogs and badgers are sold and slaughtered for food or medicine.\n\nThe response to Romney's assessment underscored the split evident at the hearing, which included sharp rebukes directed at one of the witnesses. Robert Garry, an author of a controversial paper that concluded early in the pandemic that the virus did not come from a lab.\n\nGarry, a Tulane University School of Medicine professor and associate dean, told Romney that depending on how gain of function research is defined, \"you're going to really cripple the biomedical research enterprise\" on viruses, cancers and other health issues.\n\n\"So let's get that right. I don't think, just blanket we should stop funding all gain of function research because some of that is important, like for developing animal models of new diseases as they come forth.\" Garry said, limiting the response to any new threats.\n\nBut Richard Ebright, a Rutgers University professor and laboratory director who'd said earlier in the hearing there was \"zero evidence\" that COVID-19 occurred naturally, said the definition of the term is not at issue. Ebright said the intensity Romney referred to is coming from those involved in gain of function research who don't want federal oversight.\n\n\"Only after there is an acknowledgement that there is a very real possibility -- not a remote possibility, but a very real possibility -- of a lab origin will there be the political will to impose regulation on this scientific community that has successfully resisted and obstructed regulation for two decades,\" Ebright said.\n\nAnother scientist offered told Romney it comes down to money.\n\n\"I think the energy is around the fact that paychecks, salaries, careers, are based on continuing gain of function research by some of the most vocal people in this debate,\" said Dr. Steven Quay, a former faculty member of the Stanford University School of Medicine.\" I think if you follow the money, you'll see the answer.\"", "source": {"uri": "deseret.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Deseret News"}, "authors": [{"uri": "lisa_riley_roche@deseret.com", "name": "Lisa Riley Roche", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gain-of-function_research", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gain-of-function research"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Coronavirus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Virus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitt_Romney", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mitt Romney"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utah", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Utah"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Utah"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Investigations_into_the_origin_of_COVID-19", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Investigations into the origin of COVID-19"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate_Committee_on_Homeland_Security_and_Governmental_Affairs", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wet_market", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wet market"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deseret_News", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Deseret News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wuhan", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wuhan"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Wuhan"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_lab_leak_theory", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "COVID-19 lab leak theory"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nyctereutes", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nyctereutes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogen", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pathogen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Medicine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_H._Ebright", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Richard H.

Rand Paul (R-KY) as the ranking member, hosted four witnesses:\n\nWhat stands out about this hearing is not so much the discussion regarding the origins of COVID -- there have been several of those, and the House has a select subcommittee devoted to the pandemic -- but that it was a Democrat-led hearing in which not even the Democrat-invited witnesses ruled out the lab leak theory as implausible. We've come a long way, Baby.\n\nHomeland Security Committee ranking member Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) asked Ebright at one point whether his staunch support for the lab leak hypothesis was a \"right-wing conspiracy\" or he was a \"crazy Republican partisan.\"\n\n\"I'm a registered Democrat. I voted for [President] Biden. I have a Biden sign on my lawn and have a Biden bumper sticker,\" Ebright began before Paul cut in to say, \"All right that's enough of that,\" causing lawmakers and attendees in the hearing room to erupt with laughter.\n\nDr. Quay's testimony laid out the primary reasons he believes the origin of the virus was most likely a gain-of-function lab leak.\n\nStanding Up Against the White House Plot to Shut Down Discussion of Lab Leak Theory, COVID Shot Effects\n\n10 Facts About the Origin of SARS-CoV-2 Everyone Needs to Know\n\nMIT Virologist Tells UK Parliamentary Committee That SARS-CoV-2 Was Likely Engineered, Originated at the Wuhan Institute of Virology\n\nHis written testimony spells it all out in detail, but this section sums it up well:\n\nFirst, the virus was spreading in Wuhan in the early fall of 2019, two to four months before the first case in the Hunan Seafood Market. This is supported by fourteen observations or evidence. This should be sufficient to dismiss the Hunan Market as the source of the outbreak.\n\nSecond, I look at the data from the market, including human infections, animal samples, and environmental specimens. This involves looking at eight observations or evidence. None of these data are consistent with an infected animal passing SARS2 to a human at the market.\n\nThird, documented events at or related to the Wuhan Institute of Virology, or WIV, beginning in March 2019, are consistent with the expected activities of a virology lab in which a laboratory-acquired infection has occurred. I will go through that timeline.\n\nFourth, the evidence that is found in a natural zoonosis with respect to the animal host, the virus, and the human population in the vicinity of the outbreak is missing for the COVID pandemic. Each of these three components of a zoonosis will be examined separately and each will be found wanting.\n\nFifth, the genome of SARS-CoV-2 has seven features that would be expected to be found in a virus constructed in a laboratory and which are not found in viruses from nature. The statistical probability of finding each feature in nature can be determined and the combined probability that SARS2 came from nature is less than one in 1.2 billion.\n\nThese same features were described in a grant application submitted to DARPA in 2018 by scientists from the WIV, together with US collaborators.\n\nSixth and final, the earliest genomes of SARS2 were unstable and could not have come from an animal host without the stabilizing mutation, the so-called D614G change, that appeared in human viruses beginning January 1st, 2020. The consequence of this is that I can conclude that the first human infection occurred soon after the insertion of the furin cleavage site in the laboratory and before extensive animal testing. Otherwise, the first human cases would have had this stabilizing mutation.\n\nIt also means that the unstable version of SARS2 could not have been circulating in animals, otherwise it would have acquired the stabilizing mutation. If any virologist can find an animal host that can transmit the unstable ancestral SARS2 five or more times without obtaining the stabilizing mutation, they have found a hypothetical candidate for a spillover host. All testing to date of potential hosts has failed this test.\n\nAs Peters rightly notes, the probability that the Chinese government will never fully cooperate in the investigation of the pandemic's origin makes the likelihood of ever finding definitive answers on it slim. Nevertheless, hearings such as this, where the witnesses and inquisitors allow for the scientific method rather than a preferred political narrative to be the driver, are a step in the right direction. It's too bad it took over four years to get to that point. One wonders how many lives were sacrificed in pursuit of the narrative rather than the science.\n\nI'll add this: One of the most maddening aspects of this entire escapade was the fact that we were so hamstrung in our ability to report on it while we were in the middle of it. The government and their Big Tech buddies had such a stranglehold on messaging that outlets like RedState, who were doing our darnedest to report on the evidence -- factually -- were being censored at every turn. That's the primary reason we developed and keep promoting our VIP membership program. It helps lessen our need to be beholden to the whims of the censor scolds. That, in turn, enables us to pursue more of the investigative work and independent journalism that have made us a go-to site for so many of you. We appreciate your readership and your support. I'd simply ask that if you're not already a member, you give it some serious consideration. Using promo code SAVEAMERICA will get you a 50 percent discount off the cost -- and for the full VIP Gold membership, that's a savings of roughly $45 (and also means you're getting VIP access across all the Townhall sites for less than $4 a month.) I may be biased -- but I think we're worth it.", "source": {"uri": "redstate.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Redstate"}, "authors": [{"uri": "susie_moore@redstate.com", "name": "Susie Moore",

This establishes the market is not the origin,\" Quay said upon describing the virus's apparent spread before it was discovered at a wet market in Wuhan.\n\nQuay proceeded to describe the extensive evidence that the virus could not have jumped from a bat to another animal before infecting humans at the wet market, pointing out that the virus has not yet been found in any animal in the wild despite extensive efforts to do so.", "source": {"uri": "johnlocke.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "John Locke Foundation"}, "authors": [{"uri": "https@johnlocke.org", "name": "https", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Virus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wuhan", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Wuhan"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Wuhan"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Coronavirus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Investigations_into_the_origin_of_COVID-19", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Investigations into the origin of COVID-19"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate_Committee_on_Homeland_Security_and_Governmental_Affairs", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Review", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National Review"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wuhan_Institute_of_Virology", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Wuhan Institute of Virology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wet_market", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Wet market"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanford_University_School_of_Medicine", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Stanford University School of Medicine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctor_of_Philosophy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Doctor of Philosophy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genome", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Genome"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Michigan", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "University of Michigan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunan", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hunan"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Hunan"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Marketing_and_Advertising/Consulting", "label": "dmoz/Business/Marketing and Advertising/Consulting", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Security/Malicious_Software", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Security/Malicious Software", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Marketing_and_Advertising/Internet_Marketing", "label": "dmoz/Business/Marketing and Advertising/Internet Marketing", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Hacking/Malicious_Software", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Hacking/Malicious Software", "wgt": 25}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Marketing_and_Advertising/Associations", "label": "dmoz/Business/Marketing and Advertising/Associations", "wgt": 12}], "image": "https://www.johnlocke.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/covid-19-5073811_1920-768x513.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9663214", "eventUri": "eng-9663214", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2019-12-", "textStart": 1625, "textEnd": 1638}], "sentiment": 0.3176470588235294, "wgt": 144, "relevance": 1}

The D-Day, the Allied invasion of Normandy in June 1944 - 80 years ago- heralded the beginning of the end of World War II in Europe, with Adolf Hitler\u2019s dreams of conquest ending less than a year later as a direct result of the success of the landings and subsequent push westwards. This week, thousands of veterans from across the UK continue to pay their respects to those who lost their lives in line of duty. However, those in Inverness were \u2018saddened\u2019 by the conditions of Cavell Gardens and the council\u2019s \u2018lack of effort\u2019 for this significant occasion. Highland councillor Bet McAllister (Inverness Central) said: \u201cIt is an absolute disgrace and I am so embarrassed. The British Legion ended up going to Nairn because they wouldn\u2019t go to Cavell Gardens due to the state of it. \u201cThey were just disgusted with how the Highland Council had done it this year. \u201cI am absolutely devastated as it is so unfair for all the people who had relatives that were killed in the Second World War. I just cannot believe that they would let it get into that state. \u201cIt really is the most disgusting state the Cavell Gardens has ever been in since it was built. \u201cThis is the first time that I have ever seen it like that as it has always been kept in an absolutely wonderful condition. It breaks my heart to see it.\u201d Those that did attend the memorial garden out of respect were \u2018very disappointed\u2019 that the gardens weren\u2019t maintained for the occasion. British Legion committee member from Inverness and veteran John Baillie said: \u201cThe memorial plaque really should have been cleaned as it is the 80-year anniversary, the flowers weren\u2019t blue and yellow for the Legion colours, and weeds were growing at the statue where the stones are, which is quite disgusting. \u201cI even picked weeds up before putting the wreath down. \u201cI don\u2019t think they have given the 80th anniversary its due respect. It is sad that the town didn\u2019t put on a better show and made the place tidy. There are only very few veterans left and it\u2019s a shame that we couldn\u2019t rise to the occasion. \u201cI hold the council responsible for it and I want them to attend to it immediately.\u201d Highland Council\u2019s Inverness city area manager David Haas said: \u201cThe council have the highest respect and regard for the military family. First of all, the comments are understood and recognised, but they must be seen in the context of the strength of support that we already give to the military family and the work that they do. \u201cThere was an event at the Town House on Thursday to recognise the 80th anniversary of D-Day where military and public service representatives were present. \u201cWith regard to Cavell Gardens, it has received significant investment over the years and in all occasions the monument itself and its surroundings have received attention over a long period of time to make them look how they do today. \u201cIt is understood that we didn\u2019t get to the flower bed as quickly as we would have liked, and it is understood that they didn\u2019t look their best, but there are issues around that. The availability of plants, the weather and our capacity to actually put them out prior to the event was quite challenging because of the logistics around the availability of plants through our own provisions that we have got. \u201cQuite frankly it is down to logistics, supply and the weather.\u201d However, Mr Haas made it clear that the progress of Cavell Gardens flower beds is on track and will be attending to them \u2018as quickly as possible to ensure they\u2019re properly populated\u2019.

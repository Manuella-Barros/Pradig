I\u2019ve never been sad about the death of famous person who I\u2019d never met before until now. \u2018A few months ago my son aged 14 introduced me to Dr Mosley\u2019s Just One Thing podcasts and I\u2019ve been listening to them while I was I sew. His manner and warmth shone through and I feel like I knew him well. Like a lovely cousin or something. \u2018His subject matter was the spark for many conversations in our house for the last few months and my son and I would compare which ipodcats we\u2019d listened to and suggest other one. Do Mosley will be sadly missed in our house. Our thoughts go out to his wife and children. \u2764\ufe0f\u2019 AJ added: \u2018This is so tragic. Bless you and your family and thank you for everything that you have done for the nation\u2019s health and beyond.

Michael was an adventurous man, it\u2019s part of what made him so special,\u2019 she said. Dr Bailey said that the family are \u2018so grateful to the extraordinary people on Symi\u2019 who worked \u2018tirelessly\u2019 to help find him from dawn until dusk. \u2018I feel so lucky to have our children and my amazing friends.

They said they really believe in me and what I can do at Rutgers. A big bonus for me was they're taking 30 of my college credits, so I can start as a sophomore when I get there and I can get my master's in four years. And they've got a great brotherhood there.\"\n\nRutgers landed three North Carolina recruits in its 2024 class in wide receiver Benjamin Black and defensive backs Isaiah Crumpler and Noah Shaw.\n\nDeloatch, a three-star recruit and the No. 13 overall recruit in North Carolina according to the 247Sports Composite, picked Rutgers from a list that included Indiana, Syracuse, South Florida, Duke and Liberty.\n\nWatching the program's rise under Schiano, which included a 7-6 season in 2023 and a trip to the Pinstripe Bowl, also stood out.\n\n\"He always makes sure to take care of his players and makes sure everybody has everything they need to be successful,\" Deloatch said. \"That's a real big bonus for me.\"\n\nWhat Isaiah Deloatch brings to Rutgers: 'I'm a team player'\n\nRutgers has infused ample speed into the program in recent recruiting classes, and Deloatch is no different.\n\nHe ran a 10.64 100-meter dash.\n\nDeloatch has also embraced the way Rutgers defensive coordinator and linebackers coach Joe Harasymiak plans to teach him the playbook.\n\nMORE Breaking down Rutgers football's QB room with Athan Kaliakmanis installed as new starter\n\n\"He's a cool dude,\" Deloatch said. \"He keeps it real. Real broad, he doesn't water anything down I would say. He told me when I get there, I won't have to worry about getting the playbook right away. He said he would give me the calls and the assignments and then worry about the playbook later, because you have to know what you're doing in the play before you learn the playbook.\"\n\nDeloatch fulfills multiple roles for his high school team. In addition to playing linebacker, he's also the back-up running back, placeholder and punter.\n\n\"I'm pretty sure next year I'm going to be the kicker,\" Deloatch said. \"So I'm a team player.\"\n\nLast season was Deloatch's first playing inside linebacker. He previously was a strong safety.\n\nRefining his skills at linebacker is a top priority between now and the time he gets to Rutgers.\n\n\"I want to achieve more on the mental side,\" Deloatch said. \"Athletically, I feel I'm good enough to play at Rutgers. But last year was my first year playing inside linebacker, so Coach Harasymiak said he's going to send me some stuff so I can get more of a feel of linebacker. Instinctively I can play it, but there's still a lot more I need to learn about the position.\"", "source": {"uri": "app.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Asbury Park Press"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rutgers_Scarlet_Knights", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rutgers Scarlet Knights"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greg_Schiano", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Greg Schiano"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rutgers_Scarlet_Knights_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rutgers Scarlet Knights football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linebacker", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Linebacker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Carolina", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "North Carolina"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "North Carolina"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Track_and_field", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Track and field"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "American football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Durham,_North_Carolina", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Durham, North Carolina"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Durham, North Carolina"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/247Sports", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "247Sports"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Florida_Bulls_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "South Florida Bulls football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duke_Blue_Devils_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Duke Blue Devils football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberty_University", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Liberty University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinstripe_Bowl", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pinstripe Bowl"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sophomore", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sophomore"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defensive_back", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Defensive back"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wide_receiver", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Wide receiver"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syracuse,_New_York", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Syracuse, New York"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Syracuse, New York"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Indiana"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Indiana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safety_(gridiron_football_position)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Safety (gridiron football position)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_school_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "High school football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Placekicker", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Placekicker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defensive_coordinator", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Defensive coordinator"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Quarterback"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Football", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Football", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Football/American", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Football/American", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Football/Canadian", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Football/Canadian", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Fun", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Fun", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/College_and_University/Recruiting", "label": "dmoz/Sports/College and University/Recruiting", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/authoring/authoring-images/2024/04/27/PNJM/73486280007-042724-picataway-1437.JPG?auto=webp&crop=3977,2237,x0,y0&format=pjpg&width=1200", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9540106", "eventUri": "eng-9540106", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2313725490196079, "wgt": 189, "relevance": 1}

They were at the top of the list of 10 demands after the camp was set up.\n\nRutgers, along with Princeton University, were among campuses around the country where student protests materialized in opposition to Israel's war in Gaza, sparking debates about free speech and whether the demonstrations endangered Jewish students.\n\nUnlike at UCLA and Columbia, demonstrations in New Jersey remained peaceful, although protesters were arrested in Princeton and Rutgers threatened police action on Thursday after demonstrators threatened to interrupt final exams.\n\nRutgers said it postponed 28 exams that impacted 1,000 students out of concern the encampment could escalate.\n\nThe 4 p.m. deadline to clear tents from the campus green was met after SJP and Rutgers had what Chancellor Francine Conway called \"constructive dialogue\" that \"opens the door for ongoing dialogue and better addresses the needs of our Arab, Muslim, and Palestinian student body.\"\n\nThe school could not agree to the two biggest demands -- divesting from Israel and ending ties to Tel Aviv University -- because \"such decisions fall outside of our administrative scope,\" according to a letter from Conway.\n\nElected officials said the school should not be negotiating with lawbreakers.\n\n\"Any capitulation whatsoever to antisemitic, anti-Israel, pro-Hamas protesters is absolutely disgraceful,\" U.S. Rep. Chris Smith, R-N.J. 4th District, who visited the encampment Thursday, said.\n\n\"Instead of rewarding unbridled hatred for Jews and the nation of Israel, Rutgers should be working to combat the violent and antisemitic threats that have been escalating against Jewish students on campus.\"\n\nState Sen. Owen Henry, R-Middlesex, said Rutgers' \"caving to the demands of the anti-semitic demonstrators\" was unacceptable.\n\n\"I strongly condemn Rutgers for their failure to effectively address the academic disruptions that have occurred on their campus. It is imperative that Rutgers ensure the safety and well-being of all their students by holding students and staff who perpetuated messages of hatred on their campus accountable,\" Owen said in a written statement.\n\nDemocratic Assemblyman Avi Schnall, whose district includes the largely Orthodox Jewish municipality of Lakewood, condemned the agreement as favoring \"a mob of students\" who illegally commandeered the campus.\n\n\"By capitulating to the demands of these protesters, Rutgers University sets a dangerous precedent, signaling that our esteemed educational institutions can be overrun and held hostage by radical activists,\" Schnall told The Lakewood Scoop, adding that Rutgers should take \"immediate and decisive steps to restore its campus to a place of inclusivity and safety.\n\nRepublican gubernatorial candidate Jack Ciatarelli and his primary rival, state Sen. Jon Bramnick, R-Union, took strong stands against the agreement.\n\n\"Rather than being negotiated with, students violating school policy should have been removed from campus and then expelled, and those breaking the law should have been arrested,\" Ciatarelli told New Jersey 101.5.\n\n\"When I'm governor, I can promise you that the Rutgers Administration won't be acquiescing to any unreasonable demand made by those who violate University policy.\"\n\nGov. Phil Murphy, who did not comment about the agreement, earlier in the week called the situation \"complicated.\"\n\nSpeaking at an event on Tuesday, Murphy said that he is OK with \"peaceful protests,\" according to reporting by Insider NJ. But when campus life is upset that is a different matter.\n\nMurphy was a strong supporter of Israel following the terrorist attacks by Hamas on Oct. 7. He has tempered his comments since to support a cease-fire in Gaza following retaliation by Israel.\n\nA sit-in at Princeton University's Cannon Green continued for a 10th day on Saturday with the addition of a hunger strike.

However, I will say that you cannot just let a bunch of students run the whole show,\" Wallace said. \"If the general population of students here at Rutgers either don't care, don't have an opinion or are pro-American, why are we capitulating to people who don't really care about this country?\"\n\nVice President of Rutgers College Republicans, Michael Joseph, told Fox News Digital in a phone interview that the debate over the Israel-Hamas war has divided students on campus.\n\nJoseph, who visited the rally to cover the demonstrations, said that he found the protest to be \"peaceful.\" He also responded to reports that Rutgers agreed with a majority of demands from anti-Israel protesters.\n\n\"They didn't get the divestment demands met,\" Joseph said, explaining that student protesters were granted other demands, including scholarships for Gazans to become students at Rutgers.\n\nThe anti-Israel protesters agreed to end their demonstration by 4 p.m. on Thursday after coming to an agreement with university administrators, according to a statement from Rutgers. A variation of eight of the protesters' ten demands were met by Rutgers administrators, according to the statement. The university did not immediately agree to divest from firms tied to Israel and said it would not be terminating its partnership with Tel Aviv University.\n\n\"That's the reason why it probably ended peacefully,\" he said.\n\nBut in total, Joseph said that he did not believe that the students won a significant victory against the administration. \"I'm not too bothered one way or another with their demands because they say it was a great victory with 8 out of 10 demands [met].\"\n\n\"It wasn't,\" he said.\n\n\"The whole point of the tent state was to be in solidarity with the other protesters across the country,\" Joseph explained. \"On the Rutgers level, it was to force the administration to accept the divestment from what they consider 'Zionist' companies and also divestment from Tel Aviv University. They didn't get that. Every other demand was mostly just fluff.\"\n\nRUTGERS UNIVERSITY PROFESSOR SAYS WITHOUT DEI OFFICES, THERE IS 'NO ABILITY TO MAKE MEANINGFUL PROGRESS'\n\n\"I don't consider this a victory for them,\" he said.\n\nWriter Steve McGuire reported that the Rutgers administration conceded to \"8/10 of the protestors demands after they forced the university to postpone 28 final exams\" on Thursday.\n\nBillionaire investor Bill Ackman responded to the news on X.\n\n\"This is crazy,\" Ackman wrote. \"If you reward protesters who violate the rules or worse, you will get more protests and more extreme rule violations.

Rutgers promised to have the president and the chief investment officer meet with student representatives to discuss this matter.\n\nIn a follow up on May 2, Rutgers said it was pleased that the protest, unlike those that played out at other prestigious U.S. institutions, didn't end with arrests. It also extended special thanks to faculty members who acted as mediators and helped deescalate the situation on campus.\n\n\"Any capitulation whatsoever to antisemitic, anti-Israel, pro-Hamas protesters is absolutely disgraceful,\" said Rep. Chris Smith (R-N.J.), who visited the encampment on May 2.\n\n\"Instead of rewarding unbridled hatred for Jews and the nation of Israel, Rutgers should be working to combat the violent and antisemitic threats that have been escalating against Jewish students on campus,\" he said in a statement.\n\nState Sen. Owen Henry, a Republican representing Middlesex County where Rutgers' flagship campus is located, denounced the school leadership for \"caving to the demands of the anti-semitic demonstrators.\"\n\n\"I strongly condemn Rutgers for their failure to effectively address the academic disruptions that have occurred on their campus,\" he wrote in a statement. \"It is imperative

Rutgers offered the students concessions on eight of their 10 demands so long as the students cleared their encampment by 4 p.m. Otherwise, the school warned members of the encampment would be considered to have trespassed and be removed \"with the assistance of law enforcement.\"\n\nSo, Rutgers - New Brunswick students peacefully ended their pro-Palestinian encampment. Their negotiated resolution stands in stark contrast to other universities across the country where rather than brokering a deal, universities used police force to clear pro-Palestinian encampments, often resulting in violence and mass arrests. At Rutgers, students and administrators both said de-escalation was a central part of their negotiation strategy.\n\nStudent negotiators with the Endowment Justice Collective brought the offer to the encampment around 3:30 p.m. and members of the encampment agreed to take the deal. Divestment from certain Israeli companies and dissolving Rutgers' partnership with Tel Aviv University were not included in the deal.\n\nAfter agreeing to accept the offer, students cheered and began packing up the encampment -- breaking down tents and creating large piles of sleeping bags and signs. By 6:30 p.m. Voorhees Mall was clear. Rutgers police remained on-site throughout the day but did not physically engage with protestors.\n\n\"I feel like we are being heard and recognized. After the past two semesters we've had, this is the first time where there is a conversation, an active conversation, with administration, with being heard, with them listening to the Palestinian students who have been suffering and who have been harmed within the last seven to eight months,\" said one student organizer before the agreement was reached.\n\nStudent organizers with the Endowment Justice Collective and Students for Justice in Palestine involved in the encampment declined to share their names.\n\nIn a message announcing the agreement, Rutgers - New Brunswick Chancellor Francine Conway said Rutgers is committed to prioritizing safe and peaceful resolution through open dialogue. \"Together, we can serve as a model for our community, nation, and the world,\" Conway said.\n\nStudents, who established their encampment on April 29 at Voorhees Mall on the College Avenue campus, said their goal was having their demands met and they did not want to see an escalation like what has happened at nearby schools.\n\nMore than 2,500 people had been arrested in similar campus protests across the country as of Friday afternoon, according to The Appeal, a news site that focuses on criminal justice. This includes 15 arrests for trespassing at New Jersey's Princeton University. In New York City, close to 300 protestors were arrested at Columbia University and the City College of New York.\n\nThe \"Gaza solidarity encampment\" was ongoing at Princeton as of Friday afternoon. About a dozen students there had begun a hunger strike they said will continue until the administration agrees to meet with students to discuss divestment and criminal and disciplinary amnesty is granted to the 15 people who were arrested. Students at the Rutgers - Newark campus also started an encampment on Wednesday which continued as of Friday afternoon. Protesters at Rutgers - Newark are calling for divestment from certain Israeli companies and have issued demands on several local issues, such as free tuition and student debt relief for Newark residents.\n\nThe university agreed to create an Arab cultural center and hire administrators and faculty with cultural competency and knowledge of Palestinian communities.\n\nConway's message said she is pleased the students in New Brunswick decided to peacefully end their protest.\n\n\"This resolution was achieved through constructive dialogue between the protesting students and our leadership teams. Despite the myriad ways to address the national movement, our focus has remained on ensuring our students' safety and our university's smooth operation,\" Conway said.\n\nThe demands agreed to by the university include the creation of an Arab cultural center and hiring administrators and faculty with cultural competency and knowledge of Palestinian communities.\n\nRutgers will also name Palestine, Palestinians and Gaza in future communications, and take stock of flags displayed on campus to ensure appropriate representation, according to the agreement. Finally, members of the encampment will not face retaliation from the university based on their involvement. Any reports of bias, harassment or discrimination against members of the school community will still be investigated.\n\nRutgers administrators did not agree to the New Brunswick students' first two demands, including ending the university's partnership with Tel Aviv University. Conway said in a statement such decisions are \"outside of our administrative scope.\"\n\nNor did the university agree to \"divest from any firm or corporation materially participating in, benefitting from, or otherwise supporting the state of Israel's settler colonialism, apartheid, and genocide of Palestine and the Palestinian people,\" which was the students' first demand. Rutgers President Jonathan Holloway and the chairman of the university's Joint Committee on Investments agreed to meet with a maximum of five student representatives to discuss the divestment request, which is under review.\n\nStudent organizers with the Endowment Justice Collective said they have been pushing for this meeting for over five years.\n\n'If we don't get what we want, I'll see you back here next time,\" one organizer with a megaphone warned as the encampment cleared on Thursday.\n\n\"I'm not saying this is enough or that this is where we stop on divestment. What I am saying is that this is huge, and we are also getting a lot of other things that will be helping Palestinians in Gaza and Palestinians here,\" a student organizer announced to the camp just before 4 p.m. on Thursday.\n\nThe organizer added that the Endowment Justice Collective will have regular meetings with Conway where students will hold administrators responsible for holding up their end of the deal.\n\nIn April, more than 80% of Rutgers - New Brunswick students voted for the university to divest from companies that profit from or engage with human rights violations committed by the Israeli government in the student assembly spring election. Investment decisions are made by the Joint Committee on Investments and are not determined by student referendums.\n\nSeventy-eight percent of students voted for the university to end its relationship with Tel Aviv University. About 8,000 of the school's nearly 37,000 undergraduate students participated in the election.\n\nRutgers has a significant Palestinian population, as does the state of New Jersey. The university said in a statement that there are more than 7,000 Arab, Muslim and Palestinian students on campus.\n\nStudents and administrators have expressed a desire to continue working toward a solution together following the dismantling of the encampment. One of the chants used by protestors was a call and response: \"Whose university? Our university.\"\n\n\"We're not against the university. We are against the university participating in human rights violations. If we can make a change to make Rutgers better, we should,\" one student organizer said on Thursday.\n\nThe agreement states that it is contingent on the absence of further disruptions and adherence to university policies.\n\nAs the encampment cleared on Thursday afternoon, one organizer with a megaphone said: \"If we don't get what we want, I'll see you back here next time.\"", "source": {"uri":

The school says Rutgers will work with a committee to implement that support.\n\nRutgers also says it will develop a plan to start an Arab Cultural Center on campus by the start of the fall 2024 semester.\n\nThe Office of the Chancellor says it will also convene a group to look into the creation of a department of Middle East studies and hire faculty.\n\nPro-Palestinian protesters spent about four days camped out on the school's Voorhees Mall. They were demanding the university end its relationship with Tel Aviv University and divest from companies that do business with Israel.\n\nAn on-campus rally Thursday morning forced the school to postpone final exams and prompted the administration to issue a 4 p.m. deadline for demonstrators to clear their tents, which the protesters agreed to follow.\n\nIn a statement posted Thursday, University President Jonathan Holloway said in part, \"We still have a great deal of work ahead and will continue to be tested.

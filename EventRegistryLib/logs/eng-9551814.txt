The operation, which is still ongoing, has so far seized 13 drug boats, 12.3 tons of hashish, and 634 kilograms of cocaine.\n\nOn April 16, Spanish and Portuguese authorities carried out a joint operation against a network of hashish and cocaine transporters based in the coastal area of Cadiz, Andalusia. Authorities arrested 31 people accused of working with a transnational drug trafficking network to move a shipment of 628 kilos of cocaine that police seized in the neighboring province of Huelva in early April.\n\nPolice Corruption Jeopardizes Drug Trafficking Trial in Spain\n\nThe Province of C\u00e1diz has seen a sharp increase in cocaine seizures in the last few years. Between 2021 and 2022, seizures grew by 78.4%, from 9 tons of cocaine to approximately 16 tons.\n\nApril's investigation began in May 2023, when authorities detected that this criminal organization unsuccessfully attempted to pick up a 6 ton cocaine shipment from a semi-submersible vessel coming from South America.\n\n\"The network had an average of between eight and 10 high-speed crafts in the water at all times ... to carry out the transports of goods for other national or international organizations,\" the Spanish National Police explained in a press release.\n\nDrug-related violence has also recently increased in the area. At the beginning of 2024, a narco-boat hit and killed two police officers in Barbate, C\u00e1diz during a police chase.\n\n\"In four years, five Civil Guard officers have died as a result of being run over, rammed, or assassinated,\" Miguel \u00c1ngel Ramos Le\u00f3n, representative of the Unified Association of Civil Guards (Asociaci\u00f3n Unificada de Guardias Civiles - AUGC) of Cadiz, told InSight Crime.\n\nSouthern Spain has been used as a port of entry by cocaine trafficking networks before, but a number of factors have converged to see a sharp expansion of the route in recent years.\n\nFirstly, record levels of coca leaf cultivation and cocaine production in South America has led to an increase in cocaine seizures in Spain overall. Last year, authorities seized nearly 142 tons of cocaine, an increase of 142% compared to 2022. Included in last year's seizure figures was a record 9.5-ton cocaine seizure, which arrived at the port from Ecuador.\n\nThe Port of Algeciras in Cadiz is currently one of the busiest ports on the continent, making it attractive to organized crime groups shipping cocaine in contaminated containers. Generally speaking, the more containers move through a port, the harder it is for port authorities to detect drugs concealed in them.\n\nMexican Traffickers Find New Criminal Opportunities in Spain\n\n\"A large part of the cocaine [shipped] to Spain and Europe is entering or residing in that port [Algeciras],\" \u00c1ngel Bodoque Agredano, a special anti-drug prosecutor for the Spain's National Court, told InSight Crime.\n\nIn addition to direct shipments from Latin American countries, more and more contaminated containers arriving in southern Spain are calling at or heading to ports in West Africa and North Africa on their way to Europe to avoid controls, Ramos Le\u00f3n explained. Earlier this year, Moroccan authorities seized 1.4 tons of cocaine hidden in a shipment of bananas in the port of Tangier, Morocco, which were allegedly destined for Turkey.\n\nLarge quantities of cocaine are shipped to West Africa and trafficked to North Africa by land, as indicated by a growing number of seizures in countries along the Sahel belt, a region that lies south of the Sahara Desert.\n\nBetween 2015 and 2020, the average annual amount of cocaine seized in the region was 13 kilos. In 2022, it was 1.5 tons and 2 tons in 2023, according to a report by the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime. Once drugs are in North Africa, traffickers use boats to transport them to countries like Spain.\n\nThe use of narco-boats in southern Spain has traditionally been associated with the trafficking of hashish and small quantities of cocaine. Now, seizures of large amounts of cocaine in the south of the country from these vessels are becoming increasingly frequent, authorities told InSight Crime.\n\nInvestigations into these shipments have allowed Spanish authorities to detect new alliances between Spanish clans that traditionally trafficked hashish from Morocco and national and transnational criminal organizations dedicated to cocaine trafficking.\n\nAccording to Ramos Le\u00f3n, several Latin American drug trafficking networks have sent emissaries to the area to contact these transportista networks. \"They come, they check the networks, the logistics, they meet and see if it is viable to transport cocaine in narco-boats,\" he explained.", "source": {"uri": "insightcrime.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "InSight Crime"},

To carry out this activity, they recruited young men with maritime experience and no criminal record.\n\nThe cocaine would be smuggled into different entry points on the Galician coast, before being smuggled inland and to other EU Member States using vehicles equipped with sophisticated hidden compartments.\n\nIn order to maximise their profits, the Galicia-based criminal organisation also allegedly ran a cocaine laboratory, installed in an isolated area in the suburbs of Madrid.

This case confirms a new trend in cocaine trafficking: the unprocessed drug is exported to be chemically processed in clandestine laboratories in the destination countries, which makes it possible to reduce their losses in the event of customs or police seizures.", "source": {"uri": "bobrtimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "bobrtimes.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europol", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Europol"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug_Enforcement_Administration", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Drug Enforcement Administration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Villa", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Villa"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cocaine", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Cocaine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_Guard_(Spain)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Civil Guard (Spain)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coup_d'\u00e9tat", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Coup d'\u00e9tat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madrid", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Madrid"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Madrid"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Spain"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drum", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Drum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hashish", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hashish"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Province", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Province"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MDMA", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "MDMA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coca", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Coca"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cannabis_(drug)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cannabis (drug)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_substance", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chemical substance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_America", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "South America"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heroin", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Heroin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Euro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pontevedra", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pontevedra"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Pontevedra"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Coru\u00f1a", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "A Coru\u00f1a"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "A Coru\u00f1a"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colombia", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Colombia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Colombia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seizure", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Seizure"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catamaran", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Catamaran"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amphetamine", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Amphetamine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Customs", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Customs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ton", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galicia_(Spain)", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Galicia (Spain)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Galicia (Spain)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Weight_Loss", "label": "dmoz/Health/Weight Loss", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Strength_Sports", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Strength Sports", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Strength_Sports/Olympic_Lifting", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Strength Sports/Olympic Lifting", "wgt": 100}], "image": null, "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9551814", "eventUri": "eng-9551814", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-06", "textStart": 258, "textEnd": 263}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-04-30", "textStart": 401, "textEnd": 409}], "sentiment": 0.2, "wgt": 176, "relevance": 1}

Official sources say that smugglers from the Balkans were ideally placed to meet European demand.\n\nThey control the complex logistics needed to transport cocaine from laboratories in the Andes to street vendors in Paris, London or Berlin.\n\nRead also: The accused of accepting 150 kilos of cocaine: - He thought it was hashish\n\nThe United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime recorded seizures of 315 tons of cocaine in Europe in 2021. In the same year, seizures in the United States of America amounted to 250 tons. In the past decade, cocaine purity has increased in Europe. UNOC considers it a sign of abundance, according to Reuters news agency.\n\n- When we talk about large shipments to the European continent, there is only one group that dominates - smugglers from the Balkans, says Brazilian Federal Police officer Ivo Silva.\n\nThe Balkans are a peninsula extending from the Adriatic Sea to the Black Sea. The definition of what the term Balkans covers varies slightly. But these countries are included: Albania, Bosnia, Bulgaria, Croatia, Kosovo, Montenegro, North Macedonia, Serbia, Slovenia and Romania.\n\nThe groups from the Balkans have avoided the strict top-down structure that characterizes the cartels in Mexico and Colombia. Instead, the trafficking organization operates in small, highly mobile and secretive cells capable of smuggling staggeringly large quantities of cocaine.\n\nRead also: Customs Director on the cocaine threat: - We are the first line\n\nPolice investigators called these groups the Balkan Cartel. Penetrating these networks has proven difficult.\n\n- There is no strict hierarchical structure in the Balkan Cartel. There is no godfather, says a former US narcotics investigator.\n\nThe former DEA investigator says Balkan criminals happily cooperate with the Israelis, Dutch, Swedes, Americans, Dominicans and Chinese.\n\n- He says they are working with who they should be, but they are turning away from the Americans.\n\nThe actions of cartels in the Balkans leave an ugly trail behind them. In March, Greek police arrested a Balkan group allegedly responsible for more than 60 murders in Europe. European Commissioner Ylva Johansson said drug-related murders now challenge terrorism as Europe's biggest security threat. One Europol investigator says there are supposedly more than 50 different groups from the Balkans now operating in Latin America.\n\nWe have to go back more than 20 years to understand the strong presence of criminals from the Balkans in Latin America today. During the wars that followed the breakup of Yugoslavia in 1991, criminal smuggling groups flourished. When peace came in the early 2000s, some groups sought new opportunities in Latin America.\n\nHere they formed alliances with powerful criminal networks in both Colombia and Brazil. Gradually they built. The shipment was carried out with the help of several thousand sailors from the Balkans. Sailors were bribed or forced to tamper with containers, hide cocaine among their possessions, or reload cocaine onto small boats at sea.\n\nIt took a long time for the Balkan Cartel's large-scale smuggling operations to reach its peak. This is partly because these smugglers were adept at maneuvering between different jurisdictions with forged documents.\n\nThe seizure in June 2019 showed how deeply Balkan gangs penetrate international shipping. Then US authorities found 18 tons of cocaine on board a cargo ship belonging to the world's largest shipping company, Mediterranean Shipping Company (MSC).\n\nAnother impact came when Europol began an investigation into two encrypted communications services the previous year. They assumed that criminals were making heavy use of both EncroChat and Sky ECC. French, German and Belgian investigators were able to hack the services within two years.\n\nUnder the guise of tens of millions of calls, they found a vibrant ecosystem where suspects spoke openly about drug trafficking, gun dealing and planned murders. Both services have been shut down, but the investigation into the recordings continues. So far, more than 6,500 suspects have been arrested, according to Europol.\n\nOn Tuesday this week, a trial also began in Hordaland District Court in which five Albanians were charged with importing 150 kilograms of cocaine into western Norway.\n\nDespite a series of major seizures, the Balkan gang continues to flood Europe with cocaine, according to police sources. Brazilian police officer Alexandre Custodio says the Balkan gang had previously used fake companies to smuggle cocaine. They've stopped doing that. Now they use real and legitimate export companies.\n\nThe Balkan Cartel is the largest vehicle in Europe's booming cocaine trade. They've improved their methods, and it's working, a US Drug Enforcement Agency source tells Reuters.", "source": {"uri": "brytfmonline.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "brytfmonline"}, "authors":

He is scheduled to be sentenced Aug. 8, when he faces between 10 years and life in federal prison.\n\nHe is the last of nine defendants in the case. Eight other people have been convicted, according to the U.S. Attorney's Office.\n\nAccording to prosecutors, Cisneros orchestrated the drug-trafficking operation between July 2014 and August 2016.

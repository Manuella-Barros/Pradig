(NYSE:ACHR), a leader in electric vertical takeoff and landing (eVTOL) aircraft, today announced it has completed the build out of its high-volume battery pack manufacturing line. This facility is housed at Archer's Integrated Test Lab and Manufacturing Facilities in San Jose, CA and will have the throughput necessary to support the planned high volume aircraft production ramp at Archer's manufacturing facility in Georgia that remains on track to be completed later this year.\n\nThe battery pack manufacturing line was built to be an \"automotive style\" line that is designed for high-volume production from day one with the final phase of the facility set to be capable of producing up to 15,000 battery packs per year. Archer has applied automation in key areas of the battery pack manufacturing process to improve quality, operator safety and data traceability. This includes cell test and load, adhesive dispensing, laser cleaning, laser welding and end of line testing.\n\n\"This is a major milestone for Archer as designing, developing, and mass producing electric propulsion systems that are purpose built for electric aircraft is the key to unlocking the electrification of aviation,\" said Tom Muniz, Archer CTO. \"The facility will give us the capability to scale our battery pack production to meet the demands of the output that our Covington, Georgia facility will be capable of.\"\n\nArcher chose to vertically integrate its design and manufacturing of the battery pack itself to ensure it meets the rigorous levels of safety, performance and reliability necessary for its aviation use case. Archer's battery pack implements a proprietary and robust thermal runaway containment strategy. The battery packs use cylindrical cells as those, relative to other cell form factors, have a track record of safety, performance and scalability. Archer's battery pack recently successfully completed multiple drop tests, which are some of the most challenging tests Archer will face as part of the FAA's Type Certification program, further validating the safety and durability of the pack's proprietary design.\n\nArcher's goal is to transform urban travel, replacing 60-90-minute commutes by car with estimated 10-20 minute electric air taxi flights that are safe, sustainable, low noise, and cost-competitive with ground transportation. Archer's Midnight is a piloted, four-passenger aircraft designed to perform rapid back-to-back flights with minimal charge time between flights.\n\nAbout Archer\n\nArcher is designing and developing electric vertical takeoff and landing aircraft for use in urban air mobility networks. Archer's mission is to unlock the skies, freeing everyone to reimagine how they move and spend time. Archer's team is based in Santa Clara, CA.

(NYSE:ACHR), a company specializing in electric vertical takeoff and landing (eVTOL) aircraft, announced the completion of a new high-volume battery pack manufacturing line. The facility, located within the company's Integrated Test Lab and Manufacturing Facilities in San Jose, CA, is designed to support Archer's upcoming aircraft production ramp in Covington, GA, which is expected to be operational later this year.\n\nThe newly established line is set to produce up to 15,000 battery packs annually and incorporates automated processes to enhance quality, safety, and data traceability. These processes include cell testing and loading, adhesive dispensing, laser cleaning, laser welding, and end-of-line testing. This development is part of Archer's strategy to vertically integrate its battery pack production to meet stringent safety and performance standards required for aviation applications.\n\nArcher's battery pack design utilizes cylindrical cells known for their safety and scalability. The company recently reported that its battery pack passed multiple 50-foot drop tests, simulating extreme impact scenarios, as part of the Federal Aviation Administration's (FAA) Type Certification Program.\n\nTom Muniz, Archer's Chief Technology Officer, highlighted the importance of the facility, stating it is crucial for scaling battery pack production to meet the demands of the Covington, Georgia facility's capabilities. The company's vertical integration aims to ensure its battery packs meet the rigorous demands of aviation safety and reliability.\n\nArcher's overarching goal is to transform urban air travel by offering electric air taxi flights that could significantly reduce commute times compared to traditional ground transportation. Its Midnight aircraft, designed for rapid, consecutive urban flights with minimal charging time required between, is a four-passenger, piloted eVTOL aircraft.\n\nThis announcement is based on a press release statement and is part of Archer's continued efforts to develop and commercialize its eVTOL aircraft, with the aim of revolutionizing urban mobility. Archer's business plans and expectations are subject to various risks and uncertainties, which are detailed in the company's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.\n\nArcher Aviation Inc. (NYSE:ACHR) is making significant strides in the eVTOL industry with its recent announcement of a new battery pack manufacturing line. As the company gears up for increased production, a glance at the financial metrics and analyst insights from InvestingPro provides a broader context for its current market position.\n\nWith a market capitalization of $1.24 billion, Archer Aviation is navigating the challenges of a growth-focused business. Despite a negative price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of -2.72 for the last twelve months as of Q4 2023, which reflects the company's current lack of profitability, Archer's stock has seen a high return over the last year of 80.37%. This suggests that investors may be optimistic about the company's future prospects, despite the volatility indicated by a price that is currently at 51.6% of its 52-week high.\n\nInvestingPro Tips indicate that Archer holds more cash than debt on its balance sheet, which could provide financial flexibility as it continues to invest in its technology and manufacturing capabilities. However, the company is quickly burning through cash and suffers from weak gross profit margins. Additionally, analysts do not anticipate the company will be profitable this year, and the valuation implies a poor free cash flow yield. These factors should be considered when evaluating the company's long-term financial health.\n\nFor readers interested in a deeper analysis, there are an additional 11 InvestingPro Tips available, which can offer further insights into Archer's financial condition and market performance.

(Photo: Business Wire)\n\nCommenting on first quarter 2024 results, Adam Goldstein, Archer's CEO said:\n\n\"The electrification of aviation continues to increasingly emerge into the mainstream every day. From the outset, we've been clear that our strategy is to keep the design of our first electric aircraft, Midnight, as simple as possible while delivering industry-leading performance balanced with safety. We are accomplishing this by partnering with what we believe to be the best suppliers in the aerospace industry, rather than take on the cost and risk of vertically integrating every aspect of a novel aircraft program. This capital-light strategy continues to pay dividends that are more clear today than ever, as we continue to make rapid progress towards commercializing electric aviation.\"\n\nHere is a behind-the-scenes first look tour of our Integrated Test Lab and Manufacturing Facility where these aircraft are being built.\n\nArcher will be conducting its earnings conference call at 2:00 p.m. Pacific Time (5:00 p.m. Eastern Time) today. You can access a live webcast on our investor relations website at investors.archer.com or the conference call by dialing 404-975-4839 (domestic) or +1 833-470-1428 (international) and entering the access code 781391.\n\nA replay of the webcast will be available on our investor relations website. In addition, a telephonic replay of the conference call will be accessible for one week following the call by dialing 866-813-9403 (domestic) or +44 204-525-0658 (international), and entering the access code 792154.\n\nFirst Quarter 2024 Financial Results\n\nQ1 2024\n\n(GAAP)\n\nQ1 2024 1\n\n(Non-GAAP)\n\nTotal Operating Expenses\n\n$\n\n142.2M\n\n$\n\n89.1M\n\nNet Loss\n\n$\n\n(116.5M)\n\nNA\n\nAdjusted EBITDA\n\nNA\n\n$\n\n(86.8M)\n\nCash and Cash Equivalents\n\n$\n\n405.8M\n\nNA\n\n1.A reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures to the most comparable GAAP measures is provided below in the section titled \"Reconciliation of Selected GAAP To Non-GAAP Results for Q1 2024.\"\n\nSecond Quarter 2024 Financial Estimates\n\nArcher's financial estimates for second quarter of 2024 are as follows:\n\nNon-GAAP total operating expenses of $80M to $95M\n\nWe have not reconciled our non-GAAP total operating expense estimates because certain items that impact non-GAAP total operating expense are uncertain or out of our control and cannot be reasonably predicted. In particular, stock-based compensation expense is impacted by the future fair market value of our common stock and other factors, all of which are difficult to predict, subject to frequent change, or not within our control. The actual amount of these expenses during 2024 will have a significant impact on our future GAAP financials. Accordingly, a reconciliation of non-GAAP total operating expenses is not available without unreasonable effort.\n\nAbout Archer\n\nArcher is designing and developing electric vertical takeoff and landing aircraft for use in urban air mobility networks.

In addition, this press release refers to a framework agreement that is conditioned on the future execution by the parties of additional binding definitive agreements incorporating the terms outlined in the framework agreement, which definitive agreements may not be completed or may contain different terms than those set forth in the framework agreement. These forward-looking statements are only predictions and may differ materially from actual results due to a variety of factors. The risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ from the results predicted are more fully detailed in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), including our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K and most recent Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, which are or will be available on our investor relations website at investors.archer.com and on the SEC website at www.sec.gov. In addition, please note that any forward-looking statements contained herein are based on assumptions that we believe to be reasonable as of the date of this press release. We undertake no obligation to update these statements as a result of new information or future events.\n\nReconciliation of Selected GAAP To Non-GAAP Results for Q1 2024\n\nReconciliation of Total Operating Expenses (in millions; unaudited): A reconciliation of total operating expenses to non-GAAP total operating expenses for the three months ended March 31, 2024 is set forth below.\n\nThree Months Ended\n\nMarch 31, 2024\n\nTotal operating expenses\n\n$\n\n142.2\n\nAdjusted to exclude the following:\n\nStellantis warrant expense (1)\n\n(2.1)\n\nStock-based compensation (2)\n\n(40.7)\n\nTechnology and dispute resolution agreements (3)\n\n(10.3)\n\nNon-GAAP total operating expenses\n\n$\n\n89.1\n\n(1)\n\nAmount includes non-cash warrant costs, classified as research and development expenses, for the warrants issued to Stellantis in connection with certain services they are providing to the Company.\n\n(2)\n\nAmounts include stock-based compensation for options and restricted stock units issued to both employees and non-employees, including the grants issued to our founders in connection with the closing of the business combination.\n\n(3)\n\nAmounts reflect charges relating to the Boeing Wisk Agreements (as defined in our shareholder letter).\n\nReconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA (in millions; unaudited): A reconciliation of net loss to Adjusted EBITDA for the three months ended March 31, 2024 is set forth below.\n\nThree Months Ended\n\nMarch 31, 2024\n\nNet loss\n\n$\n\n(116.5)\n\nAdjusted to exclude the following:\n\nOther (income) expense, net (1)\n\n(20.6)\n\nInterest income, net\n\n(5.3)\n\nIncome tax expense\n\n0.2\n\nDepreciation and amortization expense\n\n2.3\n\nStellantis warrant expense (2)\n\n2.1\n\nStock-based compensation (3)\n\n40.7\n\nTechnology and dispute resolution agreements (4)\n\n10.3\n\nAdjusted EBITDA\n\n$\n\n(86.8)\n\n(1)\n\nAmount includes changes in fair value of the public and private warrants, which are classified as warrant liabilities.\n\n(2)\n\nAmount includes non-cash warrant costs, classified as research and development expenses, for the warrants issued to Stellantis in connection with certain services they are providing to the Company.\n\n(3)\n\nAmount includes stock-based compensation for options and restricted stock units issued to both employees and non-employees, including the grants issued to our founders in connection with the closing of the business combination.\n\n(4)\n\nAmounts reflect charges relating to the Boeing Wisk Agreements.\n\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\n\nTo supplement our condensed consolidated financial results prepared in accordance with GAAP, we use a number of non-GAAP financial measures to help us in analyzing and assessing our overall business performance, for making operating decisions and for forecasting and planning future periods. We consider the use of non-GAAP financial measures helpful in assessing our current financial performance, ongoing operations and prospects for the future as well as understanding financial and business trends relating to our financial condition and results of operations.\n\nWhile we use non-GAAP financial measures as a tool to enhance our understanding of certain aspects of our financial performance and to provide incremental insight into the underlying factors and trends affecting our performance, we do not consider these measures to be a substitute for, or superior to, the information provided by GAAP financial measures. Consistent with this approach, we believe that disclosing non-GAAP financial measures to the readers of our financial statements provides useful supplemental data that, while not a substitute for GAAP financial measures, can offer insight in the review of our financial and operational performance and enables investors to more fully understand trends in our current and future performance.\n\nIn assessing our business during the quarter ended March 31, 2024, we excluded items in the following general categories from one or more of our non-GAAP financial measures, certain of which are described below:\n\nStock-Based Compensation Expense: We believe that providing non-GAAP measures excluding stock-based compensation expense, in addition to the GAAP measures, allows for better comparability of our financial results from period to period. We prepare and maintain our budgets and forecasts for future periods on a basis consistent with this non-GAAP financial measure. Further, companies use a variety of types of equity awards as well as a variety of methodologies, assumptions and estimates to determine stock-based compensation expense. We believe that excluding stock-based compensation expenses enhances our ability and the ability of investors to understand the impact of non-cash stock-based compensation on our operating results and to compare our results against the results of other companies.\n\nWarrant Expense and Gains or Losses from Revaluation of Warrants: Expense from our common stock warrants issued to United Airlines and Stellantis, which is recurring (but non-cash) and gains or losses from change in fair value of public and private warrants from revaluation will be reflected in our financial results for the foreseeable future. We exclude warrant expense and gains or losses from change in fair value for similar reasons to our stock-based compensation expense.\n\nTechnology and Dispute Resolution Agreements: Amounts reflect non-cash charges relating to the Boeing Wisk Agreements.\n\nEach of the non-GAAP financial measures presented in this release should not be considered in isolation from, or as a substitute for, a measure of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP and are presented for supplemental informational purposes only. Further, investors are cautioned that there are inherent limitations associated with the use of each of these non-GAAP financial measures as an analytical tool. In particular, these non-GAAP financial measures have no standardized meaning prescribed by GAAP and are not based on a comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles and many of the adjustments to the GAAP financial measures reflect the exclusion of items that are recurring and may be reflected in our financial results for the foreseeable future. In addition, the non-GAAP measures we use may be different from non-GAAP measures used by other companies, limiting their usefulness for comparison purposes. We compensate for these limitations by providing specific information in the reconciliation included in this release regarding the GAAP amounts excluded from the non-GAAP financial measures. In addition, as noted above, we evaluate the non-GAAP financial measures together with the most directly comparable GAAP financial information. Investors are encouraged to review the reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures included in this release.\n\nView source version on

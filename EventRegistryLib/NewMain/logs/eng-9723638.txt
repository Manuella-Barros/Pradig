The victim was a Class 3 student, and two of the accused, aged 12, were studying in the sixth standard.\n\nAn 8-year-old girl was sexually assaulted and murdered by 3 minor boys in Andhra Pradesh's Nandyal. The incident occurred in Mucchumarri village on Sunday and it came to light on Wednesday. The boys, who were between the ages of 13 and 17, attended the same school as the girl, according to the authorities. Under the guise of taking her to a new playground, the accused reportedly transported her to a remote location.\n\nThe girl who was a class 3 student was then sexually assaulted by the accused and later thrown into the canal. The incident occurred in Pagidyala on Sunday but only came to public on Wednesday after the police arrested the suspects. On Sunday, the victim's father reported his kid missing.\n\nThe police searched Muchumarri Park extensively and spoke with residents to get leads, but they were unable to find the girl. A sniffer dog was then brought in to help with the search. The police found the homes of the three young boys thanks to the dog's tips. After a preliminary inquiry, the youngsters were taken into custody.\n\nThe boys allegedly admitted to raping and killing the little girl as they were being questioned. According to their statement, the boys noticed the girl playing near Muchumarri Park. They asked her to join them for a game and she agreed.\n\nFearing repercussions if the girl reported the assault to her parents, they decided to murder her. They later disposed of her body in a nearby canal and fled the scene. Based on a confession from one of the accused, the police have detained all three and are continuing to investigate the matter.\n\nThe body of the girl is yet to be recovered.

The minor boys, aged between 11 and 15, reportedly admitted to taking the girl from the playground to the pump house on the outskirts of the village, and assaulting her.

He had told police that the girl was playing at Muchumarri park, but did not return home later. Subsequently, Police launched a search and questioned local residents, but could not find her. Later, a sniffer dog led police to the three minor boys. All three are students of the same school to which the girl was admitted. During questioning, the boys admitted to raping and murdering the girl, police said.\n\nEarlier in May this year, four people were arrested in Andhra Pradesh's Mandavalli for allegedly \"filming\" the alleged rape of a girl by a juvenile and circulating the video, the police said. The incident allegedly took place on May 15 but came to the fore a few days later. The arrested persons were identified as Bale Balasubrahmanyam (22), Gantashala Chandrasekhar (28), Peddireddi Dharmateja (19) and Jayamangala Hari Krishna (20).\n\nAccording to the police, the victim, who was a minor, and the juvenile were acquainted. She had gone to the government school in the Chintapadu village in Eluru's district Mandavalli mandal to take books. \"Seeing the Class-7 student alone, the boy, a Class-10 student, led her into the school and allegedly raped her.

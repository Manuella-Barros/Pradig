Tim Walz.\n\nArizona Sen. Mark Kelly, a former astronaut and gun control advocate, had been a top contender for running mate. He's won two tough races in politically divided Arizona.\n\nIn passing over Kelly, Harris may have also lost the chance to win over people like Gonzalo Leyva, a 49-year-old landscaper in Phoenix. Leyva plans to vote for former President Donald Trump, a Republican, but says he would have backed a Harris-Kelly ticket.\n\n\"I prefer Kelly like 100 times,\" said Leyva, a lifelong Democrat who became an independent at the beginning of Trump's term in office. \"I don't think he's that extreme like the other guys.\"\n\nIn Arizona, every vote will be critical. The state is no stranger to nail-biter races, including in 2020 when President Joe Biden bested Trump by fewer than 11,000 votes. Both parties are bracing for a similar photo finish this year.\n\n\"These last few months are going to feel like years, and it is tough to see anyone winning by a large margin,\" said Constantine Querard, a veteran Republican strategist in the state.\n\nDemocrats profess confidence that Harris is in solid shape in the state even without Kelly on the ticket. The senator is expected to remain a strong advocate for Harris and is already mentioned for possible Cabinet posts or other prominent roles should the vice president ascend to the Oval Office.\n\n\"Not picking Kelly hasn't put the brakes on support for Harris,\" said Stacy Pearson, a Democratic strategist in Phoenix. She said she feels the same enthusiasm for the new ticket that has led to giant crowds greeting Harris and Walz at prior stops on their tour, including the home of another running mate also-ran, Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro.\n\nAnother Democratic strategist in Arizona, D.J. Quinlan, agreed. \"There's a ton of enthusiasm on the ground. It's the closest thing to me to what 2008 felt like,\" he said, referring former President Barack Obama's first run, which electrified Democratic voters.\n\nArizona is something of a magnet for Midwesterners seeking to escape the cold. So, several observers say, Walz may still play well there. Scott Snyder, who moved to Phoenix three years ago from Detroit, wasn't too familiar with Kelly's background or his politics, but said Harris made the right choice with Walz.\n\n\"He reminds me a lot of my dad,\" said Snyder, an electrician. \"You see pictures of him out there coaching high school football. That's something that resonates with me. You see him out there duck hunting. Same thing. That's fairly common in Michigan, where I'm from.\"\n\nArizona was reliably Republican until Trump's combative approach to politics went national.\n\nIn 2016, Trump won Arizona, then quickly started feuding with the late Republican Sen. John McCain, a political icon in the state. That sparked a steady exodus of educated, moderate Republicans from the GOP and toward Democrats in top of the ticket contests.\n\nIn 2018, Democrats won an open Senate race in the state, foreshadowing Kelly's 2020 win and Biden's victory there as well. In 2022, Kelly won again, and Democrats swept the top three statewide races for governor, attorney general and secretary of state, defeating Republican candidates who hewed to Trump's style and his lies about fraud costing him the 2020 presidential election.\n\nChuck Coughlin, a Republican strategist and former McCain staffer, said the same voters who tipped the state to Democrats in the past few cycles remain lukewarm, at best, on Trump.\n\n\"Trump's not doing anything to embrace that segment of the electorate,\" he said.\n\nThe campaign is already being fought over familiar turf in Arizona -- its border with Mexico. Trump and his allies have been hammering Biden over the influx of migrants during his term and are shifting their attacks to Harris.\n\n\"It's very easy for us to segue and switch our sights and focus on her,\" said Dave Smith, Pima County's Republican party chairman.\n\nKari Lake, who is running against Democratic Rep. Ruben Gallego for an open Senate seat in Arizona, unveiled an ad late last week bashing Gallego for supporting what the ad calls Biden and Harris' \"radical border agenda,\" featuring repeated clips of the vice president chortling.\n\nOn Thursday, Lake argued to reporters that Harris is less popular in Arizona than Biden. \"They like Kamala Harris even less,\" Lake said. \"They understand that she hasn't done anything on the border.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Harris is targeting the state's fast-growing Latino population with her own ad highlighting how Harris, the daughter of immigrants from India and Jamaica, rose to the highest echelons of American politics.\n\nHarris' background and comparative youth have put Arizona and other Sun Belt states back in play in a presidential race that had been narrowing to the trio of \"blue wall\" swing states, Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin.\n\nThough it has a robust younger population, Arizona is also known for its vast swaths of retirement communities. Pearson contended that Biden's age -- 81 -- put him at a disadvantage in the state.\n\n\"Fellow retirees were the first to say this is not OK,\" Pearson said of Biden's age. \"I'm so much more optimistic with Harris and Walz at the top of the ticket.\"", "source": {"uri": "wsbt.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "WSBT"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Tim Walz. Arizona Sen. Mark Kelly, a former astronaut and gun control advocate, had been a top contender for running mate.\n\nMeanwhile, former President Donald Trump is visiting Montana for a rally in support of Republican Senate candidate Tim Sheehy. The former president hopes to remedy some unfinished business from 2018, when he campaigned repeatedly in Big Sky Country in a failed bid to oust incumbent Democratic Sen. Jon Tester.\n\nFollow the AP's Election 2024 coverage at: https://apnews.com/hub/election-2024.\n\nHere's the Latest:\n\nFor a brief moment this week, the fierce competition for swing voters in swing-state Wisconsin converged on the tarmac of the tiny Chippewa Valley Regional Airport.\n\nMinutes after Vice President Kamala Harris landed with her new running mate Tim Walz for their first campaign stop in the state, Republican vice presidential nominee JD Vance arrived. He walked across the tarmac to check out Air Force Two, just missing Harris.\n\nThe close encounter of the political kind could be written off as a coincidence if it happened anywhere other than Wisconsin, one of a small number of states that will not only determine the winner of the presidential race but could also shape the balance of power in Congress. But it sent a much louder signal that both parties understand the importance of a region that could tip the balance of power in more ways than one.\n\nVice President Kamala Harris and her new running mate will hold a rally in Arizona on Friday as part of their tour of electoral battlegrounds, visiting a state where Harris passed over a prominent Democrat in favor of Minnesota Gov.

Tim Walz. Arizona Sen. Mark Kelly, a former astronaut and gun control advocate, had been a top contender for running mate.\n\nMeanwhile, former President Donald Trump is visiting Montana for a rally in support of Republican Senate candidate Tim Sheehy. The former president hopes to remedy some unfinished business from 2018, when he campaigned repeatedly in Big Sky Country in a failed bid to oust incumbent Democratic Sen. Jon Tester.\n\nDemocrats and Republicans descend on western Wisconsin with high stakes up and down the ballot\n\nFor a brief moment this week, the fierce competition for swing voters in swing-state Wisconsin converged on the tarmac of the tiny Chippewa Valley Regional Airport.\n\nMinutes after Vice President Kamala Harris landed with her new running mate Tim Walz for their first campaign stop in the state, Republican vice presidential nominee JD Vance arrived. He walked across the tarmac to check out Air Force Two, just missing Harris.\n\nThe close encounter of the political kind could be written off as a coincidence if it happened anywhere other than Wisconsin, one of a small number of states that will not only determine the winner of the presidential race but could also shape the balance of power in Congress. But it sent a much louder signal that both parties understand the importance of a region that could tip the balance of power in more ways than one.\n\nHarris and Walz head to Arizona, where a VP runner-up could still make a difference\n\nVice President Kamala Harris and her new running mate will hold a rally in Arizona on Friday as part of their tour of electoral battlegrounds, visiting a state where Harris passed over a prominent Democrat in favor of Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz.\n\nArizona Sen. Mark Kelly, a former astronaut and gun control advocate, had been a top contender for running mate. He's won two tough races in politically divided Arizona.\n\nIn passing over Kelly, Harris may have also lost the chance to win over people like Gonzalo Leyva, a 49-year-old landscaper in Phoenix. Leyva plans to vote for former President Donald Trump, a Republican, but says he would have backed a Harris-Kelly ticket.\n\n\"I prefer Kelly like 100 times,\" said Leyva, a lifelong Democrat who became an independent at the beginning of Trump's term in office. \"I don't think he's that extreme like the other guys.\"\n\nTrump heads to Montana in a bid to oust Sen. Tester after failing to topple the Democrat in 2018\n\nWith control of the Senate potentially at stake, Donald Trump is visiting Montana on Friday hoping to remedy some unfinished business from 2018, when he campaigned repeatedly in Big Sky Country in a failed bid to oust incumbent Democratic Sen. Jon Tester.\n\nTester has tried to convince voters he's aligned with Trump on many issues, mirroring his successful strategy from six years ago. While that worked in a non-presidential election year, it faces a more critical test this fall with Tester's opponent, former Navy SEAL Tim Sheehy, trying to link the three-term incumbent to Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris.\n\nA win for the Harris-Walz ticket would also mean the country's first Native American female governor\n\nIf Vice President Kamala Harris and her running mate, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, are elected this fall, not only would a woman of color lead the country for the first time, but a Native woman also would govern a state for the first time in U.S. history.\n\nPeggy Flanagan, the lieutenant governor of Minnesota and a citizen of the White Earth Band of Ojibwe, is poised to serve as the state's next governor should Walz step down to accept the role of U.S. vice president. Her rise to power has been watched closely by Indigenous peoples in Minnesota and across the country who see her as a champion of policies that positively affect Native Americans.\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

Tim Walz. Arizona Sen. Mark Kelly, a former astronaut and gun control advocate, had been a top contender for running mate.\n\nMeanwhile, former President Donald Trump is visiting Montana for a rally in support of Republican Senate candidate Tim Sheehy. The former president hopes to remedy some unfinished business from 2018, when he campaigned repeatedly in Big Sky Country in a failed bid to oust incumbent Democratic Sen. Jon Tester.\n\nGeorgia Gov. Brian Kemp insists he's not getting bogged down by Republican nominee and former President Donald Trump's intraparty attacks over Kemp's refusal to help overturn the 2020 presidential election.\n\nThe Republican governor called Trump's recent broadsides at an Atlanta campaign rally and on the Truth Social platform \"a lot of noise\" and jokingly compared Trump to a tropical storm.\n\n\"This big storm came through the state this week - and now we're dealing with Tropical Storm Debby,\" Kemp said at conservative radio host Erick Erickson's annual conference, \"The Gathering,\" in the Buckhead section of Atlanta.\n\nKemp repeated his pledge to support the GOP nominee and renewed his warnings that Republicans should stop focusing on the 2020 election and false assertions that Biden won Georgia and nationally because of fraud.\n\n\"We're going to use our political operation to win Georgia despite past grievances,\" Kemp told Erickson, adding that the efforts would \"help Republicans up and down the ticket.\"\n\nOf course, Kemp's political operation is focusing on competitive Georgia legislative districts that are key to maintaining GOP majorities at the statehouse, meaning potential Republican voters in other swaths of the hotly contested state may not be reached by the Kemp organization before November.\n\nThroughout the discussion with Erickson, Kemp did not say Trump's name.\n\nFor a brief moment this week, the fierce competition for swing voters in swing-state Wisconsin converged on the tarmac of the tiny Chippewa Valley Regional Airport.\n\nMinutes after Vice President Kamala Harris landed with her new running mate Tim Walz for their first campaign stop in the state, Republican vice presidential nominee JD Vance arrived. He walked across the tarmac to check out Air Force Two, just missing Harris.\n\nThe close encounter of the political kind could be written off as a coincidence if it happened anywhere other than Wisconsin, one of a small number of states that will not only determine the winner of the presidential race but could also shape the balance of power in Congress. But it sent a much louder signal that both parties understand the importance of a region that could tip the balance of power in more ways than one.\n\nVice President Kamala Harris and her new running mate will hold a rally in Arizona on Friday as part of their tour of electoral battlegrounds, visiting a state where Harris passed over a prominent Democrat in favor of Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz.\n\nArizona Sen. Mark Kelly, a former astronaut and gun control advocate, had been a top contender for running mate. He's won two tough races in politically divided Arizona.\n\nIn passing over Kelly, Harris may have also lost the chance to win over people like Gonzalo Leyva, a 49-year-old landscaper in Phoenix. Leyva plans to vote for former President Donald Trump, a Republican, but says he would have backed a Harris-Kelly ticket.\n\n\"I prefer Kelly like 100 times,\" said Leyva, a lifelong Democrat who became an independent at the beginning of Trump's term in office. \"I don't think he's that extreme like the other guys.\"\n\nWith control of the Senate potentially at stake, Donald Trump is visiting Montana on Friday hoping to remedy some unfinished business from 2018, when he campaigned repeatedly in Big Sky Country in a failed bid to oust incumbent Democratic Sen. Jon Tester.\n\nTester has tried to convince voters he's aligned with Trump on many issues, mirroring his successful strategy from six years ago. While that worked in a non-presidential election year, it faces a more critical test this fall with Tester's opponent, former Navy SEAL Tim Sheehy, trying to link the three-term incumbent to Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris.\n\nIf Vice President Kamala Harris and her running mate, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, are elected this fall, not only would a woman of color lead the country for the first time, but a Native woman also would govern a state for the first time in U.S. history.\n\nPeggy Flanagan, the lieutenant governor of Minnesota and a citizen of the White Earth Band of Ojibwe, is poised to serve as the state's next governor should Walz step down to accept the role of U.S. vice president. Her rise to power has been watched closely by Indigenous peoples in Minnesota and across the country who see her as a champion of policies that positively affect Native Americans.", "source": {"uri":

Tim Walz. Arizona Sen. Mark Kelly, a former astronaut and gun control advocate, had been a top contender for running mate.\n\nMeanwhile, former President Donald Trump is visiting Montana for a rally in support of Republican Senate candidate Tim Sheehy. The former president hopes to remedy some unfinished business from 2018, when he campaigned repeatedly in Big Sky Country in a failed bid to oust incumbent Democratic Sen. Jon Tester.\n\nGeorgia Gov. Brian Kemp insists he\u00b4s not getting bogged down by Republican nominee and former President Donald Trump's intraparty attacks over Kemp\u00b4s refusal to help overturn the 2020 presidential election.\n\nThe Republican governor called Trump\u00b4s recent broadsides at an Atlanta campaign rally and on the Truth Social platform \"a lot of noise\" and jokingly compared Trump to a tropical storm.\n\n\"This big storm came through the state this week - and now we\u00b4re dealing with Tropical Storm Debby,\" Kemp said at conservative radio host Erick Erickson\u00b4s annual conference, \"The Gathering,\" in the Buckhead section of Atlanta.\n\nKemp repeated his pledge to support the GOP nominee and renewed his warnings that Republicans should stop focusing on the 2020 election and false assertions that Biden won Georgia and nationally because of fraud.\n\n\"We\u00b4re going to use our political operation to win Georgia despite past grievances,\" Kemp told Erickson, adding that the efforts would \"help Republicans up and down the ticket.\"\n\nOf course, Kemp\u00b4s political operation is focusing on competitive Georgia legislative districts that are key to maintaining GOP majorities at the statehouse, meaning potential Republican voters in other swaths of the hotly contested state may not be reached by the Kemp organization before November.\n\nThroughout the discussion with Erickson, Kemp did not say Trump\u00b4s name.\n\nFor a brief moment this week, the fierce competition for swing voters in swing-state Wisconsin converged on the tarmac of the tiny Chippewa Valley Regional Airport.\n\nMinutes after Vice President Kamala Harris landed with her new running mate Tim Walz for their first campaign stop in the state, Republican vice presidential nominee JD Vance arrived. He walked across the tarmac to check out Air Force Two, just missing Harris.\n\nThe close encounter of the political kind could be written off as a coincidence if it happened anywhere other than Wisconsin, one of a small number of states that will not only determine the winner of the presidential race but could also shape the balance of power in Congress. But it sent a much louder signal that both parties understand the importance of a region that could tip the balance of power in more ways than one.\n\nVice President Kamala Harris and her new running mate will hold a rally in Arizona on Friday as part of their tour of electoral battlegrounds, visiting a state where Harris passed over a prominent Democrat in favor of Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz.\n\nArizona Sen. Mark Kelly, a former astronaut and gun control advocate, had been a top contender for running mate. He\u00b4s won two tough races in politically divided Arizona.\n\nIn passing over Kelly, Harris may have also lost the chance to win over people like Gonzalo Leyva, a 49-year-old landscaper in Phoenix. Leyva plans to vote for former President Donald Trump, a Republican, but says he would have backed a Harris-Kelly ticket.\n\n\"I prefer Kelly like 100 times,\" said Leyva, a lifelong Democrat who became an independent at the beginning of Trump\u00b4s term in office. \"I don\u00b4t think he\u00b4s that extreme like the other guys.\"\n\nWith control of the Senate potentially at stake, Donald Trump is visiting Montana on Friday hoping to remedy some unfinished business from 2018, when he campaigned repeatedly in Big Sky Country in a failed bid to oust incumbent Democratic Sen. Jon Tester.\n\nTester has tried to convince voters he\u00b4s aligned with Trump on many issues, mirroring his successful strategy from six years ago. While that worked in a non-presidential election year, it faces a more critical test this fall with Tester\u00b4s opponent, former Navy SEAL Tim Sheehy, trying to link the three-term incumbent to Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris.\n\nIf Vice President Kamala Harris and her running mate, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, are elected this fall, not only would a woman of color lead the country for the first time, but a Native woman also would govern a state for the first time in U.S. history.\n\nPeggy Flanagan, the lieutenant governor of Minnesota and a citizen of the White Earth Band of Ojibwe, is poised to serve as the state\u00b4s next governor should Walz step down to accept the role of U.S. vice president. Her rise to power has been watched closely by Indigenous peoples in Minnesota and across the country who see her as a champion of policies that positively affect Native Americans.", "source": {"uri":

The former president hopes to remedy some unfinished business from 2018, when he campaigned repeatedly in Big Sky Country in a failed bid to oust incumbent Democratic Sen. Jon Tester.\n\nFollow the AP's Election 2024 coverage at: https://apnews.com/hub/election-2024.\n\nHere's the Latest:\n\nDemocrats and Republicans descend on western Wisconsin with high stakes up and down the ballot\n\nFor a brief moment this week, the fierce competition for swing voters in swing-state Wisconsin converged on the tarmac of the tiny Chippewa Valley Regional Airport.\n\nMinutes after Vice President Kamala Harris landed with her new running mate Tim Walz for their first campaign stop in the state, Republican vice presidential nominee JD Vance arrived. He walked across the tarmac to check out Air Force Two, just missing Harris.\n\nThe close encounter of the political kind could be written off as a coincidence if it happened anywhere other than Wisconsin, one of a small number of states that will not only determine the winner of the presidential race but could also shape the balance of power in Congress. But it sent a much louder signal that both parties understand the importance of a region that could tip the balance of power in more ways than one.\n\nHarris and Walz head to Arizona, where a VP runner-up could still make a difference\n\nVice President Kamala Harris and her new running mate will hold a rally in Arizona on Friday as part of their tour of electoral battlegrounds, visiting a state where Harris passed over a prominent Democrat in favor of Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz.\n\nFeatured Local Savings\n\nArizona Sen. Mark Kelly, a former astronaut and gun control advocate, had been a top contender for running mate. He's won two tough races in politically divided Arizona.\n\nIn passing over Kelly, Harris may have also lost the chance to win over people like Gonzalo Leyva, a 49-year-old landscaper in Phoenix. Leyva plans to vote for former President Donald Trump, a Republican, but says he would have backed a Harris-Kelly ticket.\n\n\"I prefer Kelly like 100 times,\" said Leyva, a lifelong Democrat who became an independent at the beginning of Trump's term in office. \"I don't think he's that extreme like the other guys.\"\n\nTrump heads to Montana in a bid to oust Sen. Tester after failing to topple the Democrat in 2018\n\nWith control of the Senate potentially at stake, Donald Trump is visiting Montana on Friday hoping to remedy some unfinished business from 2018, when he campaigned repeatedly in Big Sky Country in a failed bid to oust incumbent Democratic Sen. Jon Tester.\n\nTester has tried to convince voters he's aligned with Trump on many issues, mirroring his successful strategy from six years ago. While that worked in a non-presidential election year, it faces a more critical test this fall with Tester's opponent, former Navy SEAL Tim Sheehy, trying to link the three-term incumbent to Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris.\n\nA win for the Harris-Walz ticket would also mean the country's first Native American female governor\n\nIf Vice President Kamala Harris and her running mate, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, are elected this fall, not only would a woman of color lead the country for the first time, but a Native woman also would govern a state for the first time in U.S. history.\n\nPeggy Flanagan, the lieutenant governor of Minnesota and a citizen of the White Earth Band of Ojibwe, is poised to serve as the state's next governor should Walz step down to accept the role of U.S. vice president. Her rise to power has been watched closely by Indigenous peoples in Minnesota and across the country who see her as a champion of policies that positively affect Native Americans.", "source": {"uri":

Josh Shapiro.\n\nAnother Democratic strategist in Arizona, D.J. Quinlan, agreed. \"There's a ton of enthusiasm on the ground. It's the closest thing to me to what 2008 felt like,\" he said, referring former President Barack Obama's first run, which electrified Democratic voters.\n\nArizona is something of a magnet for Midwesterners seeking to escape the cold. So, several observers say, Walz may still play well there. Scott Snyder, who moved to Phoenix three years ago from Detroit, wasn't too familiar with Kelly's background or his politics, but said Harris made the right choice with Walz.\n\n\"He reminds me a lot of my dad,\" said Snyder, an electrician. \"You see pictures of him out there coaching high school football. That's something that resonates with me. You see him out there duck hunting. Same thing. That's fairly common in Michigan, where I'm from.\"\n\nArizona was reliably Republican until Trump's combative approach to politics went national.\n\nIn 2016, Trump won Arizona, then quickly started feuding with the late Republican Sen. John McCain, a political icon in the state. That sparked a steady exodus of educated, moderate Republicans from the GOP and toward Democrats in top of the ticket contests.\n\nIn 2018, Democrats won an open Senate race in the state, foreshadowing Kelly's 2020 win and Biden's victory there as well. In 2022, Kelly won again, and Democrats swept the top three statewide races for governor, attorney general and secretary of state, defeating Republican candidates who hewed to Trump's style and his lies about fraud costing him the 2020 presidential election.\n\nChuck Coughlin, a Republican strategist and former McCain staffer, said the same voters who tipped the state to Democrats in the past few cycles remain lukewarm, at best, on Trump.\n\n\"Trump's not doing anything to embrace that segment of the electorate,\" he said.\n\nThe campaign is already being fought over familiar turf in Arizona -- its border with Mexico. Trump and his allies have been hammering Biden over the influx of migrants during his term and are shifting their attacks to Harris.\n\n\"It's very easy for us to segue and switch our sights and focus on her,\" said Dave Smith, Pima County's Republican party chairman.\n\nKari Lake, who is running against Democratic Rep. Ruben Gallego for an open Senate seat in Arizona, unveiled an ad late last week bashing Gallego for supporting what the ad calls Biden and Harris' \"radical border agenda,\" featuring repeated clips of the vice president chortling.\n\nOn Thursday, Lake argued to reporters that Harris is less popular in Arizona than Biden. \"They like Kamala Harris even less,\" Lake said. \"They understand that she hasn't done anything on the border.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Harris is targeting the state's fast-growing Latino population with her own ad highlighting how Harris, the daughter of immigrants from India and Jamaica, rose to the highest echelons of American politics.\n\nHarris' background and comparative youth have put Arizona and other Sun Belt states back in play in a presidential race that had been narrowing to the trio of \"blue wall\" swing states, Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin.\n\nThough it has a robust younger population, Arizona is also known for its vast swaths of retirement communities. Pearson contended that Biden's age -- 81 -- put him at a disadvantage in the state.\n\n\"Fellow retirees were the first to say this is not OK,\" Pearson said of Biden's age. \"I'm so much more optimistic with Harris and Walz at the top of the ticket.\"\n\n___\n\nRiccardi reported from Denver.

Tim Walz.\n\nArizona Sen. Mark Kelly, a former astronaut and gun control advocate, had been a top contender for running mate. He's won two tough races in politically divided Arizona.\n\nIn passing over Kelly, Harris may have also lost the chance to win over people like Gonzalo Leyva, a 49-year-old landscaper in Phoenix. Leyva plans to vote for former President Donald Trump, a Republican, but says he would have backed a Harris-Kelly ticket.\n\n\"I prefer Kelly like 100 times,\" said Leyva, a lifelong Democrat who became an independent at the beginning of Trump's term in office. \"I don't think he's that extreme like the other guys.\"\n\nIn Arizona, every vote will be critical. The state is no stranger to nail-biter races, including in 2020 when President Joe Biden bested Trump by fewer than 11,000 votes. Both parties are bracing for a similar photo finish this year.\n\n\"These last few months are going to feel like years, and it is tough to see anyone winning by a large margin,\" said Constantine Querard, a veteran Republican strategist in the state.\n\nDemocrats profess confidence that Harris is in solid shape in the state even without Kelly on the ticket. The senator is expected to remain a strong advocate for Harris and is already mentioned for possible Cabinet posts or other prominent roles should the vice president ascend to the Oval Office.\n\n\"Not picking Kelly hasn't put the brakes on support for Harris,\" said Stacy Pearson, a Democratic strategist in Phoenix. She said she feels the same enthusiasm for the new ticket that has led to giant crowds greeting Harris and Walz at prior stops on their tour, including the home of another running mate also-ran, Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro.\n\nAnother Democratic strategist in Arizona, D.J. Quinlan, agreed. \"There's a ton of enthusiasm on the ground. It's the closest thing to me to what 2008 felt like,\" he said, referring to former President Barack Obama's first run, which electrified Democratic voters.\n\nArizona is something of a magnet for Midwesterners seeking to escape the cold. So, several observers say, Walz may still play well there.

Tim Walz. Arizona Sen. Mark Kelly, a former astronaut and gun control advocate, had been a top contender for running mate.\n\nMeanwhile, former President Donald Trump is visiting Montana for a rally in support of Republican Senate candidate Tim Sheehy. The former president hopes to remedy some unfinished business from 2018, when he campaigned repeatedly in Big Sky Country in a failed bid to oust incumbent Democratic Sen. Jon Tester.\n\nFollow the AP's Election 2024 coverage at: https://apnews.com/hub/election-2024.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nHere's the Latest:\n\nGeorgia Gov. Kemp calls Trump attacks 'noise' and says he's still focused on winning\n\nGeorgia Gov. Brian Kemp insists he's not getting bogged down by Republican nominee and former President Donald Trump's intraparty attacks over Kemp's refusal to help overturn the 2020 presidential election.\n\nThe Republican governor called Trump's recent broadsides at an Atlanta campaign rally and on the Truth Social platform \"a lot of noise\" and jokingly compared Trump to a tropical storm.\n\n\"This big storm came through the state this week - and now we're dealing with Tropical Storm Debby,\" Kemp said at conservative radio host Erick Erickson's annual conference, \"The Gathering,\" in the Buckhead section of Atlanta.\n\nKemp repeated his pledge to support the GOP nominee and renewed his warnings that Republicans should stop focusing on the 2020 election and false assertions that Biden won Georgia and nationally because of fraud.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\n\"We're going to use our political operation to win Georgia despite past grievances,\" Kemp told Erickson, adding that the efforts would \"help Republicans up and down the ticket.\"\n\nOf course, Kemp's political operation is focusing on competitive Georgia legislative districts that are key to maintaining GOP majorities at the statehouse, meaning potential Republican voters in other swaths of the hotly contested state may not be reached by the Kemp organization before November.\n\nThroughout the discussion with Erickson, Kemp did not say Trump's name.\n\nDemocrats and Republicans descend on western Wisconsin with high stakes up and down the ballot\n\nFor a brief moment this week, the fierce competition for swing voters in swing-state Wisconsin converged on the tarmac of the tiny Chippewa Valley Regional Airport.\n\nMinutes after Vice President Kamala Harris landed with her new running mate Tim Walz for their first campaign stop in the state, Republican vice presidential nominee JD Vance arrived. He walked across the tarmac to check out Air Force Two, just missing Harris.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nThe close encounter of the political kind could be written off as a coincidence if it happened anywhere other than Wisconsin, one of a small number of states that will not only determine the winner of the presidential race but could also shape the balance of power in Congress. But it sent a much louder signal that both parties understand the importance of a region that could tip the balance of power in more ways than one.\n\nHarris and Walz head to Arizona, where a VP runner-up could still make a difference\n\nVice President Kamala Harris and her new running mate will hold a rally in Arizona on Friday as part of their tour of electoral battlegrounds, visiting a state where Harris passed over a prominent Democrat in favor of Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz.\n\nArizona Sen. Mark Kelly, a former astronaut and gun control advocate, had been a top contender for running mate. He's won two tough races in politically divided Arizona.\n\nIn passing over Kelly, Harris may have also lost the chance to win over people like Gonzalo Leyva, a 49-year-old landscaper in Phoenix. Leyva plans to vote for former President Donald Trump, a Republican, but says he would have backed a Harris-Kelly ticket.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\n\"I prefer Kelly like 100 times,\" said Leyva, a lifelong Democrat who became an independent at the beginning of Trump's term in office. \"I don't think he's that extreme like the other guys.\"\n\nTrump heads to Montana in a bid to oust Sen. Tester after failing to topple the Democrat in 2018\n\nWith control of the Senate potentially at stake, Donald Trump is visiting Montana on Friday hoping to remedy some unfinished business from 2018, when he campaigned repeatedly in Big Sky Country in a failed bid to oust incumbent Democratic Sen. Jon Tester.\n\nTester has tried to convince voters he's aligned with Trump on many issues, mirroring his successful strategy from six years ago. While that worked in a non-presidential election year, it faces a more critical test this fall with Tester's opponent, former Navy SEAL Tim Sheehy, trying to link the three-term incumbent to Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris.\n\nA win for the Harris-Walz ticket would also mean the country's first Native American female governor\n\nIf Vice President Kamala Harris and her running mate, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, are elected this fall, not only would a woman of color lead the country for the first time, but a Native woman also would govern a state for the first time in U.S. history.\n\nPeggy Flanagan, the lieutenant governor of Minnesota and a citizen of the White Earth Band of Ojibwe, is poised to serve as the state's next governor should Walz step down to accept the role of U.S. vice president. Her rise to power has been watched closely by Indigenous peoples in Minnesota and across the country who see her as a champion of policies that positively affect Native Americans.\n\nRead more on the

Tim Walz will take the stage in Glendale Friday evening for one of their last campaign stops in a tour of battleground states.\n\nHer stop in Arizona on Friday marks her and Walz's first appearance in the state since becoming the presumptive Democratic ticket after President Joe Biden withdrew from the race on July 21.\n\nHarris and Walz have spoken to crowds of thousands of voters this week in Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and Michigan as part of a cross-country trip to all of the swing states.\n\nBut Harris' visit isn't her first time in the Valley. She has visited Arizona half a dozen times over the last four years as vice president.\n\nHere's what you need to know about Harris' past visits to Arizona.\n\nWhen was the last time Kamala Harris visited Arizona?\n\nHarris has made frequent stops to the state. She most recently returned to Arizona on June 24 -- the anniversary of U.S. Supreme Court's decision to overturn Roe vs. Wade.\n\nShe discussed the future of abortion rights to a crowd of 400 people in downtown Phoenix.\n\nSecond gentleman Doug Emhoff also visited Phoenix in late July to affirm support for President Joe Biden and Harris, who were the Democratic presidential and vice presidential nominees at the time.\n\nWhy has Kamala Harris made visits to Arizona in the past?\n\nHarris visited the state in the last four years to advocate for issues from solar energy to immigration and gun violence. But the topic of abortion rights has dominated the discussions during her most recent visits.\n\nAbortion is a top issue in the upcoming Nov. 5 election and in the state after the Arizona Supreme Court upheld an 1864 near-total abortion ban this year.\n\nShe made the case for abortion rights during a March 8 visit to Phoenix.\n\n\"In states across our nation, extremists have proposed and passed laws that criminalize doctors and punished women, laws that threaten doctors and nurses with prison time, even for life, simply for providing health care. Laws like those in Arizona,\" Harris said.\n\nHarris also visited to speak about abortion rights and the attempted total abortion ban in the state on April 12 in Tuscon.\n\nDuring the 2020 presidential race, Biden and Harris made a joint October trip to Arizona that included a stop at Phoenix restaurant Barrio Cafe.\n\nWhen did Republican vice-presidential nominee JD Vance last visit Arizona?\n\nHarris and Walz's visit is trailing behind GOP vice presidential nominee JD Vance's most recent appearance in Arizona. Vance visited the state for the first time as former President Donald Trump's running-mate at Arizona Christian University in Glendale.\n\nVance also took a trip to the U.S.-Mexico border during his stop in the state.\n\nAt the rally, Vance said Harris is a \"phony\" and a \"San Francisco liberal.\"\n\n\"She has not received a single vote for president of the United States,\" Vance said July 31 in Glendale. \"The media calls it a coronation, I think we can call it a coup. And in America, we don't crown our leaders, we vote for them.\"\n\nWhat can I expect at Kamala Harris' visit on Friday?\n\nHarris and Walz will headline the rally that is Friday evening at Desert Diamond Arena in Glendale.\n\nThe campaign has not released details about the event, but The Arizona Republic reported that the arena can hold 19,300 people.

Wade.

They are facing a contentious race against Donald Trump. The former president lost Arizona by fewer than 11,000 votes four years ago but carried the state in 2016.\n\nThe Arizona campaign swing is Harris' first since becoming the Democratic nominee, and a new statewide poll shows her narrowly leading former President Donald Trump among likely voters. That's a shift from a month ago. Biden was falling behind Trump before he dropped out of the race.\n\n\"The energy level is just out of this world,\" said Paul Weich, an Arizona delegate to the Democratic National Convention. \"There's never been something like this.\"\n\nPolitical forecasters have taken notice: the nonpartisan Cook Political Report shifted Arizona's presidential race from \"lean Republican\" to a toss-up this week.\n\nHarris and Walz will gather supporters at Desert Diamond Arena in Glendale, a venue that can hold 19,300 people, according to arena operator ASM Global. Some of Arizona's top Democrats will be on hand for the event, including Attorney General Kris Mayes and Reps. Greg Stanton and Ruben Gallego.\n\nSen. Mark Kelly, who Harris considered for the vice president slot, is expected to attend. So is Arizona Democratic Party Chair Yolanda Bejarano. Gov. Katie Hobbs won't be there.\n\nSam Campana, the first woman mayor of Scottsdale, described the political moment as a \"sea change in attitude in Arizona.\" Campana is a lifelong Republican and recently joined a GOP coalition backing Harris and Walz in Arizona.\n\nBiden collapsed in Arizona polls after his disastrous debate performance in June, and even his own supporters worried that the state was slipping out of his grasp ahead of November. Now that there is a new candidate running against Trump, that anxiety has eased.\n\n\"People are just joyous,\" Campana said. \"People are so confident of the job that she can do that there's room for joy.\"\n\nThe visit will mark Harris' seventh trip to Arizona as vice president, and her first as the 2024 Democratic presidential nominee.\n\nAs Harris and Walz come to the state and introduce themselves as the new party leaders, Republicans are working quickly to define them in the minds of voters. Arizona Republican leaders, including GOP Senate nominee Kari Lake, held a press conference on Thursday to \"highlight the failed policies of Kamala Harris\" and other Democratic officials.\n\nTrump running mate JD Vance was in the state last week for a Glendale rally. Afterward, he traveled to the U.S.-Mexico border to attack Harris on immigration, an issue where Democrats tend to struggle with Arizona voters.\n\n\"It's hard to believe until you see it with your own eyes, just how bad the policies of the Kamala Harris administration have been,\" Vance said during the visit, dropping Biden's name from the current administration and seeking to pin the president's record on Harris.", "source": {"uri": "azcentral.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "AZ Central"}, "authors": [{"uri": "arizona_republic@azcentral.com", "name": "Arizona Republic", "type":

Tim Walz is set to speak alongside Vice President Kamala Harris in Arizona on Friday evening as part of a tour of several states with tight polls.\n\nThe Minnesota governor and nation's Vice President will rally at the Desert Diamond Arena in Glendale, Arizona, a venue with a capacity of 19,500. The appearance follows Wednesday rallies in Wisconsin and Michigan that campaign organizers say saw crowds of 12,000 and 15,000 respectively.\n\nThe event has already reached its capacity, according to an invitation. It's unclear whether the entire venue was made available to the campaign.\n\nDonald Trump carried Arizona in 2016 by more than a four-point margin, but lost the state to Joe Biden in 2020 by just over 10,000 votes. Despite Arizona leaning Republican in some of the latest polling, election forecasters at the Cook Political Report on Thursday called for a shift in momentum, calling Arizona a toss-up state.\n\nThough an exact time for the rally had not been set by Friday morning, Walz and Harris arrived at Phoenix's Sky Harbor International Airport on Thursday evening.\n\nProminent Arizona Democrats are expected to attend Friday's rally, including Sen. Mark Kelly (D-Ariz.), who Harris considered as an option for vice president. Arizona Gov. Katie Hobbs won't be in attendance, according to Phoenix news outlet Arizona Republic.\n\nFriday's rally will be Walz's fourth appearance alongside Harris since he was tapped to run alongside her on Tuesday. The duo have since appeared in Philadelphia; Eau Claire, Wisconsin; and Detroit.\n\nWalz is aware of the busy schedule that lies ahead, saying in Philadelphia on Tuesday: \"We've got 91 days [until Election Day].

Despite the loss, Kelly vowed to do all he could to support the Harris-Walz ticket.\n\nThe visit is also a good opportunity for Harris to win over Arizona voters who may be disillusioned with the Biden administration's border policies, according to Stacy Pearson, a Democratic political consultant.\n\n\"This is going to be a very optimistic message for Arizonans who have really been on the corner of Main and Main for this border crisis,\" Pearson told KTAR News 92.3 FM's Arizona's Morning News on Friday.\n\nHarris said she's happy to be in Arizona in a Friday morning post on social media.\n\n\"She's going to talk about what's possible and talk about what happens when she and Gov. Walz take control of the White House,\" Pearson said. \"It starts with passing the bipartisan border security deal that was crafted by an Arizona senator: Sen. Sinema.\"\n\nIn addition to tackling the border, Pearson expects Harris to discuss homelessness, LGBT rights, crime and other cogent issues.\n\nHarris may also discuss abortion. Her last trip to Arizona was for a reproductive freedom event in late June.\n\nThis rally is an opportunity for Harris to win over independents in the state as well, Pearson said.\n\nMany of the state's independents were lifelong Democrats who moved to Arizona from blue states like California, Oregon or Washington, she added.\n\n\"They were lifelong Democrats,\" Pearson said. \"They believe in marriage equality, but they're mad about homelessness. They're mad about traffic. They're mad about local crime and safety-related issues. And so they got here and they planted their flag as to not pledge allegiance to either party.\"\n\n\"Arizona is going to be a swing state, or a state that's in play, for the foreseeable future,\" Pearson said.\n\nIn Arizona, every vote will be critical. The state is no stranger to nail-biter races, including in 2020 when President Joe Biden bested Trump by fewer than 11,000 votes. Both parties are bracing for a similar photo finish this year.\n\nWhether Arizona will lean red or blue in the election isn't clear. Whether or not Harris can court independents to her side could change the tide, Pearson said.\n\nHowever, Harris' appeal has already been shown to cross political aisles in Arizona. Mesa Mayor John Giles, a Republican, pledged his support for her.\n\nAdditionally, her campaign launched an initiative called Republicans for Harris, which has several events planned in Arizona. Its purpose is to court those in the party who are disillusioned with former President Donald Trump.\n\nShe received a warm welcome to the Grand Canyon State ahead of her campaign stop in Glendale. Officials like Arizona Secretary of State Adrian Fontes, Phoenix Mayor Kate Gallego, Attorney General Kris Mayes and Rep. Greg Stanton greeted her on the tarmac.\n\nArizona was reliably Republican until Trump's combative approach to politics went national.\n\nIn 2016, Trump won Arizona, then quickly started feuding with the late Republican Sen. John McCain, a political icon in the state. That sparked a steady exodus of educated, moderate Republicans from the GOP and toward Democrats in top-of-the-ticket contests.\n\nIn 2018, Democrats won an open Senate race in the state, foreshadowing Kelly's 2020 win and Biden's victory there as well. In 2022, Kelly won again, and Democrats swept the top three statewide races for governor, attorney general and secretary of state, defeating Republican candidates who hewed to Trump's style and his lies about fraud costing him the 2020 presidential election.\n\nRecent polls show Harris is leading in Arizona over Trump.", "source": {"uri": "ktar.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "KTAR News"},

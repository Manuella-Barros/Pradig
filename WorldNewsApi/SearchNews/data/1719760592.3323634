Tied to its work on Responsible Innovation, Adobe commissioned the study to understand public perceptions and sentiment about the societal impact of generative AI and misinformation, including its implications within the context of the ongoing elections in India. Among the findings, the study highlights strong desire from consumers to have tools to verify the trustworthiness of digital content and the urgent need for proactive measures to address misinformation\u2019s potential impact on election integrity in the country. \u201cWe are excited about the potential for generative AI to enhance creativity and productivity, but it is also a transformational technology that demands thoughtful consideration of its societal impact. Our Future of Trust Study underscores the urgent need for media literacy campaigns to educate the consumers about the dangers of deepfakes and to empower them with tools to discern fact from fiction. With the ongoing elections, now is the time to embrace protective technologies like Content Credentials to rebuild trust in the digital ecosystem,\u201d says Prativa Mohapatra, Vice President & Managing Director, Adobe India.

Amidst a climate of eroding trust in digital content, Indians are concerned about protecting election integrity. \u00b7 In a year when over four billion people globally are expected to head to the polls, the study found that a significant number of Indians (86%) believe that misinformation and harmful deepfakes will impact future elections. \u00b7 Without widespread tools to help them decide whether the online content they are consuming is true, a significant number of Indians (82%) believe that election candidates should be prohibited from using generative AI in their promotional content. \u00b7 Most Indians (94%) believe that governments and technology companies should work together to protect election integrity against the detrimental effects of deepfakes and misinformation. Most Indians consider the credibility of a source before sharing content online but also believe that having the tools and media literacy skills to verify whether a content is true is important. \u00b7 Most Indians (92%) believe that it is essential that they have the right tools to verify if online content is trustworthy. \u00b7 In addition, high percentage of Indians (93%) agree that it is important to know if the content they are consuming is generated using AI. \u00b7 Concerns regarding misinformation are impacting how people think about its potential effect on children, with 94% of Indians saying that children should be taught media literacy skills as part of their school curriculum.

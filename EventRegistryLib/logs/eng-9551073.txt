Extending the personal income tax cuts will cost $3.8 trillion alone. Other tax cuts set to expire in 2025 include restrictions on the estate tax and valuable write-offs for small business owners.\n\nThe Congressional Budget Office's estimate, released Wednesday, is more than double the $1.9 trillion cost of the original Trump tax cuts -- a more expansive bill which also included permanent reductions in corporate taxes.\n\nThe anticipated cost of extending the tax cuts could move lawmakers to seek ways to offset the deficit impact through spending cuts or by scaling back the size of the rate reductions. President Joe Biden has proposed nearly $5 trillion worth of new tax hikes on businesses and high-earners. Presumptive Republican nominee Trump has pledged to renew the tax cuts, but hasn't released a specific tax plan.\n\nThe expiring portion of the tax cuts also includes reductions in individual tax rates and an expansion of the child tax credit. Last year, CBO estimated renewing the sunsetting tax cuts would cost $3.5 trillion.\n\nEconomic Growth\n\nSwagel said personal income tax cuts don't stimulate economic growth as much as the permanent business tax cuts.\n\nHe said that CBO raised its projection for this year's budget deficit upward from the $1.6 trillion estimate issued in February, approaching $2 trillion. The recently enacted $95 billion Ukraine, Israel and Taiwan aid package, an FDIC bank rescue and increased federal student loan forgiveness all are worsening the deficit outlook for the year and decade.\n\nSwagel said on Bloomberg Television's \"Balance of Power\" that the sooner lawmakers act to address deficits, the less painful spending cuts or tax increases will be.\n\n\"We know the current situation is not sustainable. But we don't know when that moment will come, when markets lose faith in the willingness of the United States to take on the deficit,\" he said.\n\nCBO in February said deficits would rise to $2.6 trillion by 2034. At that point, deficits would be above 6% of gross domestic product, a level reached only during World War II, the Great Recession and the 2020 pandemic. CBO also found that debt held by the public would rise by 2034 to 116% of GDP, the highest ever recorded.\n\nImmigration\n\nSwagel also addressed the economic effects of immigration, pointing to CBO research that found the influx of foreign workers is expected to boost GDP by about $7 trillion over the next decade by swelling the labor force and increasing demand.\n\nWhile those findings spurred a flurry of fresh number-crunching among Wall Street economists, prompting some to revise up their economic forecasts, Swagel said the impact from immigration on inflation has so far been limited.",

Other tax cuts set to expire in 2025 include restrictions on the estate tax and valuable write-offs for small business owners.\n\nThe Congressional Budget Office's estimate, released Wednesday, is more than double the $1.9 trillion cost of the original Trump tax cuts -- a more expansive bill which also included permanent reductions in corporate taxes.\n\nThe anticipated cost of extending the tax cuts could move lawmakers to seek ways to offset the deficit impact through spending cuts or by scaling back the size of the rate reductions.

Last year, the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) projected that extending policies set to expire next year would cost $3.5 trillion through 2033.\n\nThe new CBO report -- sought by U.S. Senate Budget Committee Chair Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.) and Senate Finance Committee Chair Ron Wyden (D-Ore.) -- says continuing the income, business, and estate tax cuts will now cost $4.6 trillion through 2034.\n\n\"The Republican tax plan is to double down on Trump's handouts to corporations and the wealthy, run the deficit into the stratosphere, and make it impossible to save Medicare and Social Security or help families with the cost of living in America.\"\n\nResponding in a statement Wednesday, the senators cited an Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy (ITEP) estimate that \"extending the Trump tax cuts would create a $112.6 billion windfall for the top 5% of income earners in the first year alone.\"\n\nThey also slammed their GOP colleagues, who Whitehouse said \"are awfully eager to shield their megadonors from paying taxes.\"\n\nHe recalled that just last year, \"Republicans held our entire economy hostage,\" refusing to raise the debt ceiling and risking the first-ever U.S. default, because they didn't want the Internal Revenue Service to get more funding to \"go after wealthy tax cheats.\"\n\n\"Remember the Trump tax scam cutting taxes for billionaires and big corporations,\" Whitehouse continued. \"Now they're set on extending those tax cuts, even though it would blow up the deficit. The Trump tax cuts were a gift to the ultrarich and a rotten deal for American families and small businesses. With their impending expiration, we have a chance to undo the damage, fix our corrupted tax code, and have big corporations and the ultrawealthy begin to pay their fair share.\"\n\nWyden similarly took aim at the GOP, warning that \"the Republican tax plan is to double down on Trump's handouts to corporations and the wealthy, run the deficit into the stratosphere, and make it impossible to save Medicare and Social Security or help families with the cost of living in America.\"\n\n\"Republicans have planned all along on making Trump's tax handouts to the rich permanent, but they hid the true cost with timing gimmicks and a 2025 deadline that threatens the middle class with an automatic tax hike if they don't get what they want,\" he argued. \"In short, they're focused on helping the rich get richer, and everybody else can go pound sand. Democrats are going to stand by our commitment to protect the middle class while ensuring that corporations and the wealthy pay a fair share.\"\n\nA new CBO report estimates that extending the Trump tax cuts for the next 10 years would add $4.6 trillion to the deficit.\\n\\nRemember this the next time Republicans propose cuts to Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid. \\n\\nThe \"party of fiscal responsibility\" is full of it.\n\n-- (@)\n\nGroundwork Collaborative executive director Lindsay Owens also responded critically to the CBO report, saying Wednesday that \"extending Trump's tax law and effectively subsidizing corporate profiteering and billionaire wealth is a nonstarter.\"\n\n\"This tax law, on top of decades of failed trickle-down cuts, has come at the expense of workers and families,\" Owens stressed. \"We can't afford 10 more years of giveaways to the wealthy and corporations and fail to invest in the people who drive our economy. This tax law should expire.\"\n\nWhile some of the tax cuts in the 2017 law are temporary -- unless they get extended -- the legislation permanently slashed the statutory corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%.

Interest costs would also rise, with net interest outlays rising by $467 billion over a decade.\n\nThe 2017 tax law also included provisions cutting taxes on estates, gifts, investments and some types of small business income; extending those cuts would cost $717 billion, plus another $138 billion for interest.\n\nTallying it up (the table from the CBO report showing the breakdown of the costs is below) and the total cost comes to roughly $4.6 trillion.\n\nFraming the debate: Democrats have long complained that the Trump tax cuts were fiscally irresponsible and tilted toward the wealthy, and President Biden has vowed to let them expire. \"By the way, that tax credit of his expires next year,\" he said in April, referring to Trump. \"Well, let me tell you something: It's going to stay expired and dead forever if I'm reelected.\"\n\nHowever, Biden has also vowed not to raise taxes on anyone making less than $400,000 a year, and it's not clear how he will square that pledge with his stated goal of letting the individual tax cuts expire. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen recently told lawmakers that the president intends to allow the 2017 tax cuts to continue for families earning less than $400,000, with the revenue losses to be made up by as yet unspecified tax increases in other areas.\n\nSenate Budget Committee Chair Sheldon Whitehouse echoed Biden's call for letting the tax cuts expire. \"Remember the Trump tax scam cutting taxes for billionaires and big corporations. Now they're set on extending those tax cuts, even though it would blow up the deficit,\" he said in a statement Wednesday. \"The Trump tax cuts were a gift to the ultrarich and a rotten deal for American families and small businesses. With their impending expiration, we have a chance to undo the damage, fix our corrupted tax code, and have big corporations and the ultra-wealthy begin to pay their fair share.\"\n\nRepublicans continue to defend the tax cuts while promising to extend them. In a statement, Ways and Means Committee Chairman Jason Smith and House Budget Committee Chairman Jodey Arrington pushed back against the CBO report, claiming the agency's \"track record in predicting the economic and fiscal outcome of the 2017 Trump tax cuts is poor to say the least.\"\n\n\"The truth is, the Trump tax cuts resulted in economic growth that was a full percentage point above CBO's forecast, and federal revenues far outpaced the agency's predictions,\" they said. \"Republicans believe working families do not need the IRS taking any more out of their pockets ...\"\n\nThe bottom line: Extending the Trump tax cuts would be enormously costly in budgetary terms, but you can expect to see a serious effort to do so next year, if not sooner.", "source": {"uri": "finance.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo!

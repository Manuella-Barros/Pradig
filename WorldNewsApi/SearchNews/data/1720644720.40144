When we find a gap in our collection, we reach out to the public for material that can be loaned for an exhibition.\u201d The museum\u2019s current exhibition, Chariots of Fire: A History of Windsor\u2019s Firefighting Equipment, was developed by guest curators, Walter McCall and Jeff Topliffe. It explores the history of the Windsor Fire Department through historical photographs, firefighting equipment, badges, and other unique items rarely seen by the public. \u201cBy exploring these topics, we\u2019re able to learn about our past as a community,\u201d said Capacchione. \u201cThis in turn can help guide our community into the future.\u201d", "summary": "History enthusiasts in Windsor-Essex will find a wealth of opportunities to explore the region&#8217;s rich culture throughout the month of June.

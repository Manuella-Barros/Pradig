She also acknowledged that the street value of the addictive painkiller she prescribed totaled more than $2 million.\n\nFranklin was indicted in March of 2016 alongside two other doctors and seven others -- all of whom were accused of running a large-scale pill operation that grossed $5.7 million. Doctors wrote prescriptions for more than 1 million pills that were not medically necessary with the help of patient recruiters and marketers, the indictment said.\n\nRead more:\n\nTragic toll: Drug overdose deaths quadruple in Michigan\n\nPharmacist from Rochester Hills sentenced on drug, fraud charges\n\nAccording to the U.S. Attorneys office, nine defendants have pleaded guilty to their roles in the scheme, including the alleged ringleader: Dr. Boris Zigmond, 51, of West Bloomfield, a chiropractor who did not see patients himself or write prescriptions but rather used \"marketers\" or \"patient recruiters\" to pull off the scheme.\n\nDr. Carlos Godoy, 79, of Farmington Hills, also pleaded guilty to his role in the scheme.\n\nAccording to the indictment, Zigmond set up office suites in several different locations in Oak Park, where Franklin and Godoy would see fake patients and write the prescriptions. In return, Zigmond paid the doctors money.\n\nAs part of their plea agreements, all three doctors face up to 20 years in prison when they are sentenced in December.\n\nAuthorities said the case highlights what continues to be a growing problem in America and in Michigan, where, they say, oxycodone continues to be a contributing factor to the Opiod epidemic that is facing the state.\n\n\"More people die from overdoses of prescription drugs in America than from overdoses of all other drugs combined,\" Acting U.S. Attorney Daniel Lemisch said in a statement. \"We hope that prosecuting the doctors who are putting these drugs on the streets will deter others from contributing to this epidemic.\"\n\nFranklin's attorney was not available for comment. It is not known why she decided to cut a deal with the government, rather than go to trial.\n\nTresa Baldas can be contacted at tbaldas@freepress.com.

A Lansing man recently shared the photos in a Facebook post that's been shared more than 4,000 times as of Wednesday.\n\nOne photo shows VanArsdale raising his hand in a Nazi salute, and the other photo shows a swastika drawn on his forehead.\n\nRead more:\n\nDeVos decries 'racial bigots' in white nationalist movement\n\nMSU denies request from white supremacist group headed by Richard Spencer\n\nThe photos have resulted in death threats and messages calling VanArsdale a racist and a Nazi. He said he assumed the photos began circulating this week because of nationwide outrage about a protest in Charlottesville, Virginia, that included white supremacists, neo-Nazis and Ku Klux Klan members.\n\n\"The climate that happened in Virginia over last weekend, I'm getting lumped into that,\" VanArsdale said. \"... Last weekend kicked off and now all of a sudden, people are paying attention. It's a witch hunt now.\"\n\nThe photos have also resulted in calls to boycott his business, Craft Draft 2 Go. The business was vandalized Wednesday with anti-fascist rhetoric. He is closing it for now, citing safety reasons.\n\nVanArsdale said some workers quit because they were either afraid to come into work or didn't want to be associated with assertions of being a white supremacist.\n\n\"I don't plan on going back to Kalamazoo,\" he said. \"You're run out of the city.\"\n\nVanArsdale said the photos were taken in humor but that he believes in equality.\n\n\"I'm not a Nazi. I'm not a fascist. I'm not a white supremacist,\" he said. \"My pictures were inappropriate, that's for sure. They were meant in jest but definitely bad humor, bad decision. I own up to that.\"\n\nCONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORERead or Share this story: http://on.freep.com/2x8EePH", "date": "2017-08-17", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Internet/On_the_Web",

Wayne County prosecutors have pledged to appeal.\n\nFor decades, Phillips, now 71, has declared his innocence in the fatal shooting of Gregory Harris. He was convicted largely on the testimony of a trial witness who has since died.\n\nRead more:\n\nA family's anguish: What drove Marine recruit Raheel Siddiqui to jump to his death?\n\n3 arrested after drone drops drugs, cell phone at Michigan prison\n\nBut now he's been cleared in a remarkable way. Richard Palombo, a co-defendant at the 1972 trial, admitted his role in the fatal shooting during a parole board hearing in 2010. Palombo also repeatedly said Phillips wasn't present.\n\n\"All I can tell you about Mr. Phillips is I met him on July 4, 1971. It was eight days after the murder,\" Palombo told the board.\n\nFour years after that testimony, in 2014, the Innocence Clinic at University of Michigan law school learned what Palombo had said and ordered a transcript. The clinic also informed Phillips.\n\n\"He was shocked. He had spent 43 years at the time believing Palombo was as innocent as he was,\" said clinic director David Moran.\n\nMoran said he had to rule out any possible collusion between Phillips and Palombo. He learned they had never been housed in the same prison or exchanged letters.\n\nJudge Kevin Cox said he's satisfied that Palombo's detailed testimony at the parole board was newly discovered evidence.\n\n\"Defendant is granted a new trial,\" the judge wrote on Aug. 8.\n\nCox's decision will be appealed. A spokeswoman for the prosecutor's office, Maria Miller, said Palombo's testimony is hearsay and can't be admitted as evidence. The next hearing is Aug. 25.\n\nProfessors and students at Michigan law school have exonerated or helped free more than a dozen people since 2009 by exposing bad police work, finding new witnesses and tapping specialists.\n\n\"This is certainly the oldest case we've accepted by far,\" Moran said.\n\nCONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORERead or Share this story: http://on.freep.com/2x9gRFM", "date": "2017-08-17", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Reference/Education/Colleges_and_Universities", "wgt": 100, "id": 143, "label": "dmoz/Reference/Education/Colleges and Universities"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "wgt": 100, "id": 449, "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice"}], "concepts": [{"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Detroit"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detroit", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Detroit"}, "type": "loc", "id": "210760"}, {"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Michigan"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michigan", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Michigan"}, "type": "loc", "id": "211294"}, {"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Wayne County"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wayne_County,_Michigan", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Wayne County"}, "type": "loc", "id": "211754"}, {"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Cedar Point"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cedar_Point", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cedar Point"}, "type": "loc", "id": "219132"}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sport_utility_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "302580", "label": {"eng": "Sport utility vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parole", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "302585", "label": {"eng": "Parole"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marathon", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "302855", "label": {"eng": "Marathon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roller_coaster", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "305386", "label": {"eng": "Roller coaster"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_substance", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "305531", "label": {"eng": "Chemical substance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_supremacy", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "305969", "label": {"eng": "White supremacy"}}, {"location": null, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metro_Detroit", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Metro Detroit"}, "type": "loc", "id": "323690"}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detroit_Free_Press", "type": "org", "score": 5, "id": "326628", "label": {"eng": "Detroit Free Press"}}, {"location": null, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Downtown_Detroit", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Downtown Detroit"}, "type": "loc", "id": "329091"}, {"location": null, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michigan_State_University", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Michigan State University"}, "type": "loc", "id": "335899"}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detroit_Metropolitan_Wayne_County_Airport", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "392764", "label": {"eng": "Detroit Metropolitan Wayne County Airport"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supremacism", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "415285", "label": {"eng": "Supremacism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Michigan_Law_School", "type": "org", "score": 2, "id": "463471", "label": {"eng": "University of Michigan Law School"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dodge_Durango", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "466286", "label": {"eng": "Dodge Durango"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chrysler_Hemi_engine", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "527239", "label": {"eng": "Chrysler Hemi engine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Policy_Institute", "type": "org", "score": 3, "id": "587418", "label": {"eng": "National Policy Institute"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Michigan", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "608619", "label": {"eng": "History of Michigan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maria_Miller", "type": "person", "score": 1, "id": "619004", "label": {"eng": "Maria Miller"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northwest_Airlines_Flight_255", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "793322", "label": {"eng": "Northwest Airlines Flight 255"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_sole_survivors_of_airline_accidents_or_incidents", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "793323", "label": {"eng": "List of sole survivors of airline accidents or incidents"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_B._Spencer", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "937971", "label": {"eng": "Richard B.

Lee\" name from the Lowell showboat.\n\nThe name has been on four ships docked to the city's river side in that location for decades but now that a new ship is being built to replace the existing one, the city wants a fresh start.\n\n\"While most of West Michigan refers to it simply as the Lowell showboat, we recognize that the name (Robert E. Lee) is offensive to many,\" Burns said in a prepared statement.\n\nThe city's move comes after a change.org petition was filed by Michigan State University student and former Lowell resident Brandon Lee.\n\nMore: Critics call on Dearborn to get rid of Orville Hubbard statue\n\nRochelle Riley: We must act after Trump chooses to defend bigots\n\nLee indicated to us he wanted the name to come down before October 12th. Lee, the commander of the Confederate Army, died on October 12, 1870.\n\n\"As it stands today, the Lowell Showboat is a Confederate monument and a testament to the subtle, but insidious, realities of racism and white privilege,\" Lee said.\n\nThe city owns the showboat and does not fly a confederate flag.\n\nLiz Baker at the Lowell Area Chamber of Commerce said the Robert E. Lee name was put on the showboat, not as a celebration of the Confederate army, but to create a replica of the ships that used to sail up and down the Mississippi River.\n\nBaker and Burns indicated they expect to name the new boat something else.\n\n\"We have received a grant from the State of Michigan to build a new Showboat,\" Burns wrote. \"For much of this year, a committee has been considering new names for the boat, which we expect to begin building next year.\"\n\nMany people walking near the showboat today in Lowell during Lowell's Pink Arrow Community Day think it's a non-issue and say they know the ship as the Lowell showboat and not the \"Robert E. Lee.\"\n\nCONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORERead or Share this story: http://on.freep.com/2weSv0y", "date": "2017-08-17", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Reference/Education/Colleges_and_Universities", "wgt": 100, "id": 143, "label": "dmoz/Reference/Education/Colleges and Universities"}], "concepts": [{"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dearborn"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dearborn,_Michigan", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dearborn"}, "type": "loc", "id": "210744"}, {"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Detroit"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detroit", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Detroit"}, "type": "loc", "id": "210760"}, {"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Lowell"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lowell,_Michigan", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lowell"}, "type": "loc", "id": "211206"}, {"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Michigan"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michigan", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Michigan"}, "type": "loc", "id": "211294"}, {"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Cedar Point"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cedar_Point", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cedar Point"}, "type": "loc", "id": "219132"}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sport_utility_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "302580", "label": {"eng": "Sport utility vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marathon", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "302855", "label": {"eng": "Marathon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "302940", "label": {"eng": "Racism"}}, {"location": null, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mississippi_River", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mississippi River"}, "type": "loc", "id": "303818"}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roller_coaster", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "305386", "label": {"eng": "Roller coaster"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_substance", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "305531", "label": {"eng": "Chemical substance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confederate_States_of_America", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "305960", "label": {"eng": "Confederate States of America"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_supremacy", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "305969", "label": {"eng": "White supremacy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Change.org", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "306410", "label": {"eng": "Change.org"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petition", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "306865", "label": {"eng": "Petition"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_privilege", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "318254", "label": {"eng": "White privilege"}}, {"location": null, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metro_Detroit", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Metro Detroit"}, "type": "loc", "id": "323690"}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detroit_Free_Press", "type": "org", "score": 5, "id": "326628", "label": {"eng": "Detroit Free Press"}}, {"location": null, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Downtown_Detroit", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Downtown Detroit"}, "type": "loc", "id": "329091"}, {"location": null, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michigan_State_University", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Michigan State University"}, "type": "loc", "id": "335899"}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flags_of_the_Confederate_States_of_America", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "354872", "label": {"eng": "Flags of the Confederate States of America"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_E._Lee", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "360432", "label": {"eng": "Robert E.

A judge sentenced Schmitz to 25-50 years in prison for second-degree murder.\n\nThe case in Oakland County Circuit Court garnered national attention and put a spotlight on the tactics and motives of television talk shows.\n\nMichigan Department of Corrections spokeswoman Holly Kramer said Schmitz is expected to be released from the Parnall Correctional Facility in Jackson next week, but she didn't give the exact date.\n\nRead more:\n\n'White Boy Rick' to get out of Michigan prison but freedom may take years\n\nOak Park doctor pleads guilty: I made $200K putting $2 million in pain pills on the street\n\nSchmitz interviewed with a member of the Michigan Parole Board in March and a three-member panel made the decision to parole him in April, she said.\n\nFrank Amedure Jr., Scott's older brother, recently spoke to the Oakland Press and said he'd like to know how Schmitz feels about what he did.\n\n\"This was hard on the whole family,\" he told the Oakland Press. \"This practically ruined my life and my family's life.\"\n\nA relative of Schmitz declined to comment when reached by the Free Press today.\n\nShortly after jurors returned a verdict in 1996, they said the talk show was a catalyst for the murder. The show -- and Amedure -- deceived Schmitz into thinking his admirer was a woman, the jurors said.\n\nSchmitz, a heterosexual, shot Amedure, who was gay, three days after Amedure revealed his crush.\n\nSchmitz called 911 after the murder and told an operator he did it because Amedure put him on the show.\n\nSchmitz's attorneys have said their client was fighting alcoholism and depression and the show ambushed him. Prosecutors and gay rights activists contended the killing was motivated by Schmitz's hostility toward gays.\n\nAfter the criminal trial, a jury awarded Amedure's family a $25-million judgment against the \"Jenny Jones\" talk show and Warner Bros., but the award was overturned by the Michigan Court of Appeals.\n\n1 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORERead or Share this story: http://on.freep.com/2wf1Q8D", "date": "2017-08-17", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "wgt": 100, "id": 449, "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Radio/Formats", "wgt": 100, "id": 596, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Radio/Formats"}], "concepts": [{"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Detroit"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detroit", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Detroit"}, "type": "loc", "id": "210760"}, {"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Michigan"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michigan", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Michigan"}, "type": "loc", "id": "211294"}, {"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Oakland County"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oakland_County,_Michigan", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Oakland County"}, "type": "loc", "id": "211385"}, {"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Cedar Point"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cedar_Point", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cedar Point"}, "type": "loc", "id": "219132"}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sport_utility_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "302580", "label": {"eng": "Sport utility vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marathon", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "302855", "label": {"eng": "Marathon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prison", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "304758", "label": {"eng": "Prison"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roller_coaster", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "305386", "label": {"eng": "Roller coaster"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_supremacy", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "305969", "label": {"eng": "White supremacy"}}, {"location": null, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metro_Detroit", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Metro Detroit"}, "type": "loc", "id": "323690"}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detroit_Free_Press", "type": "org", "score": 5, "id": "326628", "label": {"eng": "Detroit Free Press"}}, {"location": null, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Downtown_Detroit", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Downtown Detroit"}, "type": "loc", "id": "329091"}, {"location": null, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michigan_State_University", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Michigan State University"}, "type": "loc", "id": "335899"}, {"location": null, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michigan_Department_of_Corrections", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Michigan Department of Corrections"}, "type": "loc", "id": "362247"}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detroit_Metropolitan_Wayne_County_Airport", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "392764", "label": {"eng": "Detroit Metropolitan Wayne County Airport"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supremacism", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "415285", "label": {"eng": "Supremacism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dodge_Durango", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "466286", "label": {"eng": "Dodge Durango"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chrysler_Hemi_engine", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "527239", "label": {"eng": "Chrysler Hemi engine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Policy_Institute", "type": "org", "score": 3, "id": "587418", "label": {"eng": "National Policy Institute"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northwest_Airlines_Flight_255", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "793322", "label": {"eng": "Northwest Airlines Flight 255"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_sole_survivors_of_airline_accidents_or_incidents", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "793323", "label": {"eng": "List of sole survivors of airline accidents or incidents"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_B._Spencer", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "937971", "label": {"eng": "Richard B.

But now is fine.\n\nThat's at least how long the City of Detroit has been asking the state Legislature to require suburban employers to withhold city income tax from the paychecks of employees who are Detroit residents, and at least how long the Legislature has been saying no.\n\nThis legislative truculence is one of those things that defies common sense.\n\nDetroit Mayor Mike Duggan said in an interview late last month that he believes a compromise bill could pass this fall, in part because the city has reached a compromise with the Michigan Chamber of Commerce, a big-spending, pro-business group that proudly proclaims its effectiveness as a lobbying organization, blocked the measure in past legislative sessions.\n\nDetroit residents, whether employed in the city or the suburbs, pay a 2.4% income tax. Non-residents who work in the city are also obligated to pay, at a lower rate of 1.2%.\n\nBecause Detroit employers are required to withhold income tax from employees' pay, the city gets almost all of the money it's owed.\n\nKaffer: Trouble ahead for the Michigan budget\n\nEditorial: Detroit election must focus on change voters want\n\nNot so in the suburbs, where city tax withholding is left entirely to the employer's -- and the employee's -- discretion. Some employers opt to withhold city tax, but not all. With tax withholding required, the city could expect to collect between $10 million and $20 million a year.\n\nThe city and the chamber are still working on the details, but the compromise would allow suburban employers to withhold on a voluntary basis, but require their Detroit-resident workers to submit to tax withholding, said Richard Studley, president and CEO of the Michigan Chamber.\n\nEmployers, as a matter of course, withhold payroll taxes from workers' checks -- federal and state tax, Social Security tax -- along with other payments, like insurance premiums or union dues or parking fees or retirement account contributions. Requiring suburban employers to withhold city tax only requires those businesses to what they're doing already, for a host of other causes.\n\nIt's not just a few more Detroiters who work outside the city, it's a lot -- 113,449 Detroiters, nearly two-thirds of working city dwellers, work in the suburbs, according to U.S. Census data, compared to 58,738 employed inside the city.\n\nBecause their employers aren't required to withhold city income tax from their paychecks, the burden of estimating, filing (until recently, e-filing wasn't an option) and paying city taxes is placed on individuals.\n\nWhen Detroiters \"who and work are employed in the suburbs, and they have zero withholding, you send them a bill in April and then they've got to write an $800 check ...\" Duggan said. \"For a lot of our residents, writing an $800 check is not realistic.\"\n\nDuggan said he thinks the compromise would significantly improve the city's income tax collection.\n\nReally, any little bit helps.\n\nRequiring universal tax withholding, however, is still off the table, Studley said.\n\nRequiring mandatory tax withholding \"would impose a substantial administrative burden on businesses who receive no services from the city,\" Studley said, as well as subject those employers to the possibility that Detroit might audit them to ensure they're doing what they ought.\n\nBusiness Leaders for Michigan, another prominent business group, hasn't taken a position on the proposed legislation, a spokeswoman said. The Detroit Regional Chamber would support universal withholding, said President and CEO Sandy Baruah, noting that the city is \"rightly owed\" those taxes, provided any proposed legislation would create an exception for small employers.\n\nBecause the compromise the chamber and the city are still negotiating is voluntary, but offers suburban employers who choose to participate the authority to require Detroiters they employ to have city tax withheld, it's acceptable, Studley said.\n\nRequiring employers to withhold, Studley said, \"probably could and would have had the unintended consequence of stopping some suburban employers from hiring Detroit residents, and obviously we didn't want to see that.\"\n\nAnother key provision of the compromise, said Dan Papineau, the state chamber's director of tax policy, would allow the city to seize state tax refunds to satisfy unpaid city income tax.\n\nFor a broke city, this is what we call \"low-hanging fruit,\" the kind of thing that should have been done at the instant the problem was identified.\n\nThe city and the chamber hope a final draft of the compromise can be reached in time for the Legislature to consider this fall.\n\nHopefully, it won't take another six years.\n\nCONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORERead or Share this story: http://on.freep.com/2wSYaH4", "date": "2017-08-17", "categories": [{"uri":

For example, coal cinders that were dumped in the river when ships unloaded near Algonac, Michigan are used as spawning sites,\" the informational form reads.\n\nRoseman said that the sturgeon are considered \"broadcast spawners.\" He compared the process to a handful of marbles being tossed onto the ground. He said the spawning reef has to have interstitial spaces, or cavities, where the eggs can settle and incubate, and where they can be protected from predators and getting washed away.\n\nLake sturgeon, which have horny scutes instead of scales, can grow up to 7 feet in length and 300 pounds, and females live 80 to 150 years while males live an average of 55 years, according to informational literature from the St. Clair-Detroit River System Initiative.\n\n\"They're a good part of the historic Great Lakes fish community,\" Roseman said. \"The Great Lakes were formed and these fish kind of evolved with the lakes.\"\n\nContact Hasan Dudar at hdudar@freepress.com.\n\nCONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORERead or Share this story: http://on.freep.com/2x8Xk8b", "date":

Handcuffs came out. A lawsuit followed.\n\nIn a unique free-speech case unfolding in federal court in Detroit, a Jackson man is suing a police officer, claiming he was unlawfully arrested for hurling F-bombs at the officer during an animal complaint investigation in 2015.\n\nAccording to the suit, the plaintiff -- 45-year-old Tracy Smith -- went on a cussing tirade, telling the officer \"Fuck you\" several times.\n\nThe officer told him to stop swearing because there were children nearby, and warned he could be arrested for disorderly conduct.\n\nSmith responded: \"Fuck you. Fuck you. Fuck you.\"\n\nHe ended up in jail.\n\nThe officer ended up in federal court, accused of violating Smith's free speech rights in a classic First Amendment case that once again tests the limits of freedom of expression.\n\nRelated:\n\nFeds: Hold your tongue! Threats are not free speech\n\nStudent group sues Macomb college over free speech policy\n\n\"While the particular four-letter word being litigated here is perhaps more distatsteful than most others of its genre, it is neverthelss often true that one man's vulgarity is another's lyric, and our law has clearly established this word as constitutionally protected speech,\" Smith's lawyer, Robert Gaecke Jr. wrote in the lawsuit filed Thursday in U.S. District Court.\n\nGaecke stressed that people have \"the right to be free from retaliatory arrest after verbally challenging police.\"\n\nIf case law is any indication, cussers have had a leading edge on this issue.\n\nIn 2002, the Michigan Court of Appeals ruled in favor of the so-called \"cussing canoeist\" -- a Roseville man who was ticketed after spewing a few choice words within earshot of a family after capsizing into a river. He was ticketed under a century-old state law barring foul language in front of women and children, but the appeals court struck down that law on free speech grounds.\n\nIn 2004, the Michigan appeals court struck down another cursing statute that prohibited swearing in front of children, saying it was unconstitutionally vague.\n\nThen in 2016 came Smith's F-bomb tirade over the dog poop interrogation. Again, the courts sided with the cusser, concluding the officer had no probable cause to arrest Smith.\n\nIn his lawsuit, Smith claims that the officer crossed a line on a number of fronts: The officer ordered him to stop swearing; used excessive force; locked him up for two days, and charged him with a crime that was ultimately dismissed.\n\nThe defendant in the case is Officer Thomas Tinklepaugh. As of Thursday afternoon, he had not yet been served with the lawsuit. He could not be reached for comment. The Free Press left messages for him and the Jackson police chief.\n\nAccording to the lawsuit, here is what transpired in 2015 when Tinklepaugh showed up on Smith's doorstep to investigate a dog complaint.\n\nOn Aug. 19, 2015, a woman called Jackson police about a dog that was defecating on open lots in the neighborhood, attracting mice to her home. She claimed the dog's owner was letting this happen and described the owner as Smith.\n\nTinklepaugh, the responding officer, went to Smith's house, where he met Smith's wife in the driveway. As the two talked, Smith emerged from the house and started taking pictures of the officer and his wife talking.\n\nTinklepaugh was recording his interaction with the couple, too, through his body microphone and dash cam video. This is some of what the audio captured as the parties discussed dog feces that doesn't get picked up.\n\nSmith: \"I'm tired of this shit.\"\n\nTinklepaugh: \"Have I ever met you before? Sir? Have I ever had a conversation with you before? So why the hostility towards me?\"\n\nSmith's wife: \"Tracy, be nice.\"\n\nDuring the conversation, the officer learned that the Smiths were worried about drug activity in the neighborhood. Tinklepaugh expressed interest in helping.\n\nTinklepaugh: \"If you would have came to me and told me with that without starting out with 'fuck you, get off my property,' we probably could have had a decent conversation.\"\n\nSmith: \"Well, fuck you.\"\n\nConversation continued.\n\nAbout a minute later, Tinklepaugh said: \"Will you stop swearing in front of these ... and the children, please, otherwise you're going to be charged with being disorderly.\"\n\nSmith: \"Fuck you. Fuck you. Fuck you.\"\n\nMrs. Smith: \"Please.\"\n\nTinklepaugh: \"Turn around and put your hands behind your back ... Put your hands behind your back now.\"\n\nAccording to the lawsuit, dash cam video shows Tinklepaugh slamming Smith backwards on the hood of the scout car. A struggle follows.\n\nSmith was tackled to the ground, handcuffed and jailed, the suit said. He was later transported to a hospital for emergency medical treatment for injuries inflicted by Tinklepaugh, the suit said. It doesn't say what the injuries were.\n\nSmith was jailed for two days and released on bond. He was charged with one felony count of assaulting-resisting-obstructing a police officer.\n\nAccording to the lawsuit, Tinklepaugh, trying to justify his actions, initially indicated that he arrested Smith \"for swearing in front of the children.\" But he changed his story after learning that Michigan's indecency statute that banned swearing in front of kids had been struck down in 2004.\n\nAt a preliminary examination, Tinklepaugh testified -- and the prosecutor argued -- that he arrested Smith \"for being a disorderly person by 'causing a contention,' \" the lawsuit states.\n\nOn Nov. 16, 2015, a district court refused to bind the case over to trial, concluding no probable cause for arrest existed.\n\nThe felony charge was dismissed. The prosecutor appealed, claiming there was probable cause to arrest Smith -- not because of his foul language, but because he allegedly interfered with the dog investigation and was loud, in violation of the city's noise ordinance.\n\nThe 4th Circuit Court -- a lower appeals court -- rejected all those arguments, the lawsuit said. The prosecutor appealed again, but the Michigan Court of Appeals refused to hear the case.\n\nJackson County Prosecutor Jerard Jarzynka could not be reached for comment.\n\nSmith, meanwhile, is seeking an undisclosed amount of damages from Tinklepaugh. As his lawsuit states, he wants Tinklepaugh to pay for arresting him without cause, jailing him, pursuing charges against him -- all because he challenged him with a four-letter swear word.\n\nContact

It's his one shot.\"\n\nRelated:\n\nKwame Kilpatrick won't get break from prison after all\n\nRochelle Riley: Carlita Kilpatrick begins her own new life\n\nSo if it seems like Kilpatrick has been dishing on his longtime attorney, James Thomas, a lot lately - it's because he has to, Henning said.\n\n\"The burden is on him. It's a civil suit - interestingly enough - and he is the plaintiff,\" Henning said. \"In essence, this puts Jim Thomas on trial.\"\n\nHenning, however, believes that Kilpatrick's ineffective-lawyer claim will be \"very difficult\" to win, \"even harder than his appeal.\"\n\nThomas, a high-profile defense attorney who represented Kilpatrick during the text message scandal and federal racketeering trial, was not available for comment. In the past, he has defended his commitment to Kilpatrick and has noted that he did ask to withdraw as his lawyer, but that U.S. District Judge Nancy Edmunds denied his request.\n\nKilpatrick, meanwhile, has long argued that he was wrongfully convicted of multiple corruption crimes, claiming prosecutors never proved he engaged in any criminal behavior or manipulated contracts that cost the city millions in losses.\n\n[In March, former U.S. Attorney Barbara McQuade told the Free Press Kilpatrick could've had it a lot worse. Tap to read her candid interview.]\n\nTo date, Kilpatrick has lost all his appeals, and this year, the U.S. Supreme Court declined to hear his case. But his appeals were based on what happened during trial and challenged his conviction.\n\nNow, Kilpatrick is focusing on what happened outside trial, particularly with his lawyer, as he aims to convince the judge that Thomas wronged him before and during trial and should never have been allowed to represent him.\n\nLast month, for example, Kilpatrick claimed in a court filing that he tried to beat up Thomas right before jury selection over a disagreement, but that Thomas ran around a conference table, threatened to call police and have him locked up for the duration of trial.\n\nThomas said no such incident took place.\n\nNow, Kilpatrick is claiming in a new filing that Thomas refused to hire a Washington, D.C., attorney who he believes could have helped him prepare for trial. In a Tuesday filing, he wrote that Thomas allegedly told him, \" 'Yeah, I spoke to that guy in D.C. He can't help us. ' This was a lie.\"\n\nKilpatrick is also claiming that Thomas performed poorly during trial and failed to vigorously defend him against bribery allegations and claims that he used the Kilpatrick Civic Fund for personal expenses and only reimbursed the fund because he was forced to do so.\n\nDuring trial, prosecutors argued that Kilpatrick used the civic fund as a personal piggy bank, writing civic fund checks for everything from yoga lessons and luxury vacations to spy gadgets and golf clubs. The fund was supposed to help improve Detroit neighborhoods and educate voters. They also claimed that a subpoena forced Kilpatrick to reimburse the civic fund.\n\nKilpatrick argues there was no such subpoena, but jurors never heard that.\n\n\"(Thomas) was absolutely silent during this moment in trial,\" Kilpatrick wrote, noting a witness who could have proven this wasn't true was stricken with a debilitating illness that left her unable to speak and partially paralyzed, so she couldn't testify.\n\n\"Although she could have testified to some very important matters, (Thomas) made sure that he never raised her name, his relationship with her, nor her involvement with the KCF,\" Kilpatrick wrote.\n\nAccording to the court filing, the witness who could have helped Kilpatrick was an attorney who worked in Thomas's office. He said Thomas got that lawyer a job with the Kilpatrick Civic Fund in 2008, but without Kilpatrick's input or permission. That lawyer, according to the filing, found some questionable civic fund expenses and suggested that the money be given back to the fund.\n\nKilpatrick said he did reimburse the civic fund $13,027 for his personal expenses without any subpoena, and that Thomas knew that, but never let the jury know.\n\nEdmunds, meanwhile, concluded at the start of trial that Thomas had been a good and effective lawyer to Kilpatrick, and denied his request to withdraw from the case. She also noted that Thomas was Kilpatrick's attorney of choice, and that he had once professed his love for him.\n\n\"When Mr. Kilpatrick ran out of money, he asked me to appoint Mr. Thomas, which I did,\" Edmunds said in court, reminding Kilpatrick that, at a recent meeting in her chambers, when a conflict of interest issue was being discussed, \"The first thing out of your mouth was how much you love Mr. Thomas.\"\n\nKilpatrick responded: \"I do love Mr. Thomas. I never said I trusted him.\"\n\nTwo months after the guilty verdict, Kilpatrick officially dumped Thomas.\n\nThomas agreed that it was time for him to step down.\n\nTresa Baldas can be reached at tbaldas@freepress.com.

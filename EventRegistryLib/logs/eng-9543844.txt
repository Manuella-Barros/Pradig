After filing for bankruptcy in 2017, it closed 400 \"underperforming\" locations and renegotiated store leases.\n\nThe retailer currently operates more than 540 brick-and-mortar stores in 45 states around the U.S. with locations in strip malls, regional malls, and outlet centers, according to court filings. Texas has the most stores with 51, followed by Georgia with 39 stores and Florida and North Carolina are tied for third-most with 30 locations in each state.\n\nThe company expects to complete the \"going out of business sales\" at all of its locations within the next 4-6 weeks. It's unclear when those closing sales may begin. It will be simultaneously running a sale for rue21's intellectual property.\n\nAs of Friday morning, the company's website said it was \"being updated\" and encouraged visitors to check back soon.\n\nThis comes less than two weeks after fashion retailer Express filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy and announced plans to close more than 100 locations.\n\n475 B Simons Run, Lynchburg, VA 24502 '325 Piedmont Drive (Space 420), Danville, VA 24540", "source": {"uri": "13newsnow.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "13News Now - WVEC"}, "authors": [{"uri": "assets@13newsnow.com", "name": "assets", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rue21", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rue21"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bankruptcy", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bankruptcy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retail", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Retail"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chapter_11,_Title_11,_United_States_Code", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chapter 11, Title 11, United States Code"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virginia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Virginia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Virginia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warrendale,_Pennsylvania", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Warrendale, Pennsylvania"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Warrendale, Pennsylvania"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norfolk,_Virginia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Norfolk, Virginia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Norfolk, Virginia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outlet_store", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Outlet store"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shopping_mall", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Shopping mall"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strip_mall", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Strip mall"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piedmont_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Piedmont (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lynchburg,_Virginia", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lynchburg, Virginia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Lynchburg, Virginia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Danville,_Virginia", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Danville, Virginia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Danville, Virginia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Carolina", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "North Carolina"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "North Carolina"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgia_(U.S._state)", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Georgia (U.S. state)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Georgia (U.S. state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/File_Management", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/File Management", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Retail_Trade", "label": "dmoz/Business/Retail Trade", "wgt": 25}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Retail_Trade/Retailers", "label": "dmoz/Business/Retail Trade/Retailers", "wgt": 37}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Food_and_Related_Products/Retail", "label": "dmoz/Business/Food and Related Products/Retail", "wgt": 28}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Retail_Trade/Services", "label": "dmoz/Business/Retail Trade/Services", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 93}], "image": "https://media.13newsnow.com/assets/WVEC/images/b2d1cd75-218c-49f1-adba-b2e5f27a8ae7/20240506T182546/b2d1cd75-218c-49f1-adba-b2e5f27a8ae7_1140x641.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9543844", "eventUri": "eng-9543844", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.06666666666666665, "wgt": 194, "relevance": 1}

Lich said while \"there's a decent amount of good clothes that look cool,\" he added that \"there are a lot of them that are just really stupid.\"\n\nThe content creator said this before showing a picture of jean shorts that have rhinestones on the front but nothing on the back.\n\n\"It's literally party in the front, nothing in the back,\" he said. \"It's so stupid.\"\n\nThe second reason the former employee provided for rue21's downfall was the store's sizing. In the video, Lich holds up a shirt he said was a woman's extra large and says, \"This could maybe fit a 13-year-old.\"\n\nLich also recalled a time where he was dressing a mannequin during work and had to put a belt on the last loop so it could fit around the mannequin's waist.\n\n\"At rue21, if you are anything except a prepubescent 13-year-old girl, you're an XL. Maybe a double XL,\" Lich said in the video, which has gotten more than 500,000 views as of Thursday afternoon.\n\nThe third reason why Lich claims rue21 is going bankrupt is the store's overpricing.\n\nThe content creator brought this up before calling out a $45 pair of jeans and a \"very basic\" pair of men's jogger sweatpants retailing for $30. He went on to pick apart a $15 pair of polyester sweatpants for its poor stitching, adding that it should have sold for $5.\n\nLich later confessed to only working at rue21 to get the employee discount, which was 40% off, according to the content creator.\n\nUltimately, Lich felt that the company going bankrupt was a long time coming.\n\n\"They've been hella overpriced.

In another video, Cahill alleges that Burris was at the Kentucky Derby when rue21 employees were \"wondering what we were going to do to pay our bills.\"\n\nAfter filing for bankruptcy, rue21 tried to sell its business, but no buyer wanted to pay more than the company would've earned through liquidating its inventory through \"going out of business sales\" and shutting down its stores, Reuters reported.\n\nThis is the third time the Pittsburgh-based company has had to file for bankruptcy, Reuters reported.\n\nIt previously filed in 2003 and 2017. When rue21 filed for bankruptcy in 2017, it shut down nearly 400 stores, a move that cut down the company's debt by $700 million at the time, Reuters reported.\n\nBelow are the rue21 stores in Massachusetts, according to the company's website.", "source": {"uri": "masslive.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "MassLive"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rue21", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rue21"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNN", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "CNN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retail", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Retail"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bankruptcy", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Bankruptcy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TikTok", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "TikTok"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Bowl_XL", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Super Bowl XL"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chapter_11,_Title_11,_United_States_Code", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chapter 11, Title 11, United States Code"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mannequin", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mannequin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhinestone", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rhinestone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyester", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Polyester"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Profanity", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Profanity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Short_film", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Short film"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeans", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jeans"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fraternities_and_sororities", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fraternities and sororities"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Coronavirus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kentucky_Derby", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kentucky Derby"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_District_Court_for_the_District_of_Delaware", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States District Court for the District of Delaware"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brick_and_mortar", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Brick and mortar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intellectual_property", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Intellectual property"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_bankruptcy_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States bankruptcy court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massachusetts", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Massachusetts"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Massachusetts"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities/Opposing_Views", "label": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities/Opposing Views", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Anti-Corporation", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Anti-Corporation", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 73}], "image": "https://www.masslive.com/resizer/v2/SBWJZDL2RZFL7GEQDTNN3TNDTI.jpg?auth=b84fc02660b3582211cf5f411b21900c945f3a21a0510c44178452fc6a06a80f&width=1280&quality=90", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9543844", "eventUri": "eng-9543844", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1764705882352942, "wgt": 186, "relevance": 1}

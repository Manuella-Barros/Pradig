How is it conceivable that Israel has alienated its closest ally and protector -- the United States -- to a degree never seen before? How has Israel become a rogue state, a pariah that has lost its morals and is putting Jewish values to shame? How is it imaginable that Israel today is governed by a bunch of criminals, fascists, warmongers, and messianic extremists who are destroying the country brick by brick, causing irreversible damage that will impact generations to come? And how has Israel reached this point of dire social and political schism and divisiveness, which is consuming the country from within, exposing its vulnerability and dreadful lack of cohesion and unity of purpose?\n\nThe answer to these troubling generational questions is NETANYAHU. Yes, Prime Minister Netanyahu, and no other, has brought Israel to this fateful state from which every exit is laden with peril with no escape without sustaining a significant blow that will scar every Israeli within its wake.\n\nNetanyahu's initial reaction and decision to wage war against Hamas for its savagery of 1,200 Israelis last October was justified because Israel has every right to defend itself. After ten months of fighting, however, following the horrific death of nearly 40,000 Palestinians and more than 1,2,00 Israelis while half of Gaza is lying in ruin, still, there is no end in sight, no exit strategy, no plans for the future of Gaza, and not even a hint about a long-term solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.\n\nAt the expense of repeating myself time and again, I want every reader to remember that it was under Netanyahu's watch that Hamas' grisly attack took place. Under his watch, Hamas built 350 miles of tunnels. Under his watch, Hamas recruited and trained and equipped between 35,000 and 40,000 fighters. Under his watch, Hamas procured and produced approximately 20,000 rockets and drones. Netanyahu and no one else facilitated the transfer of billions of dollars from Qatar to Hamas, claiming that supporting Hamas against the PA will prevent the establishment of a Palestinian state. Ten months of fighting have shown Israel's military weakness; Hamas is still alive and kicking, far from being defeated militarily, and by no stretch of the imagination will it ever cease to exist ideologically and as a political movement.\n\nThen came the assassinations of Fuad Shukr, Hezbollah's top military commander, and Hamas' political leader, Ismail Haniyeh, less than a day later. Now, the stage is set for a coordinated attack on Israel that will involve Iran and its \"axis of resistance,\" which could come at any time.\n\nDoes Netanyahu understand that no matter how many Hezbollah or Hamas leaders are killed, it will not change Israel's long-term strategic predicament and it will only make the conflict even more difficult to resolve?\n\nDoes Netanyahu understand that the massive killing of Palestinians does nothing but nurture another generation of Palestinians who will live for revenge, violently resist the occupation, and happily die for a cause they believe in?\n\nDoes Netanyahu understand Hamas put Israel exactly where they dream of being? Iran and its proxies are preparing to attack Israel on their behalf, while the whole world is dismayed by Israel's conduct.\n\nDoes Netanyahu understand that his current government and its policies are dramatically altering not only the social and cultural values of the country but its very soul as it is driven by a messianic cult that will ultimately determine its destination, which is becoming increasingly ominous?\n\nDoes Netanyahu understand that state institutions, even those like the military, are being challenged by religious extremists who are tearing the social thread that knitted Israeli society together and shattering the unity that is indispensable in a time of war?\n\nDoes Netanyahu understand that his stubborn defiance of the US and his alienation of Israel from its allies is tarnishing Israel's image, isolating it internationally, which will take decades to repair, and that is only if the Israeli-Palestinian conflict comes to an end?\n\nDoes Netanyahu understand that the nature and the aim of insurgency is survival, that is, regardless of how heavy the losses it sustains, as long as it retains the capacity to absorb Israel's repeated assaults, Hamas will regroup and fight back?\n\nDoes Netanyahu understand that he cannot gain either tactical or strategic victory against Iran and its surrogates, nor will he be able to restore deterrence against them as they have the time and resources to resume violence at will?\n\nEven though his generals, the head of the Shin Bet, the Mossad, and the Minister of Defense have been accusing him of deliberately sabotaging a deal by refusing any term of a ceasefire, while President Biden is blaming him for prolonging the war, Netanyahu remains defiant. Every time Hamas and Israeli negotiators came close to reaching an agreement, he introduced new demands. He is simply controlled by his outrageously extreme-right coalition partners, especially Ben-Gvir and Smotrich, who threatened to resign and topple the government if he accepted any deal -- an outcome he desperately wants to avoid, knowing that once he is out of office, he will face three criminal charges and the wrath of the nation that feels betrayed because he put his political survival above that of the country.\n\nIn his recent statement to the press, he said: \"We will continue to apply military pressure on Hamas and its senior figures, until the return of all of our hostages and achieving all of the war goals.\" Nothing could be more contradictory and misleading than this statement, as the reality on the ground attests to how far he is from pressuring Hamas' senior figures and achieving the objectives of the war.\n\nNetanyahu should know that for every Hamas leader killed, two or three will emerge to replace him, and although Hamas sustained a setback, its followers will become even more radicalized. And if Netanyahu's objective of the war is to crush Hamas entirely and prevent it from ever reconstituting itself in Gaza, this goal seems to grow elusive by the day. Indeed, after ten months of deadly fighting, Hamas remains operative and continues to recruit and train new fighters. Many of Hamas' fighters are reemerging in places where Israel has driven them out.\n\nIt is hard to describe what Netanyahu has done to his country. The tension between the people, the consuming anger with the government, and disgust over the unfolding events have added a deep sense of despair that many Israelis feel, not knowing what to expect next. As the prime minister, who is supposed to lead and be governed only by what is best for the country, he has no strategy and no realistic plan that would end the war, bring the hostages back home, and forge a future of peaceful Israeli-Palestinian coexistence. Time is running out as Israel is awaiting coordinated retaliations that could break into a regional war.\n\nIt is the greatest tragedy that Israel has experienced since its creation. There will be no salvation until Netanyahu is driven out of power because he is dragging Israel down on his catastrophic journey to hell.\n\nDr. Alon Ben-Meir is a retired professor of international relations, most recently at the Center for Global Affairs at NYU.

How is it possible that after 76 years of existence, Israel's relations with the Palestinians have reached a new nadir? How on earth is Israel now facing inescapably coordinated attacks by Iran, Hezbollah, Hamas, the Houthis, and other militant Islamist groups? How is it conceivable that Israel has alienated its closest ally and protector-the United States - to a degree never seen before? How has Israel become a rogue state, a pariah that has lost its morals and is putting Jewish values to shame? How is it imaginable that Israel today is governed by a bunch of criminals, fascists, warmongers, and messianic extremists who are destroying the country brick by brick, causing irreversible damage that will impact generations to come? And how has Israel reached this point of dire social and political schism and divisiveness, which is consuming the country from within, exposing its vulnerability and dreadful lack of cohesion and unity of purpose?\n\nThe answer to these troubling generational questions is NETANYAHU. Yes, Prime Minister Netanyahu, and no other, has brought Israel to this fateful state from which every exit is laden with peril with no escape without sustaining a significant blow that will scar every Israeli within its wake.\n\nNetanyahu's initial reaction and decision to wage war against Hamas for its savagery of 1,200 Israelis last October was justified because Israel has every right to defend itself. After ten months of fighting, however, following the horrific death of nearly 40,000 Palestinians and more than 1,2,00 Israelis while half of Gaza is lying in ruin, still, there is no end in sight, no exit strategy, no plans for the future of Gaza, and not even a hint about a long-term solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.\n\nAt the expense of repeating myself time and again, I want every reader to remember that it was under Netanyahu's watch that Hamas' grisly attack took place. Under his watch, Hamas built 350 miles of tunnels. Under his watch, Hamas recruited and trained and equipped between 35,000 and 40,000 fighters. Under his watch, Hamas procured and produced approximately 20,000 rockets and drones. Netanyahu and no one else facilitated the transfer of billions of dollars from Qatar to Hamas, claiming that supporting Hamas against the PA will prevent the establishment of a Palestinian state. Ten months of fighting have shown Israel's military weakness; Hamas is still alive and kicking, far from being defeated militarily, and by no stretch of the imagination will it ever cease to exist ideologically and as a political movement.\n\nThen came the assassinations of Fuad Shukr, Hezbollah's top military commander, and Hamas' political leader, Ismail Haniyeh, less than a day later. Now, the stage is set for a coordinated attack on Israel that will involve Iran and its \"axis of resistance,\" which could come at any time.\n\nDoes Netanyahu understand that no matter how many Hezbollah or Hamas leaders are killed, it will not change Israel's long-term strategic predicament and it will only make the conflict even more difficult to resolve?\n\nDoes Netanyahu understand that the massive killing of Palestinians does nothing but nurture another generation of Palestinians who will live for revenge, violently resist the occupation, and happily die for a cause they believe in?\n\nDoes Netanyahu understand Hamas put Israel exactly where they dream of being? Iran and its proxies are preparing to attack Israel on their behalf, while the whole world is dismayed by Israel's conduct.\n\nDoes Netanyahu understand that his current government and its policies are dramatically altering not only the social and cultural values of the country but its very soul as it is driven by a messianic cult that will ultimately determine its destination, which is becoming increasingly ominous?\n\nDoes Netanyahu understand that state institutions, even those like the military, are being challenged by religious extremists who are tearing the social thread that knitted Israeli society together and shattering the unity that is indispensable in a time of war?\n\nDoes Netanyahu understand that his stubborn defiance of the US and his alienation of Israel from its allies is tarnishing Israel's image, isolating it internationally, which will take decades to repair, and that is only if the Israeli-Palestinian conflict comes to an end?\n\nDoes Netanyahu understand that the nature and the aim of insurgency is survival, that is, regardless of how heavy the losses it sustains, as long as it retains the capacity to absorb Israel's repeated assaults, Hamas will regroup and fight back?", "source": {"uri": "onlineopinion.com.au", "dataType": "news", "title": "On Line Opinion"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinians", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Palestinians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamas", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hamas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benjamin_Netanyahu", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Benjamin Netanyahu"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hezbollah", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Hezbollah"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Iran"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Iran"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Houthi_movement", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Houthi movement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Messiah", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Messiah"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fascism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fascism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jews", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jews"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Islamism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_Strip", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinian_National_Authority", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Palestinian National Authority"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocket", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rocket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli\u2013Palestinian_conflict", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Israeli\u2013Palestinian conflict"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unmanned_aerial_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Unmanned aerial vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qatar", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Qatar"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Qatar"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ismail_Haniyeh", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ismail Haniyeh"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proxy_war", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Proxy war"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insurgency", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Insurgency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassination", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Assassination"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cult", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cult"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 87}], "image": null, "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9799815", "eventUri": "eng-9799815", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.4666666666666667, "wgt": 213, "relevance": 1}

After the deaths of 1,200 people and the abduction of hundreds more, a traumatized Israeli public heard abject admissions of responsibility from the heads of the Israel Defense Forces and Shin Bet, the country's domestic security service, but none from Netanyahu, who had been Prime Minister for almost a year when the attack happened, and had presided over a more than 10-year strategy of tacit acceptance of Hamas rule in Gaza. His only apology was for a social media post blaming his own security chiefs for failing to foil the assault. So, early in a 66-minute conversation with TIME on Aug. 4 in the Prime Minister's office in Jerusalem, the question is, Would he make an apology?\n\n\"Apologize?\" he asks back. \"Of course, of course. I am sorry, deeply, that something like this happened. And you always look back and you say, Could we have done things that would have prevented it?\"\n\nFor Netanyahu, who first occupied the dowdy Kaplan Street offices in 1996, it's a fraught question. Through a combination of electoral vicissitudes, sweeping regional changes, and his own political gifts, his almost 17-year cumulative tenure is longer than that of anyone else who has led Israel, a country only two years older than he is. Over that span, Netanyahu's political endurance has been built around one consistent argument: that he's the only leader who can ensure Israel's safety.\n\nBut in the wake of the worst slaughter of Jews since the Holocaust, with more than 40,000 Gazans dead in the ensuing conflict, Israel under Netanyahu is not blessed with peace but besieged by war. As we speak, the country is on edge for an expected aerial attack from Iran, the second in four months. Shops are shuttered, and pedestrians stay within sprinting distance of bomb shelters. The fighting is ongoing in Gaza, with more than 100 hostages still held by Hamas. Much to the frustration of the Biden Administration, Netanyahu still has not articulated a credible plan to end the war or a vision for how the Israelis and the Palestinians can peacefully coexist. Instead, he's bracing for escalating conflict on even more fronts: in the north with Hezbollah in Lebanon; in the Gulf with the Houthis in Yemen; and most of all, with Israel's nemesis Iran. \"We're facing not merely Hamas,\" Netanyahu says. \"We're facing a full-fledged Iranian axis, and we understand that we have to organize ourselves for broader defense.\"\n\nThe story of how Israel arrived at this precarious moment is entwined with Netanyahu's personal ambitions and vulnerabilities. In the months before Oct. 7, Israeli society was sundered by his support of right-wing legislation diminishing the power of the Supreme Court. The collective trauma of the Hamas attack may have brought Jewish Israelis together, but deepened doubts about their Prime Minister, with 72% saying he should resign, either now or after the war, according to a July poll for Israel's most watched television station. Abroad, the toll of the Gaza war can be tallied in Israel's increasing isolation: arrest warrants for Netanyahu and Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant sought by the prosecutor of the International Criminal Court for alleged war crimes; American college campuses convulsed by anti-Israel protests, the largest of their kind since Vietnam; antisemitism rising around the globe.\n\nOn his first trip overseas since the war's outbreak, Netanyahu addressed a joint session of Congress on July 25 in hopes of reinforcing his nation's most essential alliance. But behind the standing ovations, the advice from both ends of the political spectrum was unanimous: President Biden, Vice President Kamala Harris, and former President Donald Trump all said it was time to end the war in Gaza.\n\nNetanyahu's response? Two days after arriving home, without a heads-up to the White House, a bomb almost certainly planted by Israel killed Hamas' most prominent negotiator in a heavily guarded government guest house in Tehran. With every passing week, critics raise further alarms that Netanyahu is drawing out the Gaza campaign for personal political reasons, arguing that a deal for a permanent cease-fire that would bring home the remaining hostages would also open the door to elections that could result in his removal from office. Biden himself told TIME on May 28 that there was \"every reason to draw that conclusion,\" and in Israel, many do. \"Netanyahu is focused on his longevity in power more than the interests of the Israeli people or the State of Israel,\" says former Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak, who for four years served as his Defense Minister. \"It will take half a generation to repair the damage that Netanyahu has caused in the last year.\"\n\nRead More: Inside the Israel-Hamas Information War\n\nA defiant Netanyahu, 74, calls these charges a \"canard.\" He insists the goal in Gaza must be a victory so decisive that when the fighting stops, Hamas can make no claim to govern in Palestinian territories or pose a threat to Israel. Otherwise, he argues, it will only condemn his country to a future of more massacres at the hands of enemies who want to eliminate the world's only Jewish state. With the conflict expanding, Netanyahu says he is puncturing the confidence of every other element of Iran's \"axis of resistance,\" a network of nonstate actors throughout the Middle East with a collective arsenal of rockets trained on Israel.\n\nIf the war in Gaza widens into a regional conflict, the consequences for Israel and the world would be dangerously unpredictable. The U.S. and the West risk being dragged into another Middle East quagmire. Israelis increasingly worry that the war supposedly launched to save Israel will imperil it. Among their most profound fears is that the cycle of violence and the perception it shapes of Israel for the next generation will cause lasting damage to its survival and its soul.\n\nFor Netanyahu, who says he's waging an existential war, it's a risk he recognizes, but one he's willing to take. \"Being destroyed has bigger implications about Israel's security,\" he says. \"I'd rather have bad press than a good obituary.\"\n\nEarlier this year, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken flew to Tel Aviv to meet Israeli officials in the Kirya, the towering office complex from which the Prime Minister and his Cabinet were conducting the war. Israel's bombardment of Gaza had already caused an estimated 30,000 deaths, a count by the Hamas-led Health Ministry that doesn't distinguish between militants and civilians, but is accepted by the U.N. and the White House. Nearly 2 million Palestinians had been displaced. It was a humanitarian catastrophe inflaming the world, and Blinken's message to Netanyahu was simple: Wind down the war, you have achieved your objective, Hamas can no longer carry out another Oct. 7.\n\n\"That's not our objective,\" Netanyahu replied, according to a source familiar with the exchange. \"Our objective is to completely destroy Hamas' military and governing capabilities.\" The larger, more essential goal, Netanyahu argued, was restoring Israel's principle of deterrence. The price of Oct. 7 had to be sufficiently high for Hamas that any other power considering an attack on Israel would fear similar destruction. While Israel faces a cynical enemy that endangers its own people to delegitimize the Jewish state, the price of that full-throttle approach was already evident: the civilian death toll was mounting, Palestinians struggled to access basic health care, and there was a shortage of food and water. The calamity spawned accusations of a disproportionate counterattack. \"This is collective punishment,\" says Rashid Khalidi, a Columbia University professor who worked on Palestinian peace negotiations in the 1990s. \"You don't punish civilians for what Hamas did.\"\n\nNetanyahu dismisses those allegations out of hand. \"We've gone out of our way to enable humanitarian assistance since the beginning of the war,\" he says, citing Israel's delivery of aid through food trucks and air drops.\n\nTo some extent, Netanyahu has been preparing to fight this war his entire adult life. His political career began as a telegenic diplomat explaining Israel's positions on U.S. television during Iran's takeover of the U.S. embassy in 1979, and he was elected Prime Minister three times pitching himself as \"Mr. Security.\" That the worst terrorist attack in Israel's history happened on his watch was a deep wound, forcing a reckoning in Israel over the strategic policy decisions he had championed for decades.\n\nThe first was allowing Qatar to send funds into the Gaza Strip. Hamas had come to power first by the ballot box (in 2006 elections promoted by U.S. President George W. Bush) and a year later by force of arms, amid factional fighting. Israel first responded by enforcing a blockade on the enclave. But under a policy embraced over the past 10 years by Netanyahu, billions in Qatari cash was allowed into Gaza. The infrastructure it financed included many miles of tunnels.\n\n\"Hamas wore two hats. It wore a terrorist hat and it wore a governance hat after 2007,\" says Michael Oren, Netanyahu's ambassador to Washington from 2009 to 2013. \"We thought that we could incentivize Hamas to wear the governance hat through large infusions of Qatari cash and by allowing Palestinian workers into Israel. Give Hamas something to lose. That was the idea. But it was wrong.\"\n\nOthers saw a more cynical strategy, to deepen divisions between Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza, and undermine the prospects for a unified Palestinian state. \"He saw Hamas as an asset and the [West Bank-based] Palestinian Authority as a liability,\" says Barak. \"As long as he can hold Hamas alive and kicking and being a threat to Israel, he can easily protect himself against demands from America and from the rest of the world who argued that Israel should look for a way to achieve a breakthrough with the Palestinians.\"\n\nNetanyahu reportedly said as much at a Likud Party meeting in 2019, according to the Israeli media, but he denies it. Rather, he tells TIME, his approval of Qatari cash infusions was humanitarian: \"We wanted to make sure that Gaza has a functioning civilian administration to avoid humanitarian collapse,\" he says. Moreover, he claims, the money didn't form the basis of Hamas' eventual threat to Israel. \"The main issue was the transfer of weapons and ammunition from the Sinai into Gaza,\" he says. His primary mistake, he says, was acceding to his Security Cabinet's reluctance to wage full-on war. \"Oct. 7 showed that those who said that Hamas was deterred were wrong,\" he says during the Aug. 4 interview. \"If anything, I didn't challenge enough the assumption that was common to all the security agencies.\"\n\nInstead, Israel maintained a policy known as mowing the grass -- periodic fighting to degrade Hamas' military capability and deter its desire to assault Israel. The 2014 Gaza war, during which Hamas sent forces into Israel via tunnels, lasted 51 days. Early in that round, senior Israeli officials say, Netanyahu's Security Cabinet presented him with a plan to destroy Hamas that estimated the cost in deaths: roughly 10,000 Gazan civilians and nearly 500 Israeli soldiers. \"There was no domestic support for such an action,\" says Netanyahu. \"There was certainly no international support for such an action -- and you need both.\"\n\nWhile Hamas was growing stronger in secret, Israel was making a spectacle of its own division. In January 2023, after Netanyahu returned to power for the third time with a coalition that included far-right parties previously considered too extreme to govern, he backed a radical bill to weaken the judiciary. The plan triggered an immense backlash, with tens of thousands of Israelis protesting every weekend. \"You are weakening us, and our enemy is going to see it and we're going to pay the price,\" former Minister of Defense Benny Gantz warned Netanyahu.\n\nNetanyahu blames the protesters, thousands of whom declared they wouldn't serve in the military of an Israel with a diminished democratic foundation. \"The refusal to serve because of an internal political debate -- I think that, if anything, that had an effect,\" he says.\n\nAmid this tumult, Hamas had been planning to infiltrate Israel by land, air, and sea, and not just for a one-off attack. The plan on Oct. 7 was to secure the south of Israel and keep moving farther into the north, according to two senior Israeli sources who have reviewed Hamas documentation discovered in Gaza. \"This was not a plan to wound Israel,\" says one source who reviewed the documents. \"It was planned to be the first step in the operation to destroy Israel entirely.\"\n\nIsrael's invasion of Gaza began on Oct. 27, when Netanyahu launched a full-scale ground operation with aerial strikes. The offensive came with a cold calculation; because Hamas intentionally embeds its military infrastructure in densely populated areas, the attacks would inevitably inflict wide-scale civilian casualties. For an Israeli public still reeling from Oct. 7, their deaths became a tragic but necessary price to protect the nation-state established after the Holocaust to provide a safe haven for Jews in their ancestral homeland. A Pew poll in May showed fewer than 20% of Israelis thought the country's military went \"too far.\" The press here seldom shows images of civilian deaths. In our interview, Netanyahu says the IDF's \"best estimate\" is that the ratio of civilian deaths to military is 1 to 1 -- extraordinarily low for urban combat. (The U.N. has said that civilians usually account for 90% of casualties in war.)\n\nThe hostages remain the focus of domestic attention. In November, Israel and Hamas reached a temporary cease-fire to exchange 105 of them for 240 Palestinian prisoners. When fighting resumed a week later, the humanitarian crisis increasingly became the global focus. Only under intense pressure from the Biden Administration did Netanyahu allow more aid into the Strip. When he prepared to push into the southern Gaza city of Rafah, the last refuge both for displaced civilians and Hamas' remaining battalions, Netanyahu also found himself up against the American President who had flown in after Oct. 7 to publicly embrace him.\n\nRead More: The Families of Israelis Held Hostage by Hamas Speak Out\n\nIsrael seemed more internationally isolated than ever before. Most wounding to Netanyahu was a March cover of the Economist, which he read growing up in the States, headlined \"Israel alone.\" That, it turns out, was exaggerated. A few weeks later, on April 14, Iran for the first time launched 300 missiles toward Israel, a retaliation for its attack on a diplomatic facility in Damascus. Under Biden's stewardship, the American, British, French, and Arab forces all rushed to Israel's defense.\n\nBut two things can be true at once. A government anxious to prevent a full-bore regional conflagration might scramble jets to save Israeli lives while also holding grave reservations about what Israel was doing in Gaza. The war had been going on for six months, and Biden wanted Netanyahu to accept a cease-fire-for-hostage deal that would end it. To Biden's frustration, Netanyahu resisted. He wanted only a temporary pause in the fighting upon the return of the hostages. A longer respite for Hamas stood to cost Netanyahu the support of his far-right governing partners, tanking his fragile coalition. \"He's risking his government in having a deal with Hamas,\" says a senior Israeli official. \"Bibi will have a hostage deal only when it suits him politically.\"\n\nThis was the backdrop for Netanyahu's first trip abroad since Oct. 7, to address a joint session of Congress in Washington. The speech was at first opposed by Biden and Democratic congressional leadership, who knew it would exacerbate party tensions over the Administration's support for the war. Nearly 130 Democrats skipped it, including Harris, who as Vice President would traditionally preside over the address.\n\nA visit intended to showcase solidarity with Israel's most essential ally instead underscored what was for Israel a growing partisan divide. In recent years, Democratic voters have grown less supportive of Israel and more sympathetic toward Palestinians, according to Gallup. The Gaza war had only intensified the trend.\n\nNetanyahu says that's not his fault. \"I don't think that the much reported erosion of support among some quarters of the American public is related to Israel,\" he says. \"It's more related to America.\" He cites a Harvard-Harris survey that in January found that 80% of respondents supported Israel whereas 20% supported Hamas -- a significant chunk of support for a terrorist organization. \"There's a problem that America has,\" Netanyahu says. \"It's not a problem that Israel has.\"\n\nThe partisan divide on display during his trip offered the canny Israeli Premier an opportunity. After the speech he traveled to Trump's Mediterranean-style Palm Beach mansion to repair his relationship with the billionaire, who remained angry at Netanyahu for backing out of a joint strike on a top Iranian in January 2020, and for congratulating Joe Biden on his election victory. But at Mar-a-Lago, Trump greeted Netanyahu and his wife Sara with open arms, and after their conversation set up a makeshift cabinet meeting around a boardroom table with Netanyahu's top brass and his own.\n\nPerhaps Netanyahu's ultimate metric of success in the U.S. came as he prepared to fly home. On July 27, the centrist Israeli television station Channel 12 released a poll that showed his leading all three of his potential rivals in a hypothetical snap election.\n\nLess than a day after the meeting with Trump, a Hezbollah rocket launched from Lebanon struck a soccer field in northern Israel, killing 12, mostly children. In retaliation for the soccer-field attack, Israel on July 30 bombed a senior Hezbollah commander in a suburb of Beirut -- a rare strike in the Lebanese capital.\n\nJust hours later, news broke that the Hamas political leader Ismail Haniyeh had been killed in his sleep in Tehran, where he had just attended the inauguration of the new Iranian President. The Iranians accused the Israelis of the hit, which was reportedly delivered via a bomb secreted into an Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps guesthouse. Israel has not confirmed or denied involvement but went on high alert, awaiting the promised Iranian retaliation.\n\nLast April, a wider conflict had been narrowly avoided when Iran responded to an Israeli airstrike that killed an Iranian general with a massive but telegraphed direct attack on Israel that was rebuffed with the help of the allied defenses arranged by the U.S. This time, both sides again professed to want to avoid a broader conflict, even as each encounter tested the line between deterrence and provocation.\n\nRead more: On TikTok, Gaza's Palestinians Plead to the World: 'Don't Scroll'\n\nIf a larger war can indeed be averted, Netanyahu believes he can transcend the infamy of Oct. 7 in two ways, according to those close to him. One is by successfully ridding Gaza of Hamas. The second: cementing a Saudi-Israel normalization deal. This would be a dramatic expansion of the Abraham Accords forged under Trump, which normalized Israel's ties with four Arab nations. Eviscerating Hamas, then providing the Jewish state a network of alliances in the heart of the Islamic world, would turn a catastrophe into a strategic triumph.\n\nThe two goals could intersect in Netanyahu's vague plan for a postwar Gaza. Once Hamas is out of power, he says, he wants to recruit Arab countries to help install a civilian Palestinian governing entity that wouldn't pose a threat to Israel. \"I'd like to see a civilian administration run by Gazans, perhaps with the support of regional partners,\" says Netanyahu. \"Demilitarization by Israel, civilian administration by Gaza.\"\n\nFew Israelis see this as a realistic scenario. \"He doesn't have any plan for the endgame,\" says Efraim Halevy, a former head of Mossad. \"First of all, it took him a long time to admit that there would be an endgame, but he has never published it as a proposition, and what he has published is very flimsy.\" It also strikes Palestinians as unlikely. \"Not unless there's some kind of Palestinian buy-in, and there will not be a buy-in to something that's not Palestinian run,\" says Khalidi. \"Something that's run by the Emirates or any other alternative is not going to fly.\"\n\nThe fates of Israelis and Palestinians remain inextricably intertwined. If Israel does not find a way to peacefully separate from the millions of Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza, it faces a future of either absorbing them as citizens and losing its Jewish majority, or depriving them of the rights and freedoms afforded to the Jewish population and losing its democracy.\n\nNetanyahu has no interest in overseeing the creation of a Palestinian state. Rather, he offers a vision of limited pockets of autonomy in Palestinian areas where Israel maintains overriding security control, a version of the situation in the West Bank today. \"That's a detraction of sovereign powers,\" he admits, \"there's no question about it.\" But he also tacitly recognizes the dilemma Israel faces. \"I agree we should maintain a Jewish majority, but I think we should do it in democratic means,\" he says. \"That's why I don't want to incorporate the Palestinians in Judea and Samaria as citizens of Israel,\" referring to the biblical name of the West Bank. \"It means that they should run their own lives. They should vote for their own institutions. They should have their own self-governance. But they should not have the power to threaten us.\"\n\nThe Saudis have publicly said Israel needs to be taking steps toward a Palestinian state in order to clinch a normalization deal. But Netanyahu's far-right ruling coalition won't tolerate any move in that direction. Naming Itamar Ben-Gvir as National Security Minister and Belazel Smotrich as Finance Minister is, as Union for Reform Judaism president Rick Jacobs has put it, like a U.S. President welcoming into the Cabinet the KKK. The former cheered on the assassination of former Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin; the latter has said Israel would be \"justified\" in starving Palestinians to death but the world won't let them. Together, they have undertaken a bureaucratic push to eliminate any possibility of Palestinian sovereignty. Smotrich has authorized illegal Israeli outposts in the West Bank and streamlined the approval of settlement activities to expand Israel's footprint in the occupied territories.\n\nExtremist elements have seeped deeper and deeper into Israeli society since Oct. 7. At the end of July, a Palestinian detainee was rushed to the hospital with severe wounds after being sexually abused with a polelike object. Far-right demonstrators, including some lawmakers, stormed a military base to protest the arrest of nine suspects.\n\nThe compounding crises may have Israel at the greatest risk since its founding 76 years ago. Halevy, the former Mossad chief, views the situation ominously. \"There were 70 or so years between the temples,\" he says, referring to the last two periods the Jewish people had sovereignty in Israel. \"You can say that there is a pattern here.\"\n\nAmid the gathering sense of existential danger, Netanyahu is, as always, pitching himself as the man who can ensure that Zionism survives the war. \"It will, if we win,\" he says. \"And if we don't, our future will be in great jeopardy.\" Barak, the former Prime Minister, says Netanyahu is in his psychological element. \"He genuinely believes that he's saving Israel,\" says Barak. \"Not that he's responsible for one of the worst events in its history.\"\n\nUltimately, the Israeli electorate will determine its future. Though 7 in 10 Israelis say he should step down, the Channel 12 poll showed Netanyahu winning a plurality of 32% support. \"There's a disconnect between public opinion, which is a majority against him in every measure, and his potential for him to stay in power,\" says Dahlia Scheindlin, an Israeli pollster. \"That doesn't necessarily translate into losing power in elections.\"\n\nThe country's own fraught history suggests Netanyahu's vulnerability. Prime Minister Golda Meir resigned months after the Yom Kippur War of 1973, when Egypt and Syria attacked Israel on the holiest day of the Jewish year, killing over 2,600 Israeli soldiers. Netanyahu has himself been a harsh judge of leaders who oversaw military disasters. In 2008, after a damning report was published on Prime Minister Ehud Olmert's management of the 2006 Lebanon war, he called Olmert unfit and incompetent. \"The government is in charge of the military, and it failed miserably,\" Netanyahu said at the time. \"The political echelon and its leader refuse to take responsibility and exhibit personal integrity and leadership -- which is what the decisive majority of the public expects them to do.\"\n\nIn his office on Kaplan Street, TIME asks Netanyahu whether he intends to remain Prime Minister. \"I will stay in office as long as I believe I can help lead Israel to a future of security, enduring security and prosperity,\" he replies. And would he say an opposition leader who presided over Israel's worst security failure should stay in power?\n\nNetanyahu pauses to think through his answer. \"It depends what they do,\" he says. \"What do they do? Are they capable of leading the country in war? Can they lead it to victory? Can they assure that the postwar situation will be one of peace and security? If the answer is yes, they should stay in power.\"", "source": {"uri": "time.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "TIME"}, "authors": [{"uri": "eric_cortellessa@time.com", "name": "Eric Cortellessa", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinians", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Palestinians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ministry_of_Defense_(Israel)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ministry of Defense (Israel)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamas", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hamas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_City", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gaza City"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gaza City"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benjamin_Netanyahu", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Benjamin Netanyahu"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_Israel", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Prime Minister of Israel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humanitarian_aid", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Humanitarian aid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_W._Bush", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "George W.

Rather, said Netanyahu, \"The main issue was the transfer of weapons and ammunition from the Sinai into Gaza.\"\n\nThe issue of smuggling tunnels running underneath the Egyptian border with Gaza has long been a source of controversy between Egypt and Israel, with Cairo denying that any such tunnels were operative in recent years. One of the conditions set by Netanyahu for reaching a deal with Hamas is for Israel to keep control over the Philadelphi Corridor, which runs along the Egyptian border with Gaza, mainly to curb any Hamas use of smuggling tunnels to recuperate more ammunition. Hamas and Egypt have both refused this demand.\n\nNetanyahu responsible for Oct. 7 failures?\n\nIn the interview, Netanyahu said his primary mistake over the years was going along with the reluctance of his security cabinet to confront Hamas militarily with Israel's full military force. \"Oct. 7 showed that those who said that Hamas was deterred were wrong,\" Netanyahu told Time. \"If anything, I didn't challenge enough the assumption that was common to all the security agencies,\" he added.\n\nSince Oct. 7, Israelis have been calling for the establishment of an official inquiry commission to investigate the policies of the government and the conduct of the military prior and during the assault by Hamas. The interview with Time was published three days after a civil society group called upon Netanyahu to testify in front of its members on the events of Oct. 7.\n\nEstablished by family members of people killed by Hamas on Oct. 7 and family members of hostages held in Gaza, the \"civil inquiry committee\" has approached Netanyahu and the four prime ministers who served before him to testify. So far, only Yair Lapid and Ehud Olmert agreed to meet with the group and are expected to testify in front of it on Thursday.\n\nNetanyahu has repeatedly refused to take responsibility for the military, intelligence and political failures that enabled Hamas to secretly get stronger and surprise the Israeli security agencies on Oct. 7.\n\nOn Oct. 29, Netanyahu's office wrote on X that \"at no time and no stage was a warning given to Prime Minister Netanyahu regarding war intentions of Hamas,\" adding that \"on the contrary, all security officials, including the head of army intelligence and the head of the Shin Bet, estimated that Hamas was deterred and interested in an arrangement.\" The post was quickly deleted after its publication after causing an uproar in Israel.\n\nIn his interview with Time, Netanyahu said he apologizes to the victims of Oct. 7. \"Of course, of course. I am sorry, deeply, that something like this happened. And you always look back and you say could we have done things that would have prevented it?\" Still, Netanyahu did not take responsibility for the Oct. 7 failures. \"I will stay in office as long as I believe I can help lead Israel to a future of security, enduring security and prosperity,\" he said.\n\nUS advancing a deal\n\nThe publication of the interview came against the backdrop of a statement made by White House National Security spokesperson John Kirby, who said on Wednesday that it is as close as it has ever been to reaching a deal between Israel and Hamas that would see the liberation of the hostages and a cease-fire in Gaza. Asked about his plans for the day after the war in Gaza, Netanyahu said, \"I'd like to see a civilian administration run by Gazans, perhaps with the support of regional partners,\" adding that this would require \"demilitarization by Israel, civilian administration by Gaza.\"\n\nWhile the United States struggles to revive talks for a deal between Israel and Hamas, suspended after the killing of Hamas' chief, Ismail Haniyeh, the Israeli military on Thursday called on Palestinians in the Khan Younis area in the south of the Gaza Strip to evacuate to the Israeli-designated humanitarian zone near the coastline.\n\nAlso on Thursday, the Israeli military said it carried out airstrikes against Hamas command and control centers embedded within two schools in Gaza City, at the north of the Gaza Strip.", "source": {"uri": "al-monitor.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Al-Monitor"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamas", "type": "org", "score": 5,

It was, in fact, supporting the civilian administration that was run by various officials, many of them non-Hamas. But the reason that successive governments agreed to that is that we wanted to make sure that Gaza has a functioning civilian administration to avoid humanitarian collapse.\"\n\nNetanyahu also insisted that he never asserted in 2019 that \"Anyone who wants to thwart the establishment of a Palestinian state has to support bolstering Hamas and transferring money to Hamas.

I never said that.\"\n\nAsked whether Israel's military and intelligence services warned that his government's judicial overhaul was dividing Israel - and that Hezbollah and Hamas saw it as weakening Israel's deterrence - the prime minister answered that \"They said that it might affect the community overall, other parts of the Middle East, but they were quite specific that it didn't, didn't affect Gaza.\n\n\"But the more important thing is, I think that what really affected them, if anything, was the idea of someone refusing to serve.

Israel, I think, is famous for that. It has what is called a proper judicial system, both inside the military and outside the military.\n\n\"In fact ...

The prime minister batted away the concerns, saying that in each case the allegations were lies or distortions.

There are two seemingly contradictory ways to look at this tragedy, and understanding how both are true is the key to untangling one of the messiest situations in geopolitics since World War II.\n\nIn the first narrative, the Hamas terrorist group, which seized control of Gaza in 2006, last Oct. 7 invaded a surprisingly unguarded Israel unprovoked, barbarously massacred some 1,200 people, overwhelmingly civilians, and kidnapped about 250 into Gaza. It was the deadliest day for Jews since the Holocaust. Hamas did this because it's dedicated to destroying Israel and, in its demonic extremism, doesn't care about consequences to their own people. Hamas hoped to spark a multi-front war, and partly succeeded.\n\nThe Hezbollah militia, backed, funded and armed by Iran, has been attacking Israel ever since with drones, shells and missiles, most recently killing 12 children two weeks ago in a Druze town. Perhaps 80,000 Israelis have fled border communities in the north for fear of the group, which occupies much of Lebanon and is far stronger than the Lebanese military.\n\nSimilarly, the Houthi militia has been firing at Israel from 2,000 miles away in Yemen, and also attacking commercial vessels headed to the Suez Canal, imperiling a third of global container traffic out of solidarity with Hamas and hatred for the West. Also Iran-backed, the Houthis similarly don't care about consequences; they've occupied half of Yemen and caused 150,000 of their people to die in fighting since 2014 (and far more from disease).\n\nHamas had hoped to also spark a Palestinian uprising in the Israeli-occupied West Bank and a civil war in Israel itself, where 20 percent of the 10 million citizens are Arabs. That hasn't yet come about, though there certainly is tension; in recent days a West Banker attacked Tel Aviv area morning strollers with a knife, killing two.\n\nIsrael launched a counterattack in Gaza in mid-October aimed at removing Hamas from power. This has caused massive loss of life, probably in the tens of thousands, with the ratio of fighters to civilians unclear. The damage stems partly from Hamas embedding among civilians, and entirely because Hamas refuses to give up the hostages and lay down arms.\n\nIn recent weeks, Israel has assassinated a series of major Hamas and Hezbollah figures, most daringly Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh while he was a guest in Tehran. Iran and its various proxies have vowed to avenge the attack in Israel itself, and so the region is on edge.\n\nI think the above is true. But there is a second narrative as well, about the true intentions of the current Israeli government.\n\nIn this narrative, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu (facing trial for bribery) understood quickly that Oct. 7 was not an event a government in a parliamentary democracy is meant to survive. The failure was total: ignoring intelligence, abandoning the border, taking long hours to arrive on the scene. Moreover, it had attempted authoritarian reforms that caused a massive national schism and which security chiefs had warned were inviting attack.\n\nSo, polls showed three-quarters of Israelis wanted the government replaced and that the opposition would win a new election, as Netanyahu declared war with the popular twin aims of removing Hamas from power in Gaza and gaining the return of the hostages. He argued that any reckoning for Oct. 7 must await the end of the war. Many people bought this, creating an incentive to prolong and expand the war.\n\nIt is not just a question of putting time between Oct. 7 and the reckoning over it -- or even of dragging things out until the next scheduled election in 2026. There's also an incentive to engineer so great a crisis that Oct. 7 somehow pales by comparison -- while the discussion moves on, to bigger and worse things still.\n\nOne might think those things would merely be more calamities that extend the government's rap sheet -- but that would be checkers. On Netanyahu's chess table, if the Oct. 7 argument cannot be won, perhaps some other argument can. Specifically, enough Israelis must be convinced that the world is against them and conflict is inevitable and force alone is the proper response.\n\nIsrael has endured a legitimacy drubbing since its tanks rolled into Gaza. More than 400 more soldiers have been killed and many more maimed, and its economy has suffered as tens of thousands are called up for months of reserve duty.\n\nIts international standing has plummeted; the International Court of Justice has ruled that it might be guilty of genocide and that its West Bank occupation is illegal; the International Criminal Court is considering its prosecutor's request for arrest warrants against Netanyahu and the defense minister; boycotts and talk of arms embargoes grow; and the country is starting to endure a near-Russia-level ostracization as Zionism has become a dirty word on college campuses. Slowly, but surely, a siege mentality is settling in.\n\nAnd whereas many blame Netanyahu, it's no longer three-quarters of the people who see things quite so clearly; many are indeed inclined to put recriminations aside in the middle of a war. One can work with this situation, if one's only goal is clinging to power. One might actually survive it politically, even if thousands of others -- and Israel's own hostages -- do not survive in real life.\n\nViewed through such a prism, it becomes clearer why the war is dragging on. Despite the massive destruction, Hamas continues to hold half the hostages (the other half were released in early deals) -- and the group is still able to control any area that Israel's military evacuates. In this exhausting endless cat-and-mouse chase, there is political time bought.\n\nFor about three months early this year, Israel was said to want to enter the town of Rafah, Hamas' supposed last redoubt. Israeli officials leaked that the United States was preventing this; U.S. officials said they were merely asking for safe passage for the population. Eventually Israel provided safe passage and went in, halfheartedly and to little avail. Not much changed -- more time bought.\n\nThere is a complex three-stage hostage deal on the table which actually amounts to an acceptance of the Hamas condition of an Israeli pullout in exchange for all the hostages. President Joe Biden on May 31 said it was Israel that proposed the deal, but Netanyahu now rejects it, adding requests that his own negotiators say (in a stream of leaked reports) are aimed at scuttling the whole thing. According to credible and persistent Israeli news reports, Netanyahu has been berating his negotiators -- a retired general and the heads of the Shin Bet security agency and the Mossad spy agency -- that they don't know how to drive a bargain. Put another way, they're not trying to buy time.\n\nIn fact, Hamas remains in a strong position due to Netanyahu's own refusal to allow the West Bank-based Palestinian Authority to retake the territory with much outside assistance -- which is the only solution that might work. That's because Netanyahu's essential far-right coalition allies oppose it and because that would end the war.\n\nBiden offered Israel an exit plan that also includes that massive global aid to the Palestinians, peace for Israel with Saudi Arabia and a Western-Arab-Israeli strategic alliance against Iran. Highly credible reports this week say Netanyahu, who has been ignoring the offer for six months, has decided to delay considering it until after the U.S. election. A rational Israeli government, a patriotic one, would grab this. But for Netanyahu, rejecting it buys still more time.\n\nNow Haniyeh is assassinated while visited Tehran, guaranteeing retaliation by his honor-obsessed hosts. Millions of Israelis are hoping it will be mild so as not to spark a wider regional war. But if what one wants is for Netanyahu to buy yet more time via greater complications, deepening chaos and terrifyingly high new stakes -- well, that is not what one is hoping for at all.\n\nObservers might conclude that a leader who acts this way is a traitor, but there's no denying his skill at surviving against high odds. It is tempting to view this second narrative as a sort of conspiracy theory. But if one knows Netanyahu, it rings very true. \"The PM doesn't want the war to end -- he wants as long a war as possible,\" said retired General Dan Harel this week. Many Israelis think it's true, as does Biden, who reportedly told Netanyahu last week: \"Stop b-----ing me.\"\n\nDealing with two conflicting narratives is known as cognitive dissonance. This state is useful for agents of chaos. It foments tension, confusion, divisions, indecision, and self-deception, opening the door wide to manipulation. In a society, unresolved narrative conflicts can lead to increased polarization -- the classic context for the emergence and preservation of strongman rule.\n\nThat is the context in which Netanyahu can thrive. It is also an enormous boon to Hamas, Iran and the other enemies of Israel. Realizing how all these players' interests shockingly converge is the key to defusing the bomb they planted. This, too, will require a big stick.\n\nDan Perry is the former Cairo-based Middle East editor and London-based Europe/Africa editor of the Associated Press, the former Chairman of the Foreign Press Association in Jerusalem, and the author of two books about Israel.

The death of a top Hamas negotiator in Tehran last week through a point-precision assassination may speak of the superlative Israeli intelligence. But it frontally challenged the ruling Ayatollahs who were made to look silly before their own people while being vulnerable even in their own safe houses. A few days earlier, the Israel Defence Force had neutralised the military commander of Hamas in Gaza. In the more than seven month long war by Israel with the specific objective of eliminating Hamas, more than 30,000 people, mostly civilians, among them a huge number children and women, have been killed. Tens of thousands of Palestinians are rendered homeless every other day , moving from place to place on Israel's orders to avoid a relentless shower of bombs and missiles. The UN has repeatedly called for a ceasefire even as the humanitarian crisis deteriorates by the day in Gaza. Yet, Israel shows no inclination to heed the global calls for ceasefire. On the contrary, after the two high-profile assassinations the world at large is now living in dread of a bigger conflagration following threats of a severe retaliation by Iran, Hezbollah and Hamas. It seems there is nothing to stop Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu from persisting with his war against the perceived enemies of Israel.\n\nNetanyahu's need to prolong the armed hostilities to save himself from the ouster from power seems to have made him averse to accepting the US's counsel. The only country deeply committed to guarantee Israel's existence under all circumstances may have lost its leverage with Netanyahu largely owing to its own domestic disharmony, with the Democrats and the Republicans unable to evolve a common stance against a rampaging Netanyahu. Otherwise, having virtually neutralised the top brass of Hamas, and even Hezbollah, there should be no reason for Israel to try and pound Gaza into nothingness each passing hour.

Eric Cortellessa, Time's national political correspondent, interviewed the prime minister shortly after his visit to the United States, where he addressed Congress and vowed to press on with Israel's war against Hamas in Gaza.\n\nAfter asking Netanyahu about the threat posed by Iran and his handling of Hamas prior to Oct. 7, Cortellessa asked Netanyahu why the only apology he had made since the attack was to military and security officials whom he had blamed for it.\n\nThe heads of the IDF and the Shin Bet apologized for October 7. When you apologized, it was for a social media post blaming the military and security establishment. Why have you not apologized to the Israeli people for October 7?\n\nI've said that following the end of the war, there'll be an independent commission that will examine everything that happened before, and everybody will have to answer some tough questions, including me.\n\nWill you do it right now? Will you apologize?\n\nI don't think we can do it right now in the middle of a war. Apologize? Of course, of course. I am sorry, deeply, that something like this happened. And you always look back and you say, could we have done things that would have prevented it? You'd have to be -- how could you not?\n\nSure, but what is your accountability for it?\n\nI think we'll examine all that, that question, and examine it in detail, exactly what happened? How did it happen? How did this failure of intelligence, operational capability and other policies that contributed? There'll be enough time to deal with it. But I think that dealing with it now is a mistake. We're in the midst of a war, a seven-front war. I think we have to concentrate on one thing: winning.\n\nCortellessa asked Netanyahu about the many criticisms being leveled about his leadership, including that he was foolish to support Hamas in the past, that he has excessively empowered the far-right in Israel and that he might be prolonging the war to ensure that he stays in power. The prime minister batted away the concerns, saying that in each case the allegations were lies or distortions. He also said he had no plans to step aside, even as a majority of Israelis in polls say he should.\n\n\"I will stay in office as long as I believe I can help lead Israel to a future of security, enduring security and prosperity,\" he said.\n\nIn the immediate aftermath of the Oct. 7 attack, one takeaway was that Netanyahu's longstanding reputation as \"Mr. Security\" appeared to have been wiped away. In the months since, the criticism has grown. Netanyahu said he wasn't bothered and that he would continue to do what he believed was necessary to keep Israelis safe.\n\n\"I'd rather have bad press than a good obituary,\" he told Cortellessa.", "source": {"uri": "jta.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "Jewish Telegraphic Agency"}, "authors": [{"uri": "philissa_cramer@jta.org", "name": "Philissa Cramer", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamas", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hamas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benjamin_Netanyahu", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Benjamin Netanyahu"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jewish_Telegraphic_Agency", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jewish Telegraphic Agency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_Israel", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Prime Minister of Israel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_minister", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Prime minister"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerusalem", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jerusalem"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Jerusalem"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_Strip", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Iran"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Iran"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shin_Bet", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Shin Bet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israelis", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Israelis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel_Defense_Forces", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Israel Defense Forces"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Far-right_politics", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Far-right politics"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/History", "label": "dmoz/Society/History", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Security", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Security", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Strength_Sports/Tug-of-War", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Strength Sports/Tug-of-War", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 88}], "image": "https://forward.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/F240713POOLDB01.jpg?_t=1723124188", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9799815", "eventUri": "eng-9799815", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-10-07", "textStart": 74, "textEnd": 80, "freq": 6}], "sentiment": -0.05882352941176472, "wgt": 162, "relevance": 1}

He said, \"It depends on what they do. Are they capable of leading the country in war and securing a peaceful postwar situation? If they can, they should remain in power.\" He emphasized that the decision ultimately lies with the people.\n\nREAD THE FULL INTERVIEW\n\nRegarding a past decision to allow Qatari funds into Gaza, Netanyahu downplayed its impact. He suggested that the real issue was the transfer of weapons and ammunition, not financial aid. He stressed the need to cut off supply routes to prevent future terror.\n\nIn discussing past decisions, Netanyahu admitted that his main mistake was not challenging the belief that Hamas was deterred. He conceded that there was a consensus against a full-scale war in 2014 and highlighted the lack of public and international support for such an action at that time.\n\nOn the topic of his judicial overhaul and its impact on security, Netanyahu argued that military and intelligence warnings about division affecting deterrence were not applicable to Gaza. He speculated that internal political disagreements might have influenced some members of the military, but not significantly in Gaza.\n\nAddressing whether Hamas and Hezbollah exploited internal divisions in Israel, Netanyahu dismissed it as a major factor, citing that their goal to destroy Israel has long been established. He noted that plans for the attack had been in place before the judicial reforms.\n\nWhen questioned about criticism for the events of October 7th, Netanyahu likened his situation to that of past leaders facing major crises.

I appreciate your doing this. Looking forward to having this conversation about Israel's war against Hamas, broader regional threats, and the future of the world's only Jewish state. I want to start with the news. As we speak, the IDF is on high alert for awaiting an Iranian attack. Can Israel simultaneously defend itself against Hamas, Hezbollah, the Houthis, and Iran?\n\nYes.\n\nIf Iran directly attacks Israel and launches a war against it, would you ask for the United States to come to your defense?\n\nI always appreciate American support, and uh, I'd appreciate it in every case. It's already been demonstrated in the April 14th attack. But I'm not going to get into our defensive preparations, or, for that matter, our offensive preparations. We'll do what we need to do to defend ourselves.\n\nDo you think the Biden administration is sending a strong enough force posture against Iran to deter it from attacking Israel or launching an all-out war against it?\n\nThe less daylight there is between Israel and America, the more effective the deterrence on Iran and its proxies. I appreciate the fact that President Biden sent battle groups, carrier groups here at the first part of the war. I appreciate the fact that he's doing it now.\n\nIn recent years, Iran has gotten closer to a nuclear weapon. As you know, it's now enriching uranium up to 60% purity, according to the IAEA, which suspects it could develop two nuclear weapons if the uranium is enriched further. What steps is Israel taking to stop this?\n\nWell, we've been taking steps, I think the actions we took over the years have delayed Iran's enrichment, but it didn't stop it, and they're now close to being a threshold state, a nuclear state, when it comes to enrichment. There are other components of, other elements of making a nuclear weapon that they're still further away from. But I've committed -- I've said it again and again -- we'll do whatever we're able to do to prevent Iran from getting nuclear weapons. It would not only threaten us with destruction, I think it would threaten the peace of the entire world.\n\nIs full-on war with Hezbollah inevitable?\n\nWell, I think that Hezbollah has to consider the consequences of attacking Israel and uh, opening a wider war with it. I think if they're contemplating it, they should think twice.\n\nIf you don't deal with them now, are you worried that you could repeat a mistake with Hamas, where they gain even more in strength and capabilities and then catch you off guard years later?\n\nIt's very much on our minds, especially after October 7th. We're facing not merely Hamas. We're facing the broader Iran terror axis that includes Hamas, the Houthis, Hezbollah, the militias in uh, the Shiite militias in uh, Syria and Iraq and also the efforts that they're trying to do to create another front in uh, the West Bank, in Judea and Samaria. So we're facing a full-fledged Iranian axis, and we understand that we have to uh, to organize ourselves for a broader defense, which affects not only us but every country in the region, including our Arab uh, partners.\n\nSo if it doesn't happen now, do you think it will happen later?\n\nNothing is predetermined. I think the stronger you are, the stronger your alliances are, the less likely you'll have to take military action, but in order to -- but the Romans were right, you know, if you want peace, prepare for war.\n\nWhen will people in the north be able to return home?\n\nI can't quite say, to put a date on it, but that's a goal. One of our main goals is to make sure that the 60,000 or so Israelis who have been who have evacuated their homes can come back and live in their communities in peace and security. That's still the goal that we have to achieve.\n\nIn retrospect, do you think it was the right decision to evacuate those communities in the north?\n\nI think at the time, we were concerned that what we had in Gaza, that is a ground invasion and massacres, would be replicated in the north. And uh, I think that right now, our concern is how to make sure that they can come back with security.\n\nRead More: Inside the Israel-Hamas Information War\n\nI want to transition to the world before October 7, and I want to give you a chance to respond. Why did you and your government allow the Qataris to bankroll Hamas?\n\nWell, it's not only my government. It's the previous government, the government before me, and the government after me. It wasn't bankrolling Hamas. It was, in fact, supporting the civilian administration that was run by various officials, many of them non-Hamas. But the reason that successive governments agreed to that is that we wanted to make sure that Gaza has a functioning civilian administration to avoid humanitarian collapse. For example, having money to run the sewage, to the water supply, the education system, you name it. I mean the whole thing would have, could have collapsed, and we could have epidemics. We could have many other problems that we wanted to make sure that we avoid.\n\nI want to read something that you said --\n\nBut I'll add to that. That didn't prevent me from conducting three full-fledged military campaigns against Hamas in which we killed thousands of terrorists, eliminated some of their top military leadership and sought to prevent them from having the capacity to attack us. One thing we didn't do was we didn't come out to eradicate Hamas completely, because that would require a full-scale ground invasion for which we had no internal legitimacy or international legitimacy. Look at the problem we have with legitimacy now, after they conducted the worst terror onslaught on the Jewish people since the Holocaust.\n\nWell I want to come back to that in a second, but I also want to ask you about something you said in 2019 at a Likud Party meeting. I want to read it for you. \"Anyone who wants to thwart the establishment of a Palestinian state has to support bolstering Hamas and transferring money to Hamas. This is part of our strategy -- to isolate the Palestinians in Gaza.\"\n\nNever said that. Among the many mis-quotes that are attributed to me. This doesn't quite top the list, but it's close.\n\nOthers in your government I've talked to have said you wanted to give Hamas something to lose so that they didn't want to attack Israel.\n\nNo, it just didn't have the capacity. I never had any illusions about Hamas. When I resigned from Sharon's government before he left Gaza, I said, \"What will happen is that you're going to get Hamistan. You're going to get an Iranian backed terror state right at the outskirts of Tel Aviv.\" In 2014 I called Hamas \"Daesh and ISIS,\" and I said, what we have to do is constantly cut back and destroy their military capacities. But we didn't go to the -- we sort of cut the weeds, but we didn't come in to uproot them completely until October 7th. October 7th showed that those who said that Hamas was deterred were wrong. If anything, I didn't challenge enough the assumption that was common to all the security agencies.\n\nLooking back, was it a mistake to allow the Qataris to transfer money into Gaza?\n\nI don't think it made that big a difference, because the main issue was the transfer of weapons and ammunition from the Sinai into Gaza. That's what made them -- it wasn't so much a question of money. It was a question of availability, and that's why I insist now on cutting off this supply route for the, uh, in the post-Hamas period, so you don't have to resupply the resurgence of terror.\n\nWhy didn't you take out Hamas earlier? You could have gone all the way in 2014.\n\nNo I couldn't. I don't think there was -- there wasn't a consensus. There was, in fact, a consensus among the military that we shouldn't do it. But more importantly, you can overrule the military, but you can't, you can't act in a vacuum. There was no public, no domestic support for such, for such an action. There was certainly no international support for such an action, and you need both in order to -- or at least one of them in order to take such an action. I think that became evident right after the October 7 massacre.\n\nIsrael's military and intelligence services warned that your judicial overhaul was dividing Israel, and that Hezbollah and Hamas saw it as weakening Israel's deterrence. Why didn't you listen to them?\n\nThey actually made a point to say that that's not the case in Gaza. They said that it might affect the community overall, other parts of the Middle East, but they were quite specific that it didn't, didn't affect Gaza. But the more important thing is, I think that what really affected them, if anything, was the idea of someone refusing to serve. The refusal to serve because of an internal political debate. I think that, if anything, that had an effect, as it turned out, and I said this before the October 7, make no mistake, when the moment comes, we'll all be there, all factions, all factions in a domestic dispute would unite to fight as one against an attack.\n\nDo you think that they saw this as an opening, the fact that your society was so ruptured and divided?\n\nI don't think that was the key determinant. They're determined to wipe us off the map anyway. It's been Hamas's position throughout, and the plans for this attack actually preceded the judicial reform by, let me check that, but I think it's about a year.\n\nPresident Trump told me you've been \"rightfully criticized\" for October 7th. Is he wrong?\n\nI won't get into an argument, but I would say that -- criticized for what?\n\nThat it happened on your watch.\n\nWell, you know, when it happens on your watch, I suspect that I felt the same thing that President Roosevelt felt after Pearl Harbor, and President George W. Bush felt after 9/11. It happens on your watch. You try to see how it could it have been prevented. But right now my responsibility is what? To win the war, to make sure it doesn't happen again, to destroy Hamas's military capabilities so it doesn't happen.\n\nDid you discuss this with Trump at all at Mar-a-Lago?\n\nNo, but I won't get into our discussions.\n\nThe heads of the IDF and the Shin Bet apologized for October 7. When you apologized, it was for a social media post blaming the military and security establishment. Why have you not apologized to the Israeli people for October 7?\n\nI've said that following the end of the war, there'll be an independent commission that will examine everything that happened before, and everybody will have to answer some tough questions, including me.\n\nWill you do it right now? Will you apologize?\n\nI don't think we can do it right now in the middle of a war. Apologize? Of course, of course. I am sorry, deeply, that something like this happened. And you always look back and you say, could we have done things that would have prevented it? You'd have to be -- how could you not?\n\nSure, but what is your accountability for it?\n\nI think we'll examine all that, that question, and examine it in detail, exactly what happened? How did it happen? How did this failure of intelligence, operational capability and other policies that contributed? There'll be enough time to deal with it. But I think that dealing with it now is a mistake. We're in the midst of a war, a seven-front war. I think we have to concentrate on one thing: winning.\n\nAfter the assassinations of Shukr in Beirut and Haniyeh in Tehran, do you think there's still a chance for a hostage release deal?\n\nYes, I think that. I think they've actually been increased because some of the -- because I think that some of the more extreme elements that oppose the deal are no longer with us.\n\nI know that Israel has not claimed responsibility for the Haniyeh assassination, but President Biden says that killing Haniyeh was \"not helpful\" for ceasefire talks. How do you respond?\n\nI've said that we're not going to comment on that, and I haven't changed my views.\n\nU.S. officials and the hostage families fear that you're escalating tensions in the region to sabotage the ceasefire deal. What do you say to that?\n\nThat's not true. We're faced with a noose of death that Iran is trying to place around our neck, and I think the message we're sending, 360 degrees, is that we're not going to be lambs led to the slaughter. Israel is not, is not a sacrificial lamb for the Iranians or for their proxies.\n\nThere are more than 100 hostages still held in captivity. How many do you believe are still alive?\n\nYou have vowed total victory against Hamas, which, above everything else, means ending its rule of the Gaza Strip. Is removing Hamas from power a higher priority than returning the hostages?\n\nI think they're actually complementary goals. They're not mutually exclusive. The more military pressure we apply, the more we get closer to achieving both goals. One, releasing hostages. It's pure -- it's totally a function of the pressure we put on Hamas, and secondly, it advances our goal to destroy Hamas' military capabilities and make sure that it doesn't run Gaza.\n\nAre you willing to accept a deal that would release all of the hostages, but that wouldn't end Hamas's control of the Gaza Strip?\n\nNo, I don't think that. And I think there's a vast consensus in Israel that if we did that, we'll just have a repetition. There'll be future hostage taking, there'll be a future October 7, and actually worse things that could happen. So we have to achieve both goals, achieve the release of all the hostages and win the war. And I believe it's possible. By the way, we've already released, we've already achieved the release of more than half, as you know, and insisted, when the deal came forward that we increased the number, actually by 30. We went from 50 to 80 on that particular release and had others released as well in rescue operations. But I'm committed, fully committed, to releasing all the hostages. And in fact, I think that the way that we're going about it is the only way that we'll achieve that goal.\n\nYour own security chiefs in recent days have said that your demands, including for Israel to be able to resume fighting after a ceasefire hostage deal, are crippling chances of the deal. How do you respond?\n\nWell, I'm not going to get into what they're exactly saying. They're not saying that, and some of the security chiefs are saying I'm flipping. But ah, ultimately, this is a country with an army, not an army with a country. Ultimately, the responsibility of making the decision is with the political echelons of the political leaders. That's the way it works in a democracy. And sometimes you agree, sometimes you disagree. Most of the time, by the way we make decisions and with consensus, but not all the time. That applies to the United States as well. I mean, remember that I think that most of the security chiefs and the military chiefs said to President Obama that he shouldn't take out bin Laden and he decided otherwise. That happens here on occasion.\n\nBut I'll say this, that I believe the way that I'm seeking to to, to ah, achieve this deal is a way that will maximize the number of hostages that are released in the first phase, living hostages that are released in the first phase, but also that would make sure that Hamas cannot take over Gaza after the deal. That is something that would run against everything that we were talking about. It also would not secure the release of all the hostages. And I'm committed to doing that.\n\nA lot of Americans want you to end the war. Can you explain to them why it is so imperative, in your view, that the consequence of October 7 is that Hamas loses Gaza?\n\nI want to end the war. I'd end the war tomorrow, if I could. And by the way, if Hamas laid down its arms, surrendered, went into exile, the war would be over immediately. And why do we need that? Because Hamas, the Hamas enclave, the Iranian terrorist enclave, is 40 miles from Tel Aviv, okay? To leave them in place not only means that they would have the ability to repeat the savagery of October 7, but go well beyond that. When they act in unison with the Iran terror axis, with Hezbollah in the north, with the Houthis and others who are firing at us simultaneously, that's something that is unacceptable.\n\nCan Israel restore its deterrence without achieving that outcome?\n\nNo, I think that -- I think it's important to achieve it, not only because we eliminate that front so close to the center of our country and to, to our -- all the strategic facilities that we have, but also to send a message to the other elements of the Iran terror axis: You know, if you do this horrible savagery, the worst attack on the Jewish people since the Holocaust, we'll take powerful action against you, and you will not be around to try to repeat it.\n\nMr. Prime Minister, obviously, we should have no illusions about the enemy you face and the tactics they use. Hamas deliberately embeds its military infrastructure and weapons depots inside densely populated civilian areas. And of course, this all started on October 7. But in your estimation, how many Gazans have been killed in this war, and how many were civilians versus combatants?\n\nOur best assessment is about a one-to-one ratio, but it's been going down naturally. One-to-one ratio in probably the most difficult urban warfare conditions is an amazing achievement for the Israeli government. Any civilian casualty, I've said, and I'll say it again, is a tragedy.\n\nHow many have there been?\n\nWell, if it's about half. So we're talking about what 15,000, more.\n\nThe number is 40 [40,000] right now so you're saying 20 [20,000]?\n\nIt's hard to say the exact number of civilian casualties or military casualties, but it's about -- 40 is everybody. It's about half and half. Our best assessment is one-to-one. But interestingly enough, that number has been coming down, coming down precipitously, and the place where the civilian casualties have been lowest is in Rafah. We were told by the international community and by the United States, don't go into Rafah because you'll have thousands. In fact, some people said 20,000 casualties, because there were 1.4 million people in Gaza and where would they go? Well, it turns out they all went. They all left to the humanitarian zone we designated two miles from Rafah, and the number of civilians killed in, the number of terrorists we killed in, that were killed in Rafah, exceeds now 1,500. The number of civilians killed is a few dozen, most of them in a by a small diameter bomb that hit a Hamas weapons depot that killed, they say, around 40 people in Rafah, probably half of them terrorists. So the number of civilian casualties in Rafah there was supposed to be this humanitarian and civilian casualty catastrophe has turned out to be exactly the opposite, because we take action, because we tell the people to leave, because we tell them, we text message them, we send leaflets, we phone them, we tell them to leave, and they did leave, and I'm glad to see that number coming down.\n\nBy the way, we'd have nothing. None of them would come down if it wasn't for -- none of them would be actually, because you practically had no significant casualties in Gaza, if you had a condition that doesn't exist in Gaza but exists in all other urban warfare theaters where the numbers are actually higher, and that is because Gaza is locked, because the people cannot go into the Sinai. If they could, then they'd leave, completely, the war theater and Israel would not have to take the action that it takes. This is what happened in Syria. This is what happened in Iraq. This is what happened in Yemen. People leave. In Gaza, they can't leave, and we're faced with the tremendous task of making sure that we relocate them within a very narrow space. But we've done that, and I'm glad to see that we've succeeded. As we go along, we succeed better and better on this -- in Rafah, almost 100%.\n\nBut do you agree that by any estimation, this war has brought a tragic cost in human lives?\n\nOf course. Look, anytime you have civilians killed, you have -- you see. Look, I know the horrors of losing people. I know the horrors. War is hell. I think Sherman said it, and I'll tell you, it really is hell. When you lose your own soldiers, when you lose your own people, and when you see civilians killed on the other side, it's something you want to avoid. And I've been taking, and Israel has been taking, unusual methods that no military has taken in history to avoid those casualties. That's why the ratio is relatively low. Ratio is a number, obviously. To any civilian killed, to any family of a civilian killed, the statistics don't count, but looking at it in broad terms and historical terms Israel has done here under impossible conditions, impossible conditions, I think, an exemplary effort of avoiding civilian casualties or minimizing them.\n\nDennis Ross said after October 7 that you needed to create humanitarian corridors at the very beginning of the conflict to prevent civilian casualties. Why didn't you?\n\nWe did. That's completely contrary to the fact. Of course we did. We created humanitarian zones and safe zones right away and people moved there.\n\nThere have been multiple reports of Palestinian civilians who died because they couldn't get access to medical care. Why didn't you set up field hospitals for Gazans the way you did for Ukrainians and Syrians?\n\nFirst of all, we did. I mean, we asked others to do it because we weren't in the safe zones. We wanted them to go to the safe zone. But we enabled the Emiratis to create the field hospitals. We enabled others to do the same, and they were working hospitals. The problem is that a lot of the Palestinian hospitals in Gaza weren't hospitals at all. They became command posts for Hamas. We went into these hospitals. You barely found patients. You found terrorists. You found weapons depots. You found communication centers, military communication centers. You found tunnels leading in and out of the hospitals. That's one of the problems we had to contend with.\n\nIsrael reportedly used AI systems called Lavender and Where's Daddy? to identify Hamas targets and bomb them in their homes. Is that true?\n\nI'm not going to get into our intelligence gathering capabilities.\n\nSenior Israeli officials confirmed the program to multiple reports. Are they lying?\n\nThey may have, I don't.\n\nMore than 2 million people in Gaza face food insecurity. The U.N. has warned of a famine in Gaza, and more than 30 children have reportedly died of malnutrition. The U.N. says you are using starvation as a weapon of war. How do you respond?\n\nThat's not true. We've gone out of our way to enable humanitarian assistance since the beginning of the war, we enabled some 40,000 aid trucks to come in. That's 500, half a million tons of food, okay, half a million tons. We paved roads to enable those trucks to go in. We opened land crossings to enable those trucks to go in. We allowed airdrops. We allowed sea transport. And in fact, the calorie count right now, the average calories that every man, woman, and child in Gaza could reach, could have, is about, is over 3,000 calories, which is well, well beyond subsistence levels. We take hundreds, thousands of prisoners, thousands of prisoners, Palestinian prisoners. The first thing we do is to make sure that they don't have suicide belts, suicide vests on. So we ask them to take their shirts off. Find me one example, one, of an emaciated person, you won't find even one. Sometimes you find the opposite. That's simply not true. So these reports are not reliable. The markets in Jabalia, in other parts of Gaza, are full of food and so on. That doesn't mean that there weren't stoppages in food. There were, but it's not because Israel didn't enable the supply. It's not because Israel blocked the supply of food, but because Hamas stole it. That's the problem.\n\nWell, on that note, Hamas loots the aid. Everyone knows that. But you're not using the IDF to secure distribution of the aid. You've got your forces in Gaza. You could prevent looting. Why aren't you doing that?\n\nThat is a very important debate that is happening within our own quarters. Because the way you could do it is actually to put in a lot more military force, actually occupy Gaza and run Gaza. And we'd like to avoid that. We'd like to have, to take out Hamas's military, but have a civilian administration, a civilian Gazan administration run this. So far. And we're working on how to do it. The less I speak about how we're going to do it, the more likely --\n\nThe sooner the better but one of the things we try to do is recruit local Gazans to do exactly what you said, to distribute the food. And the first thing that happened is Hamas murdered them. So we're working on other possibilities. But again, the less I talk about it, the more likely that it will materialize.\n\nWhy have none of the Israelis who destroyed food supplies for Gazans been prosecuted?\n\nThey have. I don't know. I don't know that they're not prosecuted. My instructions were, and the cabinet's instructions were, to take all the actions, the legal actions that are required, the law enforcement action to stop these people from blocking the roads. And they tried. They did, but I think we generally put a stop to that.\n\nThe groups that have done this are still eligible for tax-deductible donations. Would you get rid of that for them?\n\nI have no idea who's doing what. I've asked the police, the law enforcement agencies, to do what they need to do to prevent this. And they are. In fact, I think most of it has stopped.\n\nAs Prime Minister and as head of the war cabinet, do you accept responsibility for the treatment of Palestinian prisoners?\n\nYeah, of course. We think this is -- we're a country of laws. You have to obey the laws, the laws of war. It means that if there are any transgressions, they have to be investigated, if necessary, prosecuted. It's not a question.\n\nSir there have been reports by the U.N. and other watchdogs that Israeli military forces have abused Palestinian prisoners, including through sleep deprivation, waterboarding, dog attacks, even sexual assault. What are you doing about this alleged abuse?\n\nWe have our own independent agencies, our own independent means to monitor any, any transgressions of this kind. Israel, I think, is famous for that. It has what is called a proper judicial system, both inside the military and outside the military. In fact, it's about, it probably has the most independent legal system on the planet, so the argument that we're not investigating this is ridiculous.\n\nWell, speaking of those who are being investigated, I want to ask you about what happened at Sde Teiman. After a Palestinian detainee was rushed to the hospital with severe wounds to his anus after being sexually assaulted with a pole, far-right protesters, including some lawmakers, stormed a detention center to protest the arrest of nine alleged suspects. How will they be held accountable?\n\nNobody can storm into a military base, nobody can interfere, should interfere, with the law enforcement agencies. That's a critical position that I've held, and I don't care if it comes from the right or from the left. In fact, one of the things that I think we need to do is to make sure that law enforcement is uniform and tough, and it hasn't always been, but it should be.\n\nWhen you condemned this riot, you said we don't storm detention centers, and you said we also don't block roads, referring to the hostage protesters and the judicial reform protesters. Why would you equate those two?\n\nI also said that there was a case where protesters, where a leading protester, was taken into a military police station and then into a court, and thousands stormed the police station, and I believe the court as well. And actually it was released under that kind of pressure. That was wrong then, they may have set an example of somebody else that was wrong, and this is wrong. I don't accept either one.\n\nHas Ben Gvir created an atmosphere of permissive violence against Palestinian prisoners? Should he resign or be fired?\n\nI don't believe that we should allow any of that to happen. That's not the policy of the government, and I don't think that anybody seriously believes that we won't enforce the laws. We do enforce them. We did in this case, we did. We should in all cases.\n\nWhat do you say to your detractors who argue that your prosecution of the war in Gaza is creating a new generation of terrorists and thereby jeopardizing Israel's security instead of ensuring it?\n\nI think this is absurd. We have a terrorist enclave, an Iranian backed terrorist enclave committed to the destruction of Israel. The more they believe that they can achieve it, that's how you're going to get more terrorism um in the future. The only way that you destroy these people, who as I say committed the worst outrage against the Jewish people since the Holocaust, is to make sure that they're defeated. It's like, would you say that the allies' action against Nazis created more Nazis? Of course not. You had to destroy that regime. Doesn't mean that there aren't neo-Nazis today in Germany, but for the last 80 years, Germany has not had a Nazi regime and has had a democratic regime. I don't know if we can achieve a democratic regime in Gaza, but we have to make sure that this Hamas and their ilk do not run Gaza, and that's the only thing that will create hope for a new generation of Palestinians, as long as they believe that Gaza is going to be run by Hamas, you're not going to get a new generation of people that can live in peace with Israel.\n\nI want to shift to your vision for a post-war Gaza. You've described total victory as achieving three things: Number one, destroying Hamas's military infrastructure and removing it from power. Number two, liberating the hostages. Number three, installing a new civilian Palestinian governing entity that can rule over Gaza and not threaten Israel. The Israeli military has a plan for number one. Everybody knows the basic outlines for number two, but what is your plan for number three?\n\nWell, it involves two basic things, demilitarization and de-radicalization. Demilitarization means that you have to make sure that Hamas is destroyed, but also cannot recover itself. And that means, first of all, preventing the smuggling of weapons and terrorists from the Sinai into Gaza. That's why I insist on control, continued control of the Philadelphi corridor between Egypt, between the Sinai and Gaza. But it also means that for the foreseeable future, until another force emerges, Israel will have to have the job of actually, the overriding security responsibility of taking action against any attempt at terrorist resurgence. Second thing is, I'd like to see a civilian administration run by Gazans, perhaps with the support of regional partners, that runs the civilian administration in Gaza. Demilitarization by Israel, civilian administration by Gaza.\n\nTell us the details.\n\nAnd of course, also changing what is taught in schools, what is taught in the mosque. This is essentially what the United States did in the post-war period in Germany and Japan. It did demilitarization and it did de-radicalization, and those countries have been in peace with the United States for close to a century now.\n\nTo an outside observer, that sounds like something that would take a generation to achieve. Could you provide specific details of a plan that the Israeli people, the Americans, and the rest of the world can view as a credible way to get there?\n\nI don't think it's instantaneous. I think it will take some time to do, but I think that's the only reasonable thing to try to do, unless you want a repetition of what happened.\n\nHow long do you think it will take?\n\nI think we should start as soon as we can. And that's what we're working on right now.\n\nWhat Arab countries are you talking to about the creation of such a Palestinian government?\n\nThe less I talk about it, the more likely that we'll have some success.\n\nWell, reportedly, you're talking to Egypt, the UAE and Jordan. Is that right?\n\nYou're a reporter. You're free to ask anyone you want.\n\nI mean, are these nations really going to want to come in riding on the backs of Israeli tanks?\n\nI'll say this, look, I think that everybody understands, even though they don't say it publicly, that the defeat of Hamas not only serves Israel's purpose, it serves also the interests of peace and security in the entire region, whether they openly admit it or not. They certainly told that to us in private conversations.\n\nIn the past, you had talked about \"state minus\" for Palestinians, or \"autonomy plus.\" But can you explain why the end point to resolving this conflict is not a Palestinian state?\n\nI've always said that my vision for an arrangement, a long-term arrangement, with the Palestinians would mean that they should have all the powers to govern themselves but none of the powers to threaten us. That means that the overriding security responsibility will be left in Israel's hands, and that's a detraction of sovereign powers. There's no question about it. That's the only reasonable arrangement that we could have. In fact, when we left areas adjacent to Israel and relinquished our, that power, we had an immediate entry and takeover by Iran's proxies, Hezbollah in Lebanon, when we left Lebanon, Hamas when we left Gaza. So I don't think we should repeat that mistake. We have to have the capacity to ensure overall security by Israel. That means that any arrangement with the Palestinians would have those powers that they need to govern themselves, but not the powers that could threaten us. Chief of them -- security.\n\nBut even if you maintain security control, the U.S. has bases in South Korea, in Japan, in Germany. They've got a presence everywhere. I mean, could you not maintain some level of security, or the security control you need, even though it's less sovereignty than other countries, and allow them to have a state of their own?\n\nWell, I don't get into the labels. I get into the content, and the content is again, the critical powers that relate to security must rely, must rest in Israel's hands, until you prove to me that there's another force that could take over, and I don't see that in the immediate future, although if you did show me that, I would consider it.\n\nPresident Biden told TIME last spring that people should have \"every reason to believe\" that you are prolonging the war for your own political self preservation. How do you respond?\n\nThat's simply not true. I don't need to. I'm not concerned with my political preservation. I'm concerned with my country's preservation, and right now, I'm not prolonging it. I would end it as quickly as possible. In fact, the more assistance we have, the faster we will solve it. That's what I said in Congress. I paraphrased Churchill. He said, \"Give us the tools and we'll do the job and we'll finish the job.\" I said, \"Give us the tools faster and we'll finish the job faster.\" And that remains my position.\n\nYour critics here in Israel and abroad say you don't want to end the war because you will be voted out and then have to face possible sentencing for charges of fraud, bribery and breach of trust. I know the trial has been ongoing as Prime Minister, but how do you respond to those charges?\n\nWell, firstly, that. I mean, there's no -- there's this canard, this narrative that I'm prolonging the war is false. I'm trying to bring the war to as speedy an end as possible. Second, my trial is proceeding in Israel. The political leaders have no immunity from prosecution or legal procedures. In fact, my trial has been going on for three years. It's totally independent of what is happening on the outside, just because Israel has an independent judiciary. It's not subject to the whims of any political leader. And by the way, that trial is unraveling now. You don't hear about it very much, but it's really unraveling. So this is totally not the issue. It's a bogus issue. I'm surprised sometimes when senior journalists, not like yourself, actually write op-eds in the world's leading papers explaining that I'm trying to prolong the war to prevent my going on trial.\n\nBefore October 7, you were on the cusp of a Saudi normalization agreement. I know it's not over. But Ghazi Hamad of Hamas, I talked to him last fall, said that Hamas attacked Israel with the goal of not only trying to stop the deal, but to trigger an Israeli response that would turn the world against you. Take what he says with a grain of salt. But to that end, haven't they succeeded?\n\nNo, I think that they won't succeed, because once we win, I think things will fall in place, and actually, the Saudi deal will become more likely. In any case, I haven't given up on the deal. I was --\n\nBut the world has treated Israel as a global pariah over the last 10 months.\n\nThat says something about the world, not about Israel. Here's a democracy fighting against the worst savagery that we've seen on the planet for many decades, and the fact that democratic governments are subjected to internal pressure from fringe groups and do not support Israel completely or are willing to accommodate these extremists should be leveled at them, not at Israel.\n\nAre you worried that this is shaping the perception of Israel for the next generation of not only Americans but everywhere, and that this will have long-term implications for your security?\n\nYes, but being destroyed has bigger implications about Israel's security, so I'd rather have bad press than a good obituary.\n\nThe Saudis say they want a Palestinian state, or at least they want you to be moving toward one eventually. How is it possible to strike a Saudi normalization deal when you have Ben-Gvir and Smotrich changing the conditions on the ground to rule out a Palestinian state, or even state minus as you've called it?\n\nLook, all Israeli governments have been based in parliamentary systems [and] are based on coalitions. Everyone's done it. Previous governments even made a coalition with a party that is affiliated with the Muslim Brotherhood and rejects the very survival of Israel. I didn't hear any criticism about that. But one thing I can assure you, I run the show, I make the decisions. I formulate the policy.\n\nSo I understand what goes into cobbling together a coalition, and it was hard the last couple of years.\n\nWell you lived here.\n\nAnd there were a lot of elections in a short period of time. But why did you give Ben-Gvir and Smotrich such positions of power?\n\nWell, I think that's a natural allocation. That's what the voters decide. And also some of the parties who could have joined me decided not to join me, some of the other parties. And I was very glad when one of them joined our coalition at the beginning of the war, and I was sorry to see them leave. It's their decision. So I think you should ask -- that's the way the democratic cookie crumbles.\n\nWhat other coalition could they have been a part of?\n\nNo, I'm saying that the other parties refused. You need a government. You need a majority to govern, okay? When parties who refuse to join the coalition means that Israel is left without a government.\n\nDid you have to put them in those positions?\n\nI won't get into coalition negotiations. Maybe they wanted an even more influential job. And that's fine. I mean, that's okay. But ultimately, I think we decided, I think what, what the people of Israel decided in free, democratic elections.\n\nSmotrich once said that you are, as he said, \"with us full on\" when it comes to his West Bank annexation plans. Is he wrong?\n\nI don't know if he said that, but if he said this, it's not true, because I've not sought annexation. I've explained that our goal is to achieve a negotiated solution. So far, it hasn't happened, and I hope it will happen one day, but I can't see it happening without some substantial change in the Palestinian Authority. They teach their children basically the same thing that Hamas teaches them: that Israel has to be destroyed, it has to be dissolved. They glorify suicide bombers. They pay for slay, the more Jews you kill, more they give the families of these murderers, or the murderers themselves. This doesn't bode well for peace. But I think that many of our Arab neighbors understand that, except they won't say it openly.\n\nWill you commit to not going forward on West Bank annexation, right here and now?\n\nThat is not where we're going.\n\nPart of what the U.S. is offering for Saudi-Israel normalization is support for their nuclear industry. Are you worried that Saudi Arabia is heading toward nuclear weapons status and that that will lead to nuclear proliferation in the Middle East?\n\nI think that we'd be concerned with anything that had that possibility. I'm sure the United States is concerned with that too.\n\nI want to talk about the U.S.-Israel relationship. There may be two things that are most essential for securing Israel's long-term survival. First and foremost, the will and the resilience of the Israeli people. Second, sustained bipartisan support for Israel in Washington. There have been periods of bipartisan fracture over Israeli security in the past, with Eisenhower, George Herbert Walker Bush, Obama, but what worries Israel's supporters --\n\nPresident Johnson.\n\nPresident Johnson, for sure -- is the generational change that comes with the passing of a generation that lived through the Holocaust and its aftermath. They worry that a fragmentation of support for Israel in this era and beyond is fundamentally different than it was 20 or 50 years ago. Are you worried about that?\n\nYes. I still think Israel enjoys the broad support of the broad swath of the American people. And that's been brought up by one poll after another, but you're quite right. In the Harvard-Harris poll, 80% of Americans consistently asked, when they ask, Would you support Israel or Hamas? They support Israel, but 20% support Hamas. And when you look at it, that's not very dissimilar from the 20% who say bin Laden was in the right and America was in the wrong. So something fundamental is going on in America. I don't think that the much-reported erosion of support among some quarters of the American public is related to Israel. It's more related to America. What is happening in America itself? America is undergoing significant internal changes. I hope that, and I believe that it will, it will maintain its position as the defender of liberty and the defender of democracy in the world. I fully agree with that, but I don't think it's Israel. Israel hasn't changed its policies. It's not that. It's that, in many ways, the United States is undergoing change, and I hope that the bipartisan support, which you're right is essential for Israel, remains intact.\n\nWell, I mean, Smotrich, at least, under his remit, is approving these unauthorized outposts. He's streamlining the settlement approval process. He's changing the bureaucratic process to advance his ideological agenda. Is that not a change in policy?\n\nNo, I don't think so. I think that this is way overblown. It doesn't fundamentally change the footprint of the Jewish communities in Judea and Samaria, the West Bank. I mean, just take a photo, you know, take a satellite photo and compare it, and you see that there hasn't been that change that people are talking about. But we are committed. It's part of our homeland. We intend to stay there. We're not going to do ethnic cleansing of Jews anymore than we're going to do ethnic cleansing of Arabs.\n\nYou got 57 standing ovations last week, but nearly 130 Democrats skipped your speech, including Kamala Harris, who's one of two people who will be the next president. Why should Israelis trust you to maintain bipartisan support for Israel in Washington?\n\nWell, I'm doing everything I can to do it. And I don't come to Washington as a Republican or as a Democrat. I come as an Israeli. I seek agreement wherever I can, but I also stand up for Israel wherever I must. And I've done that not only with Democratic presidents or Democratic administrations. I opposed some of the policies of George H.W. Bush, a Republican. I opposed the policies of George W. Bush on Operation Defensive Shield, when he said Israel has to leave right away. And I came out against that. And I spoke to 50 senators at the time against the policy, which I thought was inimical to Israel's interest, and by the way, I thought to America's interest, too. So I do what I can to stand up for Israel when I can. The Israeli prime minister has to be able to say two things. He has to say no when he must and yes when he can. And that's what I did.\n\nA number of decisions that you made in recent years have alienated Democrats. The perception that you supported Mitt Romney over Obama in 2012, your attempts to prevent the Iran nuclear deal, and your most recent address to Congress against originally the wishes of Joe Biden. Why would you want to risk removing that strut of bipartisan support at a time like this?\n\nI don't want to risk bipartisan support. I want to, uh, in fact, mobilize it, as I tried to do in the speech, in order to, in this speech and in previous efforts, in order to mobilize bipartisan support, even at the face of a changing electorate for Israel's vital goals of survival. That's what I do. And in any case, I don't intervene. Contrary to reports, I don't intervene in American politics, and I expect others not to intervene in ours.\n\nAmerican college campuses were overtaken this spring with protests against Israel's war in Gaza. Polls find that young people sympathize more with the Palestinians. Are you losing the support of the next generation of Americans, including Jews?\n\nWell, I think we have a big job to do. I'm concerned with it. It's not something that I think is, I don't -- I'm not facile about it. I don't say, well, it doesn't concern me. Of course it concerns me. But I think it should concern America too. Because when the young generation supports these murderers, these rapists, these beheaders of women, these burners of babies, then there's a problem that America has. It's not a problem that Israel has.\n\nBut what are you going to do to repair this? This is a gathering storm.\n\nTry to speak the truth, as I did last week in Congress, and I was glad about the reception that it received. It was very broadly received, by the way, well received across the partisan line, not everyone, but I was very gratified to see the reaction in a very broad audience in America, and by the way, around the world. People heard the truth. It's hard to [unintelligible] truth because you have the preponderance of hostile elements because of numerical superiority. And in social media and in some instruments of it is, in particular, and it shapes the minds of young people who use that social media. That's a big problem. We should all be concerned with that, and not just about Israel.\n\nWell, I think the fact -- ignorance. More than anything else, ignorance. The lack of knowledge. Some of these people who are protesting have no idea what they're protesting. They still don't believe that Hamas actually committed these outrages.\n\nYou recently met with Vice President Harris. Where do you think she stands on Israel and on the current situation in the Middle East?\n\nFirst of all, I was very glad to have the opportunity to speak with her, as I did with President Biden and with President Trump. She spoke about her support for Israel. That doesn't mean that we don't have disagreements. I've had disagreements with the American presidents. I have had many agreements with them at the same time.\n\nWhy did your office criticize her remarks following the meeting? You may need her in the coming years.\n\nI simply said, and I said this in the meeting with her and with the President, as well, and with President Trump, that the closer Israel, at this crucial time, the closer America, the American and Israeli positions are, the more it achieves a positive result. People always look for daylight. But in times of war, they look through a microscope. And we have a common goal. We want the release of the hostages. We want peace restored. I want it after an Israeli victory, so the more we're aligned the better we are.\n\nPolls show that 72% of Israelis think you should leave office either now or when the war is over. Do you intend to remain Prime Minister when the war is over?\n\nI will stay in office as long as I believe I can help lead Israel to a future of security, enduring security and prosperity. But it doesn't only depend on me. We're in a democracy, the decision of who stays in office and who's not is ultimately dependent on people. I've been re-elected six times. I lost twice. That can happen in a democracy.\n\nShould you remain Prime Minister?\n\nWell for the moment, I think that I'm leading the effort that protects the country and assures its path to victory, which I think is getting closer.\n\nIf an opposition leader presided over the worst security failure in Israel's history, would you say they should stay in power?\n\nIt depends what they do. What do they do? Are they capable of leading the country in war? Can they lead it to victory? Can they assure that the post-war situation will be one of peace and security? If the answer is yes, they should stay in power. In any case, that's the decision of the people.\n\nWhat do you have to do to earn the ability to remain Prime Minister after this?\n\nI don't care about remaining Prime Minister. I care about preserving the -- we're not talking about my future. We're talking about the future of the country. I've dedicated my adult life, first as a soldier and then as a diplomat and then as a political leader, to assure the survival and security of the State of Israel and its prosperity, by turning, basically liberating its economy. And as long as I feel I can contribute to that, I'll do it. And as long as the people feel it. This is not -- we don't live in a monarchy. We live in a democracy.\n\nWell, that's right. And you've been Prime Minister for, what, roughly 18 years now?\n\nNot yet but --\n\nAlmost, almost there. Almost 18 years. What other other leaders of democratic countries or democratic societies have been in power for that long?\n\nWell they tried.\n\nDo you think it's good for a democracy to have the same leader in power for 18 years?\n\nI think it depends on the people. They choose, and they decide who really works for them. But it's not a personal decision. I don't dictate it any more than people think that I dictate everything that happens, even in the military. Usually, it's done by consensus for those decisions. But yes, ultimately the responsibility is for the Prime Minister and the cabinet, and it's the people who decide who will be the Prime Minister and the cabinet. This is, you know, this is not -- the people decide that. It's not. It's not something that is governed by rules. If you ask me, when is the last time that somebody did that? I think it's more than half a century ago, I don't know, in Canada or Australia or something, but politics, you know, it's not because I exactly have exorbitant powers. I don't control the press or the judiciary or the other institutions. It's the people who decide in free democratic elections, and I'm glad Israel has them.\n\nYou certainly don't control the press here in Israel, I know that.\n\nThe picture that is given is that I'm some kind of, you know, I have these fantastic powers that somehow ensure that I govern. In fact, I don't. The people have the power they decide.\n\nI know we're coming to the end. I want to get to the last few questions. Former Prime Ministers Yitzhak Rabin, Shimon Peres, Ehud Barak, even Ariel Sharon, all said that Israel needed to allow for the establishment of a Palestinian state to preserve the Zionist ideal of remaining a Jewish-majority democracy. Do you agree with that?\n\nWell, I agree we should maintain a Jewish majority, but I think we should do it in democratic means. I also think that the, and I don't want to -- that's why I don't want to incorporate the Palestinians in Judea and Samaria as citizens of Israel. I think there's a potential solution there. And again, I think it means that they should run their own lives. They should vote for their own institutions. They should have their own self-governance. But they should not have the power to threaten us.\n\nAnd I understand and appreciate that. But can Israel remain a democracy if it continuously, perpetually rules over the millions of Palestinians?\n\nI don't. We don't rule their land. We don't run Ramallah. We don't run Jenin. But we go in and take action when we have to prevent terrorism. It's a question of -- I think it's a conceptual trap that people are locked in. They think that the only possibility is complete, unabridged sovereignty. That doesn't happen in the economic field. Right now, you have countries that are subservient to larger institutions, external institutions, that govern, for example, in the E.U. you have that, okay, you have that. But not only there, you have it in many other places. The idea that the one thing that we should do is forfeit our security by giving absolute sovereignty to the Palestinians in the future without having the ability to prevent the emergence of terror or other security threats from adjacent areas is nonsensical. It doesn't bode well for peace. It guarantees that you won't move towards peace. You move towards war, which is what happened time and again, when we left, when we took out the military control from territories adjacent to us. Just think about that. I mean, you come from New Jersey, right?\n\nWell, I lived there at one point.\n\nClose to New York, right? Can you imagine? I said this to one of my interlocutors. Can you imagine that you would enable the establishment of a state committed to the destruction of America across the Washington Bridge? I mean, that's not going to happen. That's what people are asking Israel to do. The distances are so tiny, Israel would potentially be so fragile and unable to defend itself. And those who say to us, just give them a state five meters away, not thousands of miles away but a mile away, and relinquish the power to intervene militarily in such a state if it becomes, as it is, hostile to you, it doesn't make sense.\n\nDon't you think it's the duty of a responsible Prime Minister to preserve the conditions for an eventual two-state outcome?\n\nI don't call it, I don't label it, but I said before, I don't wish to govern the Palestinians, but I certainly would not let them threaten the existence of the one and only Jewish state. So there will have to be a division of power.\n\nA lot of Israelis and American Jews worry that Zionism, as I just described it, will not survive this war. What do you say to that?\n\nWell, it will, if we win. And if we don't, our future will be in great jeopardy. So we have to win, and it requires resolution. It requires looking both at the military actions, but also looking at the larger picture of the Iran axis working discreetly with Arab partners to shape the post-war period, the post-war Middle East, which we're doing and seeking to maintain, and in fact intensify the support of the United States and other democracies. It doesn't happen in the heat of war. I can understand that as far as Western public opinion, but when the dust settles, I think people will see that we waged the essential war, not only for our defense, but for the defense of the West and civilization against barbarism.", "source": {"uri": "time.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "TIME"}, "authors": [{"uri": "eric_cortellessa@time.com", "name": "Eric Cortellessa", "type": "author",

July 13, 2024. (Dudu Bachar/Pool/Flash 90)\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has apologized for the Oct. 7 attack by Hamas in which more than 1,200 Israelis were killed and more than 250 were taken hostage.\n\n\"I am sorry, deeply, that something like this happened,\" he told Time Magazine during an hourlong interview this week in Jerusalem.\n\nThe interview, which Time published in full, was Netanyahu's first major one with any news organization since Oct. 7. Eric Cortellessa, Time's national political correspondent, interviewed the prime minister shortly after his visit to the United States, where he addressed Congress and vowed to press on with Israel's war against Hamas in Gaza.\n\nAfter asking Netanyahu about the threat posed by Iran and his handling of Hamas prior to Oct. 7, Cortellessa asked Netanyahu why the only apology he had made since the attack was to military and security officials whom he had blamed for it.\n\nThe heads of the IDF and the Shin Bet apologized for October 7. When you apologized, it was for a social media post blaming the military and security establishment. Why have you not apologized to the Israeli people for October 7?\n\nI've said that following the end of the war, there'll be an independent commission that will examine everything that happened before, and everybody will have to answer some tough questions, including me.\n\nWill you do it right now? Will you apologize?\n\nI don't think we can do it right now in the middle of a war. Apologize? Of course, of course. I am sorry, deeply, that something like this happened. And you always look back and you say, could we have done things that would have prevented it? You'd have to be -- how could you not?\n\nSure, but what is your accountability for it?\n\nI think we'll examine all that, that question, and examine it in detail, exactly what happened? How did it happen? How did this failure of intelligence, operational capability and other policies that contributed? There'll be enough time to deal with it. But I think that dealing with it now is a mistake. We're in the midst of a war, a seven-front war. I think we have to concentrate on one thing: winning.\n\nCortellessa asked Netanyahu about the many criticisms being leveled about his leadership, including that he was foolish to support Hamas in the past, that he has excessively empowered the far-right in Israel and that he might be prolonging the war to ensure that he stays in power. The prime minister batted away the concerns, saying that in each case the allegations were lies or distortions. He also said he had no plans to step aside, even as a majority of Israelis in polls say he should.\n\n\"I will stay in office as long as I believe I can help lead Israel to a future of security, enduring security and prosperity,\" he said.\n\nIn the immediate aftermath of the Oct. 7 attack, one takeaway was that Netanyahu's longstanding reputation as \"Mr. Security\" appeared to have been wiped away. In the months since, the criticism has grown. Netanyahu said he wasn't bothered and that he would continue to do what he believed was necessary to keep Israelis safe.\n\n\"I'd rather have bad press than a good obituary,\" he told Cortellessa.", "source": {"uri": "jta.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "Jewish Telegraphic Agency"}, "authors": [{"uri": "philissa_cramer@jta.org", "name": "Philissa Cramer", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamas", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hamas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benjamin_Netanyahu", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Benjamin Netanyahu"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_Israel", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Prime Minister of Israel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ministry_of_Defense_(Israel)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ministry of Defense (Israel)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_minister", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Prime minister"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tel_Aviv", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tel Aviv"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tel Aviv"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerusalem", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jerusalem"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Jerusalem"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_Strip", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shin_Bet", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Shin Bet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israelis", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Israelis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel_Defense_Forces", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Israel Defense Forces"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Iran"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Iran"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Far-right_politics", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Far-right politics"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 87}], "image": "https://www.jta.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/F240713POOLDB01.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9799815", "eventUri": "eng-9799815", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-10-07", "textStart": 216, "textEnd": 222, "freq": 6}, {"amb": false, "date": "2013-07-", "textStart": 107, "textEnd": 114}], "sentiment": -0.1137254901960785, "wgt": 149, "relevance": 1}

Israel has broken that rule, and the impression is that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his commanders not only find the cessation of attacks undesirable, but they are also actively seeking to avoid any prospect of stopping the war which has claimed the lives of tens of thousands of civilians, two-thirds of whom were women and children, in what many describe as a fully-fledged genocide and war crime.\n\nRumors swirling not only in Tel Aviv point to this being driven by Netanyahu's own desperation for political survival and to lengthen the military operation against Gaza so to avoid the prospects of standing trial for a catalogue of criminal charges which threaten to send him to prison for a lengthy term. Considering the Israeli context where daily protests are taking place demanding the cessation of attacks, the release of remaining hostages and the return of traumatized soldiers from front-line duty, those rumors sit extremely uneasy with those who side with Israel.\n\nIt is also clear to many that Netanyahu is actively seeking to expand the lines of war northward towards Lebanon, and to somehow engage Iran through a series of provocations, including this latest operation which embarrasses Iran to no end. In his desperation to prove to his own population, as well as to his main allies, that the past 10 months of death, devastation and utter carnage delivered on Gaza, have not been in vain, the opening of new war fronts will, in Netanyahu's estimation, shut up the critics and get the Americans and hopefully the Brits involved in actively defending \"the only democracy in the Middle East.\" According to Netanyahu, should Iran, or even its proxy in Lebanon Hezbollah, engage militarily with Israel, the Western world will have no choice but to back Israel.\n\nHowever, it's a huge gamble, and only a man in the kind of desperate situation as Netanyahu finds himself, would consider it worth doing.\n\nAssassination of Ismail Haniyeh will prove a turning point\n\nFor more than 300 days, Israel has managed to malign itself to the world in ways that billions of dollars poured into public relations (PR) campaigns would never have succeeded in doing. In every country that is considered an ally of Israel, most of their people have decided that Israel stands in breach of international law and has committed a crime beyond anyone's imagination. Israel's arrogance and stubbornness in defending that crime has only led to even more on-the-fencers jump to the side of Palestinians against an untenable and indefensible Israeli position. The long-lasting impact and implication of this is terrifying to ordinary Israelis, adding further pressure on an increasingly politically embattled prime minister.\n\nWhether the assassination of Ismail Haniyeh will prove a turning point in this ongoing catastrophe, remains to be seen. However, the fact that Israel under Netanyahu is unwilling to stop its killing crusade against the defenseless Gazans, despite its claim to the opposite, and its attempts to expand the borders of its hostilities to force Iran to engage, is beyond doubt. That will have both internal as well as global impacts of untold proportions on the present and future of Israel.\n\n*Opinions expressed in this article are the author's own and do not necessarily reflect the editorial policy of Anadolu", "source": {"uri": "aa.com.tr", "dataType": "news", "title": "Anadolu Ajans\u0131"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamas", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hamas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benjamin_Netanyahu", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Benjamin Netanyahu"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassination", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Assassination"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Iran"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Iran"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ceasefire", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Ceasefire"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_Strip", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ismail_Haniyeh", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ismail Haniyeh"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crusades", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Crusades"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_Israel", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Prime Minister of Israel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_crime", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "War crime"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genocide", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Genocide"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tel_Aviv", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tel Aviv"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tel Aviv"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lebanon", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lebanon"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Lebanon"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinians", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Palestinians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proxy_war", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Proxy war"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hezbollah", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hezbollah"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_law", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "International law"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_world", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Western world"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_minister", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Prime minister"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democracy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Democracy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_East", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Middle East"}, "location": null}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 95}], "image": "https://cdnuploads.aa.com.tr/uploads/Contents/2024/08/08/thumbs_b_c_3ad612491ab19975328208261d61f584.jpg?v=124430", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9799815", "eventUri": "eng-9799815", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.7176470588235294, "wgt": 149, "relevance": 1}

He first became prime minister in 1996, staying in office until 1999.

In total, the coalition has 64 mandates out of 120.\n\nIn light of Israel's ongoing military operation in the Gaza Strip since October 2023, launched in response to an attack by Hamas, there have been repeated calls in Israel for the resignation of Netanyahu's Cabinet and a new election.

Netanyahu, who faces a criminal trial for corruption once he is out of office, has been accused of repeatedly sabotaging peace deals, so he can keep the war going and remain in power.\n\nWhile in the U.S., Netanyahu met with Biden, Vice President and Democrat presidential nominee Kamala Harris, and former President Donald Trump.\n\nAccording to Israeli media reports, Netanyahu was \"irked\" with Harris, who had told the Israeli prime minister that he should accept the deal with Hamas and treat Palestinians better.\n\nMultiple analysts contend that these warmongering acts were ultimately intended to box in Washington and force the U.S. into a war that an overwhelming majority of Americans do not want.", "source": {"uri": "americanfreepress.net", "dataType": "news", "title": "American

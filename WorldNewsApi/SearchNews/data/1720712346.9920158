{"id": 231992270, "title": "On the Subject of Expensive Big Macs, McDonald\u2019s Isn\u2019t to Blame", "text": "Share to Facebook Share to Twitter Share to Linkedin Talmon Joseph Smith and Jordyn Holman of the New York Times recently reported that \u201cOver the past year, a series of indignant McDonald\u2019s customers took to social media and posted receipts of orders they feel were overpriced.\u201d Adding the empirical to the emotional, Smith and Holman note that since 2019 the price of a Big Mac has risen 21 percent, from $4.39 to $5.29. The tendency of late, from President Biden on down to social-media using everymen, is to blame McDonald\u2019s for the prices on its menus. The criticism implies that McDonald\u2019s goes out of its way to overcharge its customers in order to boost profits. The criticism is without merit. To see the absurdity of it, it\u2019s useful to simply start out with the basics. Ever eager to keep prices as low as possible, self-ordering kiosks can increasingly be found in McDonald\u2019s stores. Consider what happens as the customer taps out the order desired. As each item is added, the bill increases. Of essential note, once the customer taps to complete the order, a final price comes up on the screen along with offers of other items for the customer to buy. Call this automated upselling. In contemplating the upselling, stop and think about allegations from Biden on down to the social-media active that McDonald\u2019s is presently gouging its customers. Such a view implies that McDonald\u2019s is purposely trying to cannibalize its own stores by overcharging for Big Macs so that they have fewer dollars to purchase other items from a McDonald\u2019s menu that extends well beyond Big Macs. The simple, rather basic truth missed by McDonald\u2019s critics is that economics is about tradeoffs. Assuming McDonald\u2019s had the so-called \u201cpricing power\u201d to gouge its Big Mac buying customers, the power would prove costly for McDonald\u2019s as other food, drink, and desert items go unsold. Which is just a reminder that if McDonald\u2019s really wants to earn for itself greater customer \u201cwallet share,\u201d which it does, it would be feverishly looking for ways to lower prices not just of the Big Mac, but everything on its menu. In the real economy, lower prices instigate new wants or the ability to act on wants as the lower cost of one item enables the purchase of other items formerly out of reach.

In short, even if McDonald\u2019s wanted to overcharge its customers for Big Macs, such shortsightedness would quickly be corrected by investors. Still, there is the matter of a Big Mac that\u2019s 21 percent more expensive now than it was in 2019. About it, and rather than castigating McDonald\u2019s, customers should be throwing bouquets at the fast-food giant. To see why, consider the impact of the March 26 Key Bridge collapse on Compass Coffee. While Compass is Washington, D.C.-based, its coffee beans, syrups that enhance its coffee, and even the steel used to manufacture its coffee cans are all imported from around the world. And with the collapse of the Key Bridge back in March, the cost of attaining all that goes into the making of Compass products has zoomed upward. And that\u2019s just coffee. Stop and think about the extensiveness of a McDonald\u2019s menu, and the wildly sophisticated global cooperation required so that McDonald\u2019s can sell the items offered. In particular, stop and think about the latter with the 2020 shutdown of the global economy by coronavirus-fearful politicians. If the Port of Baltimore\u2019s closure can powerfully raise the cost of producing and selling coffee, does anyone seriously think a shutdown of the global economy wouldn\u2019t have sizable near and long-term effects on all manner of prices? Hopefully the question answers itself. McDonald\u2019s isn\u2019t overcharging its customers, rather it\u2019s overseeing a miracle whereby the Big Mac isn\u2019t that much more expensive than it was before the shutdowns. Instead of whining about Big Mac prices, wise customers (and politicians) would be wondering just how much less a Big Mac might cost today if the virus panic never happened. In short, McDonald\u2019s is in the business of always lower prices. Government is in the business of intervention. In 2020, the interventionists shut down the producers, and the price of a Big Mac reflects this sad truth. Just don\u2019t blame McDonald\u2019s, and do not refer to the symptoms of shutdown as \u201cinflation.\u201d Follow me on Twitter.

The airline made the announcement via a tweet, highlighting their commitment to passenger and crew safety.\n\n\"In view of the emerging situation in Bangladesh, we have cancelled the scheduled operation of our flights to and from Dhaka with immediate effect. We are continuously monitoring the situation and are extending support to our passengers with confirmed bookings for travel to and from Dhaka with a one-time waiver on rescheduling and cancellation charges,\" Air India stated.\n\nThe airline reassured passengers that their safety remains the top priority and advised those affected to contact their 24/7 contact centre at 011-69329333 / 011-69329999 for further information and assistance.\n\nProtests and vandalism errupt in Dhaka after Hasina's resignation\n\nOn Monday, the streets of Dhaka were engulfed in protests and incidents of vandalism, coinciding with Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina's resignation and departure from the country amidst escalating student-led protests. Visuals on TV, local media, and social media showed people ransacking Sheikh Hasina's official residence and taking away food items.\n\nProtesters were also seen storming into Parliament building, taking various items. Following Sheikh Hasina's departure in a military helicopter with her sister, Bangladesh's military chief, General Waker-uz-Zaman, urged protesters to refrain from violence. He announced that an interim government would soon be formed.\n\nThe protests, primarily led by students, demanded an end to the quota system for government jobs and had evolved into a broader uprising against Hasina and her ruling Awami League party. Local media outlet Prothom Alo reported that at least 95 persons, including 14 police officers, died in clashes in Dhaka on Sunday, with hundreds more injured.", "source": {"uri": "ptcnews.tv", "dataType": "news", "title": "PTC News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dhaka", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dhaka"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dhaka"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Bangladesh"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangladesh", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bangladesh"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Bangladesh"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_India", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Air India"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheikh_Hasina", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sheikh Hasina"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waker-uz-Zaman", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Waker-uz-Zaman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Awami_League", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Awami League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangladesh_Armed_Forces", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bangladesh Armed Forces"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prothom_Alo", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Prothom Alo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palace_of_Westminster", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Palace of Westminster"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Provisional_government", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Provisional government"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Official_residence", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Official residence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Transportation", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Transportation", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Aviation", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Aviation", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Travel/Transportation", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Travel/Transportation", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 67}], "image": "https://media.ptcnews.tv/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/6fce99aa68e2bb728b4a170f2d5d85d9_1280X720.webp", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9791753", "eventUri": "eng-9791753", "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Bangladesh"}}, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.02745098039215677, "wgt": 196, "relevance": 1}

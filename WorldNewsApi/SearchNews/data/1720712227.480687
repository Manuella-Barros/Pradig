Nick Abbeam is the CEO of the Nick Group of Companies, which includes Ghana Link, the Royal Nick Hotels chain, the Royal Light chain, Nick TC Scan (Ghana and Sierra Leone), Alic Inspection Company, Export Gold Ethanol Inspection Company, Global Export Company of Guinea Bissau, Misyl Energy BDC, Nick Petroleum, and several other companies. In a 2023 interview with Kofi TV, the business mogul revealed that his father had 14 wives and 100 children. He mentioned that he was the third child of his late mother, Abena Achiaa, who was his father's last wife. \"My father had many wives; my mother was the last one, the 14th. He was the chief of Bredi... He had 100 children. I am the third child of my mother,\" he explained. Nick Abbeam also shared how moving to Spain broadened his business perspective. After more than a decade in Spain, he returned to Ghana to establish his businesses, including Nick and Slogan, the first company to import Ford tyres, kitchen cabinets, and building materials to Ghana. \"I was seventeen when my uncle took me to Spain. I worked there before bringing some of my business ventures to Ghana. One of my first companies was Nick and Slogan on Spintex Road. Slogan was a white man; I was the Nick. We started importing Ford tires, kitchen cabinets, and more to Ghana,\" he recounted. He mentioned that these initial ventures evolved into multiple businesses not only in Ghana but also in other African countries. \"In 2000, I decided to come back home after my success in Spain... I began with Nick Hotel, then expanded to Nick and Slogan, and further into other businesses in Ghana and across Africa. \"After Nick and Slogan, I founded Ghana Link. This led to Nick Scan, then Misyl (Energy BDC), which gave rise to Nick Petroleum, and with God's blessing, many more businesses,\" he elaborated.

Hamilton started strong in qualifying, recording the third-fastest time in Q1 and the second-fastest time in Q2. However, after the drivers swapped tyres in Q3 Hamilton's challenge faded away. His Mercedes teammate George Russell went on to secure pole, despite the fact he finished with the exact same time as Red Bull's Max Verstappen. Russell was ultimately given the nod due to the fact he finished his lap first, which is only the second time pole position has been decided this way in the history of the sport. However, Sky Sports F1 pundit Brundle was left baffled by Hamilton's poor showing in Q3. \"I don't know what happened to Lewis,\" he said. \"None of his sector times shone. It was as if he just didn't find grip, didn't have the tyres where he needed them, because nothing stood out on that lap.\" Sky commentator David Croft then added: \"Quite the contrast in the exterior of George Russell and Lewis Hamilton. While Russell celebrates, Lewis walks into the garage to get weighed and I'm sure will be dearly unhappy that turned out for him.\" Hamilton will now start the race in seventh and bemoaned his poor finish, admitting he also has no idea why his pace fell away. \"Firstly, congratulations to George for a great job,\" the seven-time world champion told Sky. \"It's really great for the team. Obviously everyone has worked so hard to bring upgrades back at the factory, so this will be a real huge boost for everyone back at the factory. The car was feeling great all weekend and as soon as we got to qualifying, that kind of vanished for me. \"The grip just disappears for me. P3, I had plenty of pace in me, and then get to qualifying and the tyres won't work. Nothing had changed on the car.\" Mercedes team principal Toto Wolff added: \"It seemed that Lewis was actually having the upper hand and both cars comfortably beating everyone. \"And then at the end, it got so tight, also for George, and Lewis - the time didn't show up. We can't comprehend at the moment why it wasn't a little bit more in our favour.\" Join our new WhatsApp community and receive your daily dose of Mirror Football content.

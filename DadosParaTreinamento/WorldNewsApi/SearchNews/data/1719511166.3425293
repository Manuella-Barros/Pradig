Lamorde passed on at the age of 61 in Egypt where he was receiving medical attention. In a statement by Ikechukwu Ani, Head, Press and Public Relations of the Police Service Commission, Arase eulogised Lamorde's humility and temperate disposition to the allure of power. He recalled his advice to the late super cop after he left the services of the EFCC not to get into mainstream policing immediately but to further horn his policing and leadership skills at the Nigerian Institute of Policy and Strategic Studies, NIPSS, which he accepted, adding that his advice positively shaped his career in the Nigeria Police Force. He noted that at no time did power get into the head of the late officer who he said remained humble and committed throughout his career. \"The training he got at NIPSS prepared him for the greater policing challenges he faced as he climbed the ladder of success,\" he said. He said the nation has lost one of its bright and consummate intelligence officers who contributed immensely to the growth of intelligence policing in Nigeria. Lamorde, born in 1962, joined the Nigeria Police Force in 1986 and retired as a Deputy Inspector General of Police in 2021. He served as the third Chairman of the EFCC between 2011 and 2015. He hails from Mubi in Adamawa State.", "summary": "<img width=\"1280\" height=\"720\" src=\"https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/IG-Solomon-Arase.jpg\" class=\"webfeedsFeaturedVisual wp-post-image\" alt=\"\" style=\"display: block; margin: auto; margin-bottom: 5px;max-width: 100%;\" link_thumbnail=\"\" decoding=\"async\" fetchpriority=\"high\" srcset=\"https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/IG-Solomon-Arase.jpg 1280w, https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/IG-Solomon-Arase-300x169.jpg 300w, https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/IG-Solomon-Arase-1024x576.jpg 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px\" /><p>The Chairman of the Police Service Commission, Dr. Solomon Arase, has expressed shock at the death of DIG Ibrahim Lamorde rtd, former Chairman of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission , EFCC.

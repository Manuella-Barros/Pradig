Just before we came on air we overtook the Conservatives in the national opinion polls. We are now the opposition to Labour,\" he said.\n\nThe poll came at the end of a day when Labour and Plaid Cymru launched their election manifestos.\n\nAt his launch in Manchester, Sir Keir Starmer said Labour had a plan to turn the country around after 14 years of Tory \"chaos\" but cautioned that there would be \"no quick fix\" if he is handed the keys to No 10 by voters on July 4.\n\nLaunching a manifesto which contained no new policy announcements, Sir Keir denied he was being overly cautious in his efforts to put his party back in power for the first time since 2010.\n\nRepeatedly stressing how he had changed Labour since taking over from Jeremy Corbyn, Sir Keir said he was now offering a \"serious plan for the future of our country\".\n\nDon't miss the latest news from around Scotland and beyond - Sign up to our daily newsletter here.", "source": {"uri": "dailyrecord.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Record"}, "authors": [{"uri": "lynn_love@dailyrecord.co.uk", "name": "Lynn Love", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labour_Party_(UK)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Labour Party (UK)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservative_Party_(UK)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Conservative Party (UK)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nigel_Farage", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nigel Farage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reform_Party_of_Canada", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Reform Party of Canada"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plaid_Cymru", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Plaid Cymru"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YouGov", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "YouGov"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tory", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tory"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reform_UK", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Reform UK"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberal_Democrats_(UK)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Liberal Democrats (UK)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alliance_90/The_Greens", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Greens"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keir_Starmer", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Keir Starmer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottish_National_Party", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Scottish National Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manifesto", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Manifesto"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_party", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Political party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeremy_Corbyn", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jeremy Corbyn"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opinion_poll", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Opinion poll"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Manchester"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Manchester"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scotland", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Scotland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Scotland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns_and_Elections", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns and Elections", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties/Planning", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties/Planning", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Online_Issues_Polls", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Online Issues Polls", "wgt": 25}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Entertaining/Party_Planning", "label": "dmoz/Home/Entertaining/Party Planning", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article33020088.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/3_General-Election-campaign-2024.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9650555", "eventUri": "eng-9650555", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-12", "dateEnd": "2024-06-13", "textStart": 786, "textEnd": 800}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-04", "textStart": 1470, "textEnd": 1476}], "sentiment": 0.2156862745098038, "wgt": 198, "relevance": 1}

Despite gaining traction, Reform UK is not predicted to win many parliamentary seats due to the UK's first-past-the-post electoral system.\n\nNigel Farage's Reform UK Party overtook Prime Minister Rishi Sunak's Conservatives in an opinion poll for the first time on Thursday ahead of Britain's election on July 4.\n\nThe poll by YouGov for the Times newspaper put Reform UK on 19%, up from 17% previously, and the Conservative Party unchanged on 18%. The opposition Labour Party topped the poll with 37%. The survey of 2,211 people was carried out June 12-13, after Sunak pledged to cut 17 billion pounds ($21.70 billion) of taxes for working people in his party's election manifesto.\n\nReform's poll rating has risen since Farage, best known for his successful campaign for Britain to leave the European Union, said he was returning to frontline politics, taking over leadership of the party and standing for election to parliament. \"This is the inflection point. The only wasted vote now is a Conservative vote, we are the challengers to Labour and we are on our way,\" Farage said in a video posted on X.\n\nA small right-wing party, founded in 2018 as the Brexit Party, Reform backs populist causes such as tougher immigration laws. Asked if the trend would stick, a Conservative lawmaker who declined to be named said: \"Yes. I think people are fed up with the Tories (Conservatives), but not with Conservatism. So they are moving to another Conservative party.\"\n\nSunak's campaign has also been hit by sharp criticism after he left D-Day memorial events in France earlier than other world leaders. Other opinion polls show the Conservatives much further ahead of Reform.\n\nDespite overtaking Sunak's Conservatives in Thursday's poll - which reflected the share of a nationwide vote - Reform is not forecast to win many, if any, parliamentary seats. Its support is spread comparatively evenly across the country, whereas backing for the larger and more established parties is more concentrated by geographic areas.\n\nBritain has a first-past-the-post electoral system, meaning Reform could pick up millions of votes across the country without winning any of parliament's 650 individual constituencies.

The YouGov poll shows Reform UK at 19%, Conservatives at 18%, and Labour leading with 37%. Farage's return to politics has boosted his party's popularity.\n\nNigel Farage's Reform UK Party overtook Prime Minister Rishi Sunak's Conservative Party in an opinion poll for the first time on Thursday ahead of Britain's election on July 4.\n\nThe poll by YouGov for the Times newspaper put Reform UK on 19%, up from 17% previously, and the Conservatives unchanged on 18%. The opposition Labour Party topped the poll with 37%. The survey of 2,211 people was carried out June 12-13, after Sunak pledged to cut 17 billion pounds of taxes for working people in his party's election manifesto.\n\nReform's poll rating has risen since Farage, best known for his successful campaign for Britain to leave the European Union, said he was returning to frontline politics, taking over leadership of the party and standing for election to parliament. \"This is the inflection point, the only wasted vote now is a Conservative vote, we are the challengers to Labour and we are on our way,\" Farage said in a video posted on X.\n\nA small right-wing party, founded in 2018 as the Brexit Party, Reform backs populist causes such as tougher immigration laws. Sunak's campaign has also been hit after he drew sharp criticism for leaving D-Day memorial events earlier than other world leaders.\n\nOther opinion polls show the Conservatives much further ahead of Reform. Despite overtaking Sunak's Conservatives in Thursday's poll - which reflected the share of a nationwide vote - Reform is not forecast to win many parliamentary seats.\n\nIts support is spread comparatively evenly across the country, whereas backing for the larger and more established parties like Labour and the Conservatives is more concentrated by geographic areas. Britain has a 'winner takes it all' electoral system with no proportional representation, which means Reform could pick up millions of votes across the country without coming first in one of the 650 individual constituencies that make up the British parliament.\n\n(This story has not been edited by Devdiscourse staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)", "source": {"uri": "devdiscourse.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Devdiscourse"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reform_UK", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Reform UK"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rishi_Sunak", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rishi Sunak"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labour_Party_(UK)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Labour Party (UK)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservative_Party_(UK)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Conservative Party (UK)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nigel_Farage", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nigel Farage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opinion_poll", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Opinion poll"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YouGov", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "YouGov"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brexit", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Brexit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wasted_vote", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Wasted vote"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliament_of_the_United_Kingdom", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Parliament of the United Kingdom"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manifesto", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Manifesto"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right-wing_politics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Right-wing politics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electoral_system", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Electoral system"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proportional_representation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Proportional representation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normandy_landings", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Normandy landings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Populism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Populism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electoral_district", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Electoral district"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immigration", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Immigration"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Entertainment/Party_Supplies", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Entertainment/Party Supplies", "wgt": 25}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Conservatism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Conservatism", "wgt": 27}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Children/Parties", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Children/Parties", "wgt": 25}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Online_Issues_Polls", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Online Issues Polls", "wgt": 32}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Entertaining/Party_Planning", "label": "dmoz/Home/Entertaining/Party Planning", "wgt": 25}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 94}], "image": "https://www.devdiscourse.com/remote.axd?https://devdiscourse.blob.core.windows.net/imagegallery/27_05_2019_11_50_05_8739542.jpg?width=920&format=jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9650555", "eventUri": "eng-9650555", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-12", "dateEnd": "2024-06-13", "textStart": 712, "textEnd": 722}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-04", "textStart": 126, "textEnd": 132, "freq": 2}], "sentiment": 0.3333333333333333, "wgt": 190, "relevance": 1}

which reflected the share of a nationwide vote - Reform is not forecast to win many parliamentary seats.\n\nIts support is spread comparatively evenly across the country, whereas backing for the larger and more established parties like Labour and the Conservatives is more concentrated by geographic areas.\n\nBritain has a 'winner takes it all' electoral system with no proportional representation, which means Reform could pick up millions of votes across the country without coming first in one of the 650 individual constituencies that make up the British parliament.\n\n(Reporting by Kylie MacLellan and William James, Editing by Angus MacSwan)", "source": {"uri": "usnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "U.S. News & World Report"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reform_UK", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Reform UK"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rishi_Sunak", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rishi Sunak"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservative_Party_(UK)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Conservative Party (UK)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labour_Party_(UK)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Labour Party (UK)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YouGov", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "YouGov"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nigel_Farage", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nigel Farage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opinion_poll", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Opinion poll"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reuters", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Reuters"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brexit", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Brexit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wasted_vote", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Wasted vote"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliament_of_the_United_Kingdom", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Parliament of the United Kingdom"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manifesto", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Manifesto"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right-wing_politics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Right-wing politics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Populism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Populism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immigration", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Immigration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electoral_system", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Electoral system"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proportional_representation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Proportional representation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normandy_landings", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Normandy landings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electoral_district", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Electoral district"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Entertainment/Party_Supplies", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Entertainment/Party Supplies", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns_and_Elections", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns and Elections", "wgt": 24}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Conservatism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Conservatism", "wgt": 26}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Online_Issues_Polls", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Online Issues Polls", "wgt": 33}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Entertaining/Party_Planning", "label": "dmoz/Home/Entertaining/Party Planning", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 91}], "image": "https://www.usnews.com/dims4/USNEWS/95c7f7f/2147483647/thumbnail/970x647/quality/85/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.usnews.com%2Fcmsmedia%2Fa8%2F0b9cdf4fc6aa24665d0f2602c7c1ed%2Ftag%3Areuters.com%2C2024%3Anewsml_LYNXMPEK5C0SG%3A12024-06-13T194449Z_1_LYNXMPEK5C0SG_RTROPTP_3_BRITAIN-ELECTION-REFORM.JPG", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9650555", "eventUri": "eng-9650555", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-12", "dateEnd": "2024-06-13", "textStart": 424, "textEnd": 434}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-04", "textStart": 188, "textEnd": 194}], "sentiment": 0.2078431372549019, "wgt": 189, "relevance": 1}

The latest YouGov voting intention survey, conducted 12-13 June, has Reform UK one point ahead of the Conservatives on 19% to 18%. While numerically ahead, it is worth keeping sight of the fact that these figures are well within the margin of error of one another - we will not be able to tell for some time whether Reform can sustain or improve their position relative to the Conservatives.\n\nGiven these considerations, it may be more fair to say at this point in time - given the results of the last few polls - that Reform UK are neck and neck with the Conservatives.\n\nNone of that is to downplay the momentousness of Reform UK's rise. The fact that Nigel Farage's party are neck and neck with the governing Conservatives is a seismic shift in the voting landscape.\n\nWhile Reform UK might not see the benefits immediately - the first past the post system means that the party is unlikely to pick up many seats, if any, on a vote share of this size - such a showing could internally cripple the Conservatives, potentially providing Farage the opportunity to force a merger of the two parties he has recently spoken of.\n\nElsewhere in our voting intention results, Labour are on 37%, down one point from the previous poll, while the Liberal Democrats - who saw a four point boost in our previous poll - have also declined by a single point, to 14%. The Greens are likewise down one point to 7%.\n\nSee the full results here\n\nWhat do you think about the rise of Reform UK, the general election, and everything else?

The poll puts Labour on 37 per cent, meaning Keir Starmer is on course for a super majority.\n\nSo, what will this poll mean for Tory morale? As I wrote in Sunday's Election Insider email, many Conservative candidates have seen it as a matter of when not if Reform overtook their party after Farage announced his return to frontline politics. It means it won't come as a huge surprise to already down beat Conservatives. However, it will still deal a big blow to the party - and add to a sense of despair amongst Tories that half way into the campaign the polls are looking worse than when they started - rather than narrowing. Expect more candidates to sound alarm over the state of play as they worry the party could be reduced to double figures come 4 July - particularly if more polls show the same. Given the mixed polling on Reform so far, there will also likely now be a debate as to how various pollsters are weighting the Reform vote - with Farage accusing some of underreporting - and some Tories are sceptical whether it is as big as various polls make out.\n\nYet there is one ray of light in the findings. It found that 80 per cent of those backing Reform believe a very large majority for Keir Starmer would be 'a bad thing for the country'. That suggests the Tories could be on to something with their latest messaging. In recent days, Sunak has warned against giving Labour a blank cheque while the Defence Secretary Grant Shapps has said it is time to stop Labour winning a super majority. If they can land the message with Reform voters that a vote for Reform will mean just this then some could yet switch to Tory. However, this is no sure thing - and Farage and his supporters will cease on the latest polling as evidence for his claim that his party is best placed to provide opposition to a Starmer-led Labour government.", "source": {"uri": "spectator.us", "dataType": "news", "title": "Spectator USA"}, "authors": [{"uri": "katy_balls@spectator.us", "name": "Katy Balls", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tory", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tory"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservative_Party_(UK)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Conservative Party (UK)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tories_(British_political_party)", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Tories (British political party)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keir_Starmer", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Keir Starmer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manifesto", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Manifesto"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YouGov", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "YouGov"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nigel_Farage", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nigel Farage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labour_Party_(UK)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Labour Party (UK)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supermajority", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Supermajority"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rishi_Sunak", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rishi Sunak"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grant_Shapps", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Grant Shapps"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secretary_of_State_for_Defence", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Secretary of State for Defence"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Entertainment/Party_Supplies", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Entertainment/Party Supplies", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Children/Parties", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Children/Parties", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Online_Issues_Polls", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Online Issues Polls", "wgt": 27}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Entertaining/Party_Planning", "label": "dmoz/Home/Entertaining/Party Planning", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Entertaining/Holidays", "label": "dmoz/Home/Entertaining/Holidays", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 91}], "image": "https://www.spectator.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/GettyImages-2155410237_5ed6c5.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9650555", "eventUri": "eng-9650555", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-04", "textStart": 1189, "textEnd": 1195}], "sentiment": 0.2078431372549019, "wgt": 175, "relevance": 1}

The survey, which involved 2,211 participants and was carried out from June 12-13, revealed that Reform UK garnered 19% support, a 2% increase from their previous standing, while the Conservatives remained unchanged at 18%.The opposition Labour Party maintained its lead with 37% of the vote.\n\nThe poll results come in the wake of Sunak's pledge to reduce taxes for working individuals by 17 billion pounds, as outlined in his party's election manifesto. Meanwhile, Reform UK's popularity has been on the rise since Farage, renowned for his instrumental role in the successful Brexit campaign, announced his return to frontline politics, assuming leadership of the party and declaring his intention to run for parliament. In a video posted on X, Farage confidently stated, \"This is the inflection point, the only wasted vote now is a Conservative vote, we are the challengers to Labour and we are on our way.\"\n\nReform UK, a small right-wing party established in 2018 under the name Brexit Party, advocates for populist policies such as stricter immigration laws. Sunak's campaign has also faced setbacks, including sharp criticism for his early departure from D-Day memorial events compared to other world leaders. It is important to note that while Reform UK has surpassed the Conservatives in this particular poll, other opinion polls indicate a more substantial lead for the Conservatives over Reform UK.\n\nDespite Reform UK's strong showing in the nationwide vote share, the party is not expected to secure many parliamentary seats due to the nature of Britain's electoral system. The 'winner takes it all' approach, which lacks proportional representation, means that Reform UK could amass millions of votes across the country without achieving a majority in any of the 650 individual constituencies that constitute the British parliament. In contrast, support for larger and more established parties like Labour and the Conservatives tends to be more concentrated in specific geographic areas, giving them an advantage in securing seats.\n\nAt TOI World Desk, our dedicated team of seasoned journalists and passionate writers tirelessly sifts through the vast tapestry of global events to bring you the latest news and diverse perspectives round the clock.

He is enabling no cap, no target, and no plan.\"\n\nBut Mr Farage responded that he did not believe Ms Mordaunt, adding: \"As for being a Labour enabler, we are now ahead of you in the national polls. A vote for you is actually now a vote for Labour.\"\n\nThe Reform UK leader lauded the poll as the programme began, saying: \"Just before we came on air we overtook the Conservatives in the national opinion polls. We are now the opposition to Labour.\"\n\nThe senior politicians were quizzed during the debate on a wide range of issues, including the standard of public services, the cost of living, Brexit and migration.\n\nFour out of seven of them raised their hands when asked whether immigration is too high: Reform UK's Nigel Farage, who raised both his hands, the Conservatives' Penny Mordaunt, the Liberal Democrats' Daisy Cooper and Labour's Angela Rayner.\n\nThe SNP's Westminster leader Stephen Flynn accused them of playing into \"the Westminster status quo\".\n\nMr Flynn could later be heard calling out \"shameful\" when Angela Rayner suggested Labour would not seek to rejoin the EU if it wins power.\n\nHe later added that his party would \"yes absolutely\" seek to rejoin, as did the Greens, Lib Dems and Plaid Cymru.\n\nMs Mordaunt suggested a Labour government would \"take you back in, they will tie you on defence, on migration, on regulation, without any of the benefits of membership\".\n\nMr Farage also rejected the prospect of rejoining, adding: \"Unfortunately we are governed incompetently, but at least they are our mistakes and not somebody else's.\"\n\nAway from the airwaves, Rishi Sunak insisted he was \"definitely not\" down in the dumps after Wednesday night's televised leaders' event on Sky News as he spoke at the G7 summit in Italy.\n\nA snap poll following the broadcast found approximately two-thirds of those asked thought Sir Keir Starmer had won.\n\nAsked if he was alright, Mr Sunak said \"of course\" and pivoted immediately to criticising Labour's manifesto, which was launched in Manchester on Thursday.\n\nAt the launch, Sir Keir said Labour had a plan to turn the country around after 14 years of Tory \"chaos\" but cautioned that there would be \"no quick fix\" if he is handed the keys to No 10 by voters on July 4.\n\nLaunching a manifesto which contained no new policy announcements, Sir Keir denied he was being overly cautious in his efforts to put his party back in power for the first time since 2010.", "source": {"uri": "belfasttelegraph.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Belfast Telegraph"}, "authors": [], "concepts":

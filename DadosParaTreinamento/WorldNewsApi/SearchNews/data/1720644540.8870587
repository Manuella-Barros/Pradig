While many fans were blown away by the superstar's performance, some found it difficult leaving Murrayfield Stadium. ScotRail and Edinburgh Trams put on extra and later services - but as the crowd peaked at nearly 73,000 many fans struggled to get home. Images shared by Edinburgh Live show how huge crowds came to a standstill while they were trying to exit the venue. Another massive queue formed as hundreds waited for a tram. One fan said it was well organised as staff were on hand for crowd control but each tram that arrived quickly filled up. Another said it was a 'bottleneck entrance' with everyone trying to cram in. Swifties are now urging others who are relying on public transport for nights two and three, and wish to avoid the mass crowds, to leave before the show ends at around 10.45pm. Taylor wraps up her Eras Tour gig with Karma and ticket holders are being advised by fans to leave during the song. ScotRail had organised queues at Haymarket for those hoping to get onto the later trains. The train operator put on later trains to Glasgow Queen Street, Perth, Dunblane and Dundee. They have not been advertising the times of services apart from the last train to depart Edinburgh is at 12.12am to Glasgow and the crowd was being controlled, with only so many fans allowed into the station at a time. One fan who was trying to get home to Dunfermline said: \"'It was hellish, the crowd was so big that we were worried we just wouldn\u2019t be able to get home so we had to spend a ridiculous amount of money on Uber.\" She ended up shelling out an eye-watering \u00a375 to get home. She added: \"That\u2019s more than some people paid for the concert!\" ScotRail are urging fans to head straight to Haymarket after the concert if they are planning to get a train home. Phil Campbell, ScotRail Customer Operations Director, said: \"It will be fantastic to see so many people travel to Scottish Gas Murrayfield stadium to see Taylor Swift, and ScotRail is delighted to be able to add more seats and extra late-night trains to help fans enjoy the occasion. \u201cWe\u2019re encouraging customers to plan ahead and allow extra time for travel to and from Edinburgh. Buying return tickets in advance on the ScotRail app or website will minimise your need to queue, and help your day run smoothly.\u201d Don't miss the latest news from around Scotland and beyond - Sign up to our daily newsletter here.", "summary": "While many fans were blown away by the superstar's performance, some were less complimentary about travel arrangements around Murrayfield Stadium.", "url": "https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/scottish-news/taylor-swift-fans-trapped-nightmare-32988304", "image": "https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article32988363.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_Screenshot-2024-06-08-at-12250-1.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-08 12:32:49", "author": "Katie Williams,Ryan Carroll", "authors": ["Katie Williams", "Ryan Carroll"], "language": "en", "catgory": "entertainment", "source_country": "gb", "sentiment": -0.232}

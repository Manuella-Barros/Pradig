It said the exercises were ordered by President Vladimir Putin.\n\n\"During the exercise, a set of measures will be carried out to practise the issues of preparation and use of non-strategic nuclear weapons,\" the ministry said.\n\nMissile forces in the Southern Military District, aviation and the navy will take part, the defence ministry said.\n\nThe exercise is aimed at ensuring Russia's territorial integrity and sovereignty \"in response to provocative statements and threats by certain Western officials against the Russian Federation\", it said.\n\nRussia and the US are by far the world's biggest nuclear powers, holding more than 10,600 of the world's 12,100 nuclear warheads. China has the third-largest nuclear arsenal, followed by France and the UK.\n\nRussia has about 1,558 non-strategic nuclear warheads, according to the Federation of American Scientists, though there is uncertainty about exact figures for such weapons due to a lack of transparency.\n\nNo power has used nuclear weapons in war since the US unleashed the first atomic bomb attacks on the Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki in 1945.\n\nMajor nuclear powers routinely check their nuclear weapons but very rarely publicly link such exercises to specific perceived threats in the way that Russia has.\n\nUS President Joe Biden said last year that he felt there was no real prospect of Russia using nuclear weapons, but CNN reported that top US officials had done contingency planning for a potential Russian nuclear strike against Ukraine in 2022.\n\nSome Western and Ukrainian officials have said Russia is bluffing over nuclear weapons to scare the West, though the Kremlin has repeatedly indicated that it would consider breaking the nuclear taboo if Russia's existence was threatened.\n\n\"We do not see anything new here,\" said Andriy Yusov, a spokesperson for Ukrainian military intelligence. \"Nuclear blackmail is a constant practice of Putin's regime.\"\n\nThe defence ministry, run by long-term Putin ally Sergei Shoigu, did not say which specific Western officials it was referring to in its statement.\n\nThe Kremlin said that it was in response to remarks by French President Emmanuel Macron, British officials and a representative of the US Senate.\n\nMacron has in public raised the idea of sending European troops to fight Russia in Ukraine while British Foreign Secretary David Cameron said that Ukraine had a right to use the weapons provided by London to strike targets inside Russia.\n\nKremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Western statements about sending NATO soldiers to Ukraine amounted to \"a completely new round of escalation of tension - it is unprecedented, and of course it requires special attention and special measures\".\n\nPutin warned the West in March that a direct conflict between Russia and the US-led NATO military alliance would mean the planet was one step away from World War Three but said hardly anyone wanted such a scenario.\n\nNATO, created in 1949 to provide collective security against the Soviet Union, is currently holding the \"Steadfast Defender\" exercise, its largest since the end of the Cold War. NATO has not said whether it would include rehearsal of any nuclear element.\n\nA nuclear command exercise by NATO in 1983 prompted fears at the top levels of the Kremlin that the US was preparing for a surprise nuclear attack.\n\nPutin has faced calls inside Russia from some hardliners to change Russia's nuclear doctrine, which sets out the conditions under which Russia would use a nuclear weapon, though Putin said last year he saw no need for change.\n\nBroadly, the doctrine says such a weapon would be used in response to an attack using nuclear or other weapons of mass destruction, or the use of conventional weapons against Russia \"when the very existence of the state is put under threat\".\n\nPutin casts the war as part of a centuries-old battle with the West which he says humiliated Russia after the Berlin Wall fell in 1989 by enlarging NATO and encroaching on what Moscow considers to be Russia's historical sphere of influence.\n\nUkraine and its Western backers say the war is an imperial-style land grab by a corrupt dictatorship. Western leaders have vowed to work for a defeat of Russian forces in Ukraine, while ruling out any deployment of NATO personnel there.", "source": {"uri": "indiatoday.in", "dataType": "news", "title":

It said the exercises were ordered by President Vladimir Putin.\n\n\"During the exercise, a set of measures will be carried out to practise the issues of preparation and use of non-strategic nuclear weapons,\" the ministry said.\n\nMissile forces in the Southern Military District, aviation and the navy will take part, the defence ministry said.\n\nThe exercise is aimed at ensuring Russia's territorial integrity and sovereignty \"in response to provocative statements and threats by certain Western officials against the Russian Federation\", it said.\n\nRussia and the United States are by far the world's biggest nuclear powers, holding more than 10,600 of the world's 12,100 nuclear warheads. China has the third-largest nuclear arsenal, followed by France and Britain.\n\nRussia has about 1,558 non-strategic nuclear warheads, according to\n\nthe Federation of American Scientists\n\n, though there is uncertainty about exact figures for such weapons due to a lack of transparency.\n\nNo power has used nuclear weapons in war since the United States unleashed the first atomic bomb attacks on the Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki in 1945.\n\nMajor nuclear powers routinely check their nuclear weapons but very rarely publicly link such exercises to specific perceived threats in the way that Russia has.\n\nU.S. President Joe Biden said last year that he felt there was no real prospect of Russia using nuclear weapons but CNN reported that top U.S. officials did contingency planning for a potential Russian nuclear strike against Ukraine in 2022.\n\nSome Western and Ukrainian officials have said Russia is bluffing over nuclear weapons to scare the West, though the Kremlin has repeatedly indicated that it would consider breaking the nuclear taboo if Russia's existence was threatened.\n\nThe defence ministry, run by long-term Putin ally Sergei Shoigu, did not say which specific Western officials it was referring to in its statement.\n\nThe Kremlin said that it was in response to remarks by French President Emmanuel Macron, British officials and a representative of the U.S. Senate.\n\nhas in public raised the idea of sending European troops to fight Russia in Ukraine while British Foreign Secretary David Cameron said that\n\nUkraine had a right\n\nto use the weapons provided by London to strike targets inside Russia.\n\nKremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Western statements about sending NATO soldiers to Ukraine amounted to \"a completely new round of escalation of tension - it is unprecedented, and of course it requires special attention and special measures\".\n\nPutin warned the West in March that a direct conflict between Russia and the U.S.-led NATO military alliance would mean the planet was one step away from World War Three but said hardly anyone wanted such a scenario.\n\nNATO, created in 1949 to provide collective security against the Soviet Union, is currently holding the \"Steadfast Defender\" exercise, its largest since the end of the Cold War. NATO has not said whether it would include rehearsal of any nuclear element.\n\nA nuclear command exercise by NATO in 1983 prompted fears at the top levels of the Kremlin that the United States was preparing for a surprise nuclear attack.\n\nPutin has faced calls inside Russia from some hardliners to change Russia's nuclear doctrine, which sets out the conditions under which Russia would use a nuclear weapon, though Putin said last year he saw no need for change.\n\nBroadly, the doctrine says such a weapon would be used in response to an attack using nuclear or other weapons of mass destruction, or the use of conventional weapons against Russia \"when the very existence of the state is put under threat\".\n\nPutin casts the war as part of a centuries-old battle with the West which he says humiliated Russia after the Berlin Wall fell in 1989 by enlarging NATO and encroaching on what Moscow considers to be Russia's historical sphere of influence.\n\nUkraine and its Western backers say the war is an imperial-style land grab by a corrupt dictatorship. Western leaders have vowed to work for a defeat of Russian forces in Ukraine, while ruling out any deployment of NATO personnel there.

China has the third-largest nuclear arsenal, followed by France and Britain.\n\nRussia has about 1,558 non-strategic nuclear warheads, according to the Federation of American Scientists, though there is uncertainty about exact figures for such weapons due to a lack of transparency.\n\nNo power has used nuclear weapons in war since the United States unleashed the first atomic bomb attacks on the Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki in 1945.\n\nMajor nuclear powers routinely check their nuclear weapons but very rarely publicly link such exercises to specific perceived threats in the way that Russia has.\n\nUS President Joe Biden said last year that he felt there was no real prospect of Russia using nuclear weapons but CNN reported that top US officials did contingency planning for a potential Russian nuclear strike against Ukraine in 2022.\n\nSome Western and Ukrainian officials have said Russia is bluffing over nuclear weapons to scare the West, though the Kremlin has repeatedly indicated that it would consider breaking the nuclear taboo if Russia's existence was threatened.\n\n\"We do not see anything new here,\" said Andriy Yusov, a spokesperson for Ukrainian military intelligence. \"Nuclear blackmail is a constant practice of Putin's regime.\"\n\nThe defence ministry, run by long-term Putin ally Sergei Shoigu, did not say which specific Western officials it was referring to in its statement.\n\nThe Kremlin said that it was in response to remarks by French President Emmanuel Macron, British officials and a representative of the US Senate.\n\nMacron has in public raised the idea of sending European troops to fight Russia in Ukraine while British Foreign Secretary David Cameron said that Ukraine had a right to use the weapons provided by London to strike targets inside Russia.\n\nKremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Western statements about sending NATO soldiers to Ukraine amounted to \"a completely new round of escalation of tension - it is unprecedented, and of course it requires special attention and special measures\".\n\nPutin warned the West in March that a direct conflict between Russia and the US-led NATO military alliance would mean the planet was one step away from World War Three but said hardly anyone wanted such a scenario.\n\nNATO, created in 1949 to provide collective security against the Soviet Union, is currently holding the \"Steadfast Defender\" exercise, its largest since the end of the Cold War. NATO has not said whether it would include rehearsal of any nuclear element.\n\nA nuclear command exercise by NATO in 1983 prompted fears at the top levels of the Kremlin that the United States was preparing for a surprise nuclear attack.\n\nPutin has faced calls inside Russia from some hardliners to change Russia's nuclear doctrine, which sets out the conditions under which Russia would use a nuclear weapon, though Putin said last year he saw no need for change.\n\nBroadly, the doctrine says such a weapon would be used in response to an attack using nuclear or other weapons of mass destruction, or the use of conventional weapons against Russia \"when the very existence of the state is put under threat\".\n\nPutin casts the war as part of a centuries-old battle with the West which he says humiliated Russia after the Berlin Wall fell in 1989 by enlarging NATO and encroaching on what Moscow considers to be Russia's historical sphere of influence.\n\nUkraine and its Western backers say the war is an imperial-style land grab by a corrupt dictatorship. Western leaders have vowed to work for a defeat of Russian forces in Ukraine, while ruling out any deployment of NATO personnel there.", "source": {"uri": "euractiv.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

According to a statement from the Defence Ministry, the exercises are in response to \"provocative statements and threats of certain Western officials regarding the Russian Federation.\" File image/AP\n\nDays after the Kremlin reacted angrily to remarks made by senior Western officials regarding the war in Ukraine, the Defence Ministry of Russia announced on Monday that it would be holding drills, with the use of tactical nuclear weapons.\n\nAccording to a statement from the Defence Ministry, the exercises are in response to \"provocative statements and threats of certain Western officials regarding the Russian Federation.\"\n\nDespite the fact that its strategic nuclear forces conduct regular exercises, it was the first time Russia had publicly announced drills involving tactical nuclear weapons.\n\nHere's a look at tactical nuclear weapons and their role in the Kremlin's political messaging.\n\nWhat are tactical nuclear weapons?\n\nUnlike nuclear-tipped intercontinental ballistic missiles that can destroy entire cities, tactical nuclear weapons for use against troops on the battlefield are less powerful and can have a yield as small as about one kiloton. The US bomb dropped on Hiroshima during World War II was 15 kilotons.\n\nSuch battlefield nuclear weapons -- aerial bombs, warheads for short-range missiles or artillery munitions -- can be very compact. Their small size allows them to be discreetly carried on a truck or plane.\n\nUnlike strategic weapons, which have been subject to arms control agreements between Moscow and Washington, tactical weapons never have been limited by any such pacts, and Russia hasn't released their numbers or any other specifics related to them.\n\nWhat has Vladimir Putin said about nuclear weapons?\n\nSince launching the full-scale invasion of Ukraine on 24 February, 2022, Russian president Vladimir Putin has repeatedly reminded Western nations about Moscow's nuclear might in a bid to discourage them from increasing military support to Kyiv.\n\nEarly on in the war, Putin frequently referenced Moscow's nuclear arsenal by vowing repeatedly to use \"all means\" necessary to protect Russia. But he later toned down his statements as Ukraine's offensive last summer failed to reach its goals and Russia scored more gains on the battlefield.\n\nMoscow's defence doctrine envisages a nuclear response to an atomic strike or even an attack with conventional weapons that \"threaten the very existence of the Russian state.\" That vague wording has led some pro-Kremlin Russian experts to urge Putin to sharpen it to force the West to take the warnings more seriously.\n\nPutin said last fall that he sees no reason for such a change.\n\n\"There is no situation in which anything would threaten Russian statehood and the existence of the Russian state,\" he said. \"I think that no person of sober mind and clear memory could have an idea to use nuclear weapons against Russia.\"\n\nWhy did Russia ship Belarus nuclear weapons?\n\nLast year, Russia moved some of its tactical nuclear weapons into the territory of Belarus , an ally that neighbours Ukraine and NATO members Poland, Latvia and Lithuania.\n\nBelarus' authoritarian president, Alexander Lukashenko , had long urged Moscow to station nuclear weapons in his country, which has close military ties with Russia and served as a staging ground for the war in Ukraine.\n\nBoth Putin and Lukashenko said that nuclear weapons deployment to Belarus was intended to counter perceived Western threats. Last year, Putin specifically linked the move to the UK government's decision to provide Ukraine with armour-piercing shells containing depleted uranium.\n\nNeither leader said how many were moved -- only that Soviet-era facilities in the country were readied to accommodate them, and that Belarusian pilots and missile crews were trained to use them. The weapons have remained under Russian military control.\n\nThe deployment of tactical nuclear weapons to Belarus, which has a 1,084-kilometre (673-mile) border with Ukraine, would allow Russian aircraft and missiles to reach potential targets there more easily and quickly, if Moscow decides to use them. It has also extended Russia's capability to target several NATO allies in Eastern and Central Europe.", "source": {"uri": "firstpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Firstpost"}, "authors": [],

It said the exercises were ordered by President Vladimir Putin.\n\n\"During the exercise, a set of measures will be carried out to practise the issues of preparation and use of non-strategic nuclear weapons,\" the ministry said.\n\nMissile forces in the Southern Military District, aviation and the navy will take part, the defence ministry said.\n\nThe exercise is aimed at ensuring Russia's territorial integrity and sovereignty \"in response to provocative statements and threats by certain Western officials against the Russian Federation\", it said.\n\nRussia and the United States are by far the world's biggest nuclear powers, holding more than 10,600 of the world's 12,100 nuclear warheads. China has the third-largest nuclear arsenal, followed by France and Britain.\n\nRussia has about 1,558 non-strategic nuclear warheads, according to the Federation of American Scientists, though there is uncertainty about exact figures for such weapons due to a lack of transparency.\n\nNo power has used nuclear weapons in war since the United States unleashed the first atomic bomb attacks on the Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki in 1945.\n\nMajor nuclear powers routinely check their nuclear weapons but very rarely publicly link such exercises to specific perceived threats in the way that Russia has.\n\nNUCLEAR RISKS\n\nU.S. President Joe Biden said last year that he felt there was no real prospect of Russia using nuclear weapons but CNN reported that top U.S. officials did contingency planning for a potential Russian nuclear strike against Ukraine in 2022.\n\nSome Western and Ukrainian officials have said Russia is bluffing over nuclear weapons to scare the West, though the Kremlin has repeatedly indicated that it would consider breaking the nuclear taboo if Russia's existence was threatened.\n\nThe defence ministry, run by long-term Putin ally Sergei Shoigu, did not say which specific Western officials it was referring to in its statement.\n\nThe Kremlin said that it was in response to remarks by French President Emmanuel Macron, British officials and a representative of the U.S. Senate.\n\nMacron has in public raised the idea of sending European troops to fight Russia in Ukraine while British Foreign Secretary David Cameron said that Ukraine had a right to use the weapons provided by London to strike targets inside Russia.\n\nKremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Western statements about sending NATO soldiers to Ukraine amounted to \"a completely new round of escalation of tension - it is unprecedented, and of course it requires special attention and special measures\".\n\nPutin warned the West in March that a direct conflict between Russia and the U.S.-led NATO military alliance would mean the planet was one step away from World War Three but said hardly anyone wanted such a scenario.\n\nWAR GAMES\n\nNATO, created in 1949 to provide collective security against the Soviet Union, is currently holding the \"Steadfast Defender\" exercise, its largest since the end of the Cold War. NATO has not said whether it would include rehearsal of any nuclear element.\n\nA nuclear command exercise by NATO in 1983 prompted fears at the top levels of the Kremlin that the United States was preparing for a surprise nuclear attack.\n\nPutin has faced calls inside Russia from some hardliners to change Russia's nuclear doctrine, which sets out the conditions under which Russia would use a nuclear weapon, though Putin said last year he saw no need for change.\n\nBroadly, the doctrine says such a weapon would be used in response to an attack using nuclear or other weapons of mass destruction, or the use of conventional weapons against Russia \"when the very existence of the state is put under threat\".\n\nPutin casts the war as part of a centuries-old battle with the West which he says humiliated Russia after the Berlin Wall fell in 1989 by enlarging NATO and encroaching on what Moscow considers to be Russia's historical sphere of influence.\n\nUkraine and its Western backers say the war is an imperial-style land grab by a corrupt dictatorship. Western leaders have vowed to work for a defeat of Russian forces in Ukraine, while ruling out any deployment of NATO personnel there.\n\n(Editing by Nick Macfie)\n\nSign Up for Springs AM Update Your morning rundown of the latest news from Colorado Springs and around the country\n\nSign Up View all of our newsletters.

The threats come amid nuclear drills simulated by Russia. The drills involve tactical nuclear weapons, including air bombs and short-range missiles. The Russian Foreign Ministry has summoned British and French ambassadors, warning of consequences. Western officials express alarm over nuclear risks, urging caution and avoiding actions that could lead to escalation. Germany recalls its ambassador for consultations after a suspected cyberattack. Ukrainian forces use drones to strike vehicles in Russia's Belgorod region. Russia intensifies its bombardment of Ukraine's power grid, with a drone attack targeting infrastructure in Sumy.\n\nRussia on Monday threatened to strike British military facilities and said it would hold drills simulating the use of battlefield nuclear weapons amid sharply rising tensions over comments by senior Western officials about possibly deeper involvement in the war in Ukraine.\n\nAfter summoning the British ambassador to the Foreign Ministry, Moscow warned that Ukrainian strikes on Russian territory with UK-supplied weapons could bring retaliatory strikes on British military facilities and equipment on Ukrainian soil or elsewhere.\n\nThe remarks came on the eve of Russian President Vladimir Putin's inauguration to a fifth term in office and in a week when Moscow on Thursday will celebrate Victory Day, its most important secular holiday, marking its defeat of Nazi Germany in World War II.\n\nThe drills are a response to \"provocative statements and threats of certain Western officials regarding the Russian Federation,\" the Defense Ministry said in a statement.\n\nIt was the first time Russia has publicly announced drills involving tactical nuclear weapons, although its strategic nuclear forces regularly hold exercises. Tactical nuclear weapons include air bombs, warheads for short-range missiles and artillery munitions and are meant for use on a battlefield. They are less powerful than the strategic weapons -- massive warheads that arm intercontinental ballistic missiles and are intended to obliterate entire cities.\n\nU.N. spokesman Stephane Dujarric expressed concern that various parties have been talking about issues regarding nuclear weapons more and more recently.\n\n\"Current nuclear risks are at an alarmingly high level,\" Dujarric said. \"All actions that could lead to miscalculation, escalation with catastrophic consequences, must be avoided.\" The Russian announcement was a warning to Ukraine's Western allies about becoming more deeply engaged in the 2-year-old war, where the Kremlin's forces have gained an upper hand amid Ukraine's shortage of manpower and weapons. Some of Ukraine's Western partners have previously expressed concern that the conflict could spill beyond Ukraine into a war between NATO and Russia.\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron repeated last week that he doesn't exclude sending troops to Ukraine, and U.K. Foreign Secretary David Cameron said Kyiv's forces will be able to use British long-range weapons to strike targets inside Russia. Some other NATO countries providing weapons to Kyiv have balked at that possibility.\n\nThe Kremlin branded those comments as dangerous, heightening tension between Russia and NATO. The war already has placed significant strain on relations between Moscow and the West.\n\nKremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Monday that Macron's recent statement and other remarks by British and U.S. officials had prompted the nuclear drills.\n\n\"It's a new round of escalation,\" Peskov said, referring to what the Kremlin regarded as provocative statements. \"It's unprecedented and requires special attention and special measures.\" Russia's Foreign Ministry summoned both the French and British ambassadors. It urged the British ambassador \"to think about the inevitable catastrophic consequences of such hostile steps from London.'' Sweden's Foreign Minister Tobias Billstr\u00f6m said the nuclear exercises \"contribute to increasing instability.\" \"In the current security situation, Russia's actions may be considered particularly irresponsible and reckless,\" Billstr\u00f6m told Swedish news agency TT.\n\nDmitry Medvedev, the deputy head of Russia's Security Council that's chaired by Putin, said in his typically hawkish fashion that the comments by Macron and Cameron risked pushing the nuclear-armed world toward a \"global catastrophe.\" It wasn't the first time Europe's military support for Ukraine has prompted nuclear saber-rattling. In March 2023, after the U.K.'s decision to provide Ukraine with armor-piercing shells containing depleted uranium, Putin said he intends to deploy tactical nuclear weapons on the territory of Ukraine neighbor Belarus.\n\nThe ministry said the exercise is intended to \"increase the readiness of non-strategic nuclear forces to fulfill combat tasks\" and will be held on Putin's orders. The maneuvers will involve missile units of the Southern Military District along with the air force and the navy, it said.\n\nThe Russian announcement stirred little reaction in Ukraine, where the spokesman for the Military Intelligence agency, Andrii Yusov, said on national television: \"Nuclear blackmail is a usual practice of Putin's regime; it does not constitute major news.\" Western officials have blamed Russia for threatening a wider war through provocative acts. NATO countries said last week they are deeply concerned by a campaign of hybrid activities on the military alliance's soil, accusing Moscow of being behind them and saying they represent a security threat.\n\nPeskov dismissed those claims as \"new, unfounded accusations leveled at our country.\" Germany said Monday it recalled its ambassador to Russia for a week of consultations in Berlin following an alleged computer hack of Chancellor Olaf Scholz's party. Meanwhile, Ukrainian drones hit two vehicles Monday in Russia's Belgorod region, killing six people and injuring 35 others, including two children, local authorities said. The area has been hit by Kyiv's forces in recent months.\n\nOne of the vehicles was a minibus carrying farm workers, Belgorod Gov. Vyacheslav Gladkov said.\n\nIt was not possible to independently confirm the report.\n\nWhile Ukraine's army is largely pinned down on the 1,000-kilometer (600-mile) front line due to a shortage of troops and ammunition after more than two years of fighting, it has used its long-range firepower to hit targets deep inside Russia. In what has largely been a war of attrition, Russia also has relied heavily on long-range missile, artillery and drones to wreak damage on Ukraine.\n\nThe Kremlin's forces kept up their bombardment of Ukraine's power grid, with a nighttime Russian drone attack targeting energy infrastructure in Ukraine's northern region of Sumy. Multiple towns and villages in the region, including Sumy, lost power, regional authorities said.\n\nRussia attacked Ukrainian targets with 13 Shahed drones overnight, 12 of which were intercepted in the Sumy region, Ukraine's air force said.\n\n(This story has not been edited by Devdiscourse staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)", "source": {"uri": "devdiscourse.com", "dataType":

If Russia wins in Ukraine, there will be no security in Europe. Who can pretend that Russia will stop there?\"\n\nAnd during a visit to Ukraine last week, British Foreign Secretary David Cameron said that Ukraine could use British-supplied weapons to strike targets inside Russia.\n\n\"In terms of what the Ukrainians do, in our view it is their decision about how to use these weapons. They are defending their country. They were illegally invaded by Putin and they must take those steps,\" Cameron told reporters after the United Kingdom pledged continued financial and military support for Ukraine.\n\nThe drills announcement also comes shortly after the United States last month passed a long-delayed aid package for Kyiv, which will allow desperately needed military equipment and ammunition to flow to Ukraine as it tries to shore up its frontlines in the face of a renewed Russian onslaughts.\n\nRussian forces last month made further gains in at least three locations along Ukraine's eastern front, as Moscow tries to press home its manpower and ammunition advantage before the bulk of the US aid arrives in Ukraine.\n\nRussia has tended to raise the nuclear specter when its invasion of Ukraine has hit obstacles or when other countries make new pledges of support for Ukraine. After Ukraine liberated large swathes of its territory in late 2022, Putin conceded that the war is \"going to take a while\" and warned of the \"increasing\" threat of nuclear war.\n\nIn February last year, Putin announced that Russia would suspend participation in the New START treaty, a key nuclear arms reduction agreement with the United States, the last remaining pact that regulates the world's two largest nuclear arsenals. Putin said Russia would not be the first to test nuclear weapons, but would do so in the event of a US test.\n\nAfter Macron said in February that sending Western troops to Ukraine could not be ruled out, Putin warned \"this really threatens a conflict with the use of nuclear weapons, and therefore the destruction of civilization.\"\n\nUS President Joe Biden and State Department officials have previously downplayed concerns that Putin could deploy a nuclear weapon, but continue to take the threats seriously.\n\nIn late 2022, the US began \"preparing rigorously\" for Russia potentially striking Ukraine with a tactical nuclear weapon, in what would have been the first nuclear attack in war since the US dropped atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki nearly 80 years before, two senior administration officials previously told CNN.\n\nIn Monday's announcement, Russia's defense ministry said the military's General Staff had begun preparations for conducting \"exercises in the near future with missile formations of the Southern Military District involving aviation as well as naval forces.\"\n\nFor more CNN news and newsletters create an account at CNN.com", "source": {"uri":

If Russia wins in Ukraine, there will be no security in Europe. Who can pretend that Russia will stop there?\"\n\nAnd during a visit to Ukraine last week, British Foreign Secretary David Cameron said that Ukraine could use British-supplied weapons to strike targets inside Russia.\n\n\"In terms of what the Ukrainians do, in our view it is their decision about how to use these weapons. They are defending their country. They were illegally invaded by Putin and they must take those steps,\" Cameron told reporters after the United Kingdom pledged continued financial and military support for Ukraine.\n\nThe drills announcement also comes shortly after the United States last month passed a long-delayed aid package for Kyiv, which will allow desperately needed military equipment and ammunition to flow to Ukraine as it tries to shore up its frontlines in the face of a renewed Russian onslaughts.\n\nRussian forces last month made further gains in at least three locations along Ukraine's eastern front, as Moscow tries to press home its manpower and ammunition advantage before the bulk of the US aid arrives in Ukraine.\n\nRussia has tended to raise the nuclear specter when its invasion of Ukraine has hit obstacles or when other countries make new pledges of support for Ukraine. After Ukraine liberated large swathes of its territory in late 2022, Putin conceded that the war is \"going to take a while\" and warned of the \"increasing\" threat of nuclear war.\n\nIn February last year, Putin announced that Russia would suspend participation in the New START treaty, a key nuclear arms reduction agreement with the United States, the last remaining pact that regulates the world's two largest nuclear arsenals. Putin said Russia would not be the first to test nuclear weapons, but would do so in the event of a US test.\n\nAfter Macron said in February that sending Western troops to Ukraine could not be ruled out, Putin warned \"this really threatens a conflict with the use of nuclear weapons, and therefore the destruction of civilization.\"\n\nUS President Joe Biden and State Department officials have previously downplayed concerns that Putin could deploy a nuclear weapon, but continue to take the threats seriously.\n\nIn response to Russia's latest announcement, the US said it had seen no change in Russia's \"strategic force posture\" following Moscow's announcement that it would begin tactical nuclear weapons drills, according to Pentagon spokesperson Maj. Gen. Patrick Ryder.\n\nRyder said Russia's announcement is \"completely inappropriate,\" and \"an example of the kind of irresponsible rhetoric that we've seen from Russia in the past.\"\n\nIn late 2022, the US began \"preparing rigorously\" for Russia potentially striking Ukraine with a tactical nuclear weapon, in what would have been the first nuclear attack in war since the US dropped atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki nearly 80 years before, two senior administration officials previously told CNN.\n\nIn Monday's announcement, Russia's defense ministry said the military's General Staff had begun preparations for conducting \"exercises in the near future with missile formations of the Southern Military District involving aviation as well as naval forces.\"", "source": {"uri":

It said the exercises were ordered by President Vladimir Putin.\n\n\"During the exercise, a set of measures will be carried out to practise the issues of preparation and use of non-strategic nuclear weapons,\" the ministry said.\n\nMissile forces in the Southern Military District, aviation and the navy will take part, the defence ministry said.\n\nThe exercise is aimed at ensuring Russia's territorial integrity and sovereignty \"in response to provocative statements and threats by certain Western officials against the Russian Federation\", it said.\n\nNUCLEAR RISKS\n\nUS President Joe Biden said last year that he felt there was no real prospect of Russia using nuclear weapons but CNN reported that top US officials did contingency planning for a potential Russian nuclear strike against Ukraine in 2022.\n\nSome Western and Ukrainian officials have said Russia is bluffing over nuclear weapons to scare the West, though the Kremlin has repeatedly indicated that it would consider breaking the nuclear taboo if Russia's existence was threatened.\n\nBiggest nuclear powers Russia and the United States are by far the world's biggest nuclear powers, holding more than 10,600 of the world's 12,100 nuclear warheads.\n\nChina has the third-largest nuclear arsenal, followed by France and Britain.\n\nRussia has about 1,558 non-strategic nuclear warheads, according to the Federation of American Scientists, though there is uncertainty about exact figures for such weapons due to a lack of transparency.\n\nNo power has used nuclear weapons in war since the United States unleashed the first atomic bomb attacks on the Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki in 1945.\n\nMajor nuclear powers routinely check their nuclear weapons but very rarely publicly link such exercises to specific perceived threats in the way that Russia has.\n\n\"We do not see anything new here,\" said Andriy Yusov, a spokesperson for Ukrainian military intelligence. \"Nuclear blackmail is a constant practice of Putin's regime.\" The defence ministry, run by long-term Putin ally Sergei Shoigu, did not say which specific Western officials it was referring to in its statement.\n\nThe Kremlin said that it was in response to remarks by French President Emmanuel Macron, British officials and a representative of the US Senate.\n\nMacron has in public raised the idea of sending European troops to fight Russia in Ukraine while British Foreign Secretary David Cameron said that Ukraine had a right to use the weapons provided by London to strike targets inside Russia.\n\nKremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Western statements about sending Nato soldiers to Ukraine amounted to \"a completely new round of escalation of tension -- it is unprecedented, and of course it requires special attention and special measures\".\n\nPutin warned the West in March that a direct conflict between Russia and the US-led Nato military alliance would mean the planet was one step away from World War Three but said hardly anyone wanted such a scenario.\n\nWAR GAMES\n\nNato, created in 1949 to provide collective security against the Soviet Union, is currently holding the \"Steadfast Defender\" exercise, its largest since the end of the Cold War. Nato has not said whether it would include rehearsal of any nuclear element.\n\nA nuclear command exercise by Nato in 1983 prompted fears at the top levels of the Kremlin that the United States was preparing for a surprise nuclear attack.\n\nPutin has faced calls inside Russia from some hardliners to change Russia's nuclear doctrine, which sets out the conditions under which Russia would use a nuclear weapon, though Putin said last year he saw no need for change.\n\nBroadly, the doctrine says such a weapon would be used in response to an attack using nuclear or other weapons of mass destruction, or the use of conventional weapons against Russia \"when the very existence of the state is put under threat\".\n\nPutin casts the war as part of a centuries-old battle with the West which he says humiliated Russia after the Berlin Wall fell in 1989 by enlarging Natp and encroaching on what Moscow considers to be Russia's historical sphere of influence.\n\nUkraine and its Western backers say the war is an imperial-style land grab by a corrupt dictatorship.

If Russia wins in Ukraine, there will be no security in Europe. Who can pretend that Russia will stop there?\"\n\nAnd during a visit to Ukraine last week, British Foreign Secretary David Cameron said that Ukraine could use British-supplied weapons to strike targets inside Russia.\n\n\"In terms of what the Ukrainians do, in our view it is their decision about how to use these weapons. They are defending their country. They were illegally invaded by Putin and they must take those steps,\" Cameron told reporters after the United Kingdom pledged continued financial and military support for Ukraine.\n\nThe drills announcement also comes shortly after the United States last month passed a long-delayed aid package for Kyiv, which will allow desperately needed military equipment and ammunition to flow to Ukraine as it tries to shore up its frontlines in the face of a renewed Russian onslaughts.\n\nRussian forces last month made further gains in at least three locations along Ukraine's eastern front, as Moscow tries to press home its manpower and ammunition advantage before the bulk of the US aid arrives in Ukraine.\n\nRussia has tended to raise the nuclear specter when its invasion of Ukraine has hit obstacles or when other countries make new pledges of support for Ukraine. After Ukraine liberated large swathes of its territory in late 2022, Putin conceded that the war is \"going to take a while\" and warned of the \"increasing\" threat of nuclear war.\n\nIn February last year, Putin announced that Russia would suspend participation in the New START treaty, a key nuclear arms reduction agreement with the United States, the last remaining pact that regulates the world's two largest nuclear arsenals. Putin said Russia would not be the first to test nuclear weapons, but would do so in the event of a US test.\n\nAfter Macron said in February that sending Western troops to Ukraine could not be ruled out, Putin warned \"this really threatens a conflict with the use of nuclear weapons, and therefore the destruction of civilization.\"\n\nUS President Joe Biden and State Department officials have previously downplayed concerns that Putin could deploy a nuclear weapon, but continue to take the threats seriously.\n\nIn late 2022, the US began \"preparing rigorously\" for Russia potentially striking Ukraine with a tactical nuclear weapon, in what would have been the first nuclear attack in war since the US dropped atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki nearly 80 years before, two senior administration officials previously told CNN.\n\nIn Monday's announcement, Russia's defense ministry said the military's General Staff had begun preparations for conducting \"exercises in the near future with missile formations of the Southern Military District involving aviation as well as naval forces.\"\n\nThe-CNN-Wire\n\n\u2122 & \u00a9 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

The U.S. bomb dropped on Hiroshima during World War II was 15 kilotons.\n\nNEWS WRAP: Russia says it will hold drills to simulate nuclear weapon use\n\nSuch battlefield nuclear weapons -- aerial bombs, warheads for short-range missiles or artillery munitions -- can be very compact. Their small size allows them to be discreetly carried on a truck or plane.\n\nUnlike strategic weapons, which have been subject to arms control agreements between Moscow and Washington, tactical weapons never have been limited by any such pacts, and Russia hasn't released their numbers or any other specifics related to them.\n\nWhat has Putin said about nuclear weapons?\n\nSince launching the full-scale invasion of Ukraine on Feb. 24, 2022, Russian President Vladimir Putin has repeatedly reminded Western nations about Moscow's nuclear might in a bid to discourage them from increasing military support to Kyiv.\n\nEarly on in the war, Putin frequently referenced Moscow's nuclear arsenal by vowing repeatedly to use \"all means\" necessary to protect Russia. But he later toned down his statements as Ukraine's offensive last summer failed to reach its goals and Russia scored more gains on the battlefield.\n\nREAD MORE: UN nuclear watchdog leader visits Iran over stifled monitoring and rising Mideast tensions\n\nMoscow's defense doctrine envisages a nuclear response to an atomic strike or even an attack with conventional weapons that \"threaten the very existence of the Russian state.\" That vague wording has led some pro-Kremlin Russian experts to urge Putin to sharpen it to force the West to take the warnings more seriously.\n\nPutin said last fall that he sees no reason for such a change.\n\n\"There is no situation in which anything would threaten Russian statehood and the existence of the Russian state,\" he said. \"I think that no person of sober mind and clear memory could have an idea to use nuclear weapons against Russia.\"\n\nWhy did Russia send nuclear weapons to Belarus?\n\nLast year, Russia moved some of its tactical nuclear weapons into the territory of Belarus, an ally that neighbors Ukraine and NATO members Poland, Latvia and Lithuania.\n\nBelarus' authoritarian president, Alexander Lukashenko, had long urged Moscow to station nuclear weapons in his country, which has close military ties with Russia and served as a staging ground for the war in Ukraine.\n\nREAD MORE: Russia vetoes UN resolution on preventing nuclear arms race in space\n\nBoth Putin and Lukashenko said that nuclear weapons deployment to Belarus was intended to counter perceived Western threats. Last year, Putin specifically linked the move to the U.K. government's decision to provide Ukraine with armor-piercing shells containing depleted uranium.\n\nNeither leader said how many were moved -- only that Soviet-era facilities in the country were readied to accommodate them, and that Belarusian pilots and missile crews were trained to use them. The weapons have remained under Russian military control.\n\nThe deployment of tactical nuclear weapons to Belarus, which has a 1,084-kilometer (673-mile) border with Ukraine, would allow Russian aircraft and missiles to reach potential targets there more easily and quickly, if Moscow decides to use them. It has also extended Russia's capability to target several NATO allies in Eastern and Central Europe.", "source": {"uri": "pbs.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "PBS.org"}, "authors": [{"uri":

If Russia wins in Ukraine, there will be no security in Europe. Who can pretend that Russia will stop there?\"\n\nAnd during a visit to Ukraine last week, British Foreign Secretary David Cameron said that Ukraine could use British-supplied weapons to strike targets inside Russia.\n\n\"In terms of what the Ukrainians do, in our view it is their decision about how to use these weapons. They are defending their country. They were illegally invaded by Putin and they must take those steps,\" Cameron told reporters after the United Kingdom pledged continued financial and military support for Ukraine.\n\nThe drills announcement also comes shortly after the United States last month passed a long-delayed aid package for Kyiv, which will allow desperately needed military equipment and ammunition to flow to Ukraine as it tries to shore up its frontlines in the face of a renewed Russian onslaughts.\n\nRussian forces last month made further gains in at least three locations along Ukraine's eastern front, as Moscow tries to press home its manpower and ammunition advantage before the bulk of the US aid arrives in Ukraine.\n\nRussia has tended to raise the nuclear specter when its invasion of Ukraine has hit obstacles or when other countries make new pledges of support for Ukraine. After Ukraine liberated large swathes of its territory in late 2022, Putin conceded that the war is \"going to take a while\" and warned of the \"increasing\" threat of nuclear war.\n\nIn February last year, Putin announced that Russia would suspend participation in the New START treaty, a key nuclear arms reduction agreement with the United States, the last remaining pact that regulates the world's two largest nuclear arsenals. Putin said Russia would not be the first to test nuclear weapons, but would do so in the event of a US test.\n\nAfter Macron said in February that sending Western troops to Ukraine could not be ruled out, Putin warned \"this really threatens a conflict with the use of nuclear weapons, and therefore the destruction of civilization.\"\n\nUS President Joe Biden and State Department officials have previously downplayed concerns that Putin could deploy a nuclear weapon, but continue to take the threats seriously.\n\nIn response to Russia's latest announcement, the US said it had seen no change in Russia's \"strategic force posture\" following Moscow's announcement that it would begin tactical nuclear weapons drills, according to Pentagon spokesperson Maj. Gen. Patrick Ryder.\n\nRyder said Russia's announcement is \"completely inappropriate,\" and \"an example of the kind of irresponsible rhetoric that we've seen from Russia in the past.\"\n\nIn late 2022, the US began \"preparing rigorously\" for Russia potentially striking Ukraine with a tactical nuclear weapon, in what would have been the first nuclear attack in war since the US dropped atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki nearly 80 years before, two senior administration officials previously told CNN.\n\nIn Monday's announcement, Russia's defense ministry said the military's General Staff had begun preparations for conducting \"exercises in the near future with missile formations of the Southern Military District involving aviation as well as naval forces.\"\n\nCNN's Natasha Bertrand contributed reporting.\n\nThe-CNN-Wire\n\n\u2122 & \u00a9 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

against Russia \"when the very existence of the state is put under threat\".\n\nMr Putin warned the West in March that a direct conflict between Russia and the US-led NATO military alliance would mean

humiliated Russia after the Berlin Wall fell in 1989 by enlarging NATO and encroaching on what Moscow considers to be Russia's historical sphere of influence.\n\nUkraine and its Western backers say the war is an imperial-style land grab by a corrupt dictatorship.\n\nWestern leaders have vowed to work for a defeat of Russian forces in Ukraine, while ruling out any deployment of NATO personnel

Artem Priakhin/SOPA Images via Reuters Connect.\n\nRussia has again raised the prospect of nuclear war with regard to Ukraine. On May 6, the Russian Defense Ministry announced an exercise near Ukraine involving the possible use of non-strategic (tactical) nuclear weapons. This comes as the Russian army struggles to make major gains on the battlefield while the West continues to support Kyiv with arms and ammunition.\n\nThe Kremlin seeks to unnerve both Ukrainians and the West, but the actual use of non-strategic nuclear weapons -- those with smaller warheads and intended for use on the battlefield -- in Ukraine would contradict both Russian doctrine and Russian President Vladimir Putin's own comments. Moreover, Russian use of nuclear weapons against Ukraine would raise the prospect of significant and unpredictable costs for Moscow.\n\nMore than 26 months have passed since Russia launched an all-out invasion that transformed a simmering Russia-Ukraine conflict into Europe's largest and bloodiest war since World War II. While the Russian military this year appears to have momentum, its army has failed to turn tactical gains in the Donbas region, such as the capture of the town of Avdiivka in February, into a major breakthrough.\n\nMoreover, the past two weeks have brought unpleasant news for the Kremlin. The U.S. Congress finally approved $61 billion in assistance for Ukraine, and the White House promptly announced the allocation of $7 billion for weapons. French President Emmanuel Macron affirmed that he would not rule out sending French troops to Ukraine, though Paris denied that French troops were already in the country. British Foreign Secretary David Cameron disclosed that London would allow Kyiv to use British-provided weapons to strike targets in Russia.\n\nThe Russian Defense Ministry's announcement said that Putin had directed the exercise to \"increase the readiness of nonstrategic nuclear forces to carry out combat missions.\" Russia will conduct the exercise in its Southern Military District, which adjoins Ukraine and has substantial responsibilities for commanding and supporting Russian forces fighting there.\n\nA bit perhaps, but not too much.\n\nAs Lawrence Freedman has noted, the actual use of non-strategic nuclear weapons in Ukraine would be inconsistent with Russian nuclear doctrine and with what Putin himself has said. Russia's 2020 nuclear policy statement provided that the Kremlin could use nuclear weapons in the event of \"aggression against the Russian Federation with the use of conventional weapons when the very existence of the state is in jeopardy.\" No serious military analyst believes that Russia's existence is imperiled.\n\nFreedman points out that when Putin raises nuclear weapons, he directs the threat against the United States and its allies that are supporting Ukraine, not against Ukraine itself. He seeks to dissuade Kyiv's supporters from committing their own forces to the conflict -- something that Ukraine's partners, Macron's remarks notwithstanding, do not appear to be considering. Since September 2022, when fears of possible Russian nuclear use peaked, Putin has several times denied an intention to use nuclear weapons against Ukraine, most recently in a March interview in which he observed: \"So, why do we need to use weapons of mass destruction [in Ukraine]? There has never been such a need.\"\n\nIn October and November 2022, Moscow appeared to figure out that its nuclear threats were not achieving their objectives. First, they had no impact on Kyiv's resolve to keep fighting. Ukrainians view this war as existential. If they lose, Ukraine as they know it is gone. The threat to use non-strategic nuclear weapons does not appear to have altered their determination, and Ukrainian military operations do not present obvious targets that would justify a nuclear strike.\n\nSecond, while concerns about possible Russian nuclear use have slowed Western decisions about providing arms to Ukraine, they have not prevented those decisions. Ukraine is receiving increasingly sophisticated weapons, with F-16 fighters soon to arrive. When Russia's nuclear threats peaked in fall 2022, Western officials publicly warned against using nuclear weapons, citing \"severe consequences\" though correctly leaving those consequences unspecified. The United States, Britain, and France -- NATO's three nuclear weapons states -- reportedly sent coordinated private messages to Moscow underscoring the risks.\n\nWhile not effecting a real change in Ukrainian or Western policy, the nuclear threats alarmed other countries that matter to Moscow, in particular, China and India. Putin seems to have adjusted to the fact that he is ostracized by the West. The use of nuclear weapons in a conventional war that he started, however, would very likely make him a global pariah. He very much wants to avoid that.\n\nRussian officials also must consider that the use of a nuclear weapon, against any target, would open a Pandora's box full of unpredictable but potentially very significant consequences. No one knows what would happen. A nuclear weapon has not been used in anger for nearly 79 years -- and then it was used by the United States, then the only country with nuclear arms, not in a world of multiple nuclear weapons states. The risks and potential costs of such an action for Moscow would be immense. Why would Putin chance that when Russian territory has not been, and almost certainly will not be, lost?\n\nPutin does not want a nuclear war. He does want Ukraine and the West to believe that he is prepared to risk one in order to undermine their resolve and determination. Of course, it can be unnerving when a nuclear state rattles its nuclear saber, particularly against a peaceful neighbor it has invaded. But Ukraine and the West can choose to keep their nerve.", "source": {"uri": "brookings.edu", "dataType": "news", "title": "Brookings"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

If Russia wins in Ukraine, there will be no security in Europe. Who can pretend that Russia will stop there?\"\n\nAnd during a visit to Ukraine last week, British Foreign Secretary David Cameron said that Ukraine could use British-supplied weapons to strike targets inside Russia.\n\n\"In terms of what the Ukrainians do, in our view it is their decision about how to use these weapons. They are defending their country. They were illegally invaded by Putin and they must take those steps,\" Cameron told reporters after the United Kingdom pledged continued financial and military support for Ukraine.\n\nThe drills announcement also comes shortly after the United States last month passed a long-delayed aid package for Kyiv, which will allow desperately needed military equipment and ammunition to flow to Ukraine as it tries to shore up its frontlines in the face of a renewed Russian onslaughts.\n\nRussian forces last month made further gains in at least three locations along Ukraine's eastern front, as Moscow tries to press home its manpower and ammunition advantage before the bulk of the US aid arrives in Ukraine.\n\nRussia has tended to raise the nuclear specter when its invasion of Ukraine has hit obstacles or when other countries make new pledges of support for Ukraine. After Ukraine liberated large swathes of its territory in late 2022, Putin conceded that the war is \"going to take a while\" and warned of the \"increasing\" threat of nuclear war.\n\nIn February last year, Putin announced that Russia would suspend participation in the New START treaty, a key nuclear arms reduction agreement with the United States, the last remaining pact that regulates the world's two largest nuclear arsenals. Putin said Russia would not be the first to test nuclear weapons, but would do so in the event of a US test.\n\nAfter Macron said in February that sending Western troops to Ukraine could not be ruled out, Putin warned \"this really threatens a conflict with the use of nuclear weapons, and therefore the destruction of civilization.\"\n\nUS President Joe Biden and State Department officials have previously downplayed concerns that Putin could deploy a nuclear weapon, but continue to take the threats seriously.\n\nIn late 2022, the US began \"preparing rigorously\" for Russia potentially striking Ukraine with a tactical nuclear weapon, in what would have been the first nuclear attack in war since the US dropped atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki nearly 80 years before, two senior administration officials previously told CNN.\n\nIn Monday's announcement, Russia's defense ministry said the military's General Staff had begun preparations for conducting \"exercises in the near future with missile formations of the Southern Military District involving aviation as well as naval forces.\"\n\nThe-CNN-Wire\n\n\u2122 & \u00a9 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

Headquartered in Rostov-on-Don, it is the smallest of Russia's military districts, and includes Crimea, the Caucasus, the regions of Rostov, Volgograd and Krasnodar, as well as the recently admitted Donetsk People's Republic (DPR), Lugansk People's Republic (LPR), Kherson and Zaporozhye Regions.\n\nWarheads with yields measured in kilotons of TNT - such as the weapons used by the US against the Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki in April 1945 - are now considered tactical nuclear weapons. They are intended for use against battlefield targets, whether field formations or hardened combat positions.\n\nTactical nuclear warheads with yields of 5-50 kilotons can be mounted on 9M723-1 ballistic missiles or the 9M728 cruise missiles, both fired from the Iskander-M complex. Similar warheads can be carried by Kh-47M2 Kinzhal and the Kh-32 cruise missiles that are carried by Russian bombers.\n\nA number of artillery systems can also deliver tactical nuclear warheads in the 2-2.5 kiloton range, installed in 152mm shells and 240mm mortar rounds.\n\nRussia is estimated to have almost 6,000 nuclear warheads of various yields. An unspecified number of tactical nuclear warheads were stationed in Belarus last year, as a response to NATO members delivering depleted uranium munitions to Ukraine.\n\nThe US has about 180 tactical nuclear bombs deployed at six bases in Europe - two in Italy, and one each in Belgium, Germany, the Netherlands and T\u00fcrkiye. The government in Warsaw has expressed a willingness to host the weapons as well, to which Moscow responded that it would consider Poland a priority target.\n\nThe tactical nuclear drills are taking place \"in the context of recent belligerent statements by Western officials and sharply destabilizing actions taken by a number of NATO countries\" in connection with the Ukraine conflict, the Russian Foreign Ministry said on Monday.\n\nThe US-led bloc's policy of inflicting a \"strategic defeat\" on Russia is leading it towards \"a further escalation of the Ukraine crisis towards an open military clash\" between NATO and Moscow, the ministry added.\n\nAs examples, the ministry cited Polish statements about the possible stationing of US nuclear weapons in Poland, but also recent French nuclear posturing and remarks by President Emmanuel Macron about the possibility of sending French and other NATO soldiers to Ukraine.\n\nAccording to the decree signed by President Vladimir Putin in July 2020, Moscow's nuclear arsenal is intended to deter external aggression against Russia.\n\nThe doctrine is \"defensive in nature, aimed at maintaining the potential of nuclear forces at a level sufficient to ensure nuclear deterrence, and guarantees the protection of the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the state, deterring a potential enemy from aggression against the Russian Federation and (or) its allies, and - in the event of a military conflict - preventing the escalation of hostilities and their cessation on terms acceptable to the Russian Federation and (or) its allies.\"\n\nRussia views nuclear weapons \"solely as a means of deterrence\" and considers their use \"an extreme and forced measure,\" the decree specified.\n\nThe doctrine outlines the conditions under which the Russian president would be justified in authorizing the use of atomic weapons. Of particular importance is Section 17, which spells out that Russia \"reserves the right to use nuclear weapons in response to the use of nuclear weapons and other types of weapons of mass destruction against it and/or its allies, as well as in the event of aggression against the Russian Federation using conventional weapons, when the existence of the state itself is at risk.\" (emphasis added)\n\nTime and again since the escalation of the Ukraine conflict in February 2022, the US has accused Russia of rattling the nuclear sabers and even considering the use of tactical nuclear weapons against the government in Kiev. Moscow has repeatedly dismissed such claims as groundless speculation.\n\nFor example, a CNN reporter claimed in March that Washington began \"preparing rigorously\" for the possibility of Russia using nuclear weapons in Ukraine in late 2022, as Kiev's forces advanced in Kharkov and Kherson. However, Russian President Vladimir Putin said in an interview that it had \"never come into his mind to use tactical nuclear weapons\" despite the \"various situations\" that had emerged on the battlefield.\n\nIn a speech to Russian lawmakers at the end of February, Putin accused the West of flirting with nuclear disaster. \"Everything that they are thinking up now, that they are scaring the world with, it all really poses the threat of a conflict involving nuclear weapons, and therefore, the destruction of civilization. Don't they understand this?\" the Russian president said at the time.\n\nEarlier this year, while Congress was debating the $61 billion military aid bill for Kiev, the US floated unspecified accusations about a secret Russian nuclear capability in space. The Kremlin has denied such rumors as scurrilous.", "source": {"uri": "rt.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "RT"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TNT_equivalent",

Tactical nuclear weapons include air bombs, warheads for short-range missiles and artillery munitions and are meant for use on a battlefield. They are less powerful than the massive warheads that arm intercontinental ballistic missiles, which are intended to obliterate entire cities.\n\nRussia also lashed out at NATO's four-month-long military exercises, known as \"Steadfast Defender.\"\n\nRussian foreign ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova said in a statement Saturday that NATO's expansive military exercises close to Russia's borders are proof that the Western alliance is preparing for a potential conflict with Russia.\n\nNATO is currently holding the \"Steadfast Defender\" exercise -- the largest demonstration of military power the transatlantic alliance has performed in the North Atlantic, Arctic seas and across Europe since the end of the Cold War.\n\nPresident Vladimir Putin warned the West last March that a direct conflict between Russia and the U.S.-led NATO military alliance would mean the planet was one step away from World War Three, adding hardly anyone wanted such a scenario.\n\nThe Russian president has faced pressure from some hardliners inside Russia to reword Russia's nuclear doctrine, changing the conditions under which Russia would use a nuclear weapon, though Putin said last year he saw no need for change.\n\n\"We do not see anything new here,\" said Andriy Yusov, a spokesperson for Ukrainian military intelligence. \"Nuclear blackmail is a constant practice of Putin's regime,\" he said, reiterating what Ukrainian officials and some Western officials have said in the past that Russia is bluffing over nuclear weapons to scare the West.\n\nSince Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, Moscow has repeatedly warned that the United States and its European allies are pushing the world to the brink of nuclear confrontation by supporting Ukraine with tens of billions of dollars of weapons, some of which are being used against Russian territory.\n\nU.S. President Joe Biden said last year that he felt there was no real prospect of Russia using nuclear weapons, but CNN reported that in interviews top U.S. officials, who wanted to remain anonymous due to the sensitivity of the issue, said the U.S. prepared \"rigorously\" for a potential Russian nuclear strike in Ukraine in late 2022.\n\nMeanwhile, Ukraine and its Western allies say Russia's war in Ukraine is an imperial-style land grab by a corrupt dictatorship. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has repeatedly warned that Russia's expansionist goals won't end in Ukraine.\n\nWestern leaders have vowed to support a defeat of Russian forces in Ukraine, while ruling out any deployment of NATO personnel there.\n\nRussia and the United States are the world's biggest nuclear powers, possessing more than 10,600 of the world's 12,100 nuclear warheads. China has the third-largest nuclear arsenal, followed by France and Britain.\n\nRussia has about 1,558 non-strategic nuclear warheads, according to the Federation of American Scientists, though there is uncertainty about exact figures for such weapons due to a lack of transparency.\n\nNo power has used nuclear weapons in war since the United States unleashed the first atomic bomb attacks on the Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki in 1945.", "source": {"uri": "voanews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "VOA Voice of America"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

This announcement comes amid what Russia describes as an escalation in Western provocations.\n\nPresident Vladimir Putin, who authorized the nuclear exercises, has intensified his nuclear rhetoric since deploying his forces into Ukraine in 2022.In February, he expressed concerns about the \"real\" possibility of a nuclear conflict.\n\nHere's a breakdown of key questions and answers to help understand the situation better.\n\nWhat are tactical nuclear weapons?\n\nTactical nuclear weapons are designed for use on the battlefield against military targets, rather than strategic targets like cities. They are less powerful than nuclear-tipped intercontinental ballistic missiles, with yields as small as about 1 kiloton -- compared to the 15 kilotons of the bomb dropped on Hiroshima. These weapons can include aerial bombs, warheads for short-range missiles, and artillery munitions, and are small enough to be transported discreetly.\n\nWhy did Russia order these drills?\n\nThe drills are seen as a response to what Moscow perceives as escalatory statements and actions by US allies concerning the ongoing conflict in Ukraine. The Russian government said that these exercises are meant to refine the deployment and readiness of non-strategic nuclear weapons, thus ensuring the country's sovereignty and integrity. According to the Russian foreign and defense ministries, \"The primary goal of these drills is to ensure the integrity and sovereignty of Russia.\"\n\nWhat does Russia aim to achieve with these drills?\n\nThese drills serve multiple purposes: they are a show of strength, a test of the military's readiness, and a signal to the West regarding Russia's nuclear capabilities. As tensions continue with NATO countries, these exercises are also a reminder of Russia's military capabilities and its willingness to use nuclear weapons if it perceives its national security is threatened.\n\nAre tactical nuclear weapons covered by arms control agreements?\n\nUnlike strategic nuclear weapons, tactical nuclear weapons have never been limited by arms control agreements between major powers like Moscow and Washington. Russia has not publicly disclosed the exact number of these weapons it possesses.\n\nHow does the Russian military doctrine view the use of these weapons?\n\nRussian defense doctrine allows for a nuclear response to a nuclear attack or an assault with conventional weapons that threaten the state's existence. The language in the doctrine is somewhat vague, leading some Russian experts to call for clearer terms to make the West take their capabilities more seriously.\n\nWhat recent actions has Russia taken regarding tactical nuclear weapons?\n\nIn a notable move, Russia recently stationed some of its tactical nuclear weapons in Belarus, an ally that borders Ukraine and several NATO members. This deployment is intended to counter what are perceived as Western threats and extends Russia's ability to quickly target potential adversaries in Eastern and Central Europe.\n\nThis exercise and the shifting dynamics of Russia's nuclear strategy continue to be a significant factor in the geopolitical landscape, influencing international relations and security considerations around the globe.\n\n(With inputs from agencies)\n\nAt TOI World Desk, our dedicated team of seasoned journalists and passionate writers tirelessly sifts through the vast tapestry of global events to bring you the latest news and diverse perspectives round the clock.

China has the third largest nuclear arsenal, followed by France and Britain.\n\nPutin casts the war as part of a centuries-old battle with the West which he says humiliated Russia after the Berlin Wall fell in 1989 by enlarging NATO and encroaching on what Moscow considers to be Russia's historical sphere of influence.\n\nUkraine and its Western backers say the war is an imperial-style land grab by a corrupt dictatorship. Western leaders have vowed to work for a defeat of Russian forces in Ukraine, while ruling out any deployment of NATO personnel there.", "source": {"uri": "dailymaverick.co.za", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Maverick"}, "authors": [{"uri": "reuters@dailymaverick.co.za", "name": "Reuters", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_weapon", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nuclear weapon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vladimir_Putin", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Vladimir Putin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Russia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Territorial_integrity", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Territorial integrity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_parade", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Military parade"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sovereignty", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sovereignty"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukraine", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_invasion_of_Ukraine", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Russian invasion of Ukraine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emmanuel_Macron", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Emmanuel Macron"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_Armed_Forces", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Russian Armed Forces"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_France", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "President of France"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "France"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_alliance", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Military alliance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sphere_of_influence", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sphere of influence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_III", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "World War III"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berlin_Wall", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Berlin Wall"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dictatorship", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dictatorship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weapon_of_mass_destruction", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Weapon of mass destruction"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NATO", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NATO"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moscow", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Moscow"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Moscow"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Physics/Nuclear", "label": "dmoz/Science/Physics/Nuclear", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Military_Science", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Military Science", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Pharmacy/Nuclear_Pharmacy", "label": "dmoz/Health/Pharmacy/Nuclear Pharmacy", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 94}], "image": "https://www.dailymaverick.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/12126089.jpg?w=1280", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9542018", "eventUri": "eng-9542018", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.2313725490196078, "wgt": 202, "relevance": 1}

Headquartered in Rostov-on-Don, it is the smallest of Russia's military districts, and includes Crimea, the Caucasus, the regions of Rostov, Volgograd and Krasnodar, as well as the recently admitted Donetsk People's Republic (DPR), Lugansk People's Republic (LPR), Kherson and Zaporozhye Regions.\n\nWarheads with yields measured in kilotons of TNT - such as the weapons used by the US against the Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki in April 1945 - are now considered tactical nuclear weapons. They are intended for use against battlefield targets, whether field formations or hardened combat positions.\n\nTactical nuclear warheads with yields of 5-50 kilotons can be mounted on 9M723-1 ballistic missiles or the 9M728 cruise missiles, both fired from the Iskander-M complex. Similar warheads can be carried by Kh-47M2 Kinzhal and the Kh-32 cruise missiles that are carried by Russian bombers.\n\nA number of artillery systems can also deliver tactical nuclear warheads in the 2-2.5 kiloton range, installed in 152mm shells and 240mm mortar rounds.\n\nRussia is estimated to have almost 6,000 nuclear warheads of various yields. An unspecified number of tactical nuclear warheads were stationed in Belarus last year, as a response to NATO members delivering depleted uranium munitions to Ukraine.\n\nThe US has about 180 tactical nuclear bombs deployed at six bases in Europe - two in Italy, and one each in Belgium, Germany, the Netherlands and T\u00fcrkiye. The government in Warsaw has expressed a willingness to host the weapons as well, to which Moscow responded that it would consider Poland a priority target.\n\nThe tactical nuclear drills are taking place \"in the context of recent belligerent statements by Western officials and sharply destabilizing actions taken by a number of NATO countries\" in connection with the Ukraine conflict, the Russian Foreign Ministry said on Monday.\n\nThe US-led bloc's policy of inflicting a \"strategic defeat\" on Russia is leading it towards \"a further escalation of the Ukraine crisis towards an open military clash\" between NATO and Moscow, the ministry added.\n\nAs examples, the ministry cited Polish statements about the possible stationing of US nuclear weapons in Poland, but also recent French nuclear posturing and remarks by President Emmanuel Macron about the possibility of sending French and other NATO soldiers to Ukraine.\n\nAccording to the decree signed by President Vladimir Putin in July 2020, Moscow's nuclear arsenal is intended to deter external aggression against Russia.\n\nThe doctrine is \"defensive in nature, aimed at maintaining the potential of nuclear forces at a level sufficient to ensure nuclear deterrence, and guarantees the protection of the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the state, deterring a potential enemy from aggression against the Russian Federation and (or) its allies, and - in the event of a military conflict - preventing the escalation of hostilities and their cessation on terms acceptable to the Russian Federation and (or) its allies.\"\n\nRussia views nuclear weapons \"solely as a means of deterrence\" and considers their use \"an extreme and forced measure,\" the decree specified.\n\nThe doctrine outlines the conditions under which the Russian president would be justified in authorizing the use of atomic weapons. Of particular importance is Section 17, which spells out that Russia \"reserves the right to use nuclear weapons in response to the use of nuclear weapons and other types of weapons of mass destruction against it and/or its allies, as well as in the event of aggression against the Russian Federation using conventional weapons, when the existence of the state itself is at risk.\" (emphasis added)\n\nTime and again since the escalation of the Ukraine conflict in February 2022, the US has accused Russia of rattling the nuclear sabers and even considering the use of tactical nuclear weapons against the government in Kiev. Moscow has repeatedly dismissed such claims as groundless speculation.\n\nFor example, a CNN reporter claimed in March that Washington began \"preparing rigorously\" for the possibility of Russia using nuclear weapons in Ukraine in late 2022, as Kiev's forces advanced in Kharkov and Kherson. However, Russian President Vladimir Putin said in an interview that it had \"never come into his mind to use tactical nuclear weapons\" despite the \"various situations\" that had emerged on the battlefield.\n\nIn a speech to Russian lawmakers at the end of February, Putin accused the West of flirting with nuclear disaster. \"Everything that they are thinking up now, that they are scaring the world with, it all really poses the threat of a conflict involving nuclear weapons, and therefore, the destruction of civilization. Don't they understand this?\" the Russian president said at the time.\n\nEarlier this year, while Congress was debating the $61 billion military aid bill for Kiev, the US floated unspecified accusations about a secret Russian nuclear capability in space. The Kremlin has denied such rumors as scurrilous.", "source": {"uri": "polandsun.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Poland Sun"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

A spokesperson for Macron declined to comment.\n\nThe Kremlin spokesman also took aim at the U.K., whose Foreign Secretary David Cameron said last week that Ukraine has the right to decide how to use long-range weapons provided by his country, appearing to back away from a policy banning the use of Western-supplied arms to strike Russia.\n\nThe announcement of Russian military drills also comes as more than a dozen member states of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization take part in the security alliance's largest military exercise since the Cold War, focused on countering threats from Russia.\n\nIn recent weeks, Russia has been advancing on the battlefield, taking a string of Ukrainian villages in the eastern part of the country around Avdiivka, a city its forces captured in February after months of heavy fighting.\n\nPutin has hinted on numerous occasions at his willingness to use tactical nuclear weapons in Ukraine, and Western officials have cited the risks of nuclear escalation as they weigh what kinds of weapons to supply to Ukraine.\n\nAhead of his re-election for a fifth presidential term in March, Putin warned again that Russia was prepared to use nuclear weapons if it feels threatened, citing the comments by Macron.\n\n\"They started talking about the possibility of sending NATO military contingents to Ukraine,\" Putin said. Russia's opponents, Putin said, \"must after all realize that we too have weapons that can hit targets on their territory.\"\n\nDays into the invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, Putin instructed the military to raise the alert level of Russia's strategic nuclear forces. But experts say the work normally required to raise alert levels -- including dispersal of mobile missiles and patrolling by nuclear submarines -- wasn't actually conducted by Russia.\n\n\"There was more staff added to the command posts,\" said Andrey Baklitskiy, a nuclear weapons expert at the United Nations Institute for Disarmament Research. \"No other notable things were detected.\" Baklitskiy notes that the readiness level hasn't been publicly reversed since then.\n\nTactical nuclear weapons are short-range weapons designed for use on the battlefield or to take out critical infrastructure, such as power stations. Unlike strategic nuclear weapons -- a weapon of last resort designed for the destruction of large cities -- they have never been constrained by any formal arms-control agreement.\n\nRussia has previously conducted military exercises using strategic nuclear weapons, as well as intercontinental ballistic missiles and submarine-launched rockets. Analysts say that in the coming exercises, it is unlikely to actually test tactical nuclear weapons.\n\nCoupled with Moscow's response to the Western warnings, they say the drills are meant to send another message to Ukraine's allies that Russia is ready to use everything at its disposal.\n\nPavel Podvig, a senior researcher at the U.N.'s Institute for Disarmament Research, said the exercises will likely involve Russia taking tactical nuclear weapons out of storage facilities in the south and practicing placing them -- or dummy versions of them -- in delivery systems.\n\nHe said it is just as likely that Russia won't handle any nuclear weapons in the drills, and focus instead of testing the readiness of ballistic rockets.\n\n\"The timing of the announcement suggests that it's designed to be a signal,\" he said.", "source": {"uri": "livemint.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "mint"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moscow_Kremlin", "type": "loc",

Tactical nuclear weapons include air bombs, warheads for short-range missiles and artillery munitions and are meant for use on a battlefield. They are less powerful than the strategic weapons -- warheads that arm intercontinental ballistic missiles and are intended to obliterate entire cities.\n\nU.N. spokesman Stephane Dujarric expressed concern that various parties have been talking about issues regarding nuclear weapons more and more recently.\n\n\"Current nuclear risks are at an alarmingly high level,\" Dujarric said. \"All actions that could lead to miscalculation, escalation with catastrophic consequences, must be avoided.\"\n\nThe Russian announcement was a warning to Ukraine's Western allies about becoming more deeply engaged in the 2-year-old war, where the Kremlin's forces have gained an upper hand amid Ukraine's shortage of manpower and weapons. Some of Ukraine's Western partners have previously expressed concern that the conflict could spill beyond Ukraine into a war between NATO and Russia.\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron repeated last week that he doesn't exclude sending troops to Ukraine, and U.K. Foreign Secretary David Cameron said Kyiv's forces will be able to use British long-range weapons to strike targets inside Russia. Some other NATO countries providing weapons to Kyiv have balked at that possibility.\n\nThe Kremlin branded those comments as dangerous, heightening tension between Russia and NATO. The war already has placed significant strain on relations between Moscow and the West.\n\nKremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Monday that Macron's recent statement and other remarks by British and U.S. officials had prompted the nuclear drills.\n\n\"It's a new round of escalation,\" Peskov said, referring to what the Kremlin regarded as provocative statements. \"It's unprecedented and requires special attention and special measures.\"\n\nRussia's Foreign Ministry summoned the French and British ambassadors. It urged the British ambassador \"to think about the inevitable catastrophic consequences of such hostile steps from London.\"\n\nSweden's Foreign Minister Tobias Billstr\u00f6m said the nuclear exercises \"contribute to increasing instability.\"\n\n\"In the current security situation, Russia's actions may be considered particularly irresponsible and reckless,\" Billstr\u00f6m told Swedish news agency TT.\n\nDmitry Medvedev, the deputy head of Russia's Security Council that's chaired by Putin, said the comments by Macron and Cameron risked pushing the nuclear-armed world toward a \"global catastrophe.\"\n\nIt wasn't the first time Europe's military support for Ukraine has prompted nuclear saber-rattling. In March 2023, after the U.K.'s decision to provide Ukraine with armor-piercing shells containing depleted uranium, Putin said he intends to deploy tactical nuclear weapons on the territory of Ukraine neighbor Belarus.\n\nThe ministry said the exercise is intended to \"increase the readiness of non-strategic nuclear forces to fulfill combat tasks\" and will be held on Putin's orders. The maneuvers will involve missile units of the Southern Military District along with the air force and the navy, it said.\n\nThe Russian announcement stirred little reaction in Ukraine, where the spokesman for the military intelligence agency, Andrii Yusov, said on national television: \"Nuclear blackmail is a usual practice of Putin's regime; it does not constitute major news.\"\n\nWestern officials have blamed Russia for threatening a wider war through provocative acts. NATO countries said last week that they are deeply concerned by a campaign of hybrid activities on the military alliance's soil, accusing Moscow of being behind them and saying they represent a security threat.\n\nPeskov dismissed those claims as \"new, unfounded accusations leveled at our country.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Ukrainian drones hit two vehicles Monday in Russia's Belgorod region, killing six people and injuring 35 others, including two children, local authorities said. The area has been hit by Kyiv's forces in recent months.\n\nOne of the vehicles was a minibus carrying farm workers, Belgorod Gov. Vyacheslav Gladkov said.\n\nIt was not possible to independently confirm the report.\n\nWhile Ukraine's army is largely pinned down on the 600-mile front line due to a shortage of troops and ammunition after more than two years of fighting, it has used its long-range firepower to hit targets deep inside Russia.\n\nIn what has largely been a war of attrition, Russia also has relied heavily on long-range missiles, artillery and drones to wreak damage on Ukraine.\n\nThe Kremlin's forces kept up their bombardment of Ukraine's power grid with a nighttime Russian drone attack targeting energy infrastructure in Ukraine's northern region of Sumy. Multiple towns and villages in the region, including Sumy, lost power, regional authorities said.\n\nRussia attacked Ukrainian targets with 13 Shahed drones overnight, 12 of which were intercepted in the Sumy region, Ukraine's air force said.\n\nParamedic evacuation crew member codename Livsi waits for injured soldiers in an medical point in the area of Avdiivka close to Donetsk, Ukraine, Saturday, May 4, 2024.

Missile formations in the Southern Military District and naval forces will take part.\n\n\"During the exercise, a set of measures will be carried out to practice the issues of preparation and use of non-strategic nuclear weapons,\" the ministry said.\n\nThe exercise is aimed at ensuring Russia's territorial integrity and sovereignty \"in response to provocative statements and threats by certain Western officials against the Russian Federation\", it said.\n\nIt did not name the officials. But Russia has repeatedly said that remarks by French President Emmanuel Macron about a possible French intervention in Ukraine are extremely dangerous.\n\nRussia says the United States and its European allies are pushing the world to the brink of confrontation between nuclear powers by supporting Ukraine with tens of billions of dollars of weapons in its fight against the Russian forces that invaded Ukraine in February 2022.\n\nNuclear powers routinely check their nuclear weapons but rarely publicly link such exercises to specific perceived threats.\n\nNUCLEAR RISKS\n\nSince the war began, Russia has repeatedly warned of rising nuclear risks - warnings which the United States says it has to take seriously though U.S. officials say they have seen no change in Russia's nuclear posture.\n\nPutin has faced calls inside Russia from some hardliners to change Russia's nuclear doctrine, which sets out the conditions under which Russia would use a nuclear weapon, though Putin said last year he saw no need to change the doctrine.\n\nBroadly, the doctrine says such a weapon would be used in response to an attack using nuclear or other weapons of mass destruction, or the use of conventional weapons against Russia \"when the very existence of the state is put under threat\".\n\nPutin warned the West in March that a direct conflict between Russia and the U.S.-led NATO military alliance would mean the planet was one step away from World War Three but said hardly anyone wanted such a scenario.\n\nRussia and the United States are by far the world's biggest nuclear powers, holding more than 10,600 of the world's 12,100 nuclear warheads. China has the third largest nuclear arsenal, followed by France and Britain.\n\nPutin casts the war as part of a centuries-old battle with the West which he says humiliated Russia after the Berlin Wall fell in 1989 by enlarging NATO and encroaching on what Moscow considers to be Russia's historical sphere of influence.\n\nUkraine and its Western backers say the war is an imperial-style land grab by a corrupt dictatorship. Western leaders have vowed to work for a defeat of Russian forces in Ukraine, while ruling out any deployment of NATO personnel there.\n\nSign Up for Springs AM Update Your morning rundown of the latest news from Colorado Springs and around the country\n\nSign Up View all of our newsletters.

Tactical nuclear weapons include air bombs, warheads for short-range missiles and artillery munitions and are meant for use on a battlefield. They are less powerful than the strategic weapons -- massive warheads that arm intercontinental ballistic missiles and are intended to obliterate entire cities.\n\nThe Russian announcement was a warning to Ukraine's Western allies about becoming more deeply engaged in the 2-year-old war, where the Kremlin's forces have gained an upper hand amid Ukraine's shortage of manpower and weapons. Some of Ukraine's Western partners have previously expressed concern that the conflict could spill beyond Ukraine into a war between NATO and Russia.\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron repeated last week that he doesn't exclude sending troops to Ukraine, and U.K. Foreign Secretary David Cameron said Kyiv's forces will be able to use British long-range weapons to strike targets inside Russia. Some other NATO countries providing weapons to Kyiv have balked at that possibility.\n\nThe Kremlin branded those comments as dangerous, heightening tension between Russia and NATO. The war already has placed significant strain on relations between Moscow and the West.\n\nKremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Monday that Macron's recent statement and other remarks by British and U.S. officials had prompted the nuclear drills.\n\n\"It's a new round of escalation,\" Peskov said, referring to what the Kremlin regarded as provocative statements. \"It's unprecedented and requires special attention and special measures.\"\n\nRussia's Foreign Ministry summoned both the French and British ambassadors. It urged the British ambassador \"to think about the inevitable catastrophic consequences of such hostile steps from London.\"\n\nSweden's Foreign Minister Tobias Billstr\u00f6m said the nuclear exercises \"contribute to increasing instability.\"\n\n\"In the current security situation, Russia's actions may be considered particularly irresponsible and reckless,\" Billstr\u00f6m told Swedish news agency TT.\n\nDmitry Medvedev, the deputy head of Russia's Security Council that's chaired by Putin, said in his typically hawkish fashion that the comments by Macron and Cameron risked pushing the nuclear-armed world toward a \"global catastrophe.\"\n\nIt wasn't the first time Europe's military support for Ukraine has prompted nuclear saber-rattling. In March 2023, after the U.K.'s decision to provide Ukraine with armor-piercing shells containing depleted uranium, Putin said he intends to deploy tactical nuclear weapons on the territory of Ukraine neighbor Belarus.\n\nThe ministry said the exercise is intended to \"increase the readiness of non-strategic nuclear forces to fulfill combat tasks\" and will be held on Putin's orders. The maneuvers will involve missile units of the Southern Military District along with the air force and the navy, it said.\n\nThe Russian announcement stirred little reaction in Ukraine, where the spokesman for the Military Intelligence agency, Andrii Yusov, said on national television: \"Nuclear blackmail is a usual practice of Putin's regime; it does not constitute major news.\"\n\nWestern officials have blamed Russia for threatening a wider war through provocative acts. NATO countries said last week they are deeply concerned by a campaign of hybrid activities on the military alliance's soil, accusing Moscow of being behind them and saying they represent a security threat.\n\nPeskov dismissed those claims as \"new, unfounded accusations leveled at our country.\"\n\nGermany said Monday it recalled its ambassador to Russia for a week of consultations in Berlin following an alleged computer hack of Chancellor Olaf Scholz's party.\n\nMeanwhile, Ukrainian drones hit two vehicles Monday in Russia's Belgorod region, killing six people and injuring 35 others, including two children, local authorities said. The area has been hit by Kyiv's forces in recent months.\n\nOne of the vehicles was a minibus carrying farm workers, Belgorod Gov. Vyacheslav Gladkov said.\n\nIt was not possible to independently confirm the report.\n\nWhile Ukraine's army is largely pinned down on the 1,000-kilometer (600-mile) front line due to a shortage of troops and ammunition after more than two years of fighting, it has used its long-range firepower to hit targets deep inside Russia.\n\nIn what has largely been a war of attrition, Russia also has relied heavily on long-range missile, artillery and drones to wreak damage on Ukraine.\n\nThe Kremlin's forces kept up their bombardment of Ukraine's power grid, with a nighttime Russian drone attack targeting energy infrastructure in Ukraine's northern region of Sumy. Multiple towns and villages in the region, including Sumy, lost power, regional authorities said.\n\nRussia attacked Ukrainian targets with 13 Shahed drones overnight, 12 of which were intercepted in the Sumy region, Ukraine's air force said.\n\nFollow AP's coverage of the war in Ukraine at https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine\n\nMore from this section\n\nStriking deals to end campus protests,

Missile formations in the Southern Military District and naval forces will take part.\n\n\"During the exercise, a set of measures will be carried out to practice the issues of preparation and use of non-strategic nuclear weapons,\" the ministry said.\n\nThe exercise is aimed at ensuring Russia's territorial integrity and sovereignty \"in response to provocative statements and threats by certain Western officials against the Russian Federation\", it said.\n\nIt did not name the officials. But Russia has repeatedly said that remarks by French President Emmanuel Macron about a possible French intervention in Ukraine are extremely dangerous.\n\nRussia says the US and its European allies are pushing the world to the brink of confrontation between nuclear powers by supporting Ukraine with tens of billions of dollars of weapons in its fight against the Russian forces that invaded Ukraine in February 2022.\n\nNuclear powers routinely check their nuclear weapons but rarely publicly link such exercises to specific perceived threats.\n\nNuclear risks\n\nSince the war began, Russia has repeatedly warned of rising nuclear risks -- warnings which the US says it has to take seriously, though US officials say they have seen no change in Russia's nuclear posture.\n\nPutin has faced calls inside Russia from some hardliners to change Russia's nuclear doctrine, which sets out the conditions under which Russia would use a nuclear weapon, though Putin said last year he saw no need to change the doctrine.\n\nBroadly, the doctrine says such a weapon would be used in response to an attack using nuclear or other weapons of mass destruction, or the use of conventional weapons against Russia \"when the very existence of the state is put under threat\".\n\nPutin warned the West in March that a direct conflict between Russia and the US-led Nato military alliance would mean the planet was one step away from World War 3 but said hardly anyone wanted such a scenario.\n\nRussia and the US are by far the world's biggest nuclear powers, holding more than 10,600 of the world's 12,100 nuclear warheads. China has the third-largest nuclear arsenal, followed by France and Britain.\n\nPutin casts the war as part of a centuries-old battle with the West which he says humiliated Russia after the Berlin Wall fell in 1989 by enlarging Nato and encroaching on what Moscow considers to be Russia's historical sphere of influence.\n\nUkraine and its Western backers say the war is an imperial-style land grab by a corrupt dictatorship.\n\nWestern leaders have vowed to work for a defeat of Russian forces in Ukraine, while ruling out any deployment of Nato personnel there.", "source": {"uri": "businesslive.co.za", "dataType": "news", "title": "BusinessLIVE"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_weapon", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nuclear weapon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Russia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vladimir_Putin", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Vladimir Putin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tactical_nuclear_weapon", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tactical nuclear weapon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_exercise", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Military exercise"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_Military_District", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Southern Military District"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_parade", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Military parade"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moscow", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Moscow"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Moscow"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukraine", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_invasion_of_Ukraine", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Russian invasion of Ukraine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Territorial_integrity", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Territorial integrity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emmanuel_Macron", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Emmanuel Macron"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_Armed_Forces", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Russian Armed Forces"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sovereignty", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sovereignty"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_France", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "President of France"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "France"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_alliance", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Military alliance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sphere_of_influence", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sphere of influence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berlin_Wall", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Berlin Wall"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dictatorship", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dictatorship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weapon_of_mass_destruction", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Weapon of mass destruction"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Physics/Nuclear", "label": "dmoz/Science/Physics/Nuclear", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Military_Science", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Military Science", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Pharmacy/Nuclear_Pharmacy", "label": "dmoz/Health/Pharmacy/Nuclear Pharmacy", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 95}], "image": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/Cm7GpzFhbmpXw30iGxUyOISHqR98gJRw_0l59D7nIMUCem9PCxoIRh0DVLpW6EOYJEF4ezT-bvliflP2Drm-tkj87sa6ko9jHkU22O97GneN=s1000", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9542018", "eventUri": "eng-9542018", "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.2, "wgt": 200, "relevance": 1}

Tactical nuclear weapons include air bombs, warheads for short-range missiles and artillery munitions and are meant for use on a battlefield. They are less powerful than the strategic weapons -- massive warheads that arm intercontinental ballistic missiles and are intended to obliterate entire cities.\n\nU.N. spokesman Stephane Dujarric expressed concern that various parties have been talking about issues regarding nuclear weapons more and more recently.\n\n\"Current nuclear risks are at an alarmingly high level,\" Dujarric said. \"All actions that could lead to miscalculation, escalation with catastrophic consequences, must be avoided.\"\n\nThe Russian announcement was a warning to Ukraine's Western allies about becoming more deeply engaged in the 2-year-old war, where the Kremlin's forces have gained an upper hand amid Ukraine's shortage of manpower and weapons. Some of Ukraine's Western partners have previously expressed concern that the conflict could spill beyond Ukraine into a war between NATO and Russia.\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron repeated last week that he doesn't exclude sending troops to Ukraine, and U.K. Foreign Secretary David Cameron said Kyiv's forces will be able to use British long-range weapons to strike targets inside Russia. Some other NATO countries providing weapons to Kyiv have balked at that possibility.\n\nThe Kremlin branded those comments as dangerous, heightening tension between Russia and NATO. The war already has placed significant strain on relations between Moscow and the West.\n\nKremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Monday that Macron's recent statement and other remarks by British and U.S. officials had prompted the nuclear drills.\n\n\"It's a new round of escalation,\" Peskov said, referring to what the Kremlin regarded as provocative statements. \"It's unprecedented and requires special attention and special measures.\"\n\nRussia's Foreign Ministry summoned both the French and British ambassadors. It urged the British ambassador \"to think about the inevitable catastrophic consequences of such hostile steps from London.\"\n\nSweden's Foreign Minister Tobias Billstr\u00f6m said the nuclear exercises \"contribute to increasing instability.\"\n\n\"In the current security situation, Russia's actions may be considered particularly irresponsible and reckless,\" Billstr\u00f6m told Swedish news agency TT.\n\nDmitry Medvedev, the deputy head of Russia's Security Council that's chaired by Putin, said in his typically hawkish fashion that the comments by Macron and Cameron risked pushing the nuclear-armed world toward a \"global catastrophe.\"\n\nIt wasn't the first time Europe's military support for Ukraine has prompted nuclear saber-rattling. In March 2023, after the U.K.'s decision to provide Ukraine with armor-piercing shells containing depleted uranium, Putin said he intends to deploy tactical nuclear weapons on the territory of Ukraine neighbor Belarus.\n\nThe ministry said the exercise is intended to \"increase the readiness of non-strategic nuclear forces to fulfill combat tasks\" and will be held on Putin's orders. The maneuvers will involve missile units of the Southern Military District along with the air force and the navy, it said.\n\nThe Russian announcement stirred little reaction in Ukraine, where the spokesman for the Military Intelligence agency, Andrii Yusov, said on national television: \"Nuclear blackmail is a usual practice of Putin's regime; it does not constitute major news.\"\n\nWestern officials have blamed Russia for threatening a wider war through provocative acts. NATO countries said last week they are deeply concerned by a campaign of hybrid activities on the military alliance's soil, accusing Moscow of being behind them and saying they represent a security threat.\n\nPeskov dismissed those claims as \"new, unfounded accusations leveled at our country.\"\n\nGermany said Monday it recalled its ambassador to Russia for a week of consultations in Berlin following an alleged computer hack of Chancellor Olaf Scholz's party.\n\nMeanwhile, Ukrainian drones hit two vehicles Monday in Russia's Belgorod region, killing six people and injuring 35 others, including two children, local authorities said. The area has been hit by Kyiv's forces in recent months.\n\nOne of the vehicles was a minibus carrying farm workers, Belgorod Gov. Vyacheslav Gladkov said.\n\nIt was not possible to independently confirm the report.\n\nWhile Ukraine's army is largely pinned down on the 1,000-kilometer (600-mile) front line due to a shortage of troops and ammunition after more than two years of fighting, it has used its long-range firepower to hit targets deep inside Russia.\n\nIn what has largely been a war of attrition, Russia also has relied heavily on long-range missile, artillery and drones to wreak damage on Ukraine.\n\nThe Kremlin's forces kept up their bombardment of Ukraine's power grid, with a nighttime Russian drone attack targeting energy infrastructure in Ukraine's northern region of Sumy. Multiple towns and villages in the region, including Sumy, lost power, regional authorities said.\n\nRussia attacked Ukrainian targets with 13 Shahed drones overnight, 12 of which were intercepted in the Sumy region, Ukraine's air force said.\n\nFollow AP's coverage of the war in Ukraine at https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine", "source": {"uri": "eagletribune.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

Tactical nuclear weapons include air bombs, warheads for short-range missiles and artillery munitions and are meant for use on a battlefield. They are less powerful than the strategic weapons - massive warheads that arm intercontinental ballistic missiles and are intended to obliterate entire cities.\n\nU.N. spokesman Stephane Dujarric expressed concern that various parties have been talking about issues regarding nuclear weapons more and more recently.\n\n\"Current nuclear risks are at an alarmingly high level,\" Dujarric said. \"All actions that could lead to miscalculation, escalation with catastrophic consequences, must be avoided.\"\n\nThe Russian announcement was a warning to Ukraine's Western allies about becoming more deeply engaged in the 2-year-old war, where the Kremlin's forces have gained an upper hand amid Ukraine's shortage of manpower and weapons. Some of Ukraine's Western partners have previously expressed concern that the conflict could spill beyond Ukraine into a war between NATO and Russia.\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron repeated last week that he doesn't exclude sending troops to Ukraine, and U.K. Foreign Secretary David Cameron said Kyiv's forces will be able to use British long-range weapons to strike targets inside Russia. Some other NATO countries providing weapons to Kyiv have balked at that possibility.\n\nThe Kremlin branded those comments as dangerous, heightening tension between Russia and NATO. The war already has placed significant strain on relations between Moscow and the West.\n\nKremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Monday that Macron's recent statement and other remarks by British and U.S. officials had prompted the nuclear drills.\n\n\"It's a new round of escalation,\" Peskov said, referring to what the Kremlin regarded as provocative statements. \"It's unprecedented and requires special attention and special measures.\"\n\nMore: Russia's two-face on terror Russia's two-face on terror: Coddling Hamas while being attacked by ISIS\n\nMore: The U.S. owes debt to allies The U.S. still owes a debt to its Afghan allies\n\nMore: House passes Ukraine aid bill The House passes billions in aid for Ukraine and Israel after months of struggle. Next is the Senate\n\nRussia's Foreign Ministry summoned both the French and British ambassadors. It urged the British ambassador \"to think about the inevitable catastrophic consequences of such hostile steps from London.\"\n\nSweden's Foreign Minister Tobias Billstr\u00f6m said the nuclear exercises \"contribute to increasing instability.\"\n\n\"In the current security situation, Russia's actions may be considered particularly irresponsible and reckless,\" Billstr\u00f6m told Swedish news agency TT.\n\nDmitry Medvedev, the deputy head of Russia's Security Council that's chaired by Putin, said in his typically hawkish fashion that the comments by Macron and Cameron risked pushing the nuclear-armed world toward a \"global catastrophe.\"\n\nIt wasn't the first time Europe's military support for Ukraine has prompted nuclear saber-rattling. In March 2023, after the U.K.'s decision to provide Ukraine with armor-piercing shells containing depleted uranium, Putin said he intends to deploy tactical nuclear weapons on the territory of Ukraine neighbor Belarus.\n\nThe ministry said the exercise is intended to \"increase the readiness of non-strategic nuclear forces to fulfill combat tasks\" and will be held on Putin's orders. The maneuvers will involve missile units of the Southern Military District along with the air force and the navy, it said.\n\nThe Russian announcement stirred little reaction in Ukraine, where the spokesman for the Military Intelligence agency, Andrii Yusov, said on national television: \"Nuclear blackmail is a usual practice of Putin's regime; it does not constitute major news.\"\n\nWestern officials have blamed Russia for threatening a wider war through provocative acts. NATO countries said last week they are deeply concerned by a campaign of hybrid activities on the military alliance's soil, accusing Moscow of being behind them and saying they represent a security threat.\n\nPeskov dismissed those claims as \"new, unfounded accusations leveled at our country.\"\n\nGermany said Monday it recalled its ambassador to Russia for a week of consultations in Berlin following an alleged computer hack of Chancellor Olaf Scholz's party.\n\nMeanwhile, Ukrainian drones hit two vehicles Monday in Russia's Belgorod region, killing six people and injuring 35 others, including two children, local authorities said. The area has been hit by Kyiv's forces in recent months.\n\nOne of the vehicles was a minibus carrying farm workers, Belgorod Gov. Vyacheslav Gladkov said.\n\nIt was not possible to independently confirm the report.\n\nWhile Ukraine's army is largely pinned down on the 1,000-kilometer (600-mile) front line due to a shortage of troops and ammunition after more than two years of fighting, it has used its long-range firepower to hit targets deep inside Russia.\n\nIn what has largely been a war of attrition, Russia also has relied heavily on long-range missile, artillery and drones to wreak damage on Ukraine.\n\nThe Kremlin's forces kept up their bombardment of Ukraine's power grid, with a nighttime Russian drone attack targeting energy infrastructure in Ukraine's northern region of Sumy. Multiple towns and villages in the region, including Sumy, lost power, regional authorities said.\n\nRussia attacked Ukrainian targets with 13 Shahed drones overnight, 12 of which were intercepted in the Sumy region, Ukraine's air force said.", "source": {"uri": "yorkdispatch.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "York Dispatch"}, "authors": [{"uri": "associated_press@yorkdispatch.com", "name":

Tactical nuclear weapons include air bombs, warheads for short-range missiles and artillery munitions and are meant for use on a battlefield. They are less powerful than the massive warheads that arm intercontinental ballistic missiles, which are intended to obliterate entire cities.\n\nThe Russian announcement was a warning to Ukraine's Western allies about becoming more deeply involved in the 2-year-old war. Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and some of his Western partners have warned that if Russia is not stopped, the conflict could spill beyond Ukraine into a war between NATO and Russia.\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron repeated last week that he doesn't exclude sending troops to Ukraine, and U.K. Foreign Secretary David Cameron said Kyiv's forces will be able to use British long-range weapons to strike targets inside Russia. Some other NATO countries providing weapons to Kyiv have balked at that possibility.\n\nThe Kremlin branded those comments dangerous, heightening tension between Russia and NATO. The war already has placed significant strain on relations between Moscow and the West.\n\nKremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Monday that Macron's recent statement and other remarks by British and U.S. officials had prompted the nuclear drills.\n\n\"It's a new round of escalation,\" Peskov said, referring to what the Kremlin regarded as provocative statements. \"It's unprecedented and requires special attention and special measures.\"\n\nDmitry Medvedev, the deputy head of Russia's Security Council that's chaired by Putin, said that the comments by Macron and Cameron risked pushing the nuclear-armed world toward a \"global catastrophe.\"\n\nIt wasn't the first time Europe's military support for Ukraine has prompted nuclear saber-rattling. In March 2023, after the U.K.'s decision to provide Ukraine with armor-piercing shells containing depleted uranium, Putin said he would deploy tactical nuclear weapons on the territory of Ukraine's neighbor Belarus. That country's president, a close ally of Putin's, then claimed in June -- without offering evidence -- that Russian nuclear weapons \"three times more powerful\" than those used on Japan by the U.S. in World War II had been deployed in Belarus.\n\nThe Russian defense ministry said the exercise announced Monday was intended to \"increase the readiness of non-strategic nuclear forces to fulfill combat tasks\" and would be held on Putin's orders. The maneuvers were to involve missile units of the Southern Military District, which borders Ukraine, along with the air force and the navy, it said.\n\nThe Russian announcement stirred little reaction in Ukraine, where the spokesman for the Military Intelligence agency, Andrii Yusov, said on national television: \"Nuclear blackmail is a usual practice of Putin's regime; it does not constitute major news.\"\n\nWestern officials have blamed Russia for threatening a wider war through provocative acts. NATO countries said last week they were deeply concerned by a campaign of hybrid activities on the military alliance's soil, accusing Moscow of being behind them and saying they represent a security threat.\n\nPeskov dismissed those claims as \"new, unfounded accusations leveled at our country.\"\n\nGermany said Monday it recalled its ambassador to Russia for a week of consultations in Berlin following an alleged computer hack of Chancellor Olaf Scholz's party.\n\nMeanwhile, Ukrainian drones hit two vehicles Monday in Russia's Belgorod region, killing six people and injuring 35 others, including two children, local authorities said. The area has been hit by Kyiv's forces in recent months.\n\nOne of the vehicles was a minibus carrying farm workers, Belgorod Gov. Vyacheslav Gladkov said.\n\nIt was not possible to independently confirm the report.\n\nWhile Ukraine's army is largely pinned down on the 600-mile front line due to a shortage of troops and ammunition after more than two years of fighting, it has used its long-range firepower to hit targets deep inside Russia.\n\nIn what has largely been a war of attrition, Russia also has relied heavily on long-range missile, artillery and drones to wreak damage on Ukraine.\n\nThe Kremlin's forces kept up their bombardment of Ukraine's power grid, with a nighttime Russian drone attack targeting energy infrastructure in Ukraine's northern region of Sumy. Multiple towns and villages in the region, including Sumy, lost power, regional authorities said.\n\nRussia attacked Ukrainian targets with 13 Shahed drones overnight, 12 of which were intercepted in the Sumy region, Ukraine's air force said.", "source": {"uri": "cbsnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CBS News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

The war already has placed significant strain on relations between Moscow and the West.\n\nKremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Monday that Macron's recent statement and other remarks by British and U.S. officials had prompted the nuclear drills.\n\n\"It's a new round of escalation,\" Peskov said, referring to what the Kremlin regarded as provocative statements. \"It's unprecedented and requires special attention and special measures.\"\n\nRussia's Foreign Ministry summoned both the French and British ambassadors.\n\nSweden's Foreign Minister Tobias Billstr\u00f6m said the nuclear exercises \"contribute to increasing instability.\"\n\n\"In the current security situation, Russia's actions may be considered particularly irresponsible and reckless,\" Billstr\u00f6m told Swedish news agency TT.\n\nDmitry Medvedev, the deputy head of Russia's Security Council that's chaired by Putin, said in his typically hawkish fashion that the comments by Macron and Cameron risked pushing the nuclear-armed world toward a \"global catastrophe.\"\n\nIt wasn't the first time Europe's military support for Ukraine has prompted nuclear saber-rattling. In March 2023, after the U.K.'s decision to provide Ukraine with armor-piercing shells containing depleted uranium, Putin said he intends to deploy tactical nuclear weapons on the territory of Ukraine neighbor Belarus.\n\nThe ministry said the exercise is intended to \"increase the readiness of non-strategic nuclear forces to fulfill combat tasks\" and will be held on Putin's orders. The maneuvers will involve missile units of the Southern Military District along with the air force and the navy, it said.\n\nThe Russian announcement stirred little reaction in Ukraine, where the spokesman for the Military Intelligence agency, Andrii Yusov, said on national television: \"Nuclear blackmail is a usual practice of Putin's regime; it does not constitute major news.\"\n\nWestern officials have blamed Russia for threatening a wider war through provocative acts. NATO countries said last week they are deeply concerned by a campaign of hybrid activities on the military alliance's soil, accusing Moscow of being behind them and saying they represent a security threat.\n\nPeskov dismissed those claims as \"new, unfounded accusations leveled at our country.\"\n\nGermany said Monday it recalled its ambassador to Russia for a week of consultations in Berlin following an alleged computer hack of Chancellor Olaf Scholz's party.\n\nMeanwhile, Ukrainian drones hit two vehicles Monday in Russia's Belgorod region, killing six people and injuring 35 others, including two children, local authorities said. The area has been hit by Kyiv's forces in recent months.\n\nOne of the vehicles was a minibus carrying farm workers, Belgorod Gov. Vyacheslav Gladkov said.\n\nIt was not possible to independently confirm the report.\n\nWhile Ukraine's army is largely pinned down on the 1,000-kilometer (600-mile) front line due to a shortage of troops and ammunition after more than two years of fighting, it has used its long-range firepower to hit targets deep inside Russia.\n\nIn what has largely been a war of attrition, Russia also has relied heavily on long-range missile, artillery and drones to wreak damage on Ukraine.\n\nThe Kremlin's forces kept up their bombardment of Ukraine's power grid, with a nighttime Russian drone attack targeting energy infrastructure in Ukraine's northern region of Sumy. Multiple towns and villages in the region, including Sumy, lost power, regional authorities said.\n\nRussia attacked Ukrainian targets with 13 Shahed drones overnight, 12 of which were intercepted in the Sumy region, Ukraine's air force said.", "source": {"uri": "lasvegassun.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Las Vegas Sun"}, "authors": [{"uri": "associated_press@lasvegassun.com", "name":

On May 3, the Kremlin issued an ominous response to remarks made by U.K. Foreign Minister David Cameron allowing Ukraine to use British weapons for strikes on Russian soil. Newsweek has contacted NATO for comment by email.\n\n\"During the exercise, a set of measures will be carried out to practice the issues of preparation and use of non-strategic nuclear weapons,\" the defense ministry said.\n\nThe exercises are aimed at \"maintaining the readiness of personnel and equipment of units for the combat use of non-strategic nuclear weapons\" and ensuring the nation's territorial integrity and sovereignty \"in response to provocative statements and threats by individual Western officials against the Russian Federation,\" the ministry added.\n\nDays earlier, Cameron appeared to give a green light to Ukraine using newly supplied British weapons on targets on Russian soil. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov condemned such rhetoric as \"dangerous\", saying that it was an example of \"verbal escalation\" that could threaten European security.\n\n\"These are direct escalations of tension around the Ukrainian conflict, which potentially may pose a danger to European security, to the entire security architecture of Europe,\" Peskov said. \"This is part of a dangerous trend of escalating tension through official statements, and is the cause for our concern.\"\n\nDmitry Medvedev, Russia's former president and prime minister, and current deputy chairman of the Security Council of Russia, warned in January that Moscow could respond with a nuclear strike if Ukraine attacked missile launch sites on Russian soil using long-range missiles provided by the West.\n\nAttacks by Ukraine risk infringing paragraph 19 of Russia's 2020 nuclear doctrine, Medvedev said in a post on his Telegram channel, warning that all those who support Kyiv \"should remember this.\"\n\nThe paragraph states that Russia could use nuclear weapons to respond to an attack using nuclear or other weapons of mass destruction, or to the use of conventional weapons against Russia \"when the very existence of the state is put under threat,\" Reuters reported.\n\n\"This is not a right to self-defense, but a direct and obvious basis for our use of nuclear weapons against such a state,\" added Medvedev.\n\nPutin has said since September 2022 that Russia would be prepared to use nuclear weapons to defend its \"territorial integrity,\" adding that \"this is not a bluff.\" During his annual state-of-the-nation address in Moscow on February 29, the Russian leader said that his \"strategic nuclear forces are in a state of full readiness.\"", "source": {"uri":

Tactical nuclear weapons include air bombs, warheads for short-range missiles and artillery munitions and are meant for use on a battlefield. They are less powerful than the strategic weapons -- massive warheads that arm intercontinental ballistic missiles and are intended to obliterate entire cities.\n\nU.N. spokesman Stephane Dujarric expressed concern that various parties have been talking about issues regarding nuclear weapons more and more recently.\n\n\"Current nuclear risks are at an alarmingly high level,\" Dujarric said. \"All actions that could lead to miscalculation, escalation with catastrophic consequences, must be avoided.\"\n\nThe Russian announcement was a warning to Ukraine's Western allies about becoming more deeply engaged in the 2-year-old war, where the Kremlin's forces have gained an upper hand amid Ukraine's shortage of manpower and weapons. Some of Ukraine's Western partners have previously expressed concern that the conflict could spill beyond Ukraine into a war between NATO and Russia.\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron repeated last week that he doesn't exclude sending troops to Ukraine, and U.K. Foreign Secretary David Cameron said Kyiv's forces will be able to use British long-range weapons to strike targets inside Russia. Some other NATO countries providing weapons to Kyiv have balked at that possibility.\n\nThe Kremlin branded those comments as dangerous, heightening tension between Russia and NATO. The war already has placed significant strain on relations between Moscow and the West.\n\nKremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Monday that Macron's recent statement and other remarks by British and U.S. officials had prompted the nuclear drills.\n\n\"It's a new round of escalation,\" Peskov said, referring to what the Kremlin regarded as provocative statements. \"It's unprecedented and requires special attention and special measures.\"\n\nRussia's Foreign Ministry summoned both the French and British ambassadors. It urged the British ambassador \"to think about the inevitable catastrophic consequences of such hostile steps from London.\"\n\nSweden's Foreign Minister Tobias Billstr\u00f6m said the nuclear exercises \"contribute to increasing instability.\"\n\n\"In the current security situation, Russia's actions may be considered particularly irresponsible and reckless,\" Billstr\u00f6m told Swedish news agency TT.\n\nDmitry Medvedev, the deputy head of Russia's Security Council that's chaired by Putin, said in his typically hawkish fashion that the comments by Macron and Cameron risked pushing the nuclear-armed world toward a \"global catastrophe.\"\n\nIt wasn't the first time Europe's military support for Ukraine has prompted nuclear saber-rattling. In March 2023, after the U.K.'s decision to provide Ukraine with armor-piercing shells containing depleted uranium, Putin said he intends to deploy tactical nuclear weapons on the territory of Ukraine neighbor Belarus.\n\nThe ministry said the exercise is intended to \"increase the readiness of non-strategic nuclear forces to fulfill combat tasks\" and will be held on Putin's orders. The maneuvers will involve missile units of the Southern Military District along with the air force and the navy, it said.\n\nThe Russian announcement stirred little reaction in Ukraine, where the spokesman for the Military Intelligence agency, Andrii Yusov, said on national television: \"Nuclear blackmail is a usual practice of Putin's regime; it does not constitute major news.\"\n\nWestern officials have blamed Russia for threatening a wider war through provocative acts. NATO countries said last week they are deeply concerned by a campaign of hybrid activities on the military alliance's soil, accusing Moscow of being behind them and saying they represent a security threat.\n\nPeskov dismissed those claims as \"new, unfounded accusations leveled at our country.\"\n\nGermany said Monday it recalled its ambassador to Russia for a week of consultations in Berlin following an alleged computer hack of Chancellor Olaf Scholz's party.\n\nMeanwhile, Ukrainian drones hit two vehicles Monday in Russia's Belgorod region, killing six people and injuring 35 others, including two children, local authorities said. The area has been hit by Kyiv's forces in recent months.\n\nOne of the vehicles was a minibus carrying farm workers, Belgorod Gov. Vyacheslav Gladkov said.\n\nIt was not possible to independently confirm the report.\n\nWhile Ukraine's army is largely pinned down on the 1,000-kilometer (600-mile) front line due to a shortage of troops and ammunition after more than two years of fighting, it has used its long-range firepower to hit targets deep inside Russia.\n\nIn what has largely been a war of attrition, Russia also has relied heavily on long-range missile, artillery and drones to wreak damage on Ukraine.\n\nThe Kremlin's forces kept up their bombardment of Ukraine's power grid, with a nighttime Russian drone attack targeting energy infrastructure in Ukraine's northern region of Sumy. Multiple towns and villages in the region, including Sumy, lost power, regional authorities said.\n\nRussia attacked Ukrainian targets with 13 Shahed drones overnight, 12 of which were intercepted in the Sumy region, Ukraine's air force said.

The manoeuvres will involve missile units of the Southern Military District along with the air force and the navy, it said.", "source": {"uri": "euronews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Euronews English"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tactical_nuclear_weapon", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tactical nuclear weapon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Russia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ministry_of_Defense_(Israel)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Ministry of Defense (Israel)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukraine", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_invasion_of_Ukraine", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Russian invasion of Ukraine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moscow_Kremlin", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Moscow Kremlin"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warhead", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Warhead"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intercontinental_ballistic_missile", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Intercontinental ballistic missile"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NATO", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NATO"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_Secretary", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Foreign Secretary"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyiv", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kyiv"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_Military_District", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Southern Military District"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emmanuel_Macron", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Emmanuel Macron"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_force", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Air force"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artillery", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Artillery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_France", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "President of France"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Cameron", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "David Cameron"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Missile", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Missile"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vladimir_Putin", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Vladimir Putin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moscow", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Moscow"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Moscow"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Military_Science", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Military Science", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Military/Weapons_and_Equipment", "label": "dmoz/Society/Military/Weapons and Equipment", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Pharmacy/Nuclear_Pharmacy", "label": "dmoz/Health/Pharmacy/Nuclear Pharmacy", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 89}], "image": "https://static.euronews.com/articles/stories/08/41/77/52/1200x675_cmsv2_d7156c68-d33f-5ae5-a026-352917532733-8417752.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9542018", "eventUri": "eng-9542018", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.584313725490196, "wgt": 197, "relevance": 1}

The U.S. bomb dropped on Hiroshima during World War II was 15 kilotons.\n\nSuch battlefield nuclear weapons -- aerial bombs, warheads for short-range missiles or artillery munitions -- can be very compact. Their small size allows them to be discreetly carried on a truck or plane.\n\nUnlike strategic weapons, which have been subject to arms control agreements between Moscow and Washington, tactical weapons never have been limited by any such pacts, and Russia hasn't released their numbers or any other specifics related to them.\n\nSince launching the full-scale invasion of Ukraine on Feb. 24, 2022, Russian President Vladimir Putin has repeatedly reminded Western nations about Moscow's nuclear might in a bid to discourage them from increasing military support to Kyiv.\n\nEarly on in the war, Putin frequently referenced Moscow's nuclear arsenal by vowing repeatedly to use \"all means\" necessary to protect Russia. But he later toned down his statements as Ukraine's offensive last summer failed to reach its goals and Russia scored more gains on the battlefield.\n\nMoscow's defense doctrine envisages a nuclear response to an atomic strike or even an attack with conventional weapons that \"threaten the very existence of the Russian state.\" That vague wording has led some pro-Kremlin Russian experts to urge Putin to sharpen it to force the West to take the warnings more seriously.\n\nPutin said last fall that he sees no reason for such a change.\n\n\"There is no situation in which anything would threaten Russian statehood and the existence of the Russian state,\" he said. \"I think that no person of sober mind and clear memory could have an idea to use nuclear weapons against Russia.\"\n\nLast year, Russia moved some of its tactical nuclear weapons into the territory of Belarus, an ally that neighbors Ukraine and NATO members Poland, Latvia and Lithuania.\n\nBelarus' authoritarian president, Alexander Lukashenko, had long urged Moscow to station nuclear weapons in his country, which has close military ties with Russia and served as a staging ground for the war in Ukraine.\n\nBoth Putin and Lukashenko said that nuclear weapons deployment to Belarus was intended to counter perceived Western threats. Last year, Putin specifically linked the move to the U.K. government's decision to provide Ukraine with armor-piercing shells containing depleted uranium.\n\nNeither leader said how many were moved -- only that Soviet-era facilities in the country were readied to accommodate them, and that Belarusian pilots and missile crews were trained to use them. The weapons have remained under Russian military control.\n\nThe deployment of tactical nuclear weapons to Belarus, which has a 1,084-kilometer (673-mile) border with Ukraine, would allow Russian aircraft and missiles to reach potential targets there more easily and quickly, if Moscow decides to use them. It has also extended Russia's capability to target several NATO allies in Eastern and Central Europe.", "source": {"uri": "oneidadispatch.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Oneida Dispatch"},

Is it bluffing? - National | Globalnews.ca", "body": "Russia's announcement Monday that it will begin practising the deployment of tactical nuclear weapons in military drills could set a dangerous precedent for using nuclear threats in diplomacy, analysts warn.\n\nThe United States later said it would not be changing its nuclear posture in response to the announcement, underscoring what those experts say is the continued belief that Russia is unlikely to actually use nuclear weapons on the battlefield in Ukraine or against NATO allies.\n\n\"Russia's nuclear rhetoric has been reckless and irresponsible throughout this conflict (with Ukraine),\" U.S. State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller told reporters.\n\n\"That said, we have not seen any reason to adjust our own nuclear posture in response to these announcements, nor any indications that Russia is planning to use a nuclear weapon in Ukraine.\"\n\nThe White House and the Pentagon made similar comments, adding they have not seen any changes in Russia's strategic force posture.\n\nWhite House national security spokesperson John Kirby added during a press briefing that if Russia is worried about its troops in Ukraine getting hit by foreign-supplied weapons, \"the easiest thing to do is to take your troops and leave.\"\n\nRussia has raised the spectre of nuclear warfare since it launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022. But the Kremlin warned that its tactical weapons drills were in direct response to \"recent bellicose statements by Western officials\" and actions taken by NATO to further arm Ukraine.\n\n\"We hope that this event will cool down the 'hotheads' in Western capitals,\" Russia's foreign ministry said in a statement.\n\nSpecifically, the ministry pointed to the delivery of U.S. ATACMS long-range weapons to Ukraine, which were in addition to British and French long-range missile systems already sent to Kyiv.\n\nDuring a visit to Kyiv last week, British Foreign Secretary David Cameron told Reuters in an interview that Ukraine has the \"right\" to respond to Russian attacks by striking targets inside Russia with long-range weapons supplied by the U.K.\n\nThat remark countered years of concern from NATO allies, particularly the U.S., which delayed sending long-range weapons to Ukraine over fears it would further escalate the war by striking within Russia's borders. The U.S. finally began sending its longest-range ATACMS to Ukraine last month and has promised more after Congress approved billions of dollars in new military aid.\n\nMeanwhile, French President Emmanuel Macron reaffirmed in an interview with The Economist last week that he could not rule out the possibility of western troops being sent to Ukraine, a comment he first made earlier this year.\n\nThe Kremlin has long warned that both striking within Russia and sending western troops to Ukraine would be red lines that could lead to the deployment of nuclear weapons.\n\nThe foreign ministry said Monday it had summoned both the British and French ambassadors to Russia to formally protest the remarks made by Cameron and Macron, respectively.\n\nBritain denied that its ambassador Nigel Casey had been summoned, saying he had met Russian officials \"for a diplomatic meeting\" in which he \"reiterated the U.K.'s support for Ukraine in the face of unprovoked Russian aggression.\"\n\nYet Russia's foreign ministry said in a statement that during the meeting, Russian officials warned Casey that if Ukraine struck Russian territory with British weapons, then Moscow could hit back at British military installations and equipment both inside Ukraine \"and abroad.\"\n\nUkraine, similar to the U.S., appeared unconcerned about Russia's latest announcement.\n\n\"We do not see anything new here,\" Andriy Yusov, a spokesperson for Ukrainian military intelligence, told Reuters. \"Nuclear blackmail is a constant practice of (Russian President Vladimir Putin's) regime.\"\n\nNuclear weapons experts believe Putin may be seeking to show strength ahead of Moscow's annual Victory Day celebrations on May 9, which are typically marked with displays of military might. Putin will also be sworn in for a fifth term as president on Tuesday.\n\nPutin may also be seeking to deter Ukraine from striking within Russia because it would puncture the \"illusion of safety\" he has created for the Russian people, said John Erath, a senior director at the Center for Arms Control and Non-Proliferation in Washington.\n\n\"For most Russians, the war does not affect them,\" he told Global News in an interview.\n\nAn attack on Russian infrastructure \"could have some effect on the Russian population's willingness to continue to send their brothers off to die for -- it's not very clear what.\"\n\nRussia has about 1,558 non-strategic nuclear warheads, according to the Federation of American Scientists, though there is uncertainty about exact figures for such weapons due to a lack of transparency.\n\nPutin has faced calls inside Russia from some hardliners to change Russia's nuclear doctrine, which sets out the conditions under which Russia would use a nuclear weapon, though Putin said last year he saw no need for change.\n\nBroadly, the doctrine says such a weapon would be used in response to an attack using nuclear or other weapons of mass destruction, or the use of conventional weapons against Russia \"when the very existence of the state is put under threat.\"\n\nErath said the continued threat of nuclear weapons makes it all the more critical to ensure Ukraine's victory in the war. That includes ensuring Russia isn't seen as having successfully used those threats to hold onto seized Ukrainian territory through any kind of negotiated peace agreement.\n\n\"That sets a very disturbing precedent of nuclear weapons becoming normalized as a tool of diplomacy,\" he said.\n\n\"What is (North Korean leader) Kim Jong Un going to think about that? How is that going to affect his policy? How might China approach a Taiwan crisis? Will Iran decide to remain non-nuclear now that they have pretty much all capabilities they need to build such weapons?\"", "source": {"uri": "globalnews.ca", "dataType": "news", "title": "Global

The U.S. bomb dropped on Hiroshima during World War II was 15 kilotons.\n\nSuch battlefield nuclear weapons -- aerial bombs, warheads for short-range missiles or artillery munitions -- can be very compact. Their small size allows them to be discreetly carried on a truck or plane.\n\nUnlike strategic weapons, which have been subject to arms control agreements between Moscow and Washington, tactical weapons never have been limited by any such pacts, and Russia hasn't released their numbers or any other specifics related to them.\n\nSince launching the full-scale invasion of Ukraine on Feb. 24, 2022, Russian President Vladimir Putin has repeatedly reminded Western nations about Moscow's nuclear might in a bid to discourage them from increasing military support to Kyiv.\n\nEarly on in the war, Putin frequently referenced Moscow's nuclear arsenal by vowing repeatedly to use \"all means\" necessary to protect Russia. But he later toned down his statements as Ukraine's offensive last summer failed to reach its goals and Russia scored more gains on the battlefield.\n\nMoscow's defense doctrine envisages a nuclear response to an atomic strike or even an attack with conventional weapons that \"threaten the very existence of the Russian state.\" That vague wording has led some pro-Kremlin Russian experts to urge Putin to sharpen it to force the West to take the warnings more seriously.\n\nPutin said last fall that he sees no reason for such a change.\n\n\"There is no situation in which anything would threaten Russian statehood and the existence of the Russian state,\" he said. \"I think that no person of sober mind and clear memory could have an idea to use nuclear weapons against Russia.\"\n\nLast year, Russia moved some of its tactical nuclear weapons into the territory of Belarus, an ally that neighbors Ukraine and NATO members Poland, Latvia and Lithuania.\n\nBelarus' authoritarian president, Alexander Lukashenko, had long urged Moscow to station nuclear weapons in his country, which has close military ties with Russia and served as a staging ground for the war in Ukraine.\n\nBoth Putin and Lukashenko said that nuclear weapons deployment to Belarus was intended to counter perceived Western threats. Last year, Putin specifically linked the move to the U.K. government's decision to provide Ukraine with armor-piercing shells containing depleted uranium.\n\nNeither leader said how many were moved -- only that Soviet-era facilities in the country were readied to accommodate them, and that Belarusian pilots and missile crews were trained to use them. The weapons have remained under Russian military control.\n\nThe deployment of tactical nuclear weapons to Belarus, which has a 1,084-kilometer (673-mile) border with Ukraine, would allow Russian aircraft and missiles to reach potential targets there more easily and quickly, if Moscow decides to use them. It has also extended Russia's capability to target several NATO allies in Eastern and Central Europe.\n\n___\n\nFollow the AP's coverage of the war at https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine", "source":

Tactical nuclear weapons include air bombs, warheads for short-range missiles and artillery munitions and are meant for use on a battlefield. They are less powerful than the strategic weapons -- massive warheads that arm intercontinental ballistic missiles and are intended to obliterate entire cities.\n\nThe Russian announcement was a warning to Ukraine's Western allies about becoming more deeply engaged in the two-year-old war, where the Kremlin's forces have gained an upper hand amid Ukraine's shortage of manpower and weapons. Some of Ukraine's Western partners have previously expressed concern that the conflict could spill beyond Ukraine into a war between NATO and Russia.\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron repeated last week that he doesn't exclude sending troops to Ukraine, and U.K. Foreign Secretary David Cameron said Kyiv's forces will be able to use British long-range weapons to strike targets inside Russia. Some other NATO countries providing weapons to Kyiv have balked at that possibility.\n\nThe Kremlin branded those comments as dangerous, heightening tension between Russia and NATO. The war already has placed significant strain on relations between Moscow and the West.\n\nKremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Monday that Macron's recent statement and other remarks by British and U.S. officials had prompted the nuclear drills.\n\n\"It's a new round of escalation,\" Peskov said, referring to what the Kremlin regarded as provocative statements. \"It's unprecedented and requires special attention and special measures.\"\n\nRussia's Foreign Ministry summoned both the French and British ambassadors. It urged the British ambassador \"to think about the inevitable catastrophic consequences of such hostile steps from London.\"\n\nSweden's Foreign Minister Tobias Billstr\u00f6m said the nuclear exercises \"contribute to increasing instability.\"\n\n\"In the current security situation, Russia's actions may be considered particularly irresponsible and reckless,\" Billstr\u00f6m told Swedish news agency TT.\n\nDmitry Medvedev, the deputy head of Russia's Security Council that's chaired by Putin, said in his typically hawkish fashion that the comments by Macron and Cameron risked pushing the nuclear-armed world toward a \"global catastrophe.\"\n\nIt wasn't the first time Europe's military support for Ukraine has prompted nuclear saber-rattling. In March 2023, after the U.K.'s decision to provide Ukraine with armor-piercing shells containing depleted uranium, Putin said he intends to deploy tactical nuclear weapons on the territory of Ukraine neighbor Belarus.\n\nThe ministry said the exercise is intended to \"increase the readiness of non-strategic nuclear forces to fulfill combat tasks\" and will be held on Putin's orders. The maneuvers will involve missile units of the Southern Military District along with the air force and the navy, it said.\n\nThe Russian announcement stirred little reaction in Ukraine, where the spokesman for the Military Intelligence agency, Andrii Yusov, said on national television: \"Nuclear blackmail is a usual practice of Putin's regime; it does not constitute major news.\"\n\nWestern officials have blamed Russia for threatening a wider war through provocative acts. NATO countries said last week they are deeply concerned by a campaign of hybrid activities on the military alliance's soil, accusing Moscow of being behind them and saying they represent a security threat.\n\nPeskov dismissed those claims as \"new, unfounded accusations leveled at our country.\"\n\nGermany said Monday it recalled its ambassador to Russia for a week of consultations in Berlin following an alleged computer hack of Chancellor Olaf Scholz's party.\n\nMeanwhile, Ukrainian drones hit two vehicles Monday in Russia's Belgorod region, killing six people and injuring 35 others, including two children, local authorities said. The area has been hit by Kyiv's forces in recent months.\n\nOne of the vehicles was a minibus carrying farm workers, Belgorod Gov. Vyacheslav Gladkov said.\n\nIt was not possible to independently confirm the report.\n\nWhile Ukraine's army is largely pinned down on the 1,000-kilometre (600-mile) front line due to a shortage of troops and ammunition after more than two years of fighting, it has used its long-range firepower to hit targets deep inside Russia.\n\nIn what has largely been a war of attrition, Russia also has relied heavily on long-range missile, artillery and drones to wreak damage on Ukraine.\n\nThe Kremlin's forces kept up their bombardment of Ukraine's power grid, with a nighttime Russian drone attack targeting energy infrastructure in Ukraine's northern region of Sumy. Multiple towns and villages in the region, including Sumy, lost power, regional authorities said.\n\nRussia attacked Ukrainian targets with 13 Shahed drones overnight, 12 of which were intercepted in the Sumy region, Ukraine's air force said.", "source": {"uri": "ctvnews.ca", "dataType": "news", "title": "CTV News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Tactical nuclear weapons include air bombs, warheads for short-range missiles and artillery munitions and are meant for use on a battlefield. They are less powerful than the strategic weapons -- massive warheads that arm intercontinental ballistic missiles and are intended to obliterate entire cities.\n\nThe Russian announcement was a warning to Ukraine's Western allies about becoming more deeply engaged in the 2-year-old war, where the Kremlin's forces have gained an upper hand amid Ukraine's shortage of manpower and weapons. Some of Ukraine's Western partners have previously expressed concern that the conflict could spill beyond Ukraine into a war between NATO and Russia.\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron repeated last week that he doesn't exclude sending troops to Ukraine, and U.K. Foreign Secretary David Cameron said Kyiv's forces will be able to use British long-range weapons to strike targets inside Russia. Some other NATO countries providing weapons to Kyiv have balked at that possibility.\n\nThe Kremlin branded those comments as dangerous, heightening tension between Russia and NATO. The war already has placed significant strain on relations between Moscow and the West.\n\nKremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Monday that Macron's recent statement and other remarks by British and U.S. officials had prompted the nuclear drills.\n\n\"It's a new round of escalation,\" Peskov said, referring to what the Kremlin regarded as provocative statements. \"It's unprecedented and requires special attention and special measures.\"\n\nRussia's Foreign Ministry summoned both the French and British ambassadors. It urged the British ambassador \"to think about the inevitable catastrophic consequences of such hostile steps from London.\"\n\nSweden's Foreign Minister Tobias Billstr\u00f6m said the nuclear exercises \"contribute to increasing instability.\"\n\n\"In the current security situation, Russia's actions may be considered particularly irresponsible and reckless,\" Billstr\u00f6m told Swedish news agency TT.\n\nDmitry Medvedev, the deputy head of Russia's Security Council that's chaired by Putin, said in his typically hawkish fashion that the comments by Macron and Cameron risked pushing the nuclear-armed world toward a \"global catastrophe.\"\n\nIt wasn't the first time Europe's military support for Ukraine has prompted nuclear saber-rattling. In March 2023, after the U.K.'s decision to provide Ukraine with armor-piercing shells containing depleted uranium, Putin said he intends to deploy tactical nuclear weapons on the territory of Ukraine neighbor Belarus.\n\nThe ministry said the exercise is intended to \"increase the readiness of non-strategic nuclear forces to fulfill combat tasks\" and will be held on Putin's orders. The maneuvers will involve missile units of the Southern Military District along with the air force and the navy, it said.\n\nThe Russian announcement stirred little reaction in Ukraine, where the spokesman for the Military Intelligence agency, Andrii Yusov, said on national television: \"Nuclear blackmail is a usual practice of Putin's regime; it does not constitute major news.\"\n\nWestern officials have blamed Russia for threatening a wider war through provocative acts. NATO countries said last week they are deeply concerned by a campaign of hybrid activities on the military alliance's soil, accusing Moscow of being behind them and saying they represent a security threat.\n\nPeskov dismissed those claims as \"new, unfounded accusations leveled at our country.\"\n\nGermany said Monday it recalled its ambassador to Russia for a week of consultations in Berlin following an alleged computer hack of Chancellor Olaf Scholz's party.\n\nMeanwhile, Ukrainian drones hit two vehicles Monday in Russia's Belgorod region, killing six people and injuring 35 others, including two children, local authorities said. The area has been hit by Kyiv's forces in recent months.\n\nOne of the vehicles was a minibus carrying farm workers, Belgorod Gov. Vyacheslav Gladkov said.\n\nIt was not possible to independently confirm the report.\n\nWhile Ukraine's army is largely pinned down on the 1,000-kilometer (600-mile) front line due to a shortage of troops and ammunition after more than two years of fighting, it has used its long-range firepower to hit targets deep inside Russia.\n\nIn what has largely been a war of attrition, Russia also has relied heavily on long-range missile, artillery and drones to wreak damage on Ukraine.\n\nThe Kremlin's forces kept up their bombardment of Ukraine's power grid, with a nighttime Russian drone attack targeting energy infrastructure in Ukraine's northern region of Sumy. Multiple towns and villages in the region, including Sumy, lost power, regional authorities said.\n\nRussia attacked Ukrainian targets with 13 Shahed drones overnight, 12 of which were intercepted in the Sumy region, Ukraine's air force said.\n\nFollow AP's coverage of the war in Ukraine at https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine", "source": {"uri": "yakimaherald.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

If Russia wins in Ukraine, there will be no security in Europe. Who can pretend that Russia will stop there?\"\n\nAnd during a visit to Ukraine last week, British Foreign Secretary David Cameron said that Ukraine could use British-supplied weapons to strike targets inside Russia.\n\n\"In terms of what the Ukrainians do, in our view it is their decision about how to use these weapons. They are defending their country. They were illegally invaded by Putin and they must take those steps,\" Cameron told reporters after the United Kingdom pledged continued financial and military support for Ukraine.\n\nThe drills announcement also comes shortly after the United States last month passed a long-delayed aid package for Kyiv, which will allow desperately needed military equipment and ammunition to flow to Ukraine as it tries to shore up its frontlines in the face of a renewed Russian onslaughts.\n\nRussia has raised the nuclear specter when its invasion of Ukraine has hit obstacles or when other countries make new pledges of support for Ukraine. After Ukraine liberated large swathes of its territory in late 2022, Putin conceded that the war is \"going to take a while\" and warned of the \"increasing\" threat of nuclear war.", "source": {"uri": "kenyan-post.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "DAILY POST"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tactical_nuclear_weapon", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tactical nuclear weapon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_weapon", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nuclear weapon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vladimir_Putin", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Vladimir Putin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukraine", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Russia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_invasion_of_Ukraine", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Russian invasion of Ukraine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emmanuel_Macron", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Emmanuel Macron"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_Armed_Forces", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Russian Armed Forces"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moscow_Kremlin", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Moscow Kremlin"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dmitry_Peskov", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dmitry Peskov"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_France", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "President of France"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Cameron", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "David Cameron"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Economist", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Economist"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Europe"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_Secretary", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Foreign Secretary"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyiv", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kyiv"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_warfare", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nuclear warfare"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strike_action", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Strike action"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Martial_Arts/Russian", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Martial Arts/Russian", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Pharmacy/Nuclear_Pharmacy", "label": "dmoz/Health/Pharmacy/Nuclear Pharmacy", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 84}], "image": "https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiyqOsfA4MrR6akSCfRgo91aM7fnrMVrkCs57B_5pLYuQXT1TBYJg-pVIT20V0HTvTYiHyaoPqWb2YB_ZSdKlPsTKRCzvRO_TNIobRw-fP-9JnfdVpkrGibUO5xug4EEzMZSY5iQY_bF6vKKsD36_jsby0IyGQaZ5aiyHfKpOGEp309mZBlOaHJKWKZ32U/w1200-h630-p-k-no-nu/1.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9542018", "eventUri": "eng-9542018", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.192156862745098, "wgt": 195, "relevance": 1}

However, Monday marked the first public announcement of such drills by Russia.\n\nAccording to Russia's defence ministry, the exercises will encompass preparations and deployment scenarios involving non-strategic nuclear weapons.\n\nTactical nuclear weapons, unlike their strategic counterparts, are designed for battlefield use and possess lower destructive capabilities, as reported by CNN.\n\nThe decision to conduct these drills follows what the defence ministry describes as \"provocative statements and threats\" from Western officials, which Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov characterised as reaching \"unprecedented levels.\"\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron, in a recent interview with The Economist magazine, reiterated the possibility of deploying Western troops to Ukraine, underscoring the threat Russia poses to European security.\n\nSimilarly, British Foreign Secretary David Cameron, during a visit to Ukraine, emphasised Ukraine's right to defend itself using weapons supplied by the UK, condemning Russia's illegal invasion.\n\nThe announcement of the drills comes amidst the passage of a long-delayed aid package by the United States for Kyiv, aimed at bolstering Ukraine's military capabilities against renewed Russian aggression.\n\nRussian forces have made significant territorial gains along Ukraine's eastern front in recent months, exploiting their manpower and ammunition advantage before the arrival of US aid.\n\nPutin's invocation of nuclear rhetoric often coincides with challenges to Russia's military objectives or increased international support for Ukraine.\n\nAfter Ukraine reclaimed substantial territories in late 2022, Putin acknowledged the protracted nature of the conflict and highlighted the growing threat of nuclear war.\n\nIn February of the same year, Putin announced Russia's suspension of the New START treaty, citing the possibility of US nuclear testing as justification, according to CNN.\n\nWhile US President Joe Biden and State Department officials have sought to downplay concerns regarding Putin's nuclear threats, they remain vigilant in monitoring Russian actions.\n\nResponding to Russia's latest announcement, the Pentagon emphasised that there has been no discernible shift in Russia's strategic force posture.\n\nMaj Gen Patrick Ryder characterised Russia's decision as \"completely inappropriate\" and reflective of Russia's history of irresponsible rhetoric.\n\nReports indicate that the US has been actively preparing for the possibility of Russia using tactical nuclear weapons against Ukraine since late 2022.\n\nIn the latest announcement, Russia's defence ministry revealed plans for upcoming exercises involving missile formations from the Southern Military District, incorporating aviation and naval forces.\n\nAs tensions between Russia and the West continue to escalate, the international community remains on edge, cognizant of the potential ramifications of Putin's aggressive posture and nuclear brinkmanship, CNN reported.", "source": {"uri": "economictimes.indiatimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Economic Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

A day later, UK Foreign Secretary David Cameron said Ukraine could use British weapons against targets inside Russia if it wanted.\n\nRussian officials condemned both statements and warned Moscow would retaliate to what they called a \"dangerous escalation trend\". Moscow has long warned that conflict with NATO would become inevitable if European members of the military alliance sent in their soldiers to fight in Ukraine.\n\nRelations between Western countries, led by the United States, and Russia broke down after Russian forces invaded neighbouring Ukraine in February 2022.\n\nSince the war began, Russia has repeatedly warned of rising nuclear risks - warnings which the US says it has to take seriously though its officials note they have seen no change in Russia's nuclear posture.\n\nRussia and the US are by far the world's biggest nuclear powers, holding more than 10,600 of the world's 12,100 nuclear warheads. China has the third largest nuclear arsenal, followed by France and the United Kingdom.\n\nWhile there is no universal definition, tactical nuclear weapons are often defined by their size and range, or their use for limited targets.\n\nThere is no agreed-upon size that characterises tactical weapons but they are usually much larger than conventional bombs, causing radioactive fallout and other deadly effects beyond the explosion itself.\n\nThey are often referred to as \"nonstrategic weapons\", in contrast with strategic weapons, which the US military defines as designed to target \"the enemy's war-making capacity and will to make war\", including manufacturing, infrastructure, transportation and communication systems, and other targets.\n\nTactical weapons, by contrast, are designed to accomplish more limited and immediate military goals that win a battle. They can be mounted on missiles, airdropped bombs, or even artillery shells that have a relatively short range, far less than the huge intercontinental ballistic missiles designed to travel thousands of kilometres and hit targets across oceans.\n\n\"Tactical nuclear warheads were created to give military commanders more flexibility on the battlefield. In the mid-1950s, as more powerful thermonuclear bombs were being built and tested, military planners thought smaller weapons with a shorter range would be more useful in 'tactical' situations,\" according to Al Jazeera's defence editor Alex Gatopoulos.\n\n\"Modern warheads have a variable 'dial-up' yield, meaning an operator can specify its explosive power, and a tactical weapon would be anywhere from a fraction of a kilotonne to 50kt in strength. For scale, the weapon that destroyed Hiroshima was roughly 15kt. A single kilotonne is equivalent in power to 1,000 tonnes of TNT,\" he said.", "source": {"uri": "aljazeera.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Al Jazeera Online"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

It is unprecedented, it demands special attention and special measures,\" Peskov said.\n\nThe Kremlin has sought to deter western powers from intervening more directly in the grinding two-year war in Ukraine, where Russia's forces have gained the upper hand against Kyiv's outmanned, outgunned army.\n\nDmitry Medvedev, a former stand-in president for Putin, said Russia \"would have to respond\" if western countries sent troops to Ukraine, prompting a \"global catastrophe\".\n\nThe exercises mark a return to nuclear sabre-rattling for Putin ahead of his inauguration for a fifth presidential term on Tuesday, when he will extend his quarter-century rule until at least 2030. It came as Macron hosted China's Xi Jinping in Paris, who European leaders have urged to use his influence over Putin to encourage restraint on nuclear issues.\n\nRussia's defence ministry said the drills would test whether units were fully prepared to use non-strategic nuclear weapons -- such as short-range missiles or torpedoes -- \"to respond and in order to unconditionally ensure the territorial integrity and sovereignty of the Russian state\".\n\nRocket and aviation forces of Russia's southern military district, as well as naval units, would hold the exercises \"soon\", the ministry said, without providing any further details.\n\nThough Russia regularly stages nuclear exercises, holding them as an explicit response to the west is highly unusual, according to William Alberque, former director of Nato's Arms Control, Disarmament, and Nonproliferation Centre.\n\n\"My impression is that this is a clear attempt to use nuclear coercion against Macron himself for his recent statements on Ukraine and Russia. We are certainly embarking on unknown territory in terms of nuclear signalling,\" Alberque said.\n\nThe Kremlin has repeatedly voiced its dissatisfaction with Macron's hawkish stance since he first floated sending western troops to Ukraine in February, with Moscow claiming such a move would make a direct conflict between Russia and Nato inevitable.\n\nDmitry Kiselyov, the presenter of Russia's flagship state television news programme, hosted a segment late last month called 'We will use it!', in which he assured viewers Moscow was prepared to fire nuclear weapons in such a scenario.\n\n\"If Nato countries deploy their forces to Ukraine in order to deal a strategic defeat to Russia, then [\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009] we'll send everything flying everywhere!\" Kiselyov said, standing in front of a montage of nuclear-capable missile launches.\n\nThe exercises rehearse using Russia's non-strategic nuclear arsenal. Though they carry a smaller payload than intercontinental nuclear weapons targeting the US, the warheads can still release significantly more energy than the weapons dropped on Nagasaki and Hiroshima in 1945.\n\nRussia's threshold for using tactical nuclear weapons is lower than the Kremlin has ever publicly admitted, according to leaked training documents seen by the Financial Times.\n\nThey include an enemy landing on Russian territory, the defeat of units responsible for securing border areas, or an imminent enemy attack using conventional weapons.\n\nUkraine and its western allies have been concerned about a potential Russian nuclear strike since Putin hinted at one while announcing the invasion in 2022, then vowed to \"use all the means at our disposal\" to defend his conquests in Ukraine later that year.\n\nThe US, UK and France, Nato's three nuclear powers, warned Russia they could respond to a nuclear strike in Ukraine with conventional weapons, while Xi warned Putin against using nuclear weapons, according to western and Chinese officials.", "source": {"uri": "ft.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Financial Times News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Without any arrogance, swagger, and exclusivity claims, but only on equal terms and with due respect for each other's interests,\" he said.\n\nThe day before, the Russian Ministry of Defense announced that Putin had ordered military exercises practicing for the deployment of tactical nuclear weapons in light of \"provocative statements and threats\" by Western officials.\n\nWhile senior Russian officials have routinely gestured to the country's vast nuclear arsenal as tensions with the West have spiraled, the statement marks the first time Moscow has publicly announced drills involving tactical nuclear weapons.\n\nAnd on Tuesday, the Ministry of Defense of Belarus, which aided the Russian invasion of Ukraine, announced plans to hold a snap inspection of carrier vehicles for the Russian tactical nuclear weapons that are stationed in the country.\n\nA series of statements by Western officials in recent weeks have drawn Russia's ire and appear to have provoked this latest round of nuclear saber-rattling.\n\nOn Monday, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov pointed to recent remarks by French President Emmanuel Macron, who on multiple occasions has refused to rule out the possibility of Western troops being deployed to Ukraine.\n\nFrance's ambassador to Moscow, Pierre Levy, attended Putin's inauguration on Tuesday -- despite having been summoned to Russia's Foreign Ministry the previous day in a move that the French Ministry of Foreign Affairs dismissed as an effort at intimidation. Ambassadors from the U.S., U.K., and most European Union countries boycotted the ceremony.\n\nMacron's remarks, which NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg has downplayed, came as U.S. House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries warned in an interview with CBS News on Sunday that Ukraine could not be allowed to fall, because if it does, \"then there's a significant likelihood that America will have to get into the conflict -- not simply with our money, but with our servicewomen and our servicemen.\"\n\nAnd in an interview with Reuters last week, British Foreign Secretary David Cameron said that Ukraine had the right to use long-range weapons provided by the United Kingdom to strike targets within Russia.\n\nAll of this seems to have induced Putin to make a statement of his own, in his own way -- by ordering tactical nuclear drills.\n\nNuclear experts said that the Russian drills were not immediately alarming given that Moscow is making progress on the battlefield in Ukraine. \"I think this is a political statement intended ultimately to deter NATO boots on the ground,\" said James Acton, co-director of the nuclear policy program at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, who added that the likelihood of Russia deploying a nuclear bomb in the region would rise if Putin began to feel cornered in the war. \"By far the most likely trigger for that is a threat to Crimea,\" he said.\n\nReporting by the Financial Times in February indicated that Russia's threshold for using a tactical nuclear weapon is lower than the country had previously acknowledged. Potential scenarios that could trigger the use of a tactical nuclear weapon, according to a cache of secret Russian military documents reviewed by the newspaper, include a potential incursion on Russian territory, the defeat of units securing the country's borders, as well as more nebulous goals of \"stopping aggression\" and \"containing states from using aggression [...] or escalating military conflicts.\"\n\nIn late 2022, U.S. officials began \"preparing rigorously,\" concerned that Russia might use a nuclear weapon on the battlefield in Ukraine, CNN reported in March.\n\nWhile strategic nuclear warheads that can be deployed across continents have been subject to a slate of arms control agreements dating back to the Cold War, tactical nuclear weapons have never been subject to any such agreements, and there is little transparency as to the scale of Moscow's tactical nuclear arsenal.\n\nThere is no singularly accepted definition of a tactical nuclear weapon, but they are generally regarded to be smaller in size for use on the battlefield to gain the upper hand in war.\n\nCognizant of the terrifying effect of using a nuclear weapon, which hasn't occurred since the United States dropped two atomic weapons on the Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki in 1945, Putin is more likely to deploy a tactical nuclear warhead to stun Western leaders into changing their stance on the war, rather than to gain an advantage on the battlefield, Acton said.\n\n\"I think the goal of nuclear weapons would be to terrify us by the threat of escalation,\" he said. \"At the end of the day, Russia's nuclear threshold is wherever Putin decides it is.\"", "source": {"uri": "foreignpolicy.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Foreign Policy"}, "authors": [{"uri":

Tactical nuclear weapons include air bombs, warheads for short-range missiles and artillery munitions and are meant for use on a battlefield. They are less powerful than the massive warheads that arm intercontinental ballistic missiles and are intended to obliterate entire cities.\n\nThe Russian announcement appeared to be a warning to Ukraine's Western allies about becoming more deeply involved in the more than two-year war. Some of Ukraine's Western partners have previously expressed concern about stoking the conflict amid fears it could spill beyond Ukraine into a war between NATO and Russia.\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron repeated last week that he doesn't exclude sending troops to Ukraine, and U.K. Foreign Secretary David Cameron said Kyiv's forces will be able to use British long-range weapons to strike targets inside Russia. Some other NATO countries providing weapons to Kyiv have balked at that possibility.\n\nThe Kremlin branded those comments as dangerous, heightening tension between Russia and NATO. The war already has placed significant strain on relations between Moscow and the West.\n\nKremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov on Monday said Macron's recent statement and other remarks by British and U.S. officials had prompted the nuclear drills.\n\n\"It's a new round of escalation,\" Peskov said, referring to what the Kremlin regarded as provocative statements. \"It's unprecedented and requires special attention and special measures,\" Peskov told reporters.\n\nDmitry Medvedev, the deputy head of Russia's Security Council that's chaired by President Vladimir Putin, said in his typically hawkish fashion that the comments by Macron and Cameron risked pushing the nuclear-armed world toward a \"global catastrophe.\"\n\nIt wasn't the first time Europe's military support for Ukraine has irked Russian authorities and prompted nuclear saber-rattling. In March last year, after the U.K. government's decision to provide Ukraine with armor-piercing shells containing depleted uranium, Putin announced that he intends to deploy tactical nuclear weapons on the territory of Belarus.\n\nThe ministry said the exercise is intended to \"increase the readiness of non-strategic nuclear forces to fulfill combat tasks\" and will be held on Putin's orders. The maneuvers will involve missile units of the Southern Military District along with the air force and the navy, it said.\n\nWestern officials have blamed Russia for threatening a wider war through provocative acts. NATO countries said last week they are deeply concerned by a campaign of hybrid activities on the military alliance's soil, accusing Russia of being behind them and saying they represent a threat to their security.\n\nPeskov dismissed those claims as \"new unfounded accusations leveled at our country.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Ukrainian drones hit two vehicles Monday in Russia's Belgorod region, killing six people and injuring 35 others, including two children, local authorities said, in an area frequently struck by Kyiv's forces in recent months.\n\nOne of the vehicles was a minibus that was carrying farm workers, Belgorod Gov. Vyacheslav Gladkov said.\n\nNo other details were immediately available, and it was not possible to independently confirm the report from the border region.\n\nWhile Ukraine's army is largely pinned down on the 1,000-kilometer (600-mile) front line due to a shortage of troops and ammunition after more than two years of fighting, it has used its long-range firepower to hit targets deep inside Russia. The apparent aim is to disrupt Russia's war logistics system by hitting oil refineries and depots, and unnerve the Russian border regions.\n\nThe Belgorod region was a staging ground for Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. It has come under regular attack ever since Russian forces retreated there from northeastern Ukraine early in the war following a counteroffensive by Kyiv.\n\nIn what has largely been a war of attrition, Russia has also relied heavily on long-range missile, artillery and drones to wreak damage on Ukraine.\n\nAt the end of last year, Belgorod officials said 25 people were killed, including five children, and more than 100 were injured in a Ukrainian attack, and regular rocket and drone strikes have continued since then. The area can be reached by relatively simple and mobile weapons such as multiple rocket launchers from forests on the Ukrainian side.\n\nRussian authorities said in March they planned to evacuate about 9,000 children from the area because of continuous shelling, after Putin said he wanted to create a buffer zone to help protect border regions.\n\nAlso, the Kremlin's forces kept up their bombardment of Ukraine's power grid, with a nighttime Russian drone attack targeting energy infrastructure in Ukraine's northern region of Sumy. Multiple towns and villages in the region, including Sumy, lost power, regional authorities said.\n\nRussia attacked Ukrainian targets with 13 Shahed drones overnight, 12 of which were intercepted in the Sumy region, Ukraine's air force said.", "source": {"uri": "kimt.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "KIMT-TV 3 Mason City"}, "authors": [{"uri": "associated_press@kimt.com", "name": "Associated

The U.S. bomb dropped on Hiroshima during World War II was 15 kilotons.\n\nPUTIN'S INAUGURATION: FRANCE WILL SEND DIPLOMAT, GERMANY AND BALTIC STATES WILL NOT\n\nSuch battlefield nuclear weapons -- aerial bombs, warheads for short-range missiles or artillery munitions -- can be very compact. Their small size allows them to be discreetly carried on a truck or plane.\n\nUnlike strategic weapons, which have been subject to arms control agreements between Moscow and Washington, tactical weapons never have been limited by any such pacts, and Russia hasn't released their numbers or any other specifics related to them.\n\nSince launching the full-scale invasion of Ukraine on Feb. 24, 2022, Russian President Vladimir Putin has repeatedly reminded Western nations about Moscow's nuclear might in a bid to discourage them from increasing military support to Kyiv.\n\nEarly on in the war, Putin frequently referenced Moscow's nuclear arsenal by vowing repeatedly to use \"all means\" necessary to protect Russia. But he later toned down his statements as Ukraine's offensive last summer failed to reach its goals and Russia scored more gains on the battlefield.\n\nMoscow's defense doctrine envisages a nuclear response to an atomic strike or even an attack with conventional weapons that \"threaten the very existence of the Russian state.\" That vague wording has led some pro-Kremlin Russian experts to urge Putin to sharpen it to force the West to take the warnings more seriously.\n\nPutin said last fall that he sees no reason for such a change.\n\n\"There is no situation in which anything would threaten Russian statehood and the existence of the Russian state,\" he said. \"I think that no person of sober mind and clear memory could have an idea to use nuclear weapons against Russia.\"\n\nLast year, Russia moved some of its tactical nuclear weapons into the territory of Belarus, an ally that neighbors Ukraine and NATO members Poland, Latvia and Lithuania.\n\nBelarus' authoritarian president, Alexander Lukashenko, had long urged Moscow to station nuclear weapons in his country, which has close military ties with Russia and served as a staging ground for the war in Ukraine.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nBoth Putin and Lukashenko said that nuclear weapons deployment to Belarus was intended to counter perceived Western threats. Last year, Putin specifically linked the move to the U.K. government's decision to provide Ukraine with armor-piercing shells containing depleted uranium.\n\nNeither leader said how many were moved -- only that Soviet-era facilities in the country were readied to accommodate them, and that Belarusian pilots and missile crews were trained to use them. The weapons have remained under Russian military control.\n\nThe deployment of tactical nuclear weapons to Belarus, which has a 673-mile border with Ukraine, would allow Russian aircraft and missiles to reach potential targets there more easily and quickly, if Moscow decides to use them. It has also extended Russia's capability to target several NATO allies in Eastern and Central Europe.", "source": {"uri": "foxnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Fox News"}, "authors": [],

Tactical nuclear weapons include air bombs, warheads for short-range missiles and artillery munitions and are meant for use on a battlefield. They are less powerful than the strategic weapons -- massive warheads that arm intercontinental ballistic missiles and are intended to obliterate entire cities.\n\nThe Russian announcement was a warning to Ukraine's Western allies about becoming more deeply engaged in the 2-year-old war, where the Kremlin's forces have gained an upper hand amid Ukraine's shortage of manpower and weapons. Some of Ukraine's Western partners have previously expressed concern that the conflict could spill beyond Ukraine into a war between NATO and Russia.\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron repeated last week that he doesn't exclude sending troops to Ukraine, and U.K. Foreign Secretary David Cameron said Kyiv's forces will be able to use British long-range weapons to strike targets inside Russia.

Putin has not openly threatened a nuclear strike, though he has warned the West of the possibility of nuclear war in the event of direct confrontation.\n\nFormer Russian president and deputy chairman of the Russia' Security Council Dmitry Medvedev, on the other hand, has openly threatened the use of nuclear weapons on several occasions, including once again on Monday.\n\nMedvedev also linked the decision to hold tactical nuclear weapons exercises with deliberations in the West over sending allied ground troops to Ukraine.\n\nPutin's spokesman Dmitry Peskov also linked the planned nuclear exercises with statements by Western politicians regarding a possible deployment of troops in Ukraine, mentioning French President Emmanuel Macron in particular. Peskov spoke of a \"new round of escalating tensions.\"\n\nTactical nuclear weapons are different from so-called strategic nuclear weapons because they are less powerful and have a smaller range. They can take the form of artillery, but are most often ballistic or cruise missiles. They are fired using systems that can carry conventional as well as nuclear warheads.\n\nNuclear warheads for ground-to-air missile systems with a range of up to 500 kilometers (311 miles), and sea- or air-based missile systems with a range of up to 600 kilometers, are considered tactical nuclear weapons.\n\nHowever, there are no clear limits to the classification. Some sources classify the new Russian Kalibr cruise missiles and the Kinzhal hypersonic missile with a range of up to several thousand kilometers as tactical nuclear weapons.\n\nExperts interviewed by DW agree that the use of nuclear weapons in Ukraine is highly improbable and would be pointless. \"From a military point of view, the use of nuclear weapons by Russia in Ukraine makes no sense under any circumstances,\" said Pavel Podvig, of the United Nations Institute for Disarmament Research. Nothing had changed in this respect, he added.\n\nRussia would not be able to actually practice attacks during the exercise, only the procedure for using the weapons, according to the expert. \"This is because nonstrategic warheads are normally stored separately from the missiles and aircraft that can fire them,\" said Podvig.\n\nNikolai Sokov of the Vienna Center for Disarmament and Non-Proliferation believes there had never been any plans to use nuclear arms in Ukraine -- even in the fall of 2022, when the Russian army withdrew from the Kharkiv and Kherson regions.\n\nSome US media had reported that this could be discussed in Russia, Sokov said. But now, Russian troops clearly have the upper hand over the Ukrainian Armed Forces in many respects, and are taking more and more territory in eastern Ukraine, the expert said. Kyiv is even expecting the Russian attacks to expand, he added.\n\nNuclear escalation has been one of the West's biggest fears since the beginning of the Russian invasion. Western politicians and experts say this is precisely why weapons are being supplied to Ukraine in a slow and measured fashion.\n\nMathieu Boul\u00e8gue from the Wilson Center in the US said Moscow is counting on just this. He does not believe that Russia's planned nuclear exercises are \"solely due to France's attitude.\" In his opinion, they are part of the \"constant intimidation and saber-rattling\" of the Kremlin. The aim is to break the West's resolve to support Ukraine, he argued.\n\nPutin also wants to present himself as a \"strong leader,\" especially in the run-up to May 9, when Russia celebrates the Soviet victory over Nazi Germany, according to Boul\u00e8gue.\n\nMost experts see this as a warning to the West. \"There is nothing good about this political signal, but we should try to take it as soberly as possible,\" Podvig concluded.", "source": {"uri": "dw.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Deutsche Welle"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Tactical nuclear weapons include air bombs, warheads for short-range missiles and artillery munitions and are meant for use on a battlefield. They are less powerful than the massive warheads that arm intercontinental ballistic missiles and are intended to obliterate entire cities.\n\nThe Russian announcement was a warning to Ukraine's Western allies about becoming more deeply involved in the 2-year-old war. Some of Ukraine's Western partners have previously expressed concern that the conflict could spill beyond Ukraine into a war between NATO and Russia.\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron repeated last week that he doesn't exclude sending troops to Ukraine, and U.K. Foreign Secretary David Cameron said Kyiv's forces will be able to use British long-range weapons to strike targets inside Russia. Some other NATO countries providing weapons to Kyiv have balked at that possibility.\n\nThe Kremlin branded those comments as dangerous, heightening tension between Russia and NATO. The war already has placed significant strain on relations between Moscow and the West.\n\nKremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Monday that Macron's recent statement and other remarks by British and U.S. officials had prompted the nuclear drills.\n\n\"It's a new round of escalation,\" Peskov said, referring to what the Kremlin regarded as provocative statements. \"It's unprecedented and requires special attention and special measures.\"\n\nDmitry Medvedev, the deputy head of Russia's Security Council that's chaired by Putin, said in his typically hawkish fashion that the comments by Macron and Cameron risked pushing the nuclear-armed world toward a \"global catastrophe.\"\n\nIt wasn't the first time Europe's military support for Ukraine has prompted nuclear saber-rattling. In March 2023, after the U.K.'s decision to provide Ukraine with armor-piercing shells containing depleted uranium, Putin said he intends to deploy tactical nuclear weapons on the territory of Ukraine neighbor Belarus.\n\nThe ministry said the exercise is intended to \"increase the readiness of non-strategic nuclear forces to fulfill combat tasks\" and will be held on Putin's orders. The maneuvers will involve missile units of the Southern Military District along with the air force and the navy, it said.\n\nThe Russian announcement stirred little reaction in Ukraine, where the spokesman for the Military Intelligence agency, Andrii Yusov, said on national television: \"Nuclear blackmail is a usual practice of Putin's regime; it does not constitute major news.\"\n\nWestern officials have blamed Russia for threatening a wider war through provocative acts. NATO countries said last week they are deeply concerned by a campaign of hybrid activities on the military alliance's soil, accusing Moscow of being behind them and saying they represent a security threat.\n\nPeskov dismissed those claims as \"new, unfounded accusations leveled at our country.\"\n\nGermany said Monday it recalled its ambassador to Russia for a week of consultations in Berlin following an alleged computer hack of Chancellor Olaf Scholz's party.\n\nMeanwhile, Ukrainian drones hit two vehicles Monday in Russia's Belgorod region, killing six people and injuring 35 others, including two children, local authorities said. The area has been hit by Kyiv's forces in recent months.\n\nOne of the vehicles was a minibus carrying farm workers, Belgorod Gov. Vyacheslav Gladkov said.\n\nIt was not possible to independently confirm the report.\n\nWhile Ukraine's army is largely pinned down on the 1,000-kilometer (600-mile) front line due to a shortage of troops and ammunition after more than two years of fighting, it has used its long-range firepower to hit targets deep inside Russia.\n\nIn what has largely been a war of attrition, Russia also has relied heavily on long-range missile, artillery and drones to wreak damage on Ukraine.\n\nThe Kremlin's forces kept up their bombardment of Ukraine's power grid, with a nighttime Russian drone attack targeting energy infrastructure in Ukraine's northern region of Sumy. Multiple towns and villages in the region, including Sumy, lost power, regional authorities said.\n\nRussia attacked Ukrainian targets with 13 Shahed drones overnight, 12 of which were intercepted in the Sumy region, Ukraine's air force said.\n\nFollow AP's coverage of the war in Ukraine at https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine\n\nMore from this section\n\nStack Sports launches Stack Rewards to

The German foreign office says that Germany has called back its ambassador to Russia for a week of consultations, following an alleged hacker attack on Chancellor Olaf Scholz's party. The ministry said Monday, May 6, 2024 that the government is taking the incident \"serious.\"\n\nRussia said Monday it plans to hold drills simulating the use of battlefield nuclear weapons amid rising tensions following comments by senior Western officials about the possibility of deeper involvement in the war in Ukraine.\n\nThe announcement came on the eve of Russian President Vladimir Putin's inauguration to a fifth term in office and in a week when Moscow on Thursday will celebrate Victory Day, its most important secular holiday, marking its defeat of Nazi Germany in World War II.\n\nThe drills are a response to \"provocative statements and threats of certain Western officials regarding the Russian Federation,\" the Defense Ministry said in a statement.\n\nIt was the first time Russia has publicly announced drills involving tactical nuclear weapons, although its strategic nuclear forces regularly hold exercises. Tactical nuclear weapons include air bombs, warheads for short-range missiles and artillery munitions and are meant for use on a battlefield. They are less powerful than the strategic weapons -- massive warheads that arm intercontinental ballistic missiles and are intended to obliterate entire cities.\n\nThe Russian announcement was a warning to Ukraine's Western allies about becoming more deeply engaged in the 2-year-old war, where the Kremlin's forces have gained an upper hand amid Ukraine's shortage of manpower and weapons. Some of Ukraine's Western partners have previously expressed concern that the conflict could spill beyond Ukraine into a war between NATO and Russia.\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron repeated last week that he doesn't exclude sending troops to Ukraine, and U.K. Foreign Secretary David Cameron said Kyiv's forces will be able to use British long-range weapons to strike targets inside Russia. Some other NATO countries providing weapons to Kyiv have balked at that possibility.\n\nThe Kremlin branded those comments as dangerous, heightening tension between Russia and NATO. The war already has placed significant strain on relations between Moscow and the West.\n\nKremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Monday that Macron's recent statement and other remarks by British and U.S. officials had prompted the nuclear drills.\n\n\"It's a new round of escalation,\" Peskov said, referring to what the Kremlin regarded as provocative statements. \"It's unprecedented and requires special attention and special measures.\"\n\nRussia's Foreign Ministry summoned both the French and British ambassadors.\n\nSweden's Foreign Minister Tobias Billstr\u00f6m said the nuclear exercises \"contribute to increasing instability.\"\n\n\"In the current security situation, Russia's actions may be considered particularly irresponsible and reckless,\" Billstr\u00f6m told Swedish news agency TT.\n\nDmitry Medvedev, the deputy head of Russia's Security Council that's chaired by Putin, said in his typically hawkish fashion that the comments by Macron and Cameron risked pushing the nuclear-armed world toward a \"global catastrophe.\"\n\nIt wasn't the first time Europe's military support for Ukraine has prompted nuclear saber-rattling. In March 2023, after the U.K.'s decision to provide Ukraine with armor-piercing shells containing depleted uranium, Putin said he intends to deploy tactical nuclear weapons on the territory of Ukraine neighbor Belarus.\n\nThe ministry said the exercise is intended to \"increase the readiness of non-strategic nuclear forces to fulfill combat tasks\" and will be held on Putin's orders. The maneuvers will involve missile units of the Southern Military District along with the air force and the navy, it said.\n\nThe Russian announcement stirred little reaction in Ukraine, where the spokesman for the Military Intelligence agency, Andrii Yusov, said on national television: \"Nuclear blackmail is a usual practice of Putin's regime; it does not constitute major news.\"\n\nWestern officials have blamed Russia for threatening a wider war through provocative acts. NATO countries said last week they are deeply concerned by a campaign of hybrid activities on the military alliance's soil, accusing Moscow of being behind them and saying they represent a security threat.\n\nPeskov dismissed those claims as \"new, unfounded accusations leveled at our country.\"\n\nGermany said Monday it recalled its ambassador to Russia for a week of consultations in Berlin following an alleged computer hack of Chancellor Olaf Scholz's party.\n\nMeanwhile, Ukrainian drones hit two vehicles Monday in Russia's Belgorod region, killing six people and injuring 35 others, including two children, local authorities said. The area has been hit by Kyiv's forces in recent months.\n\nOne of the vehicles was a minibus carrying farm workers, Belgorod Gov. Vyacheslav Gladkov said.\n\nIt was not possible to independently confirm the report.\n\nWhile Ukraine's army is largely pinned down on the 1,000-kilometer (600-mile) front line due to a shortage of troops and ammunition after more than two years of fighting, it has used its long-range firepower to hit targets deep inside Russia.\n\nIn what has largely been a war of attrition, Russia also has relied heavily on long-range missile, artillery and drones to wreak damage on Ukraine.\n\nThe Kremlin's forces kept up their bombardment of Ukraine's power grid, with a nighttime Russian drone attack targeting energy infrastructure in Ukraine's northern region of Sumy. Multiple towns and villages in the region, including Sumy, lost power, regional authorities said.\n\nRussia attacked Ukrainian targets with 13 Shahed drones overnight, 12 of which were intercepted in the Sumy region, Ukraine's air force said.\n\nFollow AP's coverage of the war in Ukraine at https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine", "source": {"uri": "hjnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The

Russia to launch tactical nuclear drills because of 'provocative statements' | News24", "body": "Missile formations in the Southern Military District and naval forces will take part in the drills.\n\nRussia has said it will hold drills that will include practice for the use of tactical nuclear weapons, days after top European leaders voiced stronger military support for Ukraine.\n\nThe Kremlin said on Monday the military exercises ordered by Russian President Vladimir Putin were in response to statements by Western and NATO-member countries about sending troops into Ukraine, which Russia invaded more than two years ago.\n\nThey will include practice for the preparation and deployment of nonstrategic nuclear weapons intended to \"increase the readiness... to fulfil combat tasks\" after \"provocative statements and threats of certain Western officials\", the Ministry of Defence said.\n\nMissile formations in the Southern Military District and naval forces will take part in the drills, which would take place \"in the near future\", it added.\n\nRussia's strategic nuclear forces regularly hold exercises, but the statement marked the first public announcement of drills involving tactical nuclear weapons, which are usually smaller in yield - the amount of power released during an explosion - than the strategic nuclear weapons designed to destroy entire cities.\n\nREAD | Ukraine launches drone attacks on several Russian regions, officials say\n\nThe move marks an escalation of tensions that have risen since French President Emmanuel Macron said last week that his country would consider sending ground troops to Ukraine if Kyiv requests backup.\n\nA day later, UK Foreign Secretary David Cameron said Ukraine could use British weapons against targets inside Russia if it wanted.\n\nRussian officials condemned both statements and warned Moscow would retaliate to what they called a \"dangerous escalation trend\".\n\nMoscow has long warned that conflict with NATO would become inevitable if European members of the military alliance sent in their soldiers to fight in Ukraine.\n\nRelations between Western countries, led by the United States, and Russia broke down after Russian forces invaded neighbouring Ukraine in February 2022.\n\nSince the war began, Russia has repeatedly warned of rising nuclear risks - warnings which the US says it has to take seriously though its officials note they have seen no change in Russia's nuclear posture.\n\nRussia and the US are by far the world's biggest nuclear powers, holding more than 10 600 of the world's 12 100 nuclear warheads.\n\nChina has the third largest nuclear arsenal, followed by France and the United Kingdom.\n\nWhile there is no universal definition, tactical nuclear weapons are often defined by their size and range, or their use for limited targets.\n\nThere is no agreed-upon size that characterises tactical weapons, but they are usually much larger than conventional bombs, causing radioactive fallout and other deadly effects beyond the explosion itself.\n\nThey are often referred to as \"nonstrategic weapons\", in contrast with strategic weapons, which the US military defines as designed to target \"the enemy's war-making capacity and will to make war\", including manufacturing, infrastructure, transportation and communication systems, and other targets.\n\nTactical weapons, by contrast, are designed to accomplish more limited and immediate military goals that win a battle. They can be mounted on missiles, airdropped bombs, or even artillery shells that have a relatively short range, far less than the huge intercontinental ballistic missiles designed to travel thousands of kilometres and hit targets across oceans.\n\n\"Tactical nuclear warheads were created to give military commanders more flexibility on the battlefield. In the mid-1950s, as more powerful thermonuclear bombs were being built and tested, military planners thought smaller weapons with a shorter range would be more useful in 'tactical' situations,\" according to Al Jazeera's defence editor Alex Gatopoulos.\n\n\"Modern warheads have a variable 'dial-up' yield, meaning an operator can specify its explosive power, and a tactical weapon would be anywhere from a fraction of a kilotonne to 50kt in strength. For scale, the weapon that destroyed Hiroshima was roughly 15kt. A single kilotonne is equivalent in power to 1 000 tonnes of TNT,\" he said.", "source": {"uri": "news24.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "news24"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

This comes after a Ukrainian drone attack killed six people and wounded over 30 in Russia's Belgorod border region which turned out to be one of the deadliest attacks inside Russia since the start of the full-scale invasion over two years ago.\n\nRussia's defence ministry said the exercises would be held in the \"near future\" and involve the air force, navy and troops stationed near Ukraine.\n\nThe Kremlin stated that the nuclear weapons drills were a response to \"unprecedented\" comments by the West, including by French President Emmanuel Macron, on sending troops to Ukraine. It said that the escalation requires \"special measures\".\n\nAlso read: Ukraine war: Six killed, 35 injured in Ukrainian drone attack in Russia's Belgorod region\n\nOn being asked by reporters what led to the drills, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said: \"It's obvious we are talking about statements from Mr. Macron and statements from British representatives. This is a completely new round of escalating tensions. It is unprecedented and requires special measures.\"\n\nEarlier this year in February, Putin talked about Moscow's nuclear capabilities by announcing the deployment and tests of new hypersonic weapons when he delivered his annual state-of-the-nation address.\n\nThe Russian president had also issued a warning to the West saying that Russia had weapons that could strike within their territory and

to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) members against sending military assistance and ground troops to Ukraine as he said it would cause a direct confrontation between NATO and Russia.\n\nThe Russian Defence Ministry said in a statement that \"during the exercise, a set of measures will be taken to practise the preparation and use of non-strategic nuclear weapons\".\n\nNon-strategic nuclear weapons, also known as tactical nuclear weapons, are meant for use on the battlefield and can be delivered via missiles.\n\nThe ministry mentioned that troops from the Southern Military District, which borders Ukraine and includes the occupied Ukrainian territories will take part in the drills.\n\nRussia has often warned that Putin was \"not bluffing\" when he said he was ready to use nuclear weapons as Russia has also pulled out of arms control treaties with the US.", "source": {"uri": "wionews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "WION"}, "authors": [],

The parade will take place at St. Petersburg's Palace Square on May 9 to celebrate 79 years since the victory in WWII. (AP Photo/Dmitri Lovetsky)\n\nRussia said today it plans to hold drills simulating the use of battlefield nuclear weapons amid rising tensions following comments by senior Western officials about the possibility of deeper involvement in the war in Ukraine.\n\nThe announcement came on the eve of Russian President Vladimir Putin's inauguration to a fifth term in office and in a week when Moscow on Thursday will celebrate Victory Day, its most important secular holiday, marking its defeat of Nazi Germany in World War II.\n\nThe drills are a response to \"provocative statements and threats of certain Western officials regarding the Russian Federation,\" the Defense Ministry said in a statement.\n\nIt was the first time Russia has publicly announced drills involving tactical nuclear weapons, although its strategic nuclear forces regularly hold exercises. Tactical nuclear weapons include air bombs, warheads for short-range missiles and artillery munitions and are meant for use on a battlefield. They are less powerful than the strategic weapons -- massive warheads that arm intercontinental ballistic missiles and are intended to obliterate entire cities.\n\nThe Russian announcement was a warning to Ukraine's Western allies about becoming more deeply engaged in the 2-year-old war, where the Kremlin's forces have gained an upper hand amid Ukraine's shortage of manpower and weapons. Some of Ukraine's Western partners have previously expressed concern that the conflict could spill beyond Ukraine into a war between NATO and Russia.\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron repeated last week that he doesn't exclude sending troops to Ukraine, and U.K. Foreign Secretary David Cameron said Kyiv's forces will be able to use British long-range weapons to strike targets inside Russia. Some other NATO countries providing weapons to Kyiv have balked at that possibility.\n\nThe Kremlin branded those comments as dangerous, heightening tension between Russia and NATO. The war already has placed significant strain on relations between Moscow and the West.\n\nKremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said today that Macron's recent statement and other remarks by British and U.S. officials had prompted the nuclear drills.\n\n\"It's a new round of escalation,\" Peskov said, referring to what the Kremlin regarded as provocative statements. \"It's unprecedented and requires special attention and special measures.\"\n\nRussia's Foreign Ministry summoned both the French and British ambassadors.\n\nSweden's Foreign Minister Tobias Billstr\u00f6m said the nuclear exercises \"contribute to increasing instability.\"\n\n\"In the current security situation, Russia's actions may be considered particularly irresponsible and reckless,\" Billstr\u00f6m told Swedish news agency TT.\n\nDmitry Medvedev, the deputy head of Russia's Security Council that's chaired by Putin, said in his typically hawkish fashion that the comments by Macron and Cameron risked pushing the nuclear-armed world toward a \"global catastrophe.\"\n\nIt wasn't the first time Europe's military support for Ukraine has prompted nuclear saber-rattling. In March 2023, after the U.K.'s decision to provide Ukraine with armor-piercing shells containing depleted uranium, Putin said he intends to deploy tactical nuclear weapons on the territory of Ukraine neighbor Belarus.\n\nThe ministry said the exercise is intended to \"increase the readiness of non-strategic nuclear forces to fulfill combat tasks\" and will be held on Putin's orders. The maneuvers will involve missile units of the Southern Military District along with the air force and the navy, it said.\n\nThe Russian announcement stirred little reaction in Ukraine, where the spokesman for the Military Intelligence agency, Andrii Yusov, said on national television: \"Nuclear blackmail is a usual practice of Putin's regime; it does not constitute major news.\"\n\nWestern officials have blamed Russia for threatening a wider war through provocative acts. NATO countries said last week they are deeply concerned by a campaign of hybrid activities on the military alliance's soil, accusing Moscow of being behind them and saying they represent a security threat.\n\nPeskov dismissed those claims as \"new, unfounded accusations leveled at our country.\"\n\nGermany said today it recalled its ambassador to Russia for a week of consultations in Berlin following an alleged computer hack of Chancellor Olaf Scholz's party.\n\nMeanwhile, Ukrainian drones hit two vehicles today in Russia's Belgorod region, killing six people and injuring 35 others, including two children, local authorities said. The area has been hit by Kyiv's forces in recent months.\n\nOne of the vehicles was a minibus carrying farm workers, Belgorod Gov. Vyacheslav Gladkov said.\n\nIt was not possible to independently confirm the report.\n\nWhile Ukraine's army is largely pinned down on the 1,000-kilometer front line due to a shortage of troops and ammunition after more than two years of fighting, it has used its long-range firepower to hit targets deep inside Russia.\n\nIn what has largely been a war of attrition, Russia also has relied heavily on long-range missile, artillery and drones to wreak damage on Ukraine.\n\nThe Kremlin's forces kept up their bombardment of Ukraine's power grid, with a nighttime Russian drone attack targeting energy infrastructure in Ukraine's northern region of Sumy. Multiple towns and villages in the region, including Sumy, lost power, regional authorities said.\n\nRussia attacked Ukrainian targets with 13 Shahed drones overnight, 12 of which were intercepted in the Sumy region, Ukraine's air force said.", "source": {"uri": "vindy.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Vindicator"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

In February, during his national address, he warned of a \"real\" risk of nuclear war.\n\n\"During the exercise, various measures will be undertaken to practice the preparation and use of non-strategic nuclear weapons,\" The defense ministry said in a message on Telegram.\n\nThe Kremlin specified that the exercises were a response to statements by French President Emmanuel Macron and British officials, AFP reported.\n\nRussia has in recent days hit out at Macron for telling The Economist magazine he was \"not ruling anything out\" in the West's response to the war in Ukraine, including sending troops to the country.\n\nKremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said on Monday that the West is provoking an unprecedented round of tension in Ukraine, which requires Russia's response.\n\nPeskov called Macron's statements about a possible deployment of troops to Ukraine an unprecedented new round of tension:\n\n\"It is necessary to check whether the information about sending French troops to Ukraine is true, the Russian Defense Ministry is dealing with this,\" Peskov said.\n\nThe Kremlin has also blasted UK Foreign Secretary David Cameron for saying Kyiv has the right to strike targets inside Russia.\n\nNon-strategic nuclear weapons, also referred to as tactical nuclear weapons, are designed for battlefield use and can be delivered via missiles.\n\nThe ministry added that the drills would be conducted \"in the near future\" and were intended to safeguard Russia's territorial integrity against perceived threats from certain Western officials.\n\nIn the first days of the war with Ukraine, Putin announced the transfer of Russian nuclear forces to a \"special mode\" of combat alert, and six months later he threatened to use \"all available means\" to protect the occupied territories of Ukraine.\n\nEarly last year, Putin announced the termination of Russia's participation in the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty with the United States, and a month later he announced the deployment of tactical nuclear weapons in Belarus.\n\nTwo months ago, Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk said the Russian president's aggressive rhetoric and \"announcements\" should be taken seriously.\n\nThe West should understand that the \"arms race\" Russia is imposing on the world obliges the West to wake up and prepare militarily for potential threats, Tusk said.\n\n\"The European Union has to take decisions that will balance Russia's military potential and make Europe better prepared for bad scenarios,\" he added.\n\nAt the end of 2022, the United States began to prepare for a potential Russian nuclear strike on Ukraine carefully, CNN reported earlier, citing unnamed officials from the US administration.\n\nAt that time, the nuclear scenario was seen as realistic after a series of defeats by the Russian army, which at that time had surrendered the Kharkiv region and was forced to leave Kherson. The assessment was made based on \"extremely sensitive data\" obtained by American intelligence.\n\nAccording to CNN sources, the involvement of China and India, which, in turn, put pressure on Putin,

Putin has not openly threatened a nuclear strike, though he has warned the West of the possibility of nuclear war in the event of direct confrontation.\n\nOn the other hand, Dmitry Medvedev, a former Russian president and deputy chairman of Russia's Security Council, has openly threatened the use of nuclear weapons on several occasions, including once again on Monday.\n\nMedvedev also linked the decision to hold tactical nuclear weapons exercises with deliberations in the West over sending allied ground troops to Ukraine.\n\nPutin's spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, also linked the planned nuclear exercises with statements by Western politicians regarding a possible deployment of troops in Ukraine, mentioning French President Emmanuel Macron in particular. Peskov spoke of a \"new round of escalating tensions.\"\n\nTactical nuclear weapons are different from so-called strategic nuclear weapons because they are less powerful and have a smaller range. They can take the form of artillery but are most often ballistic or cruise missiles. They are fired using systems that can carry conventional as well as nuclear warheads.\n\nNuclear warheads for ground-to-air missile systems with a range of up to 500 kilometers (311 miles), and sea- or air-based missile systems with a range of up to 600 kilometers, are considered tactical nuclear weapons.\n\nHowever, there are no clear limits to the classification. Some sources classify the new Russian Kalibr cruise missiles and the Kinzhal hypersonic missile, which has a range of up to several thousand kilometers, as tactical nuclear weapons.\n\nExperts interviewed by DW agree that the use of nuclear weapons in Ukraine is highly improbable and would be pointless. \"From a military point of view, the use of nuclear weapons by Russia in Ukraine makes no sense under any circumstances,\" said Pavel Podvig of the United Nations Institute for Disarmament Research. Nothing had changed in this respect, he added.\n\nRussia would not be able to actually practice attacks during the exercise, only the procedure for using the weapons, according to the expert. \"This is because nonstrategic warheads are normally stored separately from the missiles and aircraft that can fire them,\" said Podvig.\n\nNikolai Sokov of the Vienna Center for Disarmament and Non-Proliferation believes there had never been any plans to use nuclear arms in Ukraine -- even in the fall of 2022 when the Russian army withdrew from the Kharkiv and Kherson regions.\n\nSome US media had reported that this could be discussed in Russia, Sokov said. But now, Russian troops clearly have the upper hand over the Ukrainian Armed Forces in many respects and are taking more and more territory in eastern Ukraine, the expert said. Kyiv is even expecting the Russian attacks to expand, he added.\n\nNuclear escalation has been one of the West's biggest fears since the beginning of the Russian invasion. Western politicians and experts say this is precisely why weapons are being supplied to Ukraine in a slow and measured fashion.\n\nMathieu Boul\u00e8gue from the Wilson Center in the US said Moscow is counting on just this. He does not believe that Russia's planned nuclear exercises are \"solely due to France's attitude.\" In his opinion, they are part of the \"constant intimidation and saber-rattling\" of the Kremlin. He argued that the aim is to break the West's resolve to support Ukraine.\n\nPutin also wants to present himself as a \"strong leader,\" especially in the run-up to May 9, when Russia celebrates the Soviet victory over Nazi Germany, according to Boul\u00e8gue.\n\nMost experts see this as a warning to the West. \"There is nothing good about this political signal, but we should try to take it as soberly as possible,\" Podvig concluded.", "source": {"uri": "dw.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Deutsche Welle"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

The deployment in Belarus enhances targeting capabilities in Eastern Europe, countering perceived Western threats.Russia's Defense Ministry said Monday that the military would hold drills involving tactical nuclear weapons - the first time such an exercise has been publicly announced by Moscow.\n\nA look at tactical nuclear weapons and the part they play in the Kremlin's political messaging.\n\nWHAT ARE TACTICAL NUCLEAR WEAPONS? Unlike nuclear-tipped intercontinental ballistic missiles that can destroy entire cities, tactical nuclear weapons for use against troops on the battlefield are less powerful and can have a yield as small as about 1 kiloton. The U.S. bomb dropped on Hiroshima during World War II was 15 kilotons.\n\nSuch battlefield nuclear weapons - aerial bombs, warheads for short-range missiles or artillery munitions - can be very compact. Their small size allows them to be discreetly carried on a truck or plane.\n\nUnlike strategic weapons, which have been subject to arms control agreements between Moscow and Washington, tactical weapons never have been limited by any such pacts, and Russia hasn't released their numbers or any other specifics related to them.\n\nWHAT HAS PUTIN SAID ABOUT NUCLEAR WEAPONS? Since launching the full-scale invasion of Ukraine on Feb. 24, 2022, Russian President Vladimir Putin has repeatedly reminded Western nations about Moscow's nuclear might in a bid to discourage them from increasing military support to Kyiv.\n\nEarly on in the war, Putin frequently referenced Moscow's nuclear arsenal by vowing repeatedly to use \"all means\" necessary to protect Russia. But he later toned down his statements as Ukraine's offensive last summer failed to reach its goals and Russia scored more gains on the battlefield.\n\nMoscow's defense doctrine envisages a nuclear response to an atomic strike or even an attack with conventional weapons that \"threaten the very existence of the Russian state.\" That vague wording has led some pro-Kremlin Russian experts to urge Putin to sharpen it to force the West to take the warnings more seriously.\n\nPutin said last fall that he sees no reason for such a change.\n\n\"There is no situation in which anything would threaten Russian statehood and the existence of the Russian state,\" he said. \"I think that no person of sober mind and clear memory could have an idea to use nuclear weapons against Russia.\"\n\nWHY DID RUSSIA SEND NUCLEAR WEAPONS TO BELARUS? Last year, Russia moved some of its tactical nuclear weapons into the territory of Belarus, an ally that neighbors Ukraine and NATO members Poland, Latvia and Lithuania.\n\nBelarus' authoritarian president, Alexander Lukashenko, had long urged Moscow to station nuclear weapons in his country, which has close military ties with Russia and served as a staging ground for the war in Ukraine.\n\nBoth Putin and Lukashenko said that nuclear weapons deployment to Belarus was intended to counter perceived Western threats. Last year, Putin specifically linked the move to the U.K. government's decision to provide Ukraine with armor-piercing shells containing depleted uranium.\n\nNeither leader said how many were moved - only that Soviet-era facilities in the country were readied to accommodate them, and that Belarusian pilots and missile crews were trained to use them. The weapons have remained under Russian military control.\n\nThe deployment of tactical nuclear weapons to Belarus, which has a 1,084-kilometer (673-mile) border with Ukraine, would allow Russian aircraft and missiles to reach potential targets there more easily and quickly, if Moscow decides to use them. It has also extended Russia's capability to target several NATO allies in Eastern and Central Europe.", "source": {"uri": "economictimes.indiatimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Economic

Tactical nuclear weapons include air bombs, warheads for short-range missiles and artillery munitions and are meant for use on a battlefield. They are less powerful than the strategic weapons -- massive warheads that arm intercontinental ballistic missiles and are intended to obliterate entire cities.\n\nAlso Read | Pakistan Shocker: Policeman Booked for Raping Transgender in Gujrat City of Punjab Province.\n\nThe Russian announcement was a warning to Ukraine's Western allies about becoming more deeply engaged in the 2-year-old war, where the Kremlin's forces have gained an upper hand amid Ukraine's shortage of manpower and weapons. Some of Ukraine's Western partners have previously expressed concern that the conflict could spill beyond Ukraine into a war between NATO and Russia.\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron repeated last week that he doesn't exclude sending troops to Ukraine, and U.K. Foreign Secretary David Cameron said Kyiv's forces will be able to use British long-range weapons to strike targets inside Russia. Some other NATO countries providing weapons to Kyiv have balked at that possibility.\n\nThe Kremlin branded those comments as dangerous, heightening tension between Russia and NATO. The war already has placed significant strain on relations between Moscow and the West.\n\nKremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Monday that Macron's recent statement and other remarks by British and U.S. officials had prompted the nuclear drills.\n\n\"It's a new round of escalation,\" Peskov said, referring to what the Kremlin regarded as provocative statements. \"It's unprecedented and requires special attention and special measures.\"\n\nRussia's Foreign Ministry summoned both the French and British ambassadors.\n\nSweden's Foreign Minister Tobias Billstr\u00f6m said the nuclear exercises \"contribute to increasing instability.\"\n\n\"In the current security situation, Russia's actions may be considered particularly irresponsible and reckless,\" Billstr\u00f6m told Swedish news agency TT.\n\nDmitry Medvedev, the deputy head of Russia's Security Council that's chaired by Putin, said in his typically hawkish fashion that the comments by Macron and Cameron risked pushing the nuclear-armed world toward a \"global catastrophe.\"\n\nIt wasn't the first time Europe's military support for Ukraine has prompted nuclear saber-rattling. In March 2023, after the U.K.'s decision to provide Ukraine with armor-piercing shells containing depleted uranium, Putin said he intends to deploy tactical nuclear weapons on the territory of Ukraine neighbor Belarus.\n\nThe ministry said the exercise is intended to \"increase the readiness of non-strategic nuclear forces to fulfill combat tasks\" and will be held on Putin's orders. The maneuvers will involve missile units of the Southern Military District along with the air force and the navy, it said.\n\nThe Russian announcement stirred little reaction in Ukraine, where the spokesman for the Military Intelligence agency, Andrii Yusov, said on national television: \"Nuclear blackmail is a usual practice of Putin's regime; it does not constitute major news.\"\n\nWestern officials have blamed Russia for threatening a wider war through provocative acts. NATO countries said last week they are deeply concerned by a campaign of hybrid activities on the military alliance's soil, accusing Moscow of being behind them and saying they represent a security threat.\n\nPeskov dismissed those claims as \"new, unfounded accusations leveled at our country.\"\n\nGermany said Monday it recalled its ambassador to Russia for a week of consultations in Berlin following an alleged computer hack of Chancellor Olaf Scholz's party.\n\nMeanwhile, Ukrainian drones hit two vehicles Monday in Russia's Belgorod region, killing six people and injuring 35 others, including two children, local authorities said. The area has been hit by Kyiv's forces in recent months.\n\nOne of the vehicles was a minibus carrying farm workers, Belgorod Gov. Vyacheslav Gladkov said.\n\nIt was not possible to independently confirm the report.\n\nWhile Ukraine's army is largely pinned down on the 1,000-kilometer (600-mile) front line due to a shortage of troops and ammunition after more than two years of fighting, it has used its long-range firepower to hit targets deep inside Russia.\n\nIn what has largely been a war of attrition, Russia also has relied heavily on long-range missile, artillery and drones to wreak damage on Ukraine.\n\nThe Kremlin's forces kept up their bombardment of Ukraine's power grid, with a nighttime Russian drone attack targeting energy infrastructure in Ukraine's northern region of Sumy. Multiple towns and villages in the region, including Sumy, lost power, regional authorities said.\n\nRussia attacked Ukrainian targets with 13 Shahed drones overnight, 12 of which were intercepted in the Sumy region, Ukraine's air force said.

Last year, Putin specifically linked the move to the U.K. government's decision to provide Ukraine with armor-piercing shells containing depleted uranium.\n\nNeither leader said how many were moved -- only that Soviet-era facilities in the country were readied to accommodate them, and that Belarusian pilots and missile crews were trained to use them. The weapons have remained under Russian military control.\n\nThe deployment of tactical nuclear weapons to Belarus, which has a 1,084-kilometer (673-mile) border with Ukraine, would allow Russian aircraft and missiles to reach potential targets there more easily and quickly, if Moscow decides to use them. It has also extended Russia's capability to target several NATO allies in Eastern and Central Europe.\n\n___\n\nFollow the AP's coverage of the war at https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine", "source":

In October, Russia rehearsed its ability to deliver a \"massive\" retaliatory nuclear strike, including with the launch of ballistic and cruise missiles.\n\nIn February, the Russian leader warned the North Atlantic Treaty Organization it risked a nuclear conflict if the alliance were to send troops to Ukraine.\n\nThe US and Europe \"must understand that we also have weapons that can hit targets on their territory and that all this really threatens a conflict with the use of nuclear weapons, and therefore the destruction of civilization,\" Putin said in his annual state-of-the-nation address.\n\nThat threat came after French President Emmanuel Macron refused to rule out sending troops to Ukraine, even as the idea was rebuffed by other NATO allies. Macron on Monday is hosting Chinese President Xi Jinping, who despite growing diplomatic and economic ties with Russia, has warned Putin against the use of nuclear weapons.\n\nPutin later played down the threat that Russia and the West were heading toward a nuclear war, telling the state-run RIA Novosti news service on March 13 that there's never been a need to use tactical nuclear weapons in Ukraine and the thought had never crossed his mind.\n\nThe Russian president plans to travel to China for talks with Xi next week. His inauguration will take place at the Kremlin on Tuesday, extending his almost quarter-century rule over Russia for a further six years after he gained 87% support in a tightly controlled March election in which Putin faced no serious competition.\n\nRussia has been trying to advance against embattled Ukrainian forces this year, bolstered by an advantage in ammunition. Supplies of munitions and weapons are starting to flow again to Kyiv's troops after the US approved a long-delayed $61 billion aid package last month.", "source": {"uri": "bnnbloomberg.ca", "dataType": "news", "title": "BNN"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_weapon", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nuclear weapon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vladimir_Putin", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Vladimir Putin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Russia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_warfare", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Nuclear warfare"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_invasion_of_Ukraine", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Russian invasion of Ukraine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telegram_(messaging_service)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Telegram (messaging service)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tactical_nuclear_weapon", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tactical nuclear weapon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inauguration", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Inauguration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloomberg_L.P.", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bloomberg L.P."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NATO", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NATO"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukraine", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cruise_missile", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cruise missile"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emmanuel_Macron", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Emmanuel Macron"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_France", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "President of France"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Europe"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyiv", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kyiv"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_the_People's_Republic_of_China", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "President of the People's Republic of China"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moscow_Kremlin", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Moscow Kremlin"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xi_Jinping", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Xi Jinping"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RIA_Novosti", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "RIA Novosti"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armed_Forces_of_Ukraine", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Armed Forces of Ukraine"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Physics/Nuclear", "label": "dmoz/Science/Physics/Nuclear", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Military_Science", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Military Science", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Pharmacy/Nuclear_Pharmacy", "label": "dmoz/Health/Pharmacy/Nuclear Pharmacy", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 88}], "image": "http://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/polopoly_fs/1.2069172!/fileimage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_620/p-a-vehicle-transports-a-rs-24-yars-strategic-nuclear-missile-during-the-main-rehearsals-of-the-military-parade-in-the-red-square-moscow-nbsp-on-may-5-p.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9542018", "eventUri": "eng-9542018", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-03-13", "textStart": 1731, "textEnd": 1739}], "sentiment": -0.403921568627451, "wgt": 191, "relevance": 1}

At the second stage, Belarusian colleagues will join our joint actions.\"\n\nBelarusian President Alexander Lukashenko, speaking alongside Putin, said that this was the third such training exercise.\n\n\"There were probably dozens in Russia, so we synchronized. And the general staffs, as the Russian defence minister told me, have already begun to execute these instructions,\" Lukashenko said.\n\nRussia and the United States are by far the world's biggest nuclear powers, holding more than 10,600 of the world's 12,100 nuclear warheads. China has the third-largest nuclear arsenal, followed by France and Britain.\n\nRussia has about 1,558 non-strategic nuclear warheads, according to the Federation of American Scientists, though there is uncertainty about exact figures for such weapons due to a lack of transparency.\n\nThere is still much uncertainty among arms controls experts about what weapons Russia has supplied to Belarus and the nature of their storage.\n\nTypically, it would take some time to create the storage, security and barracks for such a deployment - and Russian nuclear weapons are controlled by the Russian defence ministry's 12th Main Directorate (known as 12th GUMO). It is unclear if 12th GUMO is in Belarus, according to Western experts.\n\nNo power has used nuclear weapons in war since the United States unleashed the first atomic bomb attacks on the Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki in 1945.\n\nThe Pentagon said on Monday that it had not seen a change to Russia's disposition of its strategic nuclear forces, despite what it called \"irresponsible rhetoric\" from Moscow detailing plans for exercises involving the deployment of non-strategic nuclear weapons.", "source": {"uri": "usnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "U.S. News & World Report"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tactical_nuclear_weapon", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tactical nuclear weapon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vladimir_Putin", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Vladimir Putin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Russia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belarus", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Belarus"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Belarus"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_weapon", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Nuclear weapon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moscow", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Moscow"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Moscow"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TASS", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "TASS"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_exercise", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Military exercise"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_parade", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Military parade"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Lukashenko", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Alexander Lukashenko"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reuters", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Reuters"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "France"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_Belarus", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "President of Belarus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dissolution_of_the_Soviet_Union", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dissolution of the Soviet Union"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ministry_of_Defence_(Russia)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ministry of Defence (Russia)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federation_of_American_Scientists", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Federation of American Scientists"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomic_bombings_of_Hiroshima_and_Nagasaki", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empire_of_Japan", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Empire of Japan"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Pentagon", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Pentagon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Physics/Nuclear", "label": "dmoz/Science/Physics/Nuclear", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Military_Science", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Military Science", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Military/Weapons_and_Equipment", "label": "dmoz/Society/Military/Weapons and Equipment", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Pharmacy/Nuclear_Pharmacy", "label": "dmoz/Health/Pharmacy/Nuclear Pharmacy", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 79}], "image": "https://www.usnews.com/dims4/USNEWS/d24e66b/2147483647/thumbnail/970x647/quality/85/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.usnews.com%2Fcmsmedia%2F32%2F0957bf40c28dafe1442589f230824a%2Ftag%3Areuters.com%2C2024%3Anewsml_LYNXMPEK480EP%3A12024-05-09T102251Z_1_LYNXMPEK480EP_RTROPTP_3_RUSSIA-EAEU.JPG", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9542018", "eventUri": "eng-9542018", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.2313725490196078, "wgt": 190, "relevance": 1}

The U.S. bomb dropped on Hiroshima during World War II was 15 kilotons.\n\nSuch battlefield nuclear weapons -- aerial bombs, warheads for short-range missiles or artillery munitions -- can be very compact. Their small size allows them to be discreetly carried on a truck or plane.\n\nUnlike strategic weapons, which have been subject to arms control agreements between Moscow and Washington, tactical weapons never have been limited by any such pacts, and Russia hasn't released their numbers or any other specifics related to them.\n\nWHAT HAS PUTIN SAID ABOUT NUCLEAR WEAPONS?\n\nSince launching the full-scale invasion of Ukraine on Feb. 24, 2022, Russian President Vladimir Putin has repeatedly reminded Western nations about Moscow's nuclear might in a bid to discourage them from increasing military support to Kyiv.\n\nEarly on in the war, Putin frequently referenced Moscow's nuclear arsenal by vowing repeatedly to use \"all means\" necessary to protect Russia. But he later toned down his statements as Ukraine's offensive last summer failed to reach its goals and Russia scored more gains on the battlefield.\n\nMoscow's defense doctrine envisages a nuclear response to an atomic strike or even an attack with conventional weapons that \"threaten the very existence of the Russian state.\" That vague wording has led some pro-Kremlin Russian experts to urge Putin to sharpen it to force the West to take the warnings more seriously.\n\nPutin said last fall that he sees no reason for such a change.\n\n\"There is no situation in which anything would threaten Russian statehood and the existence of the Russian state,\" he said. \"I think that no person of sober mind and clear memory could have an idea to use nuclear weapons against Russia.\"\n\nWHY DID RUSSIA SEND NUCLEAR WEAPONS TO BELARUS?\n\nLast year, Russia moved some of its tactical nuclear weapons into the territory of Belarus, an ally that neighbors Ukraine and NATO members Poland, Latvia and Lithuania.\n\nBelarus' authoritarian president, Alexander Lukashenko, had long urged Moscow to station nuclear weapons in his country, which has close military ties with Russia and served as a staging ground for the war in Ukraine.\n\nBoth Putin and Lukashenko said that nuclear weapons deployment to Belarus was intended to counter perceived Western threats. Last year, Putin specifically linked the move to the U.K. government's decision to provide Ukraine with armor-piercing shells containing depleted uranium.\n\nNeither leader said how many were moved -- only that Soviet-era facilities in the country were readied to accommodate them, and that Belarusian pilots and missile crews were trained to use them. The weapons have remained under Russian military control.\n\nThe deployment of tactical nuclear weapons to Belarus, which has a 1,084-kilometer (673-mile) border with Ukraine, would allow Russian aircraft and missiles to reach potential targets there more easily and quickly, if Moscow decides to use them. It has also extended Russia's capability to target several NATO allies in Eastern and Central Europe.\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

The drills involving air and naval forces are being held in response to \"provocative statements and threats made by certain Western officials,\" it said.\n\nPutin has at times brandished the threat of nuclear weapons since his February 2022 invasion of Ukraine, which borders southern Russia. In October, Russia rehearsed its ability to deliver a \"massive\" retaliatory nuclear strike, including with the launch of ballistic and cruise missiles.\n\nIn February, the Russian leader warned the North Atlantic Treaty Organization it risked a nuclear conflict if the alliance were to send troops to Ukraine.\n\nThe U.S. and Europe \"must understand that we also have weapons that can hit targets on their territory and that all this really threatens a conflict with the use of nuclear weapons, and therefore the destruction of civilization,\" Putin said in his annual state-of-the-nation address.\n\nThat threat came after French President Emmanuel Macron refused to rule out sending troops to Ukraine, even as the idea was rebuffed by other NATO allies. Macron on Monday is hosting Chinese President Xi Jinping, who despite growing diplomatic and economic ties with Russia, has warned Putin against the use of nuclear weapons.\n\nPutin later played down the threat that Russia and the West were heading toward a nuclear war, telling the state-run RIA Novosti news service on March 13 that there's never been a need to use tactical nuclear weapons in Ukraine and the thought had never crossed his mind.\n\nKremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov on Monday blamed Macron and U.K. Foreign Secretary David Cameron for sparking \"an unprecedented spike in tensions,\" RIA Novosti reported.

Multiple towns and villages in the region, including Sumy, lost power, regional authorities said.\n\nRussia attacked Ukrainian targets with 13 Shahed drones overnight, 12 of which were intercepted in

This announcement comes amid escalating tensions between Russia and the West, particularly regarding the ongoing conflict in Ukraine.\n\nAccording to the Associated Press, the drills are a response to what the Defense Ministry perceives as \"provocative statements and threats of certain Western officials regarding the Russian Federation.\"\n\nThis marks Russia's first public acknowledgment of such drills involving tactical nuclear weapons, although its strategic nuclear forces regularly undergo exercises.\n\nTactical nuclear weapons, which include air bombs, short-range missile warheads, and artillery munitions, are designed for battlefield use and have smaller warheads than those of intercontinental ballistic missiles. The aim of the exercises, as stated by the Defense Ministry, is to \"increase the readiness of non-strategic nuclear forces to fulfill combat tasks.\"\n\nRead Also: Russian Forces are Utilizing Starlink Terminals in Ukraine Conflict via Black Market Network: Report\n\nWestern leaders' discussions on potential intervention in Ukraine have further fueled tensions. French President Emmanuel Macron's comments regarding the possibility of sending troops to Ukraine were recently tagged as 'dangerous' by the Kremlin, and UK Foreign Secretary David Cameron's statements about Ukrainian forces using British weapons to strike targets inside Russia have been particularly concerning for the Kremlin.\n\nThe New York Times reports that Dmitry S. Peskov, the Kremlin's spokesman, highlighted these statements as contributing to the escalation of tensions. He emphasized the seriousness of the situation, stating, \"This is a completely new round of escalation of tensions - it is unprecedented.\"\n\n\"And, of course, it requires special attention and special measures,\" the spokesperson added.\n\nExperts note that while Russia has conducted similar exercises before, this public announcement serves as a clear message to the West. Pavel Podvig, a scholar on Russian nuclear forces, explains, \"This is a reaction to specific statements, a signal saying that Russia has nuclear weapons.\"\n\nThe drills are scheduled to involve missile units from the Southern Military District, air force, and navy under President Vladimir Putin's orders. These exercises coincide with Putin's upcoming inauguration for his fifth term as president and the annual Victory Day celebration.\n\nMeanwhile, Ukrainian drones have reportedly struck vehicles in Russia's Belgorod region, causing casualties. The region, which was a staging ground for Russia's invasion of Ukraine in 2022, has been frequently targeted by Ukrainian forces in recent months.\n\nDespite the ongoing conflict, Russia plans to evacuate children from the Belgorod region due to continuous shelling. The attacks aim to disrupt Russia's logistics and create a buffer zone to protect border regions, as outlined by Putin.\n\nIt is worth noting that while tactical nuclear weapons are being exercised, their actual deployment in the context of the Ukraine conflict remains speculative. As Russian nuclear forces Pavel Podvig suggests, these weapons serve more as a signaling mechanism than a practical battlefield solution.\n\nStay posted here at Tech Times.", "source": {"uri":

This training aims to \"maintain the readiness\" of the Army to protect the country \"in response to the provocative statements and threats made against Russia by certain Western officials,\" the ministry added.\n\nThe exercise, whose date has not been specified, will involve the aviation, navy and forces of the Southern military district, that is, the troops whose barracks are closest to Ukraine and the Ukrainian regions that Russia considers its own and declared annexed in September 2022.\n\nBy the term \"threats\", Russia refers to statements from the West that raise the possibility of sending troops to Ukraine.\n\nDimitri Peskov, press officer for the Russian president, explained this Monday that specifically these are the words of the French president, Emmanuel Macron, of \"British representatives\" and of \"representatives of the United States Senate.\"\n\n\"They have talked about the willingness and even the intention to send armed contingents to Ukraine, that is, to put NATO soldiers against the Russian army. This is a new turn in the escalation of tension. \"It is unprecedented, and requires special attention and special measures,\" the Kremlin spokesman added.\n\nMoscow has also been bothered by the \"dangerous statements\" of the head of the British Foreign Office, David Cameron, about Ukraine's right to use British weapons to attack Russian territory.\n\nOn the other hand, it is not the first time that Moscow has wielded the atomic weapon, in what appears to be an attempt to remind the West of the existence of the Russian nuclear arsenal.\n\nSince the conflict with Ukraine began in February 2022 in Moscow, former President Dimitri Medvedev, today deputy head of the Security Council, has done so regularly. Putin has also hinted at it from time to time, although avoiding talking directly about nuclear weapons.\n\nThe United States and other Western countries have criticized these continued references to such destructive potential. \"This rhetoric, as we have seen previously, is irresponsible and inappropriate for a nuclear power. And it is inconsistent with the way any nuclear power should speak publicly about the use of such weapons,\" said US State Department spokesman Matthew Miller.\n\nIn the summer of 2023, Russia deployed tactical nuclear weapons in the territory of Belarus, its closest ally and neighbor, like Russia, in the European Union.\n\nPeskov has said that the use of nuclear weapons is a \"strictly defensive\" resource and that the reasons for Moscow to use them are detailed in its nuclear doctrine. This indicates that they will be used in case Russia is attacked with weapons of mass destruction or in case the aggression is carried out with conventional weapons but \"threatens the very existence of the Russian State.\"\n\nRussia already carried out nuclear exercises last year. On October 26, 2023, the Federation Council (the Russian Senate) approved the revocation of the ratification of the Nuclear Test Ban Treaty (CTBT), and shortly after it was announced that Vladimir Putin had supervised ballistic missile launches during military maneuvers intended to simulate a \"nuclear attack\" in response to a similar attack against Moscow.\n\nDuring these exercises, a Yars intercontinental ballistic missile was fired from the Plesetsk cosmodrome in northern Russia, and another Sineva ballistic missile was fired from the Tula nuclear submarine in the Barents Sea.",

Participants will include missile forces in the Southern Military District, aviation, and the navy.\n\nThe move is purportedly a response to what Russia perceives as provocative statements and threats from Western officials against the Russian Federation. President Putin's spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, mentioned remarks from French President Emmanuel Macron, British officials, and a representative of the U.S. Senate as contributing factors to the decision.\n\nWhile President Joe Biden has expressed skepticism about the prospect of Russia using nuclear weapons, CNN reported contingency planning by top U.S. officials for a potential Russian nuclear strike against Ukraine in 2022. Some Western and Ukrainian officials have dismissed Russia's nuclear warnings as bluffing tactics.\n\nHowever, the Kremlin has consistently signaled its readiness to consider nuclear options if Russia's security is threatened.\n\nThe announcement of the military exercises underscores growing nuclear risks between Russia and the West. NATO, currently conducting its largest exercise since the Cold War, has not disclosed whether it would involve a rehearsal of any nuclear element.\n\nThis move by Russia follows its pattern of demonstrating military capabilities in response to perceived threats from Western powers.\n\nPresident Putin has framed the conflict in Ukraine as part of a broader struggle against Western encroachment on what Moscow views as its historical sphere of influence.\n\nWestern leaders, on the other hand, have condemned Russia's actions in Ukraine and pledged support for its defense against Russian forces, while ruling out direct NATO deployment in the country.\n\nAs tensions escalate, the specter of nuclear confrontation looms large, with both Russia and Western powers engaging in military posturing.

Lower your flags, and march straight back to England, stopping at every home to beg forgiveness for 100 years of theft, rape, and murder. Do that and your men shall live. Do it not, and every one of you will die today. ... Before we let you leave, your commander must cross that field, present himself before this army, put his head between his legs, and kiss his own ass.\"\n\nThreats about the use of nuclear weapons from the Kremlin have been heard since the beginning of a full-scale war. This is cynically called \"protection of Russian interests.\"\n\nRussian dictator Vladimir Putin does not dare to launch a nuclear strike on Ukraine because he fears losing power, money, and, most importantly, societal support, stated Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy 03 May 2024 during a meeting with lyceum school students, cadets, and teachers of the National Academy of the State Border Guard Service named after Bohdan Khmelnytsky. \"When it comes to Russia's threats of nuclear catastrophe or nuclear strikes, these are sick-minded individuals, that's a fact. So, to say definitively whether they are capable or incapable of this is impossible. Because with sick-minded individuals, it's difficult to say until the end,\" noted Zelensky. In his opinion, \"despite this illness, these individuals cherish life very much, love themselves, are very afraid of losing power and money, and most importantly, losing societal support.\"\n\n\"All this, what I've listed: life, power, society, and the 'red line' that nuclear weapons cross with the whole world, this is a fact. Even those countries that balance between us and Russia and cannot decide, even these countries will turn away from Russia after a nuclear strike of any scale on any territory,\" the president said. Zelenskyy believes that people who are afraid of losing money, power, and their lives will never use nuclear weapons. \"Otherwise, they will be eliminated. No matter how. They will all be eliminated, in my opinion,\" added the head of state.\n\nA total Russian victory over Ukraine in which the entire country is defeated would be detrimental to European and NATO security, as it could allow Moscow to place missiles at the EU's doorstep, French President Emmanuel Macron said 05 May 2024. In an interview with the French daily La Tribune, Macron, who has famously refused to rule out sending Western troops to Ukraine, once again advocated a policy of \"strategic ambiguity\" towards Russia, arguing that the key idea behind such an approach is to project strength while \"not giving too many details.\" Describing Russia as \"an adversary,\" the French president stressed that establishing \"a priori limits\" would be interpreted as weakness. \"We must remove all visibility from it, because that is what creates the ability to deter,\" he argued. Macron further noted that Ukraine is crucial to France's security because it is located only 1,500 kilometers from its borders. \"If Russia wins, the next second, there is no longer any security possible in Romania, in Poland, in Lithuania and not in our country either. The capability and range of Russian ballistic missiles expose us all,\" he said. Moscow announced 06 May 2024 that it planned to test its ability to deploy tactical nuclear weapons. It was the first time Russia has publicly announced drills involving tactical nuclear weapons, although its strategic nuclear forces regularly hold exercises. Russia's upcoming exercises to test its tactical nuclear weapons should be viewed in light of the \"belligerent statements\" made by some Western officials and NATO's \"destabilizing actions,\" the Russian Foreign Ministry said. The exercises, which were ordered by President Vladimir Putin, will be held in the near future, the Russian Defense Ministry said. The exercise will be conducted \"in the near future\" and was ordered by President Vladimir Putin, the ministry said. It said the training was ordered by President Vladimir Putin after \"provocative statements and threats\" by Western officials. According to the Foreign Ministry, the move was a response to the continued \"power politics\" pursued by the US and its allies against Russia. Washington and Kiev's other backers openly declare their support for Ukrainian \"terrorist acts\" and \"directly contribute\" to such attacks, the statement read, pointing to the continued supply of ever more powerful Western weapons to Ukraine. It particularly drew attention to the US-made ATACMS missiles capable of \"striking targets deep inside Russian territory.\" Last week, former UK prime minister and current Foreign Secretary David Cameron stated that Kiev had every right to use British weapons to strike targets inside Russia as well. The US had also \"created new threats\" to Russia's national security through deployment of its intermediate-range ground-based missile systems around the world, the ministry said. Such weapons were banned under the 1987 Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces Treaty (INF), but Washington unilaterally withdrew from the agreement in 2019. The move left Russia with no choice but to leave the treaty as well. However, Moscow introduced a moratorium on fielding weapons that used to be covered by the treaty. Russia now reserves the right to a \"mirror response\" to American actions, the ministry said, adding that the moratorium could be lifted. Moscow also slammed statements by French President Emmanuel Macron about a potential NATO troop deployment to Ukraine. \"This cannot be perceived in any other way than a demonstration of the readiness and willingness to enter a direct military confrontation with Russia,\" the ministry warned. Last week, Macron said that Western nations would have to consider such an option if Kiev officially requested it. \"Such actions of the NATO member states show that they deliberately strive for further escalation of the Ukraine crisis towards a direct military clash between NATO and Russia,\" the Russian Foreign Ministry said. Russia has decided to hold tactical nuclear weapons drills in response to certain NATO countries' remarks about potentially sending troops to Ukraine, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said. According to Peskov, the decision was made following a \"new\" and \"unprecedented\" escalation of the situation surrounding the Ukraine conflict. \"They talked about the readiness and even the intention to send armed contingents to Ukraine, that is, to actually put NATO soldiers in front of the Russian military,\" Peskov said at a press briefing. \"This is a new round of escalation of tension, and it is unprecedented. It requires special attention and special measures,\" Peskov told journalists. The Defense Ministry in Moscow cited \"provocative statements and threats against Russia by certain Western officials\" as the reason for the exercise. Missile forces from the Southern Military District will be directly involved in the drills, the ministry said. The goal is to iron out \"the practical aspects of the preparation and deployment of non-strategic nuclear weapons,\" it added. The US, the UK, France and other Western nations should take a Russian nuclear drill as a reminder of where escalation of the Ukraine conflict could take them, former President Dmitry Medvedev said. Medvedev, who serves as deputy head of the Russian Security Council, referred to debates in the West about possible deployment of NATO troops to Ukraine, as well as \"active encouragement [of Kiev] to use [Western] missile weapons against the entire Russian territory\" as grounds for the drill. Russia \"will have to respond\" to the proposed deployment of Western soldiers, \"and this response will not be\" in Ukraine, the Russian official warned. In that case \"there will be no hiding on Capitol Hill, in the Elysee Palace or at 10 Downing Street.\" The situation is comparable to the Cuban missile crisis of 1962, according to Medvedev. He said current Western elites were \"infantile morons\" who refuse to see the risk, unlike US President John F. Kennedy and Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev, who managed to walk back the escalation six decades ago. UN spokesman Stephane Dujarric expressed concern that various parties have been talking about issues regarding nuclear weapons more and more recently. \"Current nuclear risks are at an alarmingly high level,\" Dujarric said. \"All actions that could lead to miscalculation, escalation with catastrophic consequences, must be avoided.\" The Russian announcement stirred little reaction in Ukraine, where the spokesman for the Military Intelligence agency, Andrii Yusov, said on national television: \"Nuclear blackmail is a usual practice of Putin's regime; it does not constitute major news.\"",

They are less powerful than the strategic weapons -- massive warheads that arm intercontinental ballistic missiles and are intended to obliterate entire cities.\n\nThe Russian announcement was a warning to Ukraine's western allies about becoming more deeply engaged in the two-year-old war, where the Kremlin's forces have gained an upper hand amid Ukraine's shortage of manpower and weapons.\n\nSome of Ukraine's western partners have previously expressed concern that the conflict could spill beyond Ukraine into a war between Nato and Russia.\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron repeated last week that he does not exclude sending troops to Ukraine, and UK Foreign Secretary David Cameron said Kyiv's forces will be able to use British long-range weapons to strike targets inside Russia.\n\nSome other Nato countries providing weapons to Kyiv have baulked at that possibility.\n\nThe Kremlin branded those comments as dangerous, heightening tension between Russia and Nato. The war already has placed significant strain on relations between Moscow and the West.\n\nKremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said on Monday that Macron's recent statement and other remarks by British and US officials had prompted the nuclear drills.\n\n\"It's a new round of escalation,\" he said, referring to what the Kremlin regarded as provocative statements. \"It's unprecedented and requires special attention and special measures.\"\n\nRussia's Foreign Ministry summoned the French and British ambassadors, and urged the British ambassador \"to think about the inevitable catastrophic consequences of such hostile steps from London\".\n\nSweden's foreign minister Tobias Billstrom said the nuclear exercises \"contribute to increasing instability\".\n\n\"In the current security situation, Russia's actions may be considered particularly irresponsible and reckless,\" he told Swedish news agency TT.\n\nDmitry Medvedev, the deputy head of Russia's Security Council which is chaired by Putin, said the comments by Macron and Cameron risked pushing the nuclear-armed world towards a \"global catastrophe\".\n\nIn March 2023, after the UK's decision to provide Ukraine with armour-piercing shells containing depleted uranium, Putin said he intended to deploy tactical nuclear weapons on the territory of Ukraine's neighbour Belarus.\n\nThe ministry said the latest exercise is intended to \"increase the readiness of non-strategic nuclear forces to fulfil combat tasks\" and will be held on Putin's orders. The manoeuvres will involve missile units of the Southern Military District along with the air force and the navy, it added.\n\nThe Russian announcement stirred little reaction in Ukraine, where the spokesman for the Military Intelligence agency, Andrii Yusov, said on national television: \"Nuclear blackmail is a usual practice of Putin's regime; it does not constitute major news.\"\n\nWestern officials have blamed Russia for threatening a wider war through provocative acts. Nato countries said last week they were deeply concerned by a campaign of hybrid activities on the military alliance's soil, accusing Moscow of being behind them and saying they represent a security threat.\n\nPeskov dismissed those claims as \"new, unfounded accusations levelled at our country\".\n\nGermany said on Monday it had recalled its ambassador to Russia for a week of consultations in Berlin after an alleged computer hack of Chancellor Olaf Scholz's party.\n\nMeanwhile, Ukrainian drones hit two vehicles on Monday in Russia's Belgorod region, killing six people and injuring 35 others, including two children, local authorities said. The area has been hit by Kyiv's forces in recent months.\n\nOne of the vehicles was a minibus carrying farm workers, Belgorod governor Vyacheslav Gladkov said.\n\nsource: PA\n\nCopyright 2024 Alliance News Ltd.

The U.S. bomb dropped on Hiroshima during World War II was 15 kilotons.\n\nSuch battlefield nuclear weapons - aerial bombs, warheads for short-range missiles or artillery munitions - can be very compact. Their small size allows them to be discreetly carried on a truck or plane.\n\nUnlike strategic weapons, which have been subject to arms control agreements between Moscow and Washington, tactical weapons never have been limited by any such pacts, and Russia hasn\u00b4t released their numbers or any other specifics related to them.\n\nSince launching the full-scale invasion of Ukraine on Feb. 24, 2022, Russian President Vladimir Putin has repeatedly reminded Western nations about Moscow\u00b4s nuclear might in a bid to discourage them from increasing military support to Kyiv.\n\nFILE - In this photo taken from a video distributed by Russian Defense Ministry Press Service, on Dec. 9, 2020, a Russian Tu-160 strategic bomber fires a cruise missile at test targets, during a military drills, Russia.

(Russian Defense Ministry Press Service via AP, File)\n\nEarly on in the war, Putin frequently referenced Moscow\u00b4s nuclear arsenal by vowing repeatedly to use \"all means\" necessary to protect Russia. But he later toned down his statements as Ukraine's offensive last summer failed to reach its goals and Russia scored more gains on the battlefield.\n\nMoscow's defense doctrine envisages a nuclear response to an atomic strike or even an attack with conventional weapons that \"threaten the very existence of the Russian state.\" That vague wording has led some pro-Kremlin Russian experts to urge Putin to sharpen it to force the West to take the warnings more seriously.\n\nPutin said last fall that he sees no reason for such a change.\n\n\"There is no situation in which anything would threaten Russian statehood and the existence of the Russian state,\" he said. \"I think that no person of sober mind and clear memory could have an idea to use nuclear weapons against Russia.\"\n\nLast year, Russia moved some of its tactical nuclear weapons into the territory of Belarus, an ally that neighbors Ukraine and NATO members Poland, Latvia and Lithuania.\n\nBelarus' authoritarian president, Alexander Lukashenko, had long urged Moscow to station nuclear weapons in his country, which has close military ties with Russia and served as a staging ground for the war in Ukraine.\n\nBoth Putin and Lukashenko said that nuclear weapons deployment to Belarus was intended to counter perceived Western threats. Last year, Putin specifically linked the move to the U.K. government\u00b4s decision to provide Ukraine with armor-piercing shells containing depleted uranium.\n\nNeither leader said how many were moved - only that Soviet-era facilities in the country were readied to accommodate them, and that Belarusian pilots and missile crews were trained to use them. The weapons have remained under Russian military control.\n\nThe deployment of tactical nuclear weapons to Belarus, which has a 1,084-kilometer (673-mile) border with Ukraine, would allow Russian aircraft and missiles to reach potential targets there more easily and quickly, if Moscow decides to use them. It has also extended Russia\u00b4s capability to target several NATO allies in Eastern and Central Europe.\n\nFollow the AP\u00b4s coverage of the war at https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine\n\nFILE Russian President Vladimir Putin, center, walks to attend a welcome ceremony with Kyrgyzstan's President Sadyr Japarov prior to their talks in Bishkek, Kyrgyzstan, Thursday, Oct. 12, 2023.

battlefield nuclear weapons", "body": "Russia plans to hold drills simulating the use of battlefield nuclear weapons, days after the Kremlin reacted angrily to comments by senior Western officials about the war in Ukraine and Moscow.\n\nThe Defense Ministry announced the plans on Monday local time, saying they would be in response to \"provocative statements and threats of certain Western officials regarding the Russian Federation\".\n\nIt was the first time that Russia has publicly announced drills involving tactical nuclear weapons, though its strategic nuclear forces regularly hold exercises.\n\nUkraine's military spy agency spokesperson Andriy Yusov dismissed the plans as \"nuclear blackmail\".\n\nTactical nuclear weapons include air bombs, warheads for short-range missiles and artillery munitions, and are meant for use on a battlefield.\n\nThey are less powerful than the massive warheads that arm intercontinental ballistic missiles and are intended to obliterate entire cities.\n\nThe Russian announcement appeared to be a warning to Ukraine's Western allies about becoming more deeply involved in the more than two-year war.\n\nSome of Ukraine's Western partners have previously expressed concern about stoking the conflict amid fears it could spill beyond Ukraine into a war between NATO and Russia.\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron repeated last week that he does not exclude sending troops to Ukraine, and UK Foreign Secretary David Cameron said Kyiv's forces will be able to use British long-range weapons to strike targets inside Russia.\n\nSome other NATO countries providing weapons to Kyiv have baulked at that possibility.\n\nThe Kremlin branded those comments as dangerous, heightening tension between Russia and NATO.\n\nKremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov on Monday said Mr Macron's recent statement and other remarks by British and US officials had prompted the nuclear drills.\n\n\"It's a new round of escalation,\" Mr Peskov said, referring to what the Kremlin regarded as provocative statements.\n\nDmitry Medvedev, the deputy head of Russia's Security Council that is chaired by President Vladimir Putin, said the comments by Emmanuel Macron and David Cameron risked pushing the nuclear-armed world toward a \"global catastrophe.\"\n\nIt was not the first time Europe's military support for Ukraine has irked Russian authorities and prompted nuclear threats.\n\nIn March last year -- after the UK government's decision to provide Ukraine with armour-piercing shells containing depleted uranium -- Putin announced that he intended to deploy tactical nuclear weapons on the territory of Belarus.\n\nThe ministry said the exercise is intended to \"increase the readiness of non-strategic nuclear forces to fulfil combat tasks\" and will be held on Putin's orders.\n\nThe manoeuvres will involve missile units of the Southern Military District along with the air force and the navy, it said.\n\nWestern officials have blamed Russia for threatening a wider war through provocative acts.\n\nNATO countries said last week they are deeply concerned by a campaign of hybrid activities on the military alliance's soil, accusing Russia of being behind them and saying they represent a threat to their security.\n\nMr Peskov dismissed those claims as \"new unfounded accusations levelled at our country.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Ukrainian drones hit two vehicles Monday in Russia's Belgorod region, killing six people and injuring 35 others, including two children, local authorities said.\n\nThe Belgorod region has been an area frequently struck by Kyiv's forces in recent months.\n\nOne of the vehicles was a minibus that was carrying farm workers, Belgorod Governor Vyacheslav Gladkov said.\n\nNo other details were immediately available, and it was not possible to independently confirm the report from the border region.\n\nWhile Ukraine's army is largely pinned down on the front line due to a shortage of troops and ammunition, it has used its long-range firepower to hit targets deep inside Russia.\n\nThe apparent aim is to disrupt Russia's war logistics system by hitting oil refineries and depots, and unnerve the Russian border regions.\n\nAlso, the Kremlin's forces kept up their bombardment of Ukraine's power grid, with a night time Russian drone attack targeting energy infrastructure in Ukraine's northern region of Sumy.\n\nMultiple towns and villages in the region, including Sumy, lost power, regional authorities said.\n\nUkraine's air force said Russia attacked Ukrainian targets with 13 Shahed drones overnight, 12 of which were intercepted in the Sumy region.\n\nMeanwhile Russian forces claim to have taken control of the settlements of Soloviove and Kotliarivka in Eastern Ukraine, the defence ministry said on Monday.\n\nRussia has made slow but steady advances since taking Avdiivka, with a string of villages in the area falling to Moscow's forces.", "source": {"uri": "abc.net.au",

The U.S. bomb dropped on Hiroshima during World War II was 15 kilotons.\n\nSuch battlefield nuclear weapons -- aerial bombs, warheads for short-range missiles or artillery munitions -- can be very compact. Their small size allows them to be discreetly carried on a truck or plane.\n\nUnlike strategic weapons, which have been subject to arms control agreements between Moscow and Washington, tactical weapons never have been limited by any such pacts, and Russia hasn't released their numbers or any other specifics related to them.\n\nWHAT HAS PUTIN SAID ABOUT NUCLEAR WEAPONS?\n\nSince launching the full-scale invasion of Ukraine on Feb. 24, 2022, Russian President Vladimir Putin has repeatedly reminded Western nations about Moscow's nuclear might in a bid to discourage them from increasing military support to Kyiv.\n\nEarly on in the war, Putin frequently referenced Moscow's nuclear arsenal by vowing repeatedly to use \"all means\" necessary to protect Russia. But he later toned down his statements as Ukraine's offensive last summer failed to reach its goals and Russia scored more gains on the battlefield.\n\nMoscow's defense doctrine envisages a nuclear response to an atomic strike or even an attack with conventional weapons that \"threaten the very existence of the Russian state.\" That vague wording has led some pro-Kremlin Russian experts to urge Putin to sharpen it to force the West to take the warnings more seriously.\n\nPutin said last fall that he sees no reason for such a change.\n\n\"There is no situation in which anything would threaten Russian statehood and the existence of the Russian state,\" he said. \"I think that no person of sober mind and clear memory could have an idea to use nuclear weapons against Russia.\"\n\nWHY DID RUSSIA SEND NUCLEAR WEAPONS TO BELARUS?\n\nLast year, Russia moved some of its tactical nuclear weapons into the territory of Belarus, an ally that neighbors Ukraine and NATO members Poland, Latvia and Lithuania.\n\nBelarus' authoritarian president, Alexander Lukashenko, had long urged Moscow to station nuclear weapons in his country, which has close military ties with Russia and served as a staging ground for the war in Ukraine.\n\nBoth Putin and Lukashenko said that nuclear weapons deployment to Belarus was intended to counter perceived Western threats. Last year, Putin specifically linked the move to the U.K. government's decision to provide Ukraine with armor-piercing shells containing depleted uranium.\n\nNeither leader said how many were moved -- only that Soviet-era facilities in the country were readied to accommodate them, and that Belarusian pilots and missile crews were trained to use them. The weapons have remained under Russian military control.\n\nThe deployment of tactical nuclear weapons to Belarus, which has a 1,084-kilometer (673-mile) border with Ukraine, would allow Russian aircraft and missiles to reach potential targets there more easily and quickly, if Moscow decides to use them. It has also extended Russia's capability to target several NATO allies in Eastern and Central Europe.\n\nFollow the AP's coverage of the war at https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine\n\nMore from this

At the second stage, Belarusian colleagues will join our joint actions.\"\n\nBelarusian President Alexander Lukashenko, speaking alongside Putin, said that this was the third such training exercise.\n\n\"There were probably dozens in Russia, so we synchronized.

It is unclear if 12th GUMO is in Belarus, according to Western experts.\n\nNo power has used nuclear weapons in war since the United States unleashed the first atomic bomb attacks on the Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki in 1945.\n\nThe Pentagon said on Monday that it had not seen a change to Russia's disposition of its strategic nuclear forces, despite what it called \"irresponsible rhetoric\" from Moscow detailing plans for exercises involving the deployment of non-strategic nuclear weapons.", "source": {"uri": "foxnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Fox News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tactical_nuclear_weapon", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tactical nuclear weapon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vladimir_Putin", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Vladimir Putin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Russia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belarus", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Belarus"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Belarus"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ministry_of_Defence_(Russia)", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Ministry of Defence (Russia)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_weapon", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Nuclear weapon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moscow", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Moscow"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Moscow"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TASS", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "TASS"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_exercise", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Military exercise"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Lukashenko", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Alexander Lukashenko"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/News_agency", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "News agency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "France"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_Belarus", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "President of Belarus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dissolution_of_the_Soviet_Union", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dissolution of the Soviet Union"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox_News", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fox News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federation_of_American_Scientists", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Federation of American Scientists"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomic_bombings_of_Hiroshima_and_Nagasaki", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Pentagon", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Pentagon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Japan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Physics/Nuclear", "label": "dmoz/Science/Physics/Nuclear", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Martial_Arts/Russian", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Martial Arts/Russian", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Pharmacy/Nuclear_Pharmacy", "label": "dmoz/Health/Pharmacy/Nuclear Pharmacy", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 78}], "image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2024/05/1024/512/Putin.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9542018", "eventUri": "eng-9542018", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1215686274509804, "wgt": 188, "relevance": 1}

Tactical nuclear weapons include air bombs, warheads for short-range missiles and artillery munitions and are meant for use on a battlefield. They are less powerful than the strategic weapons -- massive warheads that arm intercontinental ballistic missiles and are intended to obliterate entire cities.\n\nThe Russian announcement was a warning to Ukraine's Western allies about becoming more deeply engaged in the 2-year-old war, where the Kremlin's forces have gained an upper hand amid Ukraine's shortage of manpower and weapons. Some of Ukraine's Western partners have previously expressed concern that the conflict could spill beyond Ukraine into a war between NATO and Russia.\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron repeated last week that he doesn't exclude sending troops to Ukraine, and U.K. Foreign Secretary David Cameron said Kyiv's forces will be able to use British long-range weapons to strike targets inside Russia. Some other NATO countries providing weapons to Kyiv have balked at that possibility.\n\nThe Kremlin branded those comments as dangerous, heightening tension between Russia and NATO. The war already has placed significant strain on relations between Moscow and the West.\n\nKremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Monday that Macron's recent statement and other remarks by British and U.S. officials had prompted the nuclear drills.\n\n\"It's a new round of escalation,\" Peskov said, referring to what the Kremlin regarded as provocative statements. \"It's unprecedented and requires special attention and special measures.\"\n\nRussia's Foreign Ministry summoned both the French and British ambassadors. It urged the British ambassador \"to think about the inevitable catastrophic consequences of such hostile steps from London.\"\n\nSweden's Foreign Minister Tobias Billstr\u00f6m said the nuclear exercises \"contribute to increasing instability.\"\n\n\"In the current security situation, Russia's actions may be considered particularly irresponsible and reckless,\" Billstr\u00f6m told Swedish news agency TT.\n\nDmitry Medvedev, the deputy head of Russia's Security Council that's chaired by Putin, said in his typically hawkish fashion that the comments by Macron and Cameron risked pushing the nuclear-armed world toward a \"global catastrophe.\"\n\nIt wasn't the first time Europe's military support for Ukraine has prompted nuclear saber-rattling. In March 2023, after the U.K.'s decision to provide Ukraine with armor-piercing shells containing depleted uranium, Putin said he intends to deploy tactical nuclear weapons on the territory of Ukraine neighbor Belarus.\n\nThe ministry said the exercise is intended to \"increase the readiness of non-strategic nuclear forces to fulfill combat tasks\" and will be held on Putin's orders. The maneuvers will involve missile units of the Southern Military District along with the air force and the navy, it said.\n\nThe Russian announcement stirred little reaction in Ukraine, where the spokesman for the Military Intelligence agency, Andrii Yusov, said on national television: \"Nuclear blackmail is a usual practice of Putin's regime; it does not constitute major news.\"\n\nWestern officials have blamed Russia for threatening a wider war through provocative acts. NATO countries said last week they are deeply concerned by a campaign of hybrid activities on the military alliance's soil, accusing Moscow of being behind them and saying they represent a security threat.\n\nPeskov dismissed those claims as \"new, unfounded accusations leveled at our country.\"\n\nGermany said Monday it recalled its ambassador to Russia for a week of consultations in Berlin following an alleged computer hack of Chancellor Olaf Scholz's party.\n\nMeanwhile, Ukrainian drones hit two vehicles Monday in Russia's Belgorod region, killing six people and injuring 35 others, including two children, local authorities said.

Multiple towns and villages in the region, including Sumy, lost power, regional authorities said.\n\nRussia attacked Ukrainian targets with 13 Shahed drones overnight, 12 of which were intercepted in

The apparent aim is to disrupt Russia's war logistics system by hitting oil refineries and depots, and unnerve the Russian border regions.\n\nThe Belgorod region was a staging ground for Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. It has come under regular attack ever since Russian forces retreated there from northeastern Ukraine early in the war following a counteroffensive by Kyiv.\n\nIn what has largely been a war of attrition, Russia has also relied heavily on long-range missile, artillery and drones to wreak damage on Ukraine.\n\nAt the end of last year, Belgorod officials said 25 people were killed, including five children, and more than 100 were injured in a Ukrainian attack, and regular rocket and drone strikes have continued since then. The area can be reached by relatively simple and mobile weapons such as multiple rocket launchers from forests on the Ukrainian side.\n\nRussian authorities said in March they planned to evacuate about 9,000 children from the area because of continuous shelling, after Putin said he wanted to create a buffer zone to help protect border regions.\n\nAlso, the Kremlin's forces kept up their bombardment of Ukraine's power grid, with a nighttime Russian drone attack targeting energy infrastructure in Ukraine's northern region of Sumy.

Russia's Defense Ministry said that President Vladimir Putin had ordered an exercise for missile, aviation and naval personnel to \"increase the readiness of nonstrategic nuclear forces to carry out combat missions.\"\n\nThe announcement of the exercise was Russia's most explicit warning in its more than two-year invasion of Ukraine that it could use tactical nuclear weapons there. The Kremlin said it came in response to comments by two European leaders that raised the prospect of more direct Western intervention in the war.\n\nThe exercise, the Defense Ministry said, would involve forces of the Southern Military District, an area that covers Russian-occupied Ukraine and part of Russia's border region with Ukraine. It said the exercise would take place \"in the near future.\"\n\nThe order ratchets up tensions with the West at the start of a week of extensive publicity for Putin. His inauguration is scheduled for Tuesday, followed Thursday by the annual Victory Day celebration, which commemorates the Soviet victory in World War II.\n\nIt also coincided with a visit to Europe by President Xi Jinping of China, which has pledged a \"no limits\" alliance with Russia. China has provided support to Russia's military industry, U.S. officials say, despite persistent lobbying from the West that it refrain from aiding Russia's war effort.\n\nWestern officials have long worried that Russia could deploy tactical nuclear weapons, especially if it faced serious setbacks on the battlefield. But Putin denied as recently as March that he had ever considered it, even as he regularly reminds the world of Russia's vast nuclear arsenal as a way of keeping in check the West's military support for Ukraine.\n\nOn Monday, however, Russian officials claimed that warnings about the possibility of more direct Western involvement in the war had changed the situation. The Defense Ministry said the exercise would be held \"to unconditionally ensure the territorial integrity and sovereignty of the Russian state in response to provocative statements and threats of individual Western officials against the Russian Federation.\"\n\nDmitry Peskov, the Kremlin's spokesperson, said the Western \"threats\" in question included a recent interview with President Emmanuel Macron of France published by The Economist, in which the French leader repeated his refusal to rule out sending ground troops to Ukraine.\n\nPeskov also alluded to a comment made last week by David Cameron, Britain's top diplomat, in which he said Ukraine was free to use British weapons to strike inside Russia -- a departure from Western governments' typical policy of discouraging such strikes to avoid being drawn deeper into the war.\n\n\"This is a completely new round of escalation of tensions -- it is unprecedented,\" Peskov told reporters Monday. \"And, of course, it requires special attention and special measures.\"\n\nThe Russian Foreign Ministry said later in the day that it had summoned the British ambassador to lodge Russia's \"strong protest\" over Cameron's statement, asserting that he was \"de facto recognizing his country as a party to the conflict.\"\n\n\"The ambassador was called upon to think about the inevitable catastrophic consequences of such hostile steps from London,\" the Russian Foreign Ministry said.\n\nA spokesperson for Britain's Foreign Office said later that the ambassador met with Russian officials \"for a diplomatic meeting\" and was not officially summoned. The spokesperson said the ambassador, Nigel Casey, \"reiterated the U.K.'s support for Ukraine in the face of unprovoked Russian aggression.\"\n\nRussia has seized the battlefield initiative after a failed Ukrainian counteroffensive last year. But Moscow's advances remain slow and bloody, and new deliveries of Western weapons are on their way, including those from a $61 billion military aid package that the United States approved last month.\n\nBeyond discouraging the West from greater involvement in Ukraine's war effort, the Kremlin wants to exploit divisions within the NATO military alliance over the risks of doing so. That schism was on display in February after Macron first mentioned the possibility of putting Western troops in Ukraine. Peskov said that such a move would lead to a direct clash with Russian forces.\n\nRecent months have marked a hawkish shift for Macron, who more than two years ago tried to head off the invasion of Ukraine by dangling the possibility of integrating Russia into a new European security architecture.\n\nRussia's announcement of tactical nuclear drills drew a sharp response from NATO on Monday.\n\n\"Russia's nuclear rhetoric is dangerous and irresponsible,\" said Farah Dakhlallah, a NATO spokesperson. \"NATO remains vigilant.\"\n\nShe added: \"Ukraine has a right to self-defense, which is enshrined in the U.N. charter, and NATO allies will continue to support Ukraine. Russia has started this illegal war and must end it.\"\n\nPavel Podvig, a scholar on Russian nuclear forces based in Geneva, said Russia had conducted such exercises before, though it rarely made them public. This time, however, the aim is to send a loud message, he said.\n\n\"This is a reaction to specific statements, a signal saying that Russia has nuclear weapons,\" Podvig said.\n\nUnlike strategic nuclear weapons, which are always in a state of combat readiness, nonstrategic ones are stored in warehouses away from the bombers, missiles, or ships that are supposed to deliver them, Podvig said. During the exercise, Russian army formations are likely to practice how they could be deployed, he said.\n\nBut it would make little sense to use them in the context of the war in Ukraine, Podvig added, because the absence of large-scale, concentrated troop formations would limit their impact on the battlefield.\n\nOther analysts have also cast doubt on the military efficacy of using battlefield nuclear weapons in Ukraine, given the spread-out nature of Ukrainian forces. The Institute for the Study of War said in 2022 that doing so would be \"a massive gamble for limited gains\" for Russia.\n\n\"This weapon system exists to send a signal,\" Podvig said, adding that its main purpose is to make an impression on the opponent.\n\nPutin has not made any public comments about the drills. On Tuesday, he is scheduled to be inaugurated to his fifth term as president.\n\nWestern governments have previously looked to China -- Russia's most important international partner -- to head off Russian nuclear use, as they did when Chancellor Olaf Scholz of Germany visited Beijing amid a previous scare in 2022.\n\nAt the time, Xi made a public statement warning that nuclear weapons had no place in the war in Ukraine. On Monday, the topic came up again as Xi met with European leaders in Paris on his first visit to the continent in five years.\n\n\"President Xi has played an important role in deescalating Russia's irresponsible nuclear threats,\" Ursula von der Leyen, the president of the European Union's executive branch, told reporters after meeting with Xi and Macron on Monday. \"I'm confident that President Xi will continue to do so against the backdrop of the ongoing nuclear threats by Russia.\"\n\nShe also urged Beijing to \"use all its influence on Russia to end its war of aggression against Ukraine.\"", "source": {"uri": "sacbee.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Sacramento Bee"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ministry_of_Defense_(Israel)",

It is unprecedented and requires special measures.'\n\nA Russian diplomat said Moscow would have to increase its entire missile arsenal as a deterrent following what was framed as the worst breakdown in relations since the 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis.\n\n'We are now at the stage of open confrontation, which, I hope, will not result in a direct armed conflict,' Russian Ambassador-at-Large Grigory Mashkov told the state RIA news agency.\n\nFile photo. A Sarmat intercontinental ballistic missile is launched by Russia in April 2022\n\nRussian 'Yars' intercontinental ballistic missile launchers are displayed in the Victory Day military parade general rehearsal on the Red Square in Moscow, Russia, May 5 2024\n\nMashkov added that it will now be necessary to take 'further steps to strengthen the country's defense capability, including building up the missile arsenal, in order to discourage any potential enemy from testing Russia's strength.'\n\nHe added that Russia was already doing a lot in this area but that more was needed given what he said was the growing threat from the West and the technological advances in most types of missiles, from tactical to inter-continental.\n\nREAD MORE: Why has Macron gone from 'appeasing' Putin to threatening to send troops into Ukraine and drag NATO into WW3? French president envied Boris Johnson's war leadership - and it's a useful distraction from other issues...\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAccording to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute, Russia is set to spend 7.1% of its gross domestic product (GDP) on the military, or more than a third of total government spending, in 2024.\n\nRamping up drills, Putin reportedly told Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu to prepare missile firing exercises in the near future 'in order to increase the readiness of non-strategic nuclear forces to fulfil combat missions'.\n\nTroops from the Southern Military District, which borders Ukraine and includes the occupied Ukrainian territories will take part in the drills, the ministry said.\n\nClose Putin ally and former President Dmitry Medvedev said today on Telegram that 'the number of scoundrels among the Western political elite calling for sending their troops to a non-existent country is expanding'.\n\n'Now it includes representatives of the US Congress, French and British leadership, and individual madmen from the Baltic states and Poland...'\n\n'Sending your troops to the territory of...Ukraine will entail the direct entry of their countries into the war, to which we will have to respond.\n\n'And, alas, not in the territory of... Ukraine. In this case, none of them will be able to hide either on Capitol Hill, or in the Elysee Palace, or in 10 Downing Street.\n\n'A world catastrophe will come.'\n\nAs part of a new drive of 'deterrence', Russia is also understood to have commissioned a notable Russian political scientist to explore possible avenues for pushing back what is perceived as an encroaching West including nuclear deterrence.\n\nSergey Karganov, a longtime advisor to Putin and his predecessor Boris Yeltsin, has reportedly been commissioned to carry out eight studies into topics including the 'theory and practice of nuclear deterrence' within the context of Russia's current political climate, and how Russia might go about 'developing' such a deterrence with Russia, China, India and Pakistan.\n\nThe 71-year-old, who currently heads the Council for Foreign and Defence Policy, is notable for his post-USSR doctrine suggesting Russia should aim to leverage Russian minorities living nearby to spread and maintain its influence in former dominions.\n\nLast year, he called for Russia to launch nuclear strikes on Europe as a pre-emptive measure to resolve the conflict in Ukraine and restore the perceived authority of the nuclear threat.\n\nThe escalation of Russian nuclear rhetoric follows weeks of more pronounced threats from the West to intervene in the conflict in Ukraine.\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron recently told The Economist he 'absolutely' stands by pledges to put boots on the ground in Ukraine if push comes to shove.\n\n'As I said, I'm not ruling anything out, because we are facing someone who is not ruling anything out,' he told the magazine in an interview published last Thursday.\n\nMacron has also called on Europe to reduce reliance on the United States and develop independent capacity to face down hostile foreign actors.\n\nIn February, Putin warned Macron that if France were to send any troops to Ukraine, they would meet the same fate as Napoleon Bonaparte's Grand Arm\u00e9e, whose 1812 invasion ended in staggering defeat and huge casualties.\n\nBritish Foreign Secretary Lord Cameron also received condemnation from Russia after telling reporters in Kyiv that Ukraine could use British-supplied missiles as they saw fit, including firing into Russian territory and lifting a previously held requirement only to fire Storm Shadow missiles within Ukraine.\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin speaks during the conference of All-Russia People's Front on January 25, 2016 in Stavropol, Russia\n\nA firefighter works at a site of a Russian drone strike in Kharkiv, Ukraine May 4, 2024\n\nThe Kremlin called Lord Cameron's statement a 'direct escalation' of the war in Ukraine deemed 'dangerous to European security'.\n\nVladimir Putin's spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said comments made on Friday could imperil the entire system of European security architecture - and namechecked Macron while condemning perceived threats from the West.\n\nREAD MORE: Putin's dictator ally Alexander Lukashenko boasts of having 'several dozen' Russian nukes in Belarus and 'moves combat-ready troops closer to Poland' to go 'head to head' with NATO after warning of nuclear 'apocalypse'\n\nAdvertisement\n\n'The statement [from Macron] is very important and very dangerous,' Peskov told reporters on Friday.\n\nMacron 'continues to constantly talk about the possibility of direct involvement on the ground in the conflict around Ukraine. This is a very dangerous trend,' he added.\n\nPeskov said the recent statements by Macron and Cameron 'potentially pose a danger to European security, to the entire European security architecture'.\n\n'We see a dangerous tendency towards escalation in official statements. This is raising our concern,' he added.\n\nUS House Leader Hakeem Jeffries added to Russian fears with comments in a CBS interview this week that if Ukraine falls 'there's a significant likelihood that America will have to get into the conflict -- not simply with our money, but with our servicewomen and our servicemen'.\n\nExperts following developments in the war suggest Macron's comments reflect a new approach of 'strategic ambiguity' mirroring threats from Russia.\n\nVlad \u015eutea, founder and lead analyst at early warning and threatcasting group T-Intelligence, told MailOnline: 'Macron is one of the few Western European leaders to understand the value of strategic ambiguity.\n\n'Putin doesn't take anything off the table, neither should we. And that includes sending troops, in whichever capacity that is feasible.'\n\n'Chances are, Macron and other European leaders have outlined implicit thresholds that could prompt direct Western intervention.\n\n'A scenario warranting action could entail a collapse of the front in the East, leading to further Russian encroachment, posing a threat to cities like Kyiv, Odesa, and, albeit less likely, western regions such as Lviv.\n\n'Our reading is that the intra-NATO discussions on this topic have not been as hypothetical as believed.\n\n'One should remember that France also recently signed a security agreement with Moldova and has a robust presence in Romania as part of the NATO battle group that will be elevated to brigade-level in 2025.'\n\nHe suggested that criticism of Macron, claiming the comments could invite nuclear Armageddon, played into the Kremlin's hands.\n\n'This appears to be typical pro-Russian scaremongering, aimed at dissuading bold Western action,' he said. 'The true irresponsibility lies in shying away from confronting Russia.'\n\n'Weakness invites aggression and this is particularly relevant when talking about Putin's Russia.'\n\nUkrainian servicemen

Macron is today to host Chinese leader Xi Jinping for a state visit in a bid to persuade him to switch positions over Russia's invasion of Ukraine.\n\nIn Xi's first visit to Europe since 2019, he is also expected to give talks in Serbia and Hungary.\n\nPresident Xi has said he wants to find peace in Ukraine but has been a careful ally to Putin and is expected to host the Russian leader in Beijing next month.\n\nIn an op-ed for Le Figaro daily, Xi recently said that he wanted to work with the international community to find ways to solve the conflict sparked by Russia's invasion of Ukraine, while emphasising that China was 'neither a party nor a participant'.\n\n'We hope that peace and stability will return quickly to Europe, and intend to work with France and the entire international community to find good paths to resolve the crisis,' he wrote.", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Mail Online"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

The parade will take place at St. Petersburg's Palace Square on May 9 to celebrate 79 years since the victory in WWII. (AP Photo/Dmitri Lovetsky)\n\nRussia said Monday it plans to hold drills simulating the use of battlefield nuclear weapons amid rising tensions following comments by senior Western officials about the possibility of deeper involvement in the war in Ukraine.\n\nThe announcement came on the eve of Russian President Vladimir Putin's inauguration to a fifth term in office and in a week when Moscow on Thursday will celebrate Victory Day, its most important secular holiday, marking its defeat of Nazi Germany in World War II.\n\nThe drills come in response to \"provocative statements and threats of certain Western officials regarding the Russian Federation,\" the Defense Ministry said in a statement.\n\nIt was the first time Russia has publicly announced drills involving tactical nuclear weapons, although its strategic nuclear forces regularly hold exercises. Tactical nuclear weapons include air bombs, warheads for short-range missiles and artillery munitions and are meant for use on a battlefield. They are less powerful than the massive warheads that arm intercontinental ballistic missiles and are intended to obliterate entire cities.\n\nThe Russian announcement was a warning to Ukraine's Western allies about becoming more deeply involved in the 2-year-old war. Some of Ukraine's Western partners have previously expressed concern that the conflict could spill beyond Ukraine into a war between NATO and Russia.\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron repeated last week that he doesn't exclude sending troops to Ukraine, and U.K. Foreign Secretary David Cameron said Kyiv's forces will be able to use British long-range weapons to strike targets inside Russia. Some other NATO countries providing weapons to Kyiv have balked at that possibility.\n\nThe Kremlin branded those comments as dangerous, heightening tension between Russia and NATO. The war already has placed significant strain on relations between Moscow and the West.\n\nKremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Monday that Macron's recent statement and other remarks by British and U.S. officials had prompted the nuclear drills.\n\n\"It's a new round of escalation,\" Peskov said, referring to what the Kremlin regarded as provocative statements. \"It's unprecedented and requires special attention and special measures.\"\n\nDmitry Medvedev, the deputy head of Russia's Security Council that's chaired by Putin, said in his typically hawkish fashion that the comments by Macron and Cameron risked pushing the nuclear-armed world toward a \"global catastrophe.\"\n\nIt wasn't the first time Europe's military support for Ukraine has prompted nuclear saber-rattling. In March 2023, after the U.K.'s decision to provide Ukraine with armor-piercing shells containing depleted uranium, Putin said he intends to deploy tactical nuclear weapons on the territory of Ukraine neighbor Belarus.\n\nThe ministry said the exercise is intended to \"increase the readiness of non-strategic nuclear forces to fulfill combat tasks\" and will be held on Putin's orders. The maneuvers will involve missile units of the Southern Military District along with the air force and the navy, it said.\n\nThe Russian announcement stirred little reaction in Ukraine, where the spokesman for the Military Intelligence agency, Andrii Yusov, said on national television: \"Nuclear blackmail is a usual practice of Putin's regime; it does not constitute major news.\"\n\nWestern officials have blamed Russia for threatening a wider war through provocative acts. NATO countries said last week they are deeply concerned by a campaign of hybrid activities on the military alliance's soil, accusing Moscow of being behind them and saying they represent a security threat.\n\nPeskov dismissed those claims as \"new, unfounded accusations leveled at our country.\"\n\nGermany said Monday it recalled its ambassador to Russia for a week of consultations in Berlin following an alleged computer hack of Chancellor Olaf Scholz's party.\n\nMeanwhile, Ukrainian drones hit two vehicles Monday in Russia's Belgorod region, killing six people and injuring 35 others, including two children, local authorities said. The area has been hit by Kyiv's forces in recent months.\n\nOne of the vehicles was a minibus carrying farm workers, Belgorod Gov. Vyacheslav Gladkov said.\n\nIt was not possible to independently confirm the report.\n\nWhile Ukraine's army is largely pinned down on the 1,000-kilometer (600-mile) front line due to a shortage of troops and ammunition after more than two years of fighting, it has used its long-range firepower to hit targets deep inside Russia.\n\nIn what has largely been a war of attrition, Russia also has relied heavily on long-range missile, artillery and drones to wreak damage on Ukraine.\n\nThe Kremlin's forces kept up their bombardment of Ukraine's power grid, with a nighttime Russian drone attack targeting energy infrastructure in Ukraine's northern region of Sumy. Multiple towns and villages in the region, including Sumy, lost power, regional authorities said.\n\nRussia attacked Ukrainian targets with 13 Shahed drones overnight, 12 of which were intercepted in the Sumy region, Ukraine's air force said.", "source": {"uri": "castanet.net", "dataType": "news", "title": "Castanet"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

They are less powerful than the strategic weapons -- massive warheads that arm intercontinental ballistic missiles and are intended to obliterate entire cities.\n\nThe Russian announcement was a warning to Ukraine's western allies about becoming more deeply engaged in the two-year-old war, where the Kremlin's forces have gained an upper hand amid Ukraine's shortage of manpower and weapons.\n\nSome of Ukraine's western partners have previously expressed concern that the conflict could spill beyond Ukraine into a war between Nato and Russia.\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron repeated last week that he does not exclude sending troops to Ukraine, and UK Foreign Secretary Lord David Cameron said Kyiv's forces will be able to use British long-range weapons to strike targets inside Russia.\n\nSome other Nato countries providing weapons to Kyiv have baulked at that possibility.\n\nThe Kremlin branded those comments as dangerous, heightening tension between Russia and Nato. The war already has placed significant strain on relations between Moscow and the West.\n\nKremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said on Monday that Mr Macron's recent statement and other remarks by British and US officials had prompted the nuclear drills.\n\n\"It's a new round of escalation,\" he said, referring to what the Kremlin regarded as provocative statements. \"It's unprecedented and requires special attention and special measures.\"\n\nRussia's Foreign Ministry summoned the French and British ambassadors, and urged the British ambassador \"to think about the inevitable catastrophic consequences of such hostile steps from London\".\n\nSweden's foreign minister Tobias Billstrom said the nuclear exercises \"contribute to increasing instability\".\n\n\"In the current security situation, Russia's actions may be considered particularly irresponsible and reckless,\" he told Swedish news agency TT.\n\nDmitry Medvedev, the deputy head of Russia's Security Council which is chaired by Mr Putin, said the comments by Mr Macron and Lord Cameron risked pushing the nuclear-armed world towards a \"global catastrophe\".\n\nIn March 2023, after the UK's decision to provide Ukraine with armour-piercing shells containing depleted uranium, Mr Putin said he intended to deploy tactical nuclear weapons on the territory of Ukraine's neighbour Belarus.\n\nThe ministry said the latest exercise is intended to \"increase the readiness of non-strategic nuclear forces to fulfil combat tasks\" and will be held on Mr Putin's orders. The manoeuvres will involve missile units of the Southern Military District along with the air force and the navy, it added.\n\nThe Russian announcement stirred little reaction in Ukraine, where the spokesman for the Military Intelligence agency, Andrii Yusov, said on national television: \"Nuclear blackmail is a usual practice of Putin's regime; it does not constitute major news.\"\n\nWestern officials have blamed Russia for threatening a wider war through provocative acts. Nato countries said last week they were deeply concerned by a campaign of hybrid activities on the military alliance's soil, accusing Moscow of being behind them and saying they represent a security threat.\n\nMr Peskov dismissed those claims as \"new, unfounded accusations levelled at our country\".\n\nGermany said on Monday it had recalled its ambassador to Russia for a week of consultations in Berlin after an alleged computer hack of Chancellor Olaf Scholz's party.\n\nMeanwhile, Ukrainian drones hit two vehicles on Monday in Russia's Belgorod region, killing six people and injuring 35 others, including two children, local authorities said. The area has been hit by Kyiv's forces in recent months.\n\nOne of the vehicles was a minibus carrying farm workers, Belgorod governor Vyacheslav Gladkov said.", "source": {"uri": "breakingnews.ie",

Putin said last year that Moscow had transferred some tactical nuclear weapons to Belarus, Russia's first move of such warheads outside Russia since the 1991 fall of the Soviet Union.\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin said on Thursday that there was nothing unusual in a planned exercise involving the practice deployment of tactical nuclear weapons in southern Russia along with ally Belarus, as preparations for the drills have begun. Russia said on Monday it would practise the deployment of tactical nuclear weapons as part of a military exercise after what Moscow said were threats from France, Britain and the United States.\n\n\"There is nothing unusual here, this is planned work,\" state news agency TASS reported Putin as saying. \"It is training.\" Russia's defence ministry, in its announcement on Monday, explicitly linked the nuclear exercise to \"provocative statements and threats by certain Western officials against the Russian Federation\".\n\nPutin said last year that Moscow had transferred some tactical nuclear weapons to Belarus, Russia's first move of such warheads outside Russia since the 1991 fall of the Soviet Union. Putin said that he had suggested to Belarus that it take part in one of the parts of the nuclear exercise announced on Monday.\n\n\"We hold them regularly,\" Putin said. \"This time they are held in three stages. At the second stage, Belarusian colleagues will join our joint actions.\" \"Corresponding instructions have been given to the ministries of defence and the general staffs of our armies. They began joint preparations,\" Putin said according to the Kremlin readout, which was earlier cited by Interfax news agency.\n\nTHIRD TRAINING DRILL Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko, speaking alongside Putin, said that this was the third such training exercise.\n\n\"There were probably dozens in Russia, so we synchronized. And the general staffs, as the Russian defence minister told me, have already begun to execute these instructions,\" Lukashenko said. Russia and the United States are by far the world's biggest nuclear powers, holding more than 10,600 of the world's 12,100 nuclear warheads. China has the third-largest nuclear arsenal, followed by France and Britain.\n\nRussia has about 1,558 non-strategic nuclear warheads, according to the Federation of American Scientists, though there is uncertainty about exact figures for such weapons due to a lack of transparency. There is still much uncertainty among arms controls experts about what weapons Russia has supplied to Belarus and the nature of their storage.\n\nTypically, it would take some time to create the storage, security and barracks for such a deployment - and Russian nuclear weapons are controlled by the Russian defence ministry's 12th Main Directorate (known as 12th GUMO). It is unclear if 12th GUMO is in Belarus, according to Western experts. No power has used nuclear weapons in war since the United States unleashed the first atomic bomb attacks on the Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki in 1945.\n\nThe Pentagon said on Monday that it had not seen a change to Russia's disposition of its strategic nuclear forces, despite what it called \"irresponsible rhetoric\" from Moscow detailing plans for exercises involving the deployment of non-strategic nuclear weapons.

Tactical nuclear weapons typically feature less powerful warheads than those arming strategic missiles and are designed for battlefield use rather than the destruction of city-sized targets.\n\nThe drills will involve the practice of the \"preparation and use of non-strategic nuclear weapons,\" the Defense Ministry said, adding that missile formations of the Southern Military District and the navy would take part.\n\nThe statement did not name which officials had made the \"provocative statements\" which had supposedly caused Putin to order the exercises, but the announcement followed the Kremlin's condemnation last week of remarks made by French President Emmanuel Macron and David Cameron, the former U.K. prime minister and current foreign secretary.\n\nIn an interview published last Thursday, Macron said that he would not rule out the possibility of sending ground troops to Ukraine, reiterating a position he'd publicly taken earlier in the year which received significant blowback both in France and internationally. On the same day, Cameron said during a visit to Kyiv that Ukraine has the right to use long-range British weapons to strike targets on Russian territory.\n\nKremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov on Friday called Macron's comment \"a very important and very dangerous statement\" and similarly branded Cameron's words \"another very dangerous statement.\" \"This is a direct escalation of tensions around the Ukrainian conflict, which potentially may threaten European security, the entire European security architecture,\" Peskov said, according to the Associated Press.\n\nWhile it's unusual for nuclear powers to publicly announce that weapons drills have been arranged in response to specific provocations, Putin has previously turned to nuclear rhetoric during the war in Ukraine. In March 2023, he said he planned to station tactical weapons in Belarus following Britain's decision to supply Kyiv with armor-piercing shells made with depleted uranium.\n\nHe also warned in March this year that a direct conflict between NATO and Russia would put the world one step away from World War III. Putin nevertheless said \"hardly anyone\" wants such a scenario.", "source": {"uri": "thedailybeast.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Daily Beast"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Russia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tactical_nuclear_weapon", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Tactical nuclear weapon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moscow_Kremlin", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Moscow Kremlin"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vladimir_Putin", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Vladimir Putin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moscow", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Moscow"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Moscow"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_invasion_of_Ukraine", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Russian invasion of Ukraine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "France"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_Secretary", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Foreign Secretary"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_Military_District", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Southern Military District"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intercontinental_ballistic_missile", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Intercontinental ballistic missile"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emmanuel_Macron", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Emmanuel Macron"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_the_United_Kingdom", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Prime Minister of the United Kingdom"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_France", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "President of France"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Cameron", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "David Cameron"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_weapon", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nuclear weapon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukraine", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_in_Donbas_(2014\u20132022)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "War in Donbas (2014\u20132022)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyiv", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kyiv"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depleted_uranium", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Depleted uranium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shell_(projectile)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Shell (projectile)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_III", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "World War III"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dmitry_Peskov", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dmitry Peskov"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Associated Press"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strike_action", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Strike action"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NATO", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NATO"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belarus", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Belarus"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Belarus"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Physics/Nuclear", "label": "dmoz/Science/Physics/Nuclear", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Military_Science", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Military Science", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Pharmacy/Nuclear_Pharmacy", "label": "dmoz/Health/Pharmacy/Nuclear Pharmacy", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 95}], "image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1589,w_2825,x_0,y_86/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1714995245/2024-04-25T170417Z_1973784314_RC2SD7A4ZJGA_RTRMADP_3_RUSSIA-BUSINESS-PUTIN_n4v5vb", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9542018", "eventUri": "eng-9542018", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.3254901960784313, "wgt": 186, "relevance": 1}

Tactical nuclear weapons include air bombs, warheads for short-range missiles and artillery munitions and are meant for use on a battlefield. They are less powerful than the massive warheads that arm intercontinental ballistic missiles and are intended to obliterate entire cities.\n\nThe Russian announcement appeared to be a warning to Ukraine's Western allies about becoming more deeply involved in the more than two-year war. Some of Ukraine's Western partners have previously expressed concern about stoking the conflict amid fears it could spill beyond Ukraine into a war between NATO and Russia.\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron repeated last week that he doesn't exclude sending troops to Ukraine, and U.K. Foreign Secretary David Cameron said Kyiv's forces will be able to use British long-range weapons to strike targets inside Russia. Some other NATO countries providing weapons to Kyiv have balked at that possibility.\n\nThe Kremlin branded those comments as dangerous, heightening tension between Russia and NATO. The war already has placed significant strain on relations between Moscow and the West.\n\nKremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov on Monday said Macron's recent statement and other remarks by British and U.S. officials had prompted the nuclear drills.\n\n\"It's a new round of escalation,\" Peskov said, referring to what the Kremlin regarded as provocative statements. \"It's unprecedented and requires special attention and special measures,\" Peskov told reporters.\n\nDmitry Medvedev, the deputy head of Russia's Security Council that's chaired by President Vladimir Putin, said in his typically hawkish fashion that the comments by Macron and Cameron risked pushing the nuclear-armed world toward a \"global catastrophe.\"\n\nIt wasn't the first time Europe's military support for Ukraine has irked Russian authorities and prompted nuclear sabre-rattling. In March last year, after the U.K. government's decision to provide Ukraine with armor-piercing shells containing depleted uranium, Putin announced that he intends to deploy tactical nuclear weapons on the territory of Belarus.\n\nThe ministry said the exercise is intended to \"increase the readiness of nonstrategic nuclear forces to fulfill combat tasks\" and will be held on Putin's orders. The manoeuvres will involve missile units of the Southern Military District along with the air force and the navy, it said.\n\nWestern officials have blamed Russia for threatening a wider war through provocative acts. NATO countries said last week they are deeply concerned by a campaign of hybrid activities on the military alliance's soil, accusing Russia of being behind them and saying they represent a threat to their security.\n\nPeskov dismissed those claims as \"new unfounded accusations levelled at our country.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Ukrainian drones hit two vehicles Monday in Russia's Belgorod region, killing six people and injuring 35 others, including two children, local authorities said, in an area frequently struck by Kyiv's forces in recent months.\n\nOne of the vehicles was a minibus that was carrying farm workers, Belgorod Gov. Vyacheslav Gladkov said.\n\nNo other details were immediately available, and it was not possible to independently confirm the report from the border region.\n\nWhile Ukraine's army is largely pinned down on the 1,000-kilometer (600-mile) front line due to a shortage of troops and ammunition after more than two years of fighting, it has used its long-range firepower to hit targets deep inside Russia. The apparent aim is to disrupt Russia's war logistics system by hitting oil refineries and depots, and unnerve the Russian border regions.\n\nThe Belgorod region was a staging ground for Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. It has come under regular attack ever since Russian forces retreated there from northeastern Ukraine early in the war following a counteroffensive by Kyiv.\n\nIn what has largely been a war of attrition, Russia has also relied heavily on long-range missile, artillery and drones to wreak damage on Ukraine.\n\nAt the end of last year, Belgorod officials said 25 people were killed, including five children, and more than 100 were injured in a Ukrainian attack, and regular rocket and drone strikes have continued since then. The area can be reached by relatively simple and mobile weapons such as multiple rocket launchers from forests on the Ukrainian side.\n\nRussian authorities said in March they planned to evacuate about 9,000 children from the area because of continuous shelling, after Putin said he wanted to create a buffer zone to help protect border regions.\n\nAlso, the Kremlin's forces kept up their bombardment of Ukraine's power grid, with a nighttime Russian drone attack targeting energy infrastructure in Ukraine's northern region of Sumy. Multiple towns and villages in the region, including Sumy, lost power, regional authorities said.\n\nRussia attacked Ukrainian targets with 13 Shahed drones overnight, 12 of which were intercepted in the Sumy region, Ukraine's air force said.", "source": {"uri": "theglobeandmail.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Globe and Mail"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

It is unprecedented and requires special measures,\" he added.\n\nThe Russian foreign ministry meanwhile said it had summoned the UK's ambassador in Moscow and warned him that if Ukraine used British weapons to attack Russia, that Moscow could hit UK military targets in Ukraine \"and beyond.\"\n\nIt also summoned France's envoy after \"increasingly belligerent statements\" by Paris, following Macron's comments.\n\n\"The Russian side presented its assessment that Paris's destructive and provocative line is leading to an escalation of the conflict\".\n\nUkrainian forces have been dependent on Western military aid to battle Russia but NATO has said it will not send troops into Ukraine.\n\nRussia's defence ministry said troops from the Southern Military District, which borders Ukraine and includes the occupied Ukrainian territories, will take part in the drills.\n\n\"During the exercise, a set of measures will be taken to practise the preparation and use of non-strategic nuclear weapons,\" it said in a statement.\n\nNon-strategic nuclear weapons, also known as tactical nuclear weapons, are designed for use on the battlefield and can be delivered via missiles.", "source":

They are less powerful than the strategic weapons -- massive warheads that arm intercontinental ballistic missiles and are intended to obliterate entire cities.\n\nThe Russian announcement was a warning to Ukraine's western allies about becoming more deeply engaged in the two-year-old war, where the Kremlin's forces have gained an upper hand amid Ukraine's shortage of manpower and weapons.\n\nSome of Ukraine's western partners have previously expressed concern that the conflict could spill beyond Ukraine into a war between Nato and Russia.\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron repeated last week that he does not exclude sending troops to Ukraine, and UK Foreign Secretary Lord David Cameron said Kyiv's forces will be able to use British long-range weapons to strike targets inside Russia.\n\nSome other Nato countries providing weapons to Kyiv have baulked at that possibility.\n\nThe Kremlin branded those comments as dangerous, heightening tension between Russia and Nato. The war already has placed significant strain on relations between Moscow and the West.\n\nKremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said on Monday that Mr Macron's recent statement and other remarks by British and US officials had prompted the nuclear drills.\n\n\"It's a new round of escalation,\" he said, referring to what the Kremlin regarded as provocative statements. \"It's unprecedented and requires special attention and special measures.\"\n\nRussia's Foreign Ministry summoned the French and British ambassadors, and urged the British ambassador \"to think about the inevitable catastrophic consequences of such hostile steps from London\".\n\nSweden's foreign minister Tobias Billstrom said the nuclear exercises \"contribute to increasing instability\".\n\n\"In the current security situation, Russia's actions may be considered particularly irresponsible and reckless,\" he told Swedish news agency TT.\n\nDmitry Medvedev, the deputy head of Russia's Security Council which is chaired by Mr Putin, said the comments by Mr Macron and Lord Cameron risked pushing the nuclear-armed world towards a \"global catastrophe\".\n\nIn March 2023, after the UK's decision to provide Ukraine with armour-piercing shells containing depleted uranium, Mr Putin said he intended to deploy tactical nuclear weapons on the territory of Ukraine's neighbour Belarus.\n\nThe ministry said the latest exercise is intended to \"increase the readiness of non-strategic nuclear forces to fulfil combat tasks\" and will be held on Mr Putin's orders. The manoeuvres will involve missile units of the Southern Military District along with the air force and the navy, it added.\n\nThe Russian announcement stirred little reaction in Ukraine, where the spokesman for the Military Intelligence agency, Andrii Yusov, said on national television: \"Nuclear blackmail is a usual practice of Putin's regime; it does not constitute major news.\"\n\nWestern officials have blamed Russia for threatening a wider war through provocative acts. Nato countries said last week they were deeply concerned by a campaign of hybrid activities on the military alliance's soil, accusing Moscow of being behind them and saying they represent a security threat.\n\nMr Peskov dismissed those claims as \"new, unfounded accusations levelled at our country\".\n\nGermany said on Monday it had recalled its ambassador to Russia for a week of consultations in Berlin after an alleged computer hack of Chancellor Olaf Scholz's party.\n\nMeanwhile, Ukrainian drones hit two vehicles on Monday in Russia's Belgorod region, killing six people and injuring 35 others, including two children, local authorities said. The area has been hit by Kyiv's forces in recent months.\n\nOne of the vehicles was a minibus carrying farm workers, Belgorod governor Vyacheslav Gladkov said.", "source": {"uri":

Tactical nuclear weapons have a lower yield compared to massive warheads that arm intercontinental ballistic missiles intended to obliterate entire cities.\n\nThe announcement appeared to be a warning to Ukraine's Western allies about becoming more deeply involved in the more than two-year war. Some of Ukraine's Western partners have previously expressed concern about stoking the war amid fears it could spill beyond Ukraine and into a conflict between NATO and Russia.\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron repeated last week that he doesn't exclude sending troops to Ukraine, and U.K. Foreign Secretary David Cameron said Kyiv's forces will be able to use British long-range weapons to strike targets inside Russia.\n\nThe Kremlin branded those comments as dangerous, heightening tension between Russia and NATO. The war already has placed significant strain on relations between Moscow and the West.\n\nIt wasn't the first time Europe's military support for Ukraine has irked Russian authorities and prompted nuclear saber-rattling. In March last year, after the U.K. government's decision to provide Ukraine with armor-piercing shells containing depleted uranium, Putin announced that he intends to deploy tactical nuclear weapons on the territory of Belarus.\n\nTactical nuclear weapons include air bombs, warheads for short-range missiles and artillery munitions and are meant for use on the battlefield.\n\nThe ministry said the exercise is intended to \"increase the readiness of non-strategic nuclear forces to fulfill combat tasks\" and will be held on President Vladimir Putin's orders. The maneuvers will involve missile units of the Southern Military District along with the air force and the navy, it said.\n\nMeanwhile, Ukrainian drones hit two vehicles Monday in Russia's Belgorod region, killing six people and injuring 35 others, including two children, local authorities said, in an area frequently struck by Kyiv's forces in recent months.\n\nOne of the vehicles was a minibus that was carrying farm workers, Belgorod Gov. Vyacheslav Gladkov said.\n\nNo other details were immediately available, and it was not possible to independently confirm the report from the border region.\n\nWhile Ukraine's army is largely pinned down on the 1,000-kilometer (600-mile) front line due to a shortage of troops and ammunition after more than two years of fighting, it has used its long-range firepower to hit targets deep inside Russia. The apparent aim is to disrupt Russia's war logistics system by hitting oil refineries and depots, and unnerve the Russian border regions.\n\nThe Belgorod region was a staging ground for Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. It has come under regular attack ever since Russian forces retreated there from northeastern Ukraine early in the war following a counteroffensive by Kyiv.\n\nIn what has largely been a war of attrition, Russia has also relied heavily on long-range missile, artillery and drones to wreak damage on Ukraine.\n\nAt the end of last year, Belgorod officials said 25 people were killed, including five children, and more than 100 were injured in a Ukrainian attack, and regular rocket and drone strikes have continued since then. The area can be reached by relatively simple and mobile weapons such as multiple rocket launchers from forests on the Ukrainian side.\n\nRussian authorities said in March they planned to evacuate about 9,000 children from the area because of continuous shelling, after Putin said he wanted to create a buffer zone to help protect border regions.\n\nAlso, the Kremlin's forces kept up their bombardment of Ukraine's power grid, with a nighttime Russian drone attack targeting energy infrastructure in Ukraine's northern region of Sumy. Multiple towns and villages in the region, including Sumy, lost power, regional authorities said.\n\nRussia attacked Ukrainian targets with 13 Shahed drones overnight, 12 of which were intercepted in the Sumy region, Ukraine's air force said.", "source": {"uri": "washingtontimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Washington Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

The drills involving air and naval forces are being held in response to \"provocative statements and threats made by certain Western officials,\" it said.\n\nPutin has at times brandished the threat of nuclear weapons since his February 2022 invasion of Ukraine, which borders southern Russia. In October, Russia rehearsed its ability to deliver a \"massive\" retaliatory nuclear strike, including with the launch of ballistic and cruise missiles.\n\nIn February, the Russian leader warned the North Atlantic Treaty Organization it risked a nuclear conflict if the alliance were to send troops to Ukraine.\n\nThe U.S. and Europe \"must understand that we also have weapons that can hit targets on their territory and that all this really threatens a conflict with the use of nuclear weapons, and therefore the destruction of civilization,\" Putin said in his annual state-of-the-nation address.\n\nThat threat came after French President Emmanuel Macron refused to rule out sending troops to Ukraine, even as the idea was rebuffed by other NATO allies. Macron on Monday is hosting Chinese President Xi Jinping, who despite growing diplomatic and economic ties with Russia, has warned Putin against the use of nuclear weapons.\n\nPutin later played down the threat that Russia and the West were heading toward a nuclear war, telling the state-run RIA Novosti news service on March 13 that there's never been a need to use tactical nuclear weapons in Ukraine and the thought had never crossed his mind.\n\nKremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov on Monday blamed Macron and U.K. Foreign Secretary David Cameron for sparking \"an unprecedented spike in tensions,\" RIA Novosti reported. Cameron last week said Ukraine had the right to use weapons it receives from Britain to strike Russia.\n\nThe Foreign Ministry in Moscow later summoned the U.K. and French ambassadors, ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said on her Telegram channel.\n\nThe Russian president plans to travel to China for talks with Xi next week. Putin's inauguration will take place at the Kremlin on Tuesday, extending his almost quarter-century rule over Russia for a further six years after he gained 87% support in a tightly controlled March election in which he faced no serious competition.\n\nRussia has been trying to advance against embattled Ukrainian forces this year, bolstered by an advantage in ammunition. Supplies of munitions and weapons are starting to flow again to Kyiv's troops after the US approved a long-delayed $61 billion aid package last month.\n\n-- -- -\n\n\u00a92024 Bloomberg L.P.

Russia's Defense Ministry said that President Vladimir Putin had ordered an exercise for missile, aviation and naval personnel to \"increase the readiness of nonstrategic nuclear forces to carry out combat missions.\"\n\nThe announcement of the exercise was Russia's most explicit warning in its more than two-year invasion of Ukraine that it could use tactical nuclear weapons there. The Kremlin said it came in response to comments by two European leaders that raised the prospect of more direct Western intervention in the war.\n\nThe exercise, the Defense Ministry said, would involve forces of the Southern Military District, an area that covers Russian-occupied Ukraine and part of Russia's border region with Ukraine. It said the exercise would take place \"in the near future.\"\n\nWestern officials have long worried that Russia could deploy tactical nuclear weapons, especially if it faced serious setbacks on the battlefield. But Putin denied as recently as March that he had ever considered it, even as he regularly reminds the world of Russia's vast nuclear arsenal as a way of keeping in check the West's military support for Ukraine.\n\nOn Monday, however, Russian officials claimed that warnings about the possibility of more direct Western involvement in the war had changed the situation. The Defense Ministry said the exercise would be held \"to unconditionally ensure the territorial integrity and sovereignty of the Russian state in response to provocative statements and threats of individual Western officials against the Russian Federation.\"", "source": {"uri": "westhawaiitoday.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "West Hawaii Today"}, "authors": [{"uri": "none@westhawaiitoday.com", "name": "none", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_weapon", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nuclear weapon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukraine", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Russia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ministry_of_Defense_(Israel)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ministry of Defense (Israel)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_exercise", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Military exercise"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vladimir_Putin", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Vladimir Putin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berlin", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Berlin"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Berlin"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian-occupied_territories_of_Ukraine", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Russian-occupied territories of Ukraine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_invasion_of_Ukraine", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Russian invasion of Ukraine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tactical_nuclear_weapon", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tactical nuclear weapon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_Military_District", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Southern Military District"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moscow_Kremlin", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Moscow Kremlin"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Territorial_integrity", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Territorial integrity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sovereignty", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sovereignty"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Martial_Arts/Russian", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Martial Arts/Russian", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Military_Science", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Military Science", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Pharmacy/Nuclear_Pharmacy", "label": "dmoz/Health/Pharmacy/Nuclear Pharmacy", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 94}], "image": "https://www.westhawaiitoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/web1_russia-ukraine-5-7-24.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9542018", "eventUri": "eng-9542018", "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.3803921568627451, "wgt": 185, "relevance": 1}

However, Monday marked the first public announcement of such drills by Russia.\n\nAccording to Russia's defence ministry, the exercises will encompass preparations and deployment scenarios involving non-strategic nuclear weapons.\n\nTactical nuclear weapons, unlike their strategic counterparts, are designed for battlefield use and possess lower destructive capabilities, as reported by CNN.\n\nThe decision to conduct these drills follows what the defence ministry describes as \"provocative statements and threats\" from Western officials, which Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov characterised as reaching \"unprecedented levels.\"\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron, in a recent interview with The Economist magazine, reiterated the possibility of deploying Western troops to Ukraine, underscoring the threat Russia poses to European security.\n\nSimilarly, British Foreign Secretary David Cameron, during a visit to Ukraine, emphasised Ukraine's right to defend itself using weapons supplied by the UK, condemning Russia's illegal invasion.\n\nThe announcement of the drills comes amidst the passage of a long-delayed aid package by the United States for Kyiv, aimed at bolstering Ukraine's military capabilities against renewed Russian aggression.\n\nRussian forces have made significant territorial gains along Ukraine's eastern front in recent months, exploiting their manpower and ammunition advantage before the arrival of US aid.\n\nPutin's invocation of nuclear rhetoric often coincides with challenges to Russia's military objectives or increased international support for Ukraine.\n\nAfter Ukraine reclaimed substantial territories in late 2022, Putin acknowledged the protracted nature of the conflict and highlighted the growing threat of nuclear war.\n\nIn February of the same year, Putin announced Russia's suspension of the New START treaty, citing the possibility of US nuclear testing as justification, according to CNN.\n\nWhile US President Joe Biden and State Department officials have sought to downplay concerns regarding Putin's nuclear threats, they remain vigilant in monitoring Russian actions.\n\nResponding to Russia's latest announcement, the Pentagon emphasised that there has been no discernible shift in Russia's strategic force posture.\n\nMaj Gen Patrick Ryder characterised Russia's decision as \"completely inappropriate\" and reflective of Russia's history of irresponsible rhetoric.\n\nReports indicate that the US has been actively preparing for the possibility of Russia using tactical nuclear weapons against Ukraine since late 2022.\n\nIn the latest announcement, Russia's defence ministry revealed plans for upcoming exercises involving missile formations from the Southern Military District, incorporating aviation and naval forces.\n\nAs tensions between Russia and the West continue to escalate, the international community remains on edge, cognizant of the potential ramifications of Putin's aggressive posture and nuclear brinkmanship, CNN reported.

At the second stage, Belarusian colleagues will join our joint actions.\"\n\nBelarusian President Alexander Lukashenko, speaking alongside Putin, said that this was the third such training exercise.\n\n\"There were probably dozens in Russia, so we synchronized. And the general staffs, as the Russian defence minister told me, have already begun to execute these instructions,\" Lukashenko said.\n\nRussia and the United States are by far the world's biggest nuclear powers, holding more than 10,600 of the world's 12,100 nuclear warheads. China has the third-largest nuclear arsenal, followed by France and Britain.\n\nRussia has about 1,558 non-strategic nuclear warheads, according to the Federation of American Scientists, though there is uncertainty about exact figures for such weapons due to a lack of transparency.\n\nThere is still much uncertainty among arms controls experts about what weapons Russia has supplied to Belarus and the nature of their storage.\n\nTypically, it would take some time to create the storage, security and barracks for such a deployment - and Russian nuclear weapons are controlled by the Russian defence ministry's 12th Main Directorate (known as 12th GUMO). It is unclear if 12th GUMO is in Belarus, according to Western experts.\n\nNo power has used nuclear weapons in war since the United States unleashed the first atomic bomb attacks on the Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki in 1945.\n\nThe Pentagon said on Monday that it had not seen a change to Russia's disposition of its strategic nuclear forces, despite what it called \"irresponsible rhetoric\" from Moscow detailing plans for exercises involving the deployment of non-strategic nuclear weapons.\n\n(Editing by Nick Macfie)\n\nSign Up for Springs AM Update Your morning rundown of the latest news from Colorado Springs and around the country\n\nSign Up View all of our newsletters.

The U.S. bomb dropped on Hiroshima during World War II was 15 kilotons.\n\nSuch battlefield nuclear weapons -- aerial bombs, warheads for short-range missiles or artillery munitions -- can be very compact. Their small size allows them to be discreetly carried on a truck or plane.\n\nUnlike strategic weapons, which have been subject to arms control agreements between Moscow and Washington, tactical weapons never have been limited by any such pacts, and Russia hasn't released their numbers or any other specifics related to them.\n\nWHAT HAS PUTIN SAID ABOUT NUCLEAR WEAPONS?\n\nSince launching the full-scale invasion of Ukraine on Feb. 24, 2022, Russian President Vladimir Putin has repeatedly reminded Western nations about Moscow's nuclear might in a bid to discourage them from increasing military support to Kyiv.\n\nEarly on in the war, Putin frequently referenced Moscow's nuclear arsenal by vowing repeatedly to use \"all means\" necessary to protect Russia. But he later toned down his statements as Ukraine's offensive last summer failed to reach its goals and Russia scored more gains on the battlefield.\n\nMoscow's defense doctrine envisages a nuclear response to an atomic strike or even an attack with conventional weapons that \"threaten the very existence of the Russian state.\" That vague wording has led some pro-Kremlin Russian experts to urge Putin to sharpen it to force the West to take the warnings more seriously.\n\nPutin said last fall that he sees no reason for such a change.\n\n\"There is no situation in which anything would threaten Russian statehood and the existence of the Russian state,\" he said. \"I think that no person of sober mind and clear memory could have an idea to use nuclear weapons against Russia.\"\n\nWHY DID RUSSIA SEND NUCLEAR WEAPONS TO BELARUS?\n\nLast year, Russia moved some of its tactical nuclear weapons into the territory of Belarus, an ally that neighbors Ukraine and NATO members Poland, Latvia and Lithuania.\n\nBelarus' authoritarian president, Alexander Lukashenko, had long urged Moscow to station nuclear weapons in his country, which has close military ties with Russia and served as a staging ground for the war in Ukraine.\n\nBoth Putin and Lukashenko said that nuclear weapons deployment to Belarus was intended to counter perceived Western threats. Last year, Putin specifically linked the move to the U.K. government's decision to provide Ukraine with armor-piercing shells containing depleted uranium.\n\nNeither leader said how many were moved -- only that Soviet-era facilities in the country were readied to accommodate them, and that Belarusian pilots and missile crews were trained to use them. The weapons have remained under Russian military control.\n\nThe deployment of tactical nuclear weapons to Belarus, which has a 1,084-kilometer (673-mile) border with Ukraine, would allow Russian aircraft and missiles to reach potential targets there more easily and quickly, if Moscow decides to use them. It has also extended Russia's capability to target several NATO allies in Eastern and Central Europe.\n\n___\n\nFollow the AP's coverage of the war at https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine", "source":

Macron's remarks including his statement about deploying French troops in Ukraine, if Russian forces were to break through the increasingly fragile Ukraine front lines and UK foreign secretary David Cameron stating that Ukraine could use British weapons to strike deep into Russian territory, are viewed as \"escalation\" by Moscow.\n\nWith US medium range nuclear weapons already present on European soil, and Macron now threatening to throw in his own nuclear forces to the mix, the stand-off in Europe is reaching a boiling point, although everybody concerned, who has his finger on the button knows that pressing it guarantees mutually assured destruction (MAD).\n\nMoscow has the largest nuclear arsenal in the world of all ranges, from ICBMs and tactical nuclear missiles, an estimated 6,000 of them. The US has about 5,500, and its NATO allies UK 245 and France 290. The US is said to have stationed 180 tactical nuclear missiles at six bases in Europe, including two in Italy and one each in Belgium, Germany, The Netherlands and Turkey.\n\nTactical nuclear missiles are small, in the range of 5-50 kilo tons and can be launched as part of medium range missile systems such as the Russian Iskander, Kinzhal, or Kh-2, or can be delivered by air, or by submarines. Tactical weapons are different from Strategic missiles that have a range of up to 10,000 kilometres and can be launched across continents, and are known as Intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBM).\n\nNuclear weapons are measured in terms of their destructive force, and a weapon of 5 kiloton means that it can deliver a devastating explosive force equivalent to 5,000 tons of TNT. The American nuclear bomb that destroyed the Japanese city of Nagasaki was 15 kilotons, while Hiroshima was flattened by a 25-kiloton bomb.\n\nRussian nuclear forces have even smaller tactical missiles, in 2-2.5 kiloton range that can be launched from long-range artillery and even mortars.\n\nSince 1945, no country which has nuclear weapons has used them, although every country keeps its strategic nuclear forces on alert, and every nuclear power develops tactical missiles for use in battlefield.\n\nThe Russian nuclear doctrine had a no-first-use clause till 1993, when the Yeltsin regime removed it. The current doctrine, signed in as a decree by President Putin in June 2020, declares that the policy is defensive in nature, and that the Russian nuclear weapons are for deterrence.\n\nThe policy, enunciated by Putin lays down the following conditions under which Russia could use nuclear weapons:\n\nClauses 9 and 10 of the decree signed by president Putin amplify the term 'Deterrence\" and its limits.\n\nClause 9 states: \"Nuclear deterrence is aimed at ensuring that a potential adversary understands the inevitability of retaliation in the event of aggression against the Russian Federation and (or) its allies\".\n\nClause 10 expands the meaning further: \"Nuclear deterrence is ensured by the presence in the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation of combat-ready forces and means capable of, through the use of nuclear weapons, guaranteed to cause unacceptable damage to a potential enemy in any situation, as well as the readiness and determination of the Russian Federation to use such weapons.\n\nMoscow is clearly conveying to the West that the recent moves by the US which is sending money and weapons to the tune of $61 billion to Ukraine, as well as NATO chief Jens Stoltenberg's proposal for raising a $100 billion NATO fund could force Russia to consider a nuclear response.\n\nRussia could also be signalling that the US supply of ATACMS missiles to Ukraine, and Macron's statement that the French nuclear weapons under the Force de Dissuasion could be treated as part of the NATO arsenal of nuclear weapons stationed in Europe, Poland asking the US to station nuclear missiles on its soil, and UK Foreign Secretary David Cameron's statement that Ukraine could use British weapons to strike targets deep inside Russia, could amount to escalation that Russia cannot ignore except at its own peril.\n\nPutin and the Russian military command have been restrained in their language so far, but Dmitri Medvedev, the Deputy head of the Russian Duma (parliament) has described the western leaders as \"infantile morons\".\n\nRussia's move appears to be meant more as a warning than actual intent to use the tactical missiles that are designed for use on the battlefield. Both Russia, as well as the western nuclear weapon nations are aware of the catastrophic nature of nuclear war. Use of tactical missiles would most likely lead to exchange of ICBMs, causing assured destruction of not just the targeted nations but also endanger the world itself, given the massive amount of radiation fall-out.\n\nThe only time the world came close to a nuclear holocaust was in October 1962, when the US threatened to use them against Russia which was planning to station its nuclear missiles in Cuba, almost next door just across the sea from Florida. Faced with a serious threat of a nuclear war, Russia withdrew its missiles from Cuba.\n\nRussia could stop at just exercising its nuclear deterrence force. Or it could take further steps including stationing the fearsome weapons right next to the new NATO members like Finland, Sweden, Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia. A nuclear war between two weapon states can happen only in the case of failure to gauge each other's motives and intentions. With both the US and Russia having a dialogue of the deaf, that situation seems to be approaching fast.", "source": {"uri": "news9live.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "News9live"}, "authors":

This marks the first time Russia has publicly announced such drills, which are intended to increase readiness. The announcement comes amid heightened tension between Russia and NATO, with some Western leaders suggesting potential military involvement in Ukraine. In a separate incident, Ukrainian drones reportedly struck vehicles in Russia's Belgorod region, killing six and injuring 35, including two children. The region has been a frequent target of Ukrainian attacks in recent months.Russia plans to hold drills simulating the use of tactical nuclear weapons, the Defense Ministry announced Monday, days after the Kremlin reacted angrily to comments by senior Western officials about the war in Ukraine.\n\nThe drills are in response to \"provocative statements and threats of certain Western officials regarding the Russian Federation,\" the Defense Ministry said in a statement.\n\nIt was the first time that Russia has publicly announced drills involving tactical nuclear weapons, though its strategic nuclear forces regularly hold exercises. Tactical nuclear weapons have a lower yield compared to massive warheads that arm intercontinental ballistic missiles intended to obliterate entire cities.\n\nThe announcement appeared to be a warning to Ukraine's Western allies about becoming more deeply involved in the more than two-year war. Some of Ukraine's Western partners have previously expressed concern about stoking the war amid fears it could spill beyond Ukraine and into a conflict between NATO and Russia.\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron repeated last week that he doesn't exclude sending troops to Ukraine, and U.K. Foreign Secretary David Cameron said Kyiv's forces will be able to use British long-range weapons to strike targets inside Russia.\n\nThe Kremlin branded those comments as dangerous, heightening tension between Russia and NATO. The war already has placed significant strain on relations between Moscow and the West.\n\nTactical nuclear weapons include air bombs, warheads for short-range missiles and artillery munitions and are meant for use on the battlefield.\n\nThe ministry said the exercise is intended to \"increase the readiness of non-strategic nuclear forces to fulfill combat tasks\" and will be held on President Vladimir Putin's orders. The maneuvers will involve missile units of the Southern Military District along with the air force and the navy, it said.\n\nMeanwhile, Ukrainian drones hit two vehicles Monday in Russia's Belgorod region, killing six people and injuring 35 others, including two children, local authorities said, in an area frequently struck by Kyiv's forces in recent months.\n\nOne of the vehicles was a minibus that was carrying farm workers, Belgorod Gov. Vyacheslav Gladkov said.\n\nNo other details were immediately available, and it was not possible to independently confirm the report from the border region.\n\nWhile Ukraine's army is largely pinned down on the 1,000-kilometer (600-mile) front line due to a shortage of troops and ammunition after more than two years of fighting, it has used its long-range firepower to hit targets deep inside Russia. The apparent aim is to disrupt Russia's war logistics system by hitting oil refineries and depots, and unnerve the Russian border regions.\n\nThe Belgorod region was a staging ground for Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. It has come under regular attack ever since Russian forces retreated there from northeastern Ukraine early in the war following a counteroffensive by Kyiv.\n\nIn what has largely been a war of attrition, Russia has also relied heavily on long-range missile, artillery and drones to wreak damage on Ukraine.\n\nAt the end of last year, Belgorod officials said 25 people were killed, including five children, and more than 100 were injured in a Ukrainian attack, and regular rocket and drone strikes have continued since then. The area can be reached by relatively simple and mobile weapons such as multiple rocket launchers from forests on the Ukrainian side.\n\nRussian authorities said in March they planned to evacuate about 9,000 children from the area because of continuous shelling, after Putin said he wanted to create a buffer zone to help protect border regions.", "source": {"uri":

The drill order also includes the navy and troops based near Ukraine.\n\nThe Russian President has stepped up its nuclear rhetoric since the Ukraine conflict began two years ago, warning in his address to the nation in February there was a \"real\" risk of nuclear war.\n\n\"During the exercise, a set of measures will be taken to practise the preparation and use of non-strategic nuclear weapons,\" the defence ministry said.\n\nThe ministry said the exercises would take place \"in the near future\" and were aimed at ensuring Russia's territorial integrity in the face of \"threats by certain Western officials\".\n\nIn the exercise, aircraft and naval forces will take part, including the troops from the Southern Military District, which borders Ukraine.\n\nWestern officials have become increasingly alarmed by the Kremlin's nuclear threat during the offensive in Ukraine, with Putin frequently invoking Russia's nuclear doctrine.\n\nNon-strategic nuclear weapons, also known as tactical nuclear weapons, are designed for use on the battlefield and can be delivered via missiles.\n\nLast year Russia ditched its ratification of the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty and pulled out of a key arms reduction agreement with the United States.\n\nRussia and the United States are the world's biggest nuclear powers, holding more than 10,600 of the world's 12,100 nuclear warheads.\n\nChina has the third largest nuclear arsenal, followed by France and Britain.\n\nPutin casts the war as part of a centuries-old battle with the West which he says humiliated Russia after the Berlin Wall fell in 1989 by enlarging Nato and encroaching on what Moscow considers to be Russia's historical sphere of influence.\n\nUkraine and its Western supporters say the war is an imperial-style land grab by a corrupt dictatorship.\n\nWestern leaders have vowed to work for a defeat of Russian forces in Ukraine, while ruling out any deployment of Nato personnel there.\n\n(With agencies input)\n\nAt TOI World Desk, our dedicated team of seasoned journalists and passionate writers tirelessly sifts through the vast tapestry of global events to bring you the latest news and diverse perspectives round the clock.

The German foreign office says that Germany has called back its ambassador to Russia for a week of consultations, following an alleged hacker attack on Chancellor Olaf Scholz's party. The ministry said Monday, May 6, 2024 that the government is taking the incident \"serious.\"\n\nRussia said Monday it plans to hold drills simulating the use of battlefield nuclear weapons amid rising tensions following comments by senior Western officials about the possibility of deeper involvement in the war in Ukraine.\n\nThe announcement came on the eve of Russian President Vladimir Putin's inauguration to a fifth term in office and in a week when Moscow on Thursday will celebrate Victory Day, its most important secular holiday, marking its defeat of Nazi Germany in World War II.\n\nThe drills come in response to \"provocative statements and threats of certain Western officials regarding the Russian Federation,\" the Defense Ministry said in a statement.\n\nIt was the first time Russia has publicly announced drills involving tactical nuclear weapons, although its strategic nuclear forces regularly hold exercises. Tactical nuclear weapons include air bombs, warheads for short-range missiles and artillery munitions and are meant for use on a battlefield. They are less powerful than the massive warheads that arm intercontinental ballistic missiles and are intended to obliterate entire cities.\n\nThe Russian announcement was a warning to Ukraine's Western allies about becoming more deeply involved in the 2-year-old war. Some of Ukraine's Western partners have previously expressed concern that the conflict could spill beyond Ukraine into a war between NATO and Russia.\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron repeated last week that he doesn't exclude sending troops to Ukraine, and U.K. Foreign Secretary David Cameron said Kyiv's forces will be able to use British long-range weapons to strike targets inside Russia. Some other NATO countries providing weapons to Kyiv have balked at that possibility.\n\nThe Kremlin branded those comments as dangerous, heightening tension between Russia and NATO. The war already has placed significant strain on relations between Moscow and the West.\n\nKremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Monday that Macron's recent statement and other remarks by British and U.S. officials had prompted the nuclear drills.\n\n\"It's a new round of escalation,\" Peskov said, referring to what the Kremlin regarded as provocative statements. \"It's unprecedented and requires special attention and special measures.\"\n\nDmitry Medvedev, the deputy head of Russia's Security Council that's chaired by Putin, said in his typically hawkish fashion that the comments by Macron and Cameron risked pushing the nuclear-armed world toward a \"global catastrophe.\"\n\nIt wasn't the first time Europe's military support for Ukraine has prompted nuclear saber-rattling. In March 2023, after the U.K.'s decision to provide Ukraine with armor-piercing shells containing depleted uranium, Putin said he intends to deploy tactical nuclear weapons on the territory of Ukraine neighbor Belarus.\n\nThe ministry said the exercise is intended to \"increase the readiness of non-strategic nuclear forces to fulfill combat tasks\" and will be held on Putin's orders. The maneuvers will involve missile units of the Southern Military District along with the air force and the navy, it said.\n\nThe Russian announcement stirred little reaction in Ukraine, where the spokesman for the Military Intelligence agency, Andrii Yusov, said on national television: \"Nuclear blackmail is a usual practice of Putin's regime; it does not constitute major news.\"\n\nWestern officials have blamed Russia for threatening a wider war through provocative acts. NATO countries said last week they are deeply concerned by a campaign of hybrid activities on the military alliance's soil, accusing Moscow of being behind them and saying they represent a security threat.\n\nPeskov dismissed those claims as \"new, unfounded accusations leveled at our country.\"\n\nGermany said Monday it recalled its ambassador to Russia for a week of consultations in Berlin following an alleged computer hack of Chancellor Olaf Scholz's party.\n\nMeanwhile, Ukrainian drones hit two vehicles Monday in Russia's Belgorod region, killing six people and injuring 35 others, including two children, local authorities said. The area has been hit by Kyiv's forces in recent months.\n\nOne of the vehicles was a minibus carrying farm workers, Belgorod Gov. Vyacheslav Gladkov said.\n\nIt was not possible to independently confirm the report.\n\nWhile Ukraine's army is largely pinned down on the 1,000-kilometer (600-mile) front line due to a shortage of troops and ammunition after more than two years of fighting, it has used its long-range firepower to hit targets deep inside Russia.\n\nIn what has largely been a war of attrition, Russia also has relied heavily on long-range missile, artillery and drones to wreak damage on Ukraine.\n\nThe Kremlin's forces kept up their bombardment of Ukraine's power grid, with a nighttime Russian drone attack targeting energy infrastructure in Ukraine's northern region of Sumy. Multiple towns and villages in the region, including Sumy, lost power, regional authorities said.\n\nRussia attacked Ukrainian targets with 13 Shahed drones overnight, 12 of which were intercepted in the Sumy region, Ukraine's air force said.\n\nFollow AP's coverage of the war in Ukraine at https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine", "source": {"uri": "register-herald.com", "dataType": "news",

Patrick Ryder called it \"entirely inappropriate.\" NATO spokesperson Farah Dakhlallah termed Moscow's plans \"dangerous and irresponsible,\" and the European Union called on Russia to \"stop the escalation.\"\n\nLike so many pronouncements from Moscow, this one's timing might matter as much as its substance.\n\nThis week holds two red-letter days for Putin: his inauguration on Tuesday to yet another presidential term after an unsurprising landslide election win in March, coupled with Thursday's traditionally bombastic Victory Day celebrations commemorating the Soviet victory over the Nazis.\n\nIt is commonplace for nuclear powers such as Russia - or the United States, for that matter - to conduct checks of their weapons stockpiles. But declaring an explicit connection between exercises involving practice use of nuclear weapons and comments by adversarial governments about an ongoing conflict is an unusual diplomatic move.\n\nRussia's Defense Ministry said the planned tactical nuclear drills near Ukraine were intended to \"unconditionally ensure the territorial integrity and sovereignty of the Russian state.\"\n\nTactical nuclear weapons, as the term implies, are far smaller and less powerful than strategic nuclear armaments such as intercontinental ballistic missiles carrying nuclear payloads that could lay waste to large population centers. But nuclear threats, even veiled ones, have a way of grabbing everyone's attention.\n\nUnlike strategic nuclear weapons, battlefield nuclear munitions - which are relatively compact and easily transportable - are not subject to international arms agreements, and Russia's stockpiles are shrouded in secrecy. Such weapons can be deployed in the form of air-dropped bombs or short-range missiles.\n\nThe Pentagon closely monitors Russia's nuclear posture, and over the course of the Ukraine war, the Biden administration has reported no changes - even at times when Russian rhetoric suggests heightened tensions.\n\nWestern analysts say the latest comments typify a pattern that has taken hold since Putin's February 2022 full-scale invasion of Ukraine - that is, any perceived Western escalation is met with Kremlin threats of a nuclear nature, meant to raise the specter of all-out war between Russia and the U.S.-led coalition aiding Ukraine.\n\nAmong observers of this conflict, there's some difference of opinion as to whether these warnings are any more worrisome or significant than similar ones in the past - though many dismissed Monday's announcement as little more than bluster.\n\nAlexander Clarkson, a European studies lecturer at King's College in London, suggested that the development did not reflect some carefully calibrated policy messaging by Moscow. Russia's threshold for use of nuclear weapons, he wrote on the social platform X, is \"whatever Putin and a small inner circle of defense apparatchiks think it is when getting out of bed in the morning.\"\n\nHowever, the Kremlin announcement could give fresh ammunition to opponents of further Western aid to Ukraine. During a drawn-out congressional blockade of military assistance - finally resolved with approval last month of $61 billion in aid for Ukraine - far-right Republicans accused the Biden administration and Ukraine's other Western partners of playing with nuclear fire by continuing to support the government of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.\n\nUkraine was dismissive of the Russian announcement, saying it is part of a familiar playbook.\n\n\"We do not see anything new here,\" Andriy Yusov, a Ukrainian military intelligence spokesman, said on national television. \"Nuclear blackmail is a constant practice of Putin's regime.\"\n\nThe latest rhetorical flare-up over nuclear weapons comes at a time when Ukraine is undeniably struggling on the battlefield.\n\nA much-vaunted Ukrainian counteroffensive foundered in the summer. Now, as the weather improves, some of the country's allies - and even some Ukrainian defense officials - have voiced concerns about whether Russian forces might exploit weakness in Ukrainian fortifications and break through somewhere along the front lines.\n\nThe eastern Ukrainian town of Chasiv Yar is considered vulnerable to a Russian onslaught, although it sits on high ground, a position that is usually favorable to the defenders.\n\nFor the last several months, Russia has been rattled by a campaign of strikes within its border by Ukrainian forces. The United States has largely enjoined Ukraine to not use American-provided weaponry for such attacks, mainly aimed at Russian energy infrastructure. But close allies such as Britain are not placing similar constraints on Ukrainian forces.\n\nOn Monday, Britain's ambassador to Moscow, Nigel Casey, was summoned to the Russian Foreign Ministry for a formal protest after David Cameron, the former British prime minister who is now the foreign secretary, declared last week that Ukraine had the right to use British armaments to launch strikes inside Russia.\n\nCameron, who visited the Ukrainian capital last week, said then that Ukraine could decide how to use British-provided long-range weapons, not ruling out strikes on Russian territory. Moscow calls that an abrogation of previous British assurances to the contrary.\n\nEven more irksome to Russia than the Cameron comments were recent remarks by French President Emmanuel Macron, who publicly mused about the idea of sending European troops to Ukraine.\n\nKremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov called the British and French statements about such potential deployments \"unprecedented\" and a \"completely new round of escalation of tension.\"\n\nAsked Monday about reasons behind the tactical-nuclear-weapons exercise, he pointed in particular to Macron's remarks.\n\nAt the same time, Russia is characterizing its own sharply stepped-up production of conventional weapons such as artillery as necessary in light of actions by Ukraine's allies.\n\n\"We are now at the stage of open confrontation, which I hope will not result in a direct armed conflict,\" a senior Russian envoy, Ambassador-at-Large Grigory Mashkov, told the state news agency RIA.\n\nHe said Moscow would take steps to strengthen its defense capabilities, including bolstering missile stockpiles, \"in order to discourage any potential enemy from testing Russia's strength.\"\n\nIn recent days, Russia has also railed against North Atlantic Treaty Organization military exercises near its frontiers.\n\nOver the weekend, Foreign Ministry spokesman Maria Zakharova described the months-long maneuvers, set to run through this month, as a clear signal that the alliance is setting the stage for conflict with Russia. The drills, involving about 90,000 troops, represent NATO's biggest such exercise since the Cold War.", "source": {"uri": "miamiherald.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Miami Herald"}, "authors":

Some of Ukraine's Western partners have previously expressed concern that the conflict could spill beyond Ukraine into a war between NATO and Russia.\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron repeated last week that he doesn't exclude sending troops to Ukraine, and U.K. Foreign Secretary David Cameron said Kyiv's forces will be able to use British long-range weapons to strike targets inside Russia. Some other NATO countries providing weapons to Kyiv have balked at that possibility.\n\nThe Kremlin branded those comments as dangerous, heightening tension between Russia and NATO.

(Pavel Golovkin/POOL/AFP/Getty Images/TNS)\n\nPresident Vladimir Putin ordered Russia's military to carry out combat drills involving tactical nuclear weapons, ramping up his confrontation with the West just a day before his inauguration for a fifth term.\n\nThe army will carry out exercises in southern Russia to \"practice the preparation and use of non-strategic nuclear weapons,\" the Defense Ministry said in a Telegram statement on Monday. The drills involving air and naval forces are being held in response to \"provocative statements and threats made by certain Western officials,\" it said.\n\nPutin has at times brandished the threat of nuclear weapons since his February 2022 invasion of Ukraine, which borders southern Russia. In October, Russia rehearsed its ability to deliver a \"massive\" retaliatory nuclear strike, including with the launch of ballistic and cruise missiles.\n\nIn February, the Russian leader warned the North Atlantic Treaty Organization it risked a nuclear conflict if the alliance were to send troops to Ukraine.\n\nThe U.S. and Europe \"must understand that we also have weapons that can hit targets on their territory and that all this really threatens a conflict with the use of nuclear weapons, and therefore the destruction of civilization,\" Putin said in his annual state-of-the-nation address.\n\nThat threat came after French President Emmanuel Macron refused to rule out sending troops to Ukraine, even as the idea was rebuffed by other NATO allies. Macron on Monday is hosting Chinese President Xi Jinping, who despite growing diplomatic and economic ties with Russia, has warned Putin against the use of nuclear weapons.\n\nPutin later played down the threat that Russia and the West were heading toward a nuclear war, telling the state-run RIA Novosti news service on March 13 that there's never been a need to use tactical nuclear weapons in Ukraine and the thought had never crossed his mind.\n\nKremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov on Monday blamed Macron and U.K. Foreign Secretary David Cameron for sparking \"an unprecedented spike in tensions,\" RIA Novosti reported. Cameron last week said Ukraine had the right to use weapons it receives from Britain to strike Russia.\n\nThe Foreign Ministry in Moscow later summoned the U.K. and French ambassadors, ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said on her Telegram channel.\n\nThe Russian president plans to travel to China for talks with Xi next week. Putin's inauguration will take place at the Kremlin on Tuesday, extending his almost quarter-century rule over Russia for a further six years after he gained 87% support in a tightly controlled March election in which he faced no serious competition.\n\nRussia has been trying to advance against embattled Ukrainian forces this year, bolstered by an advantage in ammunition. Supplies of munitions and weapons are starting to flow again to Kyiv's troops after the US approved a long-delayed $61 billion aid package last month.", "source": {"uri": "americanmilitarynews.com",

They are less powerful than the massive warheads that arm intercontinental ballistic missiles and are intended to obliterate entire cities.\n\nThe Russian announcement appeared to be a warning to Ukraine's Western allies about becoming more deeply involved in the more than two-year war.\n\nSome of Ukraine's Western partners have previously expressed concern about stoking the conflict amid fears it could spill beyond Ukraine into a war between NATO and Russia.\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron repeated last week that he doesn't exclude sending troops to Ukraine, and UK Foreign Secretary David Cameron said Kyiv's forces will be able to use British long-range weapons to strike targets inside Russia.\n\nSome other NATO countries providing weapons to Kyiv have baulked at that possibility.\n\nThe Kremlin branded those comments as dangerous, heightening tension between Russia and NATO. The war already has placed significant strain on relations between Moscow and the West.\n\nKremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov on Monday said Macron's recent statement and other remarks by British and US officials had prompted the nuclear drills.\n\n\"It's a new round of escalation,\" Peskov said, referring to what the Kremlin regarded as provocative statements. \"It's unprecedented and requires special attention and special measures,\" Peskov told reporters.\n\nDmitry Medvedev, the deputy head of Russia's Security Council that's chaired by President Vladimir Putin, said in his typically hawkish fashion that the comments by Macron and Cameron risked pushing the nuclear-armed world toward a \"global catastrophe.\"\n\nIt wasn't the first time Europe's military support for Ukraine has irked Russian authorities and prompted nuclear sabre-rattling.\n\nIn March last year, after the UK government's decision to provide Ukraine with armour-piercing shells containing depleted uranium, Putin announced that he intended to deploy tactical nuclear weapons on the territory of Belarus.\n\nThe ministry said the exercise is intended to \"increase the readiness of non-strategic nuclear forces to fulfil combat tasks\" and will be held on Putin's orders. The manoeuvres will involve missile units of the Southern Military District along with the air force and the navy, it said.\n\nWestern officials have blamed Russia for threatening a wider war through provocative acts. NATO countries said last week they are deeply concerned by a campaign of hybrid activities on the military alliance's soil, accusing Russia of being behind them and saying they represent a threat to their security.\n\nPeskov dismissed those claims as \"new unfounded accusations levelled at our country.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Ukrainian drones hit two vehicles Monday in Russia's Belgorod region, killing six people and injuring 35 others, including two children, local authorities said, in an area frequently struck by Kyiv's forces in recent months.\n\nOne of the vehicles was a minibus that was carrying farm workers, Belgorod Governor Vyacheslav Gladkov said.\n\nNo other details were immediately available, and it was not possible to independently confirm the report from the border region.\n\nWhile Ukraine's army is largely pinned down on the 1,000-kilometer (600-mile) front line due to a shortage of troops and ammunition after more than two years of fighting, it has used its long-range firepower to hit targets deep inside Russia.\n\nThe apparent aim is to disrupt Russia's war logistics system by hitting oil refineries and depots and unnerve the Russian border regions.\n\nThe Belgorod region was a staging ground for Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. It has come under regular attack ever since Russian forces retreated there from northeastern Ukraine early in the war following a counteroffensive by Kyiv.\n\nIn what has largely been a war of attrition, Russia has also relied heavily on long-range missiles, artillery and drones to wreak damage on Ukraine.\n\nAt the end of last year, Belgorod officials said 25 people were killed, including five children, and more than 100 were injured in a Ukrainian attack, and regular rocket and drone strikes have continued since then.\n\nThe area can be reached by relatively simple and mobile weapons such as multiple rocket launchers from forests on the Ukrainian side.\n\nRussian authorities said in March they planned to evacuate about 9,000 children from the area because of continuous shelling after Putin said he wanted to create a buffer zone to help protect border regions.\n\nAlso, the Kremlin's forces kept up their bombardment of Ukraine's power grid, with a nighttime Russian drone attack targeting energy infrastructure in Ukraine's northern region of Sumy.\n\nMultiple towns and villages in the region, including Sumy, lost power, regional authorities said.\n\nRussia attacked Ukrainian targets with 13 Shahed drones overnight, 12 of which were intercepted in the Sumy region, Ukraine's air force said.", "source": {"uri": "republicworld.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

Following Russia's invasion of Ukraine in 2022, Putin has hinted at the potential use of tactical nuclear weapons against Western nations. However, Monday marked the first public announcement of such drills by Russia. According to Russia's defence ministry, the exercises will encompass preparations and deployment scenarios involving non-strategic nuclear weapons.\n\nTactical nuclear weapons, unlike their strategic counterparts, are designed for battlefield use and possess lower destructive capabilities, as reported by CNN. The decision to conduct these drills follows what the defence ministry describes as \"provocative statements and threats\" from Western officials, which Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov characterised as reaching \"unprecedented levels.\" French President Emmanuel Macron, in a recent interview with The Economist magazine, reiterated the possibility of deploying Western troops to Ukraine, underscoring the threat Russia poses to European security. As Putin Begins Another 6-year Term, He is Entering a New Era of Extraordinary Power in Russia\n\nSimilarly, British Foreign Secretary David Cameron, during a visit to Ukraine, emphasised Ukraine's right to defend itself using weapons supplied by the UK, condemning Russia's illegal invasion. The announcement of the drills comes amidst the passage of a long-delayed aid package by the United States for Kyiv, aimed at bolstering Ukraine's military capabilities against renewed Russian aggression. Russian forces have made significant territorial gains along Ukraine's eastern front in recent months, exploiting their manpower and ammunition advantage before the arrival of US aid.\n\nPutin's invocation of nuclear rhetoric often coincides with challenges to Russia's military objectives or increased international support for Ukraine. After Ukraine reclaimed substantial territories in late 2022, Putin acknowledged the protracted nature of the conflict and highlighted the growing threat of nuclear war. In February of the same year, Putin announced Russia's suspension of the New START treaty, citing the possibility of US nuclear testing as justification, according to CNN.\n\nWhile US President Joe Biden and State Department officials have sought to downplay concerns regarding Putin's nuclear threats, they remain vigilant in monitoring Russian actions. Responding to Russia's latest announcement, the Pentagon emphasised that there has been no discernible shift in Russia's strategic force posture. Maj Gen Patrick Ryder characterised Russia's decision as \"completely inappropriate\" and reflective of Russia's history of irresponsible rhetoric. Reports indicate that the US has been actively preparing for the possibility of Russia using tactical nuclear weapons against Ukraine since late 2022. Russian President Putin Lights Candle for Victims of Moscow Terror Attack\n\nIn the latest announcement, Russia's defence ministry revealed plans for upcoming exercises involving missile formations from the Southern Military District, incorporating aviation and naval forces. As tensions between Russia and the West continue to escalate, the international community remains on edge, cognizant of the potential ramifications of Putin's aggressive posture and nuclear brinkmanship, CNN reported.", "source": {"uri": "latestly.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "LatestLY"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tactical_nuclear_weapon",

Here's a look at tactical nuclear weapons and the part they play in the Kremlin's political messaging.\n\nWhat are tactical nuclear weapons?\n\nUnlike nuclear-tipped intercontinental ballistic missiles that can destroy entire cities, tactical nuclear weapons for use against troops on the battlefield are less powerful and can have a yield as small as about 1 kiloton. The U.S. bomb dropped on Hiroshima during World War II was 15 kilotons.\n\nSuch battlefield nuclear weapons -- aerial bombs, warheads for short-range missiles or artillery munitions -- can be very compact. Their small size allows them to be discreetly carried on a truck or plane.\n\nPeople are also reading...\n\nTwo arrested in Cedar Falls after police found bugs, feces in mobile home UPDATE WITH PHOTO: Police arrest naked man for blocking road in Waterloo Office manager at Cedar Falls business sentenced to prison for wire fraud Police investigating person with gunshot wound Man jumps in river to flee police, firefighters rescue him Summit CEO says company does not intend to comply with Bremer County's ordinance Medo's takes the place of Restoran Bosna in Waterloo with grand opening Friday Second David Schultz autopsy to proceed without body, spokesman calls out Facebook group College Men's Basketball: Coe College guard commits to UNI as grad transfer Iowa woman boarded freight train rather than drive home drunk UPDATE: Motorcyclist injured in Wednesday Cedar Falls crash has died High School Track & Field: Jesup star wants to be \"Jack of All Trades\" Cedar Falls likely to decline $10 million grant for Main Street project College Men's Basketball: UNI lands commitment from ACC transfer, former Top 100 prospect Historic Waterloo church again the target of theft\n\nUnlike strategic weapons, which have been subject to arms control agreements between Moscow and Washington, tactical weapons are not limited by such pacts, and Russia hasn't released their numbers or other specifics related to them.\n\nWhat has Putin said about nuclear weapons?\n\nSince launching the full-scale invasion of Ukraine on Feb. 24, 2022, Russian President Vladimir Putin has repeatedly reminded Western nations about Moscow's nuclear might in a bid to discourage them from increasing military support to Kyiv.\n\nEarly on in the war, Putin frequently referenced Moscow's nuclear arsenal by vowing repeatedly to use \"all means\" necessary to protect Russia. But he later toned down his statements as Ukraine's offensive last summer failed to reach its goals and Russia scored more gains on the battlefield.\n\nMoscow's defense doctrine envisages a nuclear response to an atomic strike or even an attack with conventional weapons that \"threaten the very existence of the Russian state.\" That vague wording led some pro-Kremlin Russian experts to urge Putin to sharpen it to force the West to take the warnings more seriously.\n\nPutin said last fall that he sees no reason for such a change.\n\n\"There is no situation in which anything would threaten Russian statehood and the existence of the Russian state,\" he said. \"I think that no person of sober mind and clear memory could have an idea to use nuclear weapons against Russia.\"\n\nWhy did Russia send nuclear weapons to Belarus?\n\nLast year, Russia moved some of its tactical nuclear weapons into the territory of Belarus, an ally that neighbors Ukraine and NATO members Poland, Latvia and Lithuania.\n\nBelarus' authoritarian president, Alexander Lukashenko, had long urged Moscow to station nuclear weapons in his country, which has close military ties with Russia and served as a staging ground for the war in Ukraine.\n\nBoth Putin and Lukashenko said that nuclear weapons deployment to Belarus was intended to counter perceived Western threats. Last year, Putin specifically linked the move to the U.K. government's decision to provide Ukraine with armor-piercing shells containing depleted uranium. Neither leader said how many were moved -- only that Soviet-era facilities in the country were readied to accommodate them, and that Belarusian pilots and missile crews were trained to use them. The weapons have remained under Russian military control.\n\nThe deployment of tactical nuclear weapons to Belarus, which has a 673-mile border with Ukraine, would allow Russian aircraft and missiles to reach potential targets there more easily and quickly, if Moscow decides to use them. It also extended Russia's capability to target several NATO allies in Eastern and Central Europe.\n\n0 Comments Love 0 Funny 0 Wow 0 Sad 0 Angry 0\n\nBe the first to know\n\nGet local news delivered

The reason that justifies these maneuvers are the \"threats\" of the West, the Ministry of Defense announced yesterday.\n\nThis training aims to \"maintain the readiness\" of the army to protect the country \"in response to the provocative statements and threats made by certain Western officials against Russia\", the department added. The exercises, which will take place on an unspecified date, will involve the air force, the navy and the forces of the Southern Military District, i.e. the troops with barracks closer to Ukraine and the Ukrainian regions which Russia considers its own and which it declared annexed in September 2022.\n\nWith the term \"threats\", Russia refers to statements from the West that raise the possibility of sending troops to Ukraine. Then Dmitri Peskov, press chief of the Russian president, specifically alluded to the statements of French President Emmanuel Macron about the possibility of sending troops to Ukraine, and those of the head of diplomacy of the United Kingdom, David Cameron , about the fact that Ukrainian troops have the right to use British weapons to attack Russian territory.\n\n\"They have talked about the disposition and even the intention to send armed contingents to Ukraine, that is, to put NATO soldiers in front of the Russian army. This is another step in the escalation of tension. It is unprecedented and requires special attention and special measures,\" the Kremlin spokesman added.\n\nYesterday Russia summoned the ambassadors of France and the United Kingdom. After Britain's Nigel Casey visited Smolensk Square, the Russian Foreign Ministry said Cameron's claims are an acknowledgment that London is now, in fact, part of the conflict. And he warned that, in response to attacks on Russian territory, British military installations could be targeted, both inside and outside Ukraine.\n\nOn the other hand, it is not the first time that Moscow wields the atomic weapon in its rhetoric. Since the conflict with Ukraine began in February 2022, ex-president Dmitri Medvedev, now deputy head of the Security Council, has regularly spoken about it. Putin has also hinted at it from time to time, although avoiding talking directly about nuclear weapons.\n\nThe United States and other Western countries have criticized these continued references to such destructive potential. \"This rhetoric is irresponsible and inappropriate for a nuclear power. And it is inconsistent with the way any nuclear power should speak publicly about the use of such weapons,\" said US State Department spokesman Matthew Miller.\n\nIn the summer of 2023, Russia deployed tactical nuclear weapons on the territory of Belarus, its closest ally and, like Russia, a neighbor of the European Union and NATO countries.\n\nPeskov has said that the use of nuclear weapons is a \"strictly defensive\" resource and that it is detailed in his nuclear doctrine. This doctrine indicates that they will be used in the event that Russia is attacked with weapons of mass destruction or in the event of an aggression with conventional weapons that \"threatens the very existence of the Russian state\".\n\nRussia already carried out nuclear exercises in October last year, after revoking the ratification of the Nuclear Test Ban Treaty (CTBT).", "source": {"uri":

Some other NATO countries providing weapons to Kyiv have balked at that possibility.\n\nThe Kremlin branded those comments as dangerous, heightening tension between Russia and NATO. The war already has placed significant strain on relations between Moscow and the West.\n\nKremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov on Monday said Macron's recent statement and other remarks by British and U.S. officials had prompted the nuclear drills.\n\n\"It's a new round of escalation,\" Peskov said, referring to what the Kremlin regarded as provocative statements. \"It's unprecedented and requires special attention and special measures,\" Peskov told reporters.\n\nDmitry Medvedev, the deputy head of Russia's Security Council that's chaired by President Vladimir Putin, said that the comments by Macron and Cameron risked pushing the nuclear-armed world toward a \"global catastrophe.\"\n\nAcademics and arms control negotiators have spent years arguing about how to define tactical nuclear weapons and few people know exactly how many Russia has because it is an area still shrouded in traditions of Cold War secrecy. The United States believes Russia has around 2,000 such working tactical warheads, 10 times more than Washington.\n\nThey are nuclear weapons used for specific tactical gains on the battlefield, though some can contain yields multiple times greater than the atomic bomb dropped by the U.S. on the Japanese city of Hiroshima in 1945, which was about 15 kilotonnes.\n\nThese warheads can be delivered via a variety of missiles, torpedoes and gravity bombs from naval, air or ground forces. They could even be simply driven into an area and detonated.\n\nIt wasn't the first time Europe's military support for Ukraine has irked Russian authorities and prompted nuclear sabre-rattling. In March of last year, after the U.K. government's decision to provide Ukraine with armour-piercing shells containing depleted uranium, Putin announced that he intended to deploy tactical nuclear weapons in Belarus.\n\nWestern officials have blamed Russia for threatening a wider war through provocative acts. NATO countries said last week they are deeply concerned by a campaign of hybrid activities on the military alliance's soil, accusing Russia of being behind them and saying they represent a threat to their security.\n\nPeskov dismissed those claims as \"new unfounded accusations levelled at our country.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Ukrainian drones hit two vehicles Monday in Russia's Belgorod region, killing six people and injuring 35 others, including two children, local authorities said, in an area frequently struck by Kyiv's forces in recent months.\n\nOne of the vehicles was a minibus that was carrying farm workers, Belgorod Gov. Vyacheslav Gladkov said.\n\nNo other details were immediately available, and it was not possible to independently confirm the report from the border region.\n\nWhile Ukraine's army is largely pinned down on the 1,000-kilometre front line due to a shortage of troops and ammunition after more than two years of fighting, it has used its long-range firepower to hit targets deep inside Russia. The apparent aim is to disrupt Russia's war logistics system by hitting oil refineries and depots, and unnerve the Russian border regions.\n\nThe Belgorod region was a staging ground for Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. It has come under regular attack ever since Russian forces retreated there from northeastern Ukraine early in the war following a counteroffensive by Kyiv.\n\nIn what has largely been a war of attrition, Russia has also relied heavily on long-range missile, artillery and drones to wreak damage on Ukraine.\n\nAlso, the Kremlin's forces kept up their bombardment of Ukraine's power grid, with a nighttime Russian drone attack targeting energy infrastructure in Ukraine's northern region of Sumy. Multiple towns and villages in the region, including Sumy, lost power, regional authorities said.\n\nRussia attacked Ukrainian targets with 13 Shahed drones overnight, 12 of which were intercepted in the Sumy region, Ukraine's air force said.", "source": {"uri": "cbc.ca", "dataType": "news", "title": "CBC News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moscow_Kremlin",

Here's a look at tactical nuclear weapons and the part they play in the Kremlin's political messaging.\n\nWhat are tactical nuclear weapons?\n\nUnlike nuclear-tipped intercontinental ballistic missiles that can destroy entire cities, tactical nuclear weapons for use against troops on the battlefield are less powerful and can have a yield as small as about 1 kiloton. The U.S. bomb dropped on Hiroshima during World War II was 15 kilotons.\n\nSuch battlefield nuclear weapons -- aerial bombs, warheads for short-range missiles or artillery munitions -- can be very compact. Their small size allows them to be discreetly carried on a truck or plane.\n\nPeople are also reading...

But he later toned down his statements as Ukraine's offensive last summer failed to reach its goals and Russia scored more gains on the battlefield.\n\nMoscow's defense doctrine envisages a nuclear response to an atomic strike or even an attack with conventional weapons that \"threaten the very existence of the Russian state.\" That vague wording led some pro-Kremlin Russian experts to urge Putin to sharpen it to force the West to take the warnings more seriously.\n\nPutin said last fall that he sees no reason for such a change.\n\n\"There is no situation in which anything would threaten Russian statehood and the existence of the Russian state,\" he said. \"I think that no person of sober mind and clear memory could have an idea to use nuclear weapons against Russia.\"\n\nWhy did Russia send nuclear weapons to Belarus?\n\nLast year, Russia moved some of its tactical nuclear weapons into the territory of Belarus, an ally that neighbors Ukraine and NATO members Poland, Latvia and Lithuania.\n\nBelarus' authoritarian president, Alexander Lukashenko, had long urged Moscow to station nuclear weapons in his country, which has close military ties with Russia and served as a staging ground for the war in Ukraine.\n\nBoth Putin and Lukashenko said that nuclear weapons deployment to Belarus was intended to counter perceived Western threats. Last year, Putin specifically linked the move to the U.K. government's decision to provide Ukraine with armor-piercing shells containing depleted uranium. Neither leader said how man were moved -- only that Soviet-era facilities in the country were readied to accommodate them, and that Belarusian pilots and missile crews were trained to use them. The weapons have remained under Russian military control.\n\nThe deployment of tactical nuclear weapons to Belarus, which has a 673-mile border with Ukraine, would allow Russian aircraft and missiles to reach potential targets there more easily and quickly, if Moscow decides to use them. It also extended Russia's capability to target several NATO allies in Eastern and Central Europe.\n\nTags Armed Forces Politics Weapons Atomic Physics Government Departments And Ministries Rocket

Tactical nuclear weapons have a lower yield compared to massive warheads that arm intercontinental ballistic missiles intended to obliterate entire cities.\n\nThe announcement appeared to be a warning to Ukraine's Western allies about becoming more deeply involved in the more than two-year war. Some of Ukraine's Western partners have previously expressed concern about stoking the war amid fears it could spill beyond Ukraine and into a conflict between NATO and Russia.\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron repeated last week that he doesn't exclude sending troops to Ukraine, and U.K. Foreign Secretary David Cameron said Kyiv's forces will be able to use British long-range weapons to strike targets inside Russia.\n\nThe Kremlin branded those comments as dangerous, heightening tension between Russia and NATO. The war already has placed significant strain on relations between Moscow and the West.\n\nIt wasn't the first time Europe's military support for Ukraine has irked Russian authorities and prompted nuclear sabre-rattling. In March last year, after the U.K. government's decision to provide Ukraine with armour-piercing shells containing depleted uranium, Putin announced that he intends to deploy tactical nuclear weapons on the territory of Belarus.\n\nTactical nuclear weapons include air bombs, warheads for short-range missiles and artillery munitions and are meant for use on the battlefield.\n\nThe ministry said the exercise is intended to \"increase the readiness of non-strategic nuclear forces to fulfill combat tasks\" and will be held on President Vladimir Putin's orders. The maneuvers will involve missile units of the Southern Military District along with the air force and the navy, it said.\n\nMeanwhile, Ukrainian drones hit two vehicles Monday in Russia's Belgorod region, killing six people and injuring 35 others, including two children, local authorities said, in an area frequently struck by Kyiv's forces in recent months.\n\nOne of the vehicles was a minibus that was carrying farm workers, Belgorod Gov. Vyacheslav Gladkov said.\n\nNo other details were immediately available, and it was not possible to independently confirm the report from the border region.\n\nWhile Ukraine's army is largely pinned down on the 1,000-kilometer (600-mile) front line due to a shortage of troops and ammunition after more than two years of fighting, it has used its long-range firepower to hit targets deep inside Russia. The apparent aim is to disrupt Russia's war logistics system by hitting oil refineries and depots, and unnerve the Russian border regions.\n\nThe Belgorod region was a staging ground for Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. It has come under regular attack ever since Russian forces retreated there from northeastern Ukraine early in the war following a counteroffensive by Kyiv.\n\nIn what has largely been a war of attrition, Russia has also relied heavily on long-range missile, artillery and drones to wreak damage on Ukraine.\n\nAt the end of last year, Belgorod officials said 25 people were killed, including five children, and more than 100 were injured in a Ukrainian attack, and regular rocket and drone strikes have continued since then. The area can be reached by relatively simple and mobile weapons such as multiple rocket launchers from forests on the Ukrainian side.\n\nRussian authorities said in March they planned to evacuate about 9,000 children from the area because of continuous shelling, after Putin said he wanted to create a buffer zone to help protect border regions.\n\nAlso, the Kremlin's forces kept up their bombardment of Ukraine's power grid, with a nighttime Russian drone attack targeting energy infrastructure in Ukraine's northern region of Sumy. Multiple towns and villages in the region, including Sumy, lost power, regional authorities said.\n\nRussia attacked Ukrainian targets with 13 Shahed drones overnight, 12 of which were intercepted in the Sumy region, Ukraine's air force said.\n\n(With Inputs From International Agencies)\n\nComments", "source": {"uri": "indiandefensenews.in", "dataType": "news", "title": "indiandefensenews.in"},

Belarus' defence ministry said the inspection will test the 'planning, preparation and use of strikes with tactical nuclear warheads' and involve a squadron of Su-25 aircraft. While Belarus doesn't own any nuclear weapons, it agreed last year to host Russian tactical warheads on its soil, amid rising tensions in Europe over Ukraine. Just yesterday, Putin ordered troops based near Ukraine to practice nuclear weapons scenarios in a bid to 'deter' adversaries following perceived threats of escalation from Western leaders. Military drills in the undisclosed 'near future' will include practice for the preparation and deployment of non-strategic nuclear weapons, Russia's defense ministry claimed.\n\nThe ministry said the exercises would be carried out 'in response to provocative statements and threats by certain Western officials against the Russian Federation', the Kremlin citing threats to deploy troops in Ukraine. 'It's obvious we are talking about statements from Mr. Macron and statements from British representatives,' Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said when asked by reporters what had prompted the drills, adding: 'This is a completely new round of escalating tensions. It is unprecedented and requires special measures.' A Russian diplomat said Moscow would have to increase its entire missile arsenal as a deterrent following what was framed as the worst breakdown in relations since the 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis. 'We are now at the stage of open confrontation, which, I hope, will not result in a direct armed conflict,' Russian Ambassador-at-Large Grigory Mashkov told the state RIA news agency.\n\nMashkov added that it will now be necessary to take 'further steps to strengthen the country's defense capability, including building up the missile arsenal, in order to discourage any potential enemy from testing Russia's strength.' He added that Russia was already doing a lot in this area but that more was needed given what he said was the growing threat from the West and the technological advances in most types of missiles, from tactical to inter-continental. According to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute, Russia is set to spend 7.1% of its gross domestic product (GDP) on the military, or more than a third of total government spending, in 2024. Ramping up drills, Putin reportedly told Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu to prepare missile firing exercises in the near future 'in order to increase the readiness of non-strategic nuclear forces to fulfill combat missions'.\n\nTroops from the Southern Military District, which borders Ukraine and includes the occupied Ukrainian territories will take part in the drills, the ministry said. Close Putin ally and former President Dmitry Medvedev said today on Telegram that 'the number of scoundrels among the Western political elite calling for sending their troops to a non-existent country is expanding'. 'Now it includes representatives of the US Congress, French and British leadership, and individual madmen from the Baltic states and Poland...' 'Sending your troops to the territory of...Ukraine will entail the direct entry of their countries into the war, to which we will have to respond. 'And, alas, not in the territory of... Ukraine. In this case, none of them will be able to hide either on Capitol Hill, or in the Elysee Palace, or in 10 Downing Street. 'A world catastrophe will come.'\n\nAs part of a new drive of 'deterrence', Russia is also understood to have commissioned a notable Russian political scientist to explore possible avenues for pushing back what is perceived as an encroaching West including nuclear deterrence. Sergey Karganov, a longtime advisor to Putin and his predecessor Boris Yeltsin, has reportedly been commissioned to carry out eight studies into topics including the 'theory and practice of nuclear deterrence' within the context of Russia's current political climate, and how Russia might go about 'developing' such a deterrence with Russia, China, India and Pakistan. The 71-year-old, who currently heads the Council for Foreign and Defense Policy, is notable for his post-USSR doctrine suggesting Russia should aim to leverage Russian minorities living nearby to spread and maintain its influence in former dominions. Last year, he called for Russia to launch nuclear strikes on Europe as a pre-emptive measure to resolve the conflict in Ukraine and restore the perceived authority of the nuclear threat.\n\nThe escalation of Russian nuclear rhetoric follows weeks of more pronounced threats from the West to intervene in the conflict in Ukraine. French President Emmanuel Macron recently told The Economist he 'absolutely' stands by pledges to put boots on the ground in Ukraine if push comes to shove. 'As I said, I'm not ruling anything out, because we are facing someone who is not ruling anything out,' he told the magazine in an interview published last Thursday. Macron has also called on Europe to reduce reliance on the United States and develop independent capacity to face down hostile foreign actors. In February, Putin warned Macron that if France were to send any troops to Ukraine, they would meet the same fate as Napoleon Bonaparte's Grand Arm\u00e9e, whose 1812 invasion ended in staggering defeat and huge casualties.\n\nBritish Foreign Secretary Lord Cameron also received condemnation from Russia after telling reporters in Kyiv that Ukraine could use British-supplied missiles as they saw fit, including firing into Russian territory and lifting a previously held requirement only to fire Storm Shadow missiles within Ukraine. The Kremlin called Lord Cameron's statement a 'direct escalation' of the war in Ukraine deemed 'dangerous to European security'. Vladimir Putin's spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said comments made on Friday could imperil the entire system of European security architecture - and namechecked Macron while condemning perceived threats from the West. 'The statement [from Macron] is very important and very dangerous,' Peskov told reporters on Friday. Macron 'continues to constantly talk about the possibility of direct involvement on the ground in the conflict around Ukraine. This is a very dangerous trend,' he added. Peskov said the recent statements by Macron and Cameron 'potentially pose a danger to European security, to the entire European security architecture'.\n\n'We see a dangerous tendency towards escalation in official statements. This is raising our concern,' he added. US House Leader Hakeem Jeffries added to Russian fears with comments in a CBS interview this week that if Ukraine falls 'there's a significant likelihood that America will have to get into the conflict -- not simply with our money, but with our servicewomen and our servicemen'. Experts following developments in the war suggest Macron's comments reflect a new approach of 'strategic ambiguity' mirroring threats from Russia. Vlad \u015eutea, founder and lead analyst at early warning and threatcasting group T-Intelligence, told MailOnline: 'Macron is one of the few Western European leaders to understand the value of strategic ambiguity. 'Putin doesn't take anything off the table, neither should we. And that includes sending troops, in whichever capacity that is feasible.' 'Chances are, Macron and other European leaders have outlined implicit thresholds that could prompt direct Western intervention.\n\n'A scenario warranting action could entail a collapse of the front in the East, leading to further Russian encroachment, posing a threat to cities like Kyiv, Odesa, and, albeit less likely, western regions such as Lviv. 'Our reading is that the intra-NATO discussions on this topic have not been as hypothetical as believed. 'One should remember that France also recently signed a security agreement with Moldova and has a robust presence in Romania as part of the NATO battle group that will be elevated to brigade-level in 2025.' He suggested that criticism of Macron, claiming the comments could invite nuclear Armageddon, played into the Kremlin's hands. 'This appears to be typical pro-Russian scaremongering, aimed at dissuading bold Western action,' he said. 'The true irresponsibility lies in shying away from confronting Russia.' 'Weakness invites aggression and this is particularly relevant when talking about Putin's Russia.'\n\nAmid rising tensions, Macron is today to host Chinese leader Xi Jinping for a state visit in a bid to persuade him to switch positions over Russia's invasion of Ukraine. In Xi's first visit to Europe since 2019, he is also expected to give talks in Serbia and Hungary. President Xi has said he wants to find peace in Ukraine but has been a careful ally to Putin and is expected to host the Russian leader in Beijing next month. In an op-ed for Le Figaro daily, Xi recently said that he wanted to work with the international community to find ways to solve the conflict sparked by Russia's invasion of Ukraine, while emphasizing that China was 'neither a party nor a participant'. 'We hope that peace and stability will return quickly to Europe, and intend to work with France and the entire international community to find good paths to resolve the crisis,' he wrote.\n\nWant more stories like this from the Daily Mail?

Tactical nuclear weapons have a lower yield compared to massive warheads that arm intercontinental ballistic missiles intended to obliterate entire cities.\n\nThe announcement appeared to be a warning to Ukraine's Western allies about becoming more deeply involved in the more than two-year war. Some of Ukraine's Western partners have previously expressed concern about stoking the war amid fears it could spill beyond Ukraine and into a conflict between Nato and Russia.\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron repeated last week that he doesn't exclude sending troops to Ukraine, and UK Foreign Secretary David Cameron said Kyiv's forces will be able to use British long-range weapons to strike targets inside Russia.\n\nThe Kremlin branded those comments as dangerous, heightening tension between Russia and Nato. The war already has placed significant strain on relations between Moscow and the West.\n\nIt wasn't the first time Europe's military support for Ukraine has irked Russian authorities and prompted nuclear sabre-rattling. In March last year, after the UK government's decision to provide Ukraine with armour-piercing shells containing depleted uranium, Putin announced that he intends to deploy tactical nuclear weapons on the territory of Belarus.\n\nTactical nuclear weapons include air bombs, warheads for short-range missiles and artillery munitions and are meant for use on the battlefield.\n\nThe ministry said the exercise is intended to \"increase the readiness of non-strategic nuclear forces to fulfil combat tasks\" and will be held on President Vladimir Putin's orders. The manoeuvres will involve missile units of the Southern Military District along with the air force and the navy, it said.\n\nMeanwhile, Ukrainian drones hit two vehicles on Monday in Russia's Belgorod region, killing six people and injuring 35 others, including two children, local authorities said, in an area frequently struck by Kyiv's forces in recent months.\n\nOne of the vehicles was a minibus that was carrying farm workers, Belgorod Governor Vyacheslav Gladkov said.\n\nNo other details were immediately available, and it was not possible to independently confirm the report from the border region.\n\nWhile Ukraine's army is largely pinned down on the 1000-kilometre front line due to a shortage of troops and ammunition after more than two years of fighting, it has used its long-range firepower to hit targets deep inside Russia. The apparent aim is to disrupt Russia's war logistics system by hitting oil refineries and depots, and unnerve the Russian border regions.\n\nThe Belgorod region was a staging ground for Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. It has come under regular attack ever since Russian forces retreated there from northeastern Ukraine early in the war following a counteroffensive by Kyiv.\n\nIn what has largely been a war of attrition, Russia has also relied heavily on long-range missiles, artillery and drones to wreak damage on Ukraine.\n\nAt the end of last year, Belgorod officials said 25 people were killed, including five children, and more than 100 were injured in a Ukrainian attack, and regular rocket and drone strikes have continued since then. The area can be reached by relatively simple and mobile weapons such as multiple rocket launchers from forests on the Ukrainian side.\n\nRussian authorities said in March they planned to evacuate about 9000 children from the area because of continuous shelling, after Putin said he wanted to create a buffer zone to help protect border regions.\n\nAlso, the Kremlin's forces kept up their bombardment of Ukraine's power grid, with a nighttime Russian drone attack targeting energy infrastructure in Ukraine's northern region of Sumy. Several towns and villages in the region, including Sumy, lost power, regional authorities said.\n\nRussia attacked Ukrainian targets with 13 Shahed drones overnight, 12 of which were intercepted in the Sumy region, Ukraine's air force said.", "source": {"uri": "nzherald.co.nz", "dataType": "news", "title": "NZ Herald"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

In a series of statements from Russian military spokespeople, senior diplomats, and the Kremlin's press secretary, Moscow has explained the unscheduled exercises as a response to Western rhetoric about military aid to Ukraine, framing the expanded assistance as an intervention that directly endangers (internationally recognized) Russian territory and risks spiraling out of control. This first official nuclear threat since February 2022 to punish the West for supporting Ukraine is likely the Kremlin's attempt to restore its faded \"red lines\" in the war. Meduza explains how the nuke drills are militarily unremarkable but might nevertheless be an effective deterrent amid Western concerns about uncontrolled escalation.\n\nThis refers to Russia's (typically low-yield) nuclear warheads and their short- and medium-range delivery systems, which haven't been formally limited under any arms control agreement since the U.S. withdrew from the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty in 2019. While Russia's nuclear triad of ICBM-equipped submarines, heavy bombers, and strategic missile forces stands at permanent readiness (in case of attack), its non-strategic nuclear forces aren't on constant combat duty, and using these weapons requires transfers from warehouses, installations, and so on, which is what the military practices in exercises like those recently announced.\n\nWhile not uncommon, drilling to use tactical nuclear weapons is a complex technical procedure that demands the coordinated effort of a large number of officers and their staff to mount the specialized warheads on carriers and prepare them for use. Before Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine, the military practiced these drills regularly (for example, in missile brigades equipped with Iskander systems). The Southern Military District will be responsible for carrying out Russia's upcoming exercise. The Russian army has also periodically test-fired missiles (including potential carriers of tactical nuclear weapons) at a range located in the abandoned mining town of Kholmogory-Yu in the Komi Republic.\n\nDespite the differences from strategic forces, using a tactical nuclear weapon is still subject to Russia's official nuclear doctrine, which stipulates the conditions of a direct threat to the nation's sovereignty, the country's integrity, or a first strike by an enemy against Russia's own strategic forces.\n\nRussia's upcoming exercise is distinct because the Kremlin is officially justifying the unscheduled drill as a response to NATO members sending more advanced, longer-range weapons like ATACMS and F-16s, to comments from Western leaders about Kyiv's right to attack targets inside Russia, and to rhetoric that entertains deploying Western troops to Ukraine. Though Zelensky adviser Mykhailo Podolyak recently told Meduza that Washington still restricts how Ukraine uses its U.S.-supplied ATACMS, Moscow is clearly concerned that Kyiv could fire such weaponry at targets well inside Russia.\n\nThe most effective use of long-range missiles against Russia would be strikes on the airfields used to launch attacks against Ukraine. In recent months, Russian gains on the battlefield owe much to the increased use of guided glide bombs operating beyond the reach of most Ukrainian air defense systems. Almost all the airbases used for these strikes are located on internationally recognized Russian soil. To continue its successful use of guided glide bombs, Moscow must protect these airfields from long-range Ukrainian counterattacks.\n\nWestern supplies of F-16 fighter jets to Ukraine are one form of military aid that seemed inconceivable earlier in the war due to Western fears of uncontrolled escalation. Immediately after launching its full-scale invasion of Ukraine, Russia organized large-scale exercises of its strategic forces, declaring that the drills were a warning to the West. President Putin subsequently hinted on multiple occasions that he might use a tactical nuclear weapon in Ukraine if he feels Russia's vital national security is at risk.\n\nOver the past two years, however, the Kremlin has failed to maintain its red lines, as NATO members have sent ever-more sophisticated and lethal equipment to defend against Russia's invasion -- from tanks and artillery to ballistic missiles for HIMARS multiple rocket launch systems with a range of up to 90 kilometers (56 miles) and cruise missiles with a range of up to 300 kilometers (186 miles). Moscow's inability to deter Kyiv's allies after each new weapon arrives perhaps culminated in French President Emmanuel Macron saying openly in March 2024 that the West should respect no red lines when it comes to aiding Ukraine.\n\nPolitical scientists like Sergey Karaganov and Dmitry Trenin have argued that Moscow's current threshold for using nuclear weapons is \"unacceptably high.\" While decision-makers in the Kremlin have rejected the idea of carrying out a tactical nuclear strike to restore respect for its red lines, Moscow nevertheless struggles to hold NATO members to its hard limits in their intervention in Ukraine. Without rewriting Russia's nuclear doctrine, the Kremlin is now signaling that it might consider attacks deeper inside Russian territory to qualify as an existing justification for a retaliatory strike using tactical nuclear weapons.\n\nPavel Podvig, a nuclear arms expert at the U.N. Institute for Disarmament Research, says Russia's drills are, \"of course, a signal,\" and he urges the world to avoid \"getting sucked into this.\" \"The right response is to double down on 'nuclear threats are inadmissible' and rally everyone around that,\" he wrote on May 6.\n\nYet, Moscow's latest nuclear threats come at a time when they might achieve results. Western commitments to Ukraine have been stretched thin after more than two years of war, and many politicians in Europe and the United States still fear that military aid to Kyiv might eventually cause an escalation spiral. If these concerns keep limits in place on how Ukraine uses its Western-supplied weapons, the equipment will be much less effective against Russia's invasion.", "source": {"uri": "meduza.io",

They are less powerful than the strategic weapons -- massive warheads that arm intercontinental ballistic missiles and are intended to obliterate entire cities.\n\nThe Russian announcement was a warning to Ukraine's western allies about becoming more deeply engaged in the two-year-old war, where the Kremlin's forces have gained an upper hand amid Ukraine's shortage of manpower and weapons.\n\nSome of Ukraine's western partners have previously expressed concern that the conflict could spill beyond Ukraine into a war between Nato and Russia.\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron repeated last week that he does not exclude sending troops to Ukraine, and UK Foreign Secretary Lord David Cameron said Kyiv's forces will be able to use British long-range weapons to strike targets inside Russia.\n\nSome other Nato countries providing weapons to Kyiv have baulked at that possibility.\n\nThe Kremlin branded those comments as dangerous, heightening tension between Russia and Nato. The war already has placed significant strain on relations between Moscow and the West.\n\nKremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said on Monday that Mr Macron's recent statement and other remarks by British and US officials had prompted the nuclear drills.\n\n\"It's a new round of escalation,\" he said, referring to what the Kremlin regarded as provocative statements. \"It's unprecedented and requires special attention and special measures.\"\n\nRussia's Foreign Ministry summoned the French and British ambassadors, and urged the British ambassador \"to think about the inevitable catastrophic consequences of such hostile steps from London\".\n\nSweden's foreign minister Tobias Billstrom said the nuclear exercises \"contribute to increasing instability\".\n\n\"In the current security situation, Russia's actions may be considered particularly irresponsible and reckless,\" he told Swedish news agency TT.\n\nDmitry Medvedev, the deputy head of Russia's Security Council which is chaired by Mr Putin, said the comments by Mr Macron and Lord Cameron risked pushing the nuclear-armed world towards a \"global catastrophe\".\n\nIn March 2023, after the UK's decision to provide Ukraine with armour-piercing shells containing depleted uranium, Mr Putin said he intended to deploy tactical nuclear weapons on the territory of Ukraine's neighbour Belarus.\n\nThe ministry said the latest exercise is intended to \"increase the readiness of non-strategic nuclear forces to fulfil combat tasks\" and will be held on Mr Putin's orders. The manoeuvres will involve missile units of the Southern Military District along with the air force and the navy, it added.\n\nThe Russian announcement stirred little reaction in Ukraine, where the spokesman for the Military Intelligence agency, Andrii Yusov, said on national television: \"Nuclear blackmail is a usual practice of Putin's regime; it does not constitute major news.\"\n\nWestern officials have blamed Russia for threatening a wider war through provocative acts. Nato countries said last week they were deeply concerned by a campaign of hybrid activities on the military alliance's soil, accusing Moscow of being behind them and saying they represent a security threat.\n\nMr Peskov dismissed those claims as \"new, unfounded accusations levelled at our country\".\n\nGermany said on Monday it had recalled its ambassador to Russia for a week of consultations in Berlin after an alleged computer hack of Chancellor Olaf Scholz's party.\n\nMeanwhile, Ukrainian drones hit two vehicles on Monday in Russia's Belgorod region, killing six people and injuring 35 others, including two children, local authorities said. The area has been hit by Kyiv's forces in recent months.\n\nOne of the vehicles was a minibus carrying farm workers, Belgorod governor Vyacheslav Gladkov said.", "source": {"uri": "todayheadline.co",

They are less powerful than the strategic weapons -- massive warheads that arm intercontinental ballistic missiles and are intended to obliterate entire cities.\n\nThe Russian announcement was a warning to Ukraine's western allies about becoming more deeply engaged in the two-year-old war, where the Kremlin's forces have gained an upper hand amid Ukraine's shortage of manpower and weapons.\n\nSome of Ukraine's western partners have previously expressed concern that the conflict could spill beyond Ukraine into a war between Nato and Russia.\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron repeated last week that he does not exclude sending troops to Ukraine, and UK Foreign Secretary Lord David Cameron said Kyiv's forces will be able to use British long-range weapons to strike targets inside Russia.\n\nSome other Nato countries providing weapons to Kyiv have baulked at that possibility.\n\nThe Kremlin branded those comments as dangerous, heightening tension between Russia and Nato. The war already has placed significant strain on relations between Moscow and the West.\n\nKremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said on Monday that Mr Macron's recent statement and other remarks by British and US officials had prompted the nuclear drills.\n\n\"It's a new round of escalation,\" he said, referring to what the Kremlin regarded as provocative statements. \"It's unprecedented and requires special attention and special measures.\"\n\nRussia's Foreign Ministry summoned the French and British ambassadors, and urged the British ambassador \"to think about the inevitable catastrophic consequences of such hostile steps from London\".\n\nSweden's foreign minister Tobias Billstrom said the nuclear exercises \"contribute to increasing instability\".\n\n\"In the current security situation, Russia's actions may be considered particularly irresponsible and reckless,\" he told Swedish news agency TT.\n\nDmitry Medvedev, the deputy head of Russia's Security Council which is chaired by Mr Putin, said the comments by Mr Macron and Lord Cameron risked pushing the nuclear-armed world towards a \"global catastrophe\".\n\nIn March 2023, after the UK's decision to provide Ukraine with armour-piercing shells containing depleted uranium, Mr Putin said he intended to deploy tactical nuclear weapons on the territory of Ukraine's neighbour Belarus.\n\nThe ministry said the latest exercise is intended to \"increase the readiness of non-strategic nuclear forces to fulfil combat tasks\" and will be held on Mr Putin's orders. The manoeuvres will involve missile units of the Southern Military District along with the air force and the navy, it added.\n\nThe Russian announcement stirred little reaction in Ukraine, where the spokesman for the Military Intelligence agency, Andrii Yusov, said on national television: \"Nuclear blackmail is a usual practice of Putin's regime; it does not constitute major news.\"\n\nWestern officials have blamed Russia for threatening a wider war through provocative acts. Nato countries said last week they were deeply concerned by a campaign of hybrid activities on the military alliance's soil, accusing Moscow of being behind them and saying they represent a security threat.\n\nMr Peskov dismissed those claims as \"new, unfounded accusations levelled at our country\".\n\nGermany said on Monday it had recalled its ambassador to Russia for a week of consultations in Berlin after an alleged computer hack of Chancellor Olaf Scholz's party.\n\nMeanwhile, Ukrainian drones hit two vehicles on Monday in Russia's Belgorod region, killing six people and injuring 35 others, including two children, local authorities said. The area has been hit by Kyiv's forces in recent months.\n\nOne of the vehicles was a minibus carrying farm workers, Belgorod governor Vyacheslav Gladkov said.", "source": {"uri": "yorkpress.co.uk",

Vyacheslav Gladkov said.\n\nNo other details were immediately available, and it was not possible to independently confirm the report from the border region.\n\nWhile Ukraine's army is largely pinned down on the 1,000-kilometer (600-mile) front line due to a shortage of troops and ammunition after more than two years of fighting, it has used its long-range firepower to hit targets deep inside Russia. The apparent aim is to disrupt Russia's war logistics system by hitting oil refineries and depots, and unnerve the Russian border regions.\n\nThe Belgorod region was a staging ground for Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. It has come under regular attack ever since Russian forces retreated there from northeastern Ukraine early in the war following a counteroffensive by Kyiv.\n\nIn what has largely been a war of attrition, Russia has also relied heavily on long-range missile, artillery and drones to wreak damage on Ukraine.\n\nAt the end of last year, Belgorod officials said 25 people were killed, including five children, and more than 100 were injured in a Ukrainian attack, and regular rocket and drone strikes have continued since then. The area can be reached by relatively simple and mobile weapons such as multiple rocket launchers from forests on the Ukrainian side.\n\nRussian authorities said in March they planned to evacuate about 9,000 children from the area because of continuous shelling, after Putin said he wanted to create a buffer zone to help protect border regions.\n\n___\n\nFollow AP's coverage of the war in

They are less powerful than the strategic weapons -- massive warheads that arm intercontinental ballistic missiles and are intended to obliterate entire cities.\n\nThe Russian announcement was a warning to Ukraine's western allies about becoming more deeply engaged in the two-year-old war, where the Kremlin's forces have gained an upper hand amid Ukraine's shortage of manpower and weapons.\n\nSome of Ukraine's western partners have previously expressed concern that the conflict could spill beyond Ukraine into a war between Nato and Russia.\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron repeated last week that he does not exclude sending troops to Ukraine, and UK Foreign Secretary Lord David Cameron said Kyiv's forces will be able to use British long-range weapons to strike targets inside Russia.\n\nSome other Nato countries providing weapons to Kyiv have baulked at that possibility.\n\nThe Kremlin branded those comments as dangerous, heightening tension between Russia and Nato. The war already has placed significant strain on relations between Moscow and the West.\n\nKremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said on Monday that Mr Macron's recent statement and other remarks by British and US officials had prompted the nuclear drills.\n\n\"It's a new round of escalation,\" he said, referring to what the Kremlin regarded as provocative statements. \"It's unprecedented and requires special attention and special measures.\"\n\nRussia's Foreign Ministry summoned the French and British ambassadors, and urged the British ambassador \"to think about the inevitable catastrophic consequences of such hostile steps from London\".\n\nSweden's foreign minister Tobias Billstrom said the nuclear exercises \"contribute to increasing instability\".\n\n\"In the current security situation, Russia's actions may be considered particularly irresponsible and reckless,\" he told Swedish news agency TT.\n\nDmitry Medvedev, the deputy head of Russia's Security Council which is chaired by Mr Putin, said the comments by Mr Macron and Lord Cameron risked pushing the nuclear-armed world towards a \"global catastrophe\".\n\nIn March 2023, after the UK's decision to provide Ukraine with armour-piercing shells containing depleted uranium, Mr Putin said he intended to deploy tactical nuclear weapons on the territory of Ukraine's neighbour Belarus.\n\nThe ministry said the latest exercise is intended to \"increase the readiness of non-strategic nuclear forces to fulfil combat tasks\" and will be held on Mr Putin's orders. The manoeuvres will involve missile units of the Southern Military District along with the air force and the navy, it added.\n\nThe Russian announcement stirred little reaction in Ukraine, where the spokesman for the Military Intelligence agency, Andrii Yusov, said on national television: \"Nuclear blackmail is a usual practice of Putin's regime; it does not constitute major news.\"\n\nWestern officials have blamed Russia for threatening a wider war through provocative acts. Nato countries said last week they were deeply concerned by a campaign of hybrid activities on the military alliance's soil, accusing Moscow of being behind them and saying they represent a security threat.\n\nMr Peskov dismissed those claims as \"new, unfounded accusations levelled at our country\".\n\nGermany said on Monday it had recalled its ambassador to Russia for a week of consultations in Berlin after an alleged computer hack of Chancellor Olaf Scholz's party.\n\nMeanwhile, Ukrainian drones hit two vehicles on Monday in Russia's Belgorod region, killing six people and injuring 35 others, including two children, local authorities said. The area has been hit by Kyiv's forces in recent months.\n\nOne of the vehicles was a minibus carrying farm workers, Belgorod governor Vyacheslav Gladkov said.", "source": {"uri":

Tactical weapons are usually smaller warheads, that are less powerful and intended for use against battlefield targets instead of population centers. A recent State Department report said the U.S. no longer uses the term \"tactical nuclear weapons\" and called the word nonstrategic a \"misnomer\" as \"the use of a nuclear weapon would fundamentally change the nature of a conflict.\" In the past, President Joe Biden has warned Russia against deploying tactical nuclear weapons in Ukraine.\n\nKey Background\n\nDuring his annual \"State of the Nation\" address in late February, Putin threatened to launch nuclear strikes against Western nations if any of them attempted to militarily intervene in Ukraine. The angry threats -- Putin's most explicit since the start of the Ukraine invasion -- followed French President Emmanuel Macron's remarks that the deployment of NATO ground troops in Ukraine cannot be \"ruled out.\" Putin warned a nuclear war would result in the \"destruction of civilization\" as he lashed out against Western leaders saying \"they think it's all some kind of cartoon for them.\" In an interview a month later, Putin said Russia's nuclear armament is \"constantly in a state of combat readiness\" and he would use them if anyone was threatening the \"existence of the Russian state, harming our sovereignty and independence.\"\n\nFurther Reading\n\nPutin Says Russia Is Ready For Nuclear War If Its Existence Or Independence Is Threatened (Forbes)\n\nPutin Warns Of Nuclear Strikes Against West If Nations Intervene Militarily In Ukraine (Forbes)\n\nFollow me on Twitter.

They are less powerful than the strategic weapons -- massive warheads that arm intercontinental ballistic missiles and are intended to obliterate entire cities.\n\nThe Russian announcement was a warning to Ukraine's western allies about becoming more deeply engaged in the two-year-old war, where the Kremlin's forces have gained an upper hand amid Ukraine's shortage of manpower and weapons.\n\nSome of Ukraine's western partners have previously expressed concern that the conflict could spill beyond Ukraine into a war between Nato and Russia.\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron repeated last week that he does not exclude sending troops to Ukraine, and UK Foreign Secretary Lord David Cameron said Kyiv's forces will be able to use British long-range weapons to strike targets inside Russia.\n\nSome other Nato countries providing weapons to Kyiv have baulked at that possibility.\n\nKremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said on Monday that Mr Macron's recent statement and other remarks by British and US officials had prompted the nuclear drills.\n\n\"It's a new round of escalation,\" he said, referring to what the Kremlin regarded as provocative statements. \"It's unprecedented and requires special attention and special measures.\"\n\nRussia's Foreign Ministry summoned the French and British ambassadors, and urged the British ambassador \"to think about the inevitable catastrophic consequences of such hostile steps from London\".\n\nSweden's foreign minister Tobias Billstrom said the nuclear exercises \"contribute to increasing instability\".\n\n\"In the current security situation, Russia's actions may be considered particularly irresponsible and reckless,\" he told Swedish news agency TT.\n\nDmitry Medvedev, the deputy head of Russia's Security Council which is chaired by Mr Putin, said the comments by Mr Macron and Lord Cameron risked pushing the nuclear-armed world towards a \"global catastrophe\".\n\nIn March 2023, after the UK's decision to provide Ukraine with armour-piercing shells containing depleted uranium, Mr Putin said he intended to deploy tactical nuclear weapons on the territory of Ukraine's neighbour Belarus.\n\nThe Russian announcement stirred little reaction in Ukraine, where the spokesman for the Military Intelligence agency, Andrii Yusov, said on national television: \"Nuclear blackmail is a usual practice of Putin's regime; it does not constitute major news.\"\n\nWestern officials have blamed Russia for threatening a wider war through provocative acts. Nato countries said last week they were deeply concerned by a campaign of hybrid activities on the military alliance's soil, accusing Moscow of being behind them and saying they represent a security threat.\n\nMr Peskov dismissed those claims as \"new, unfounded accusations levelled at our country\".\n\nGermany said on Monday it had recalled its ambassador to Russia for a week of consultations in Berlin after an alleged computer hack of Chancellor Olaf Scholz's party.\n\nMeanwhile, Ukrainian drones hit two vehicles on Monday in Russia's Belgorod region, killing six people and injuring 35 others, including two children, local authorities said. The area has been hit by Kyiv's forces in recent months.\n\nOne of the vehicles was a minibus carrying farm workers, Belgorod governor Vyacheslav Gladkov said.", "source": {"uri":

The UK has been providing Ukraine with Storm Shadow missiles, which have a range of 155 miles.

rising tensions over comments by senior Western officials about possibly deeper involvement in the war in Ukraine.\n\nAfter summoning the British ambassador to the Foreign Ministry, Moscow warned that Ukrainian strikes on Russian territory with UK-supplied weapons could bring retaliatory strikes on British military facilities and equipment on Ukrainian soil or elsewhere.\n\nThe drills are a response to \"provocative statements and threats of certain Western officials regarding the Russian Federation,\" the Defence Ministry said in a statement.\n\nForeign Secretary David Cameron recently said Kyiv's forces will be able to use British long-range weapons to strike targets inside Russia.\n\nIt was the first time Russia has publicly announced drills involving tactical nuclear weapons, although its strategic nuclear forces regularly hold exercises.\n\nTactical nuclear weapons include air bombs, warheads for short-range missiles and artillery munitions and are meant for use on a battlefield.\n\nThey are less powerful than the strategic weapons - massive warheads that arm intercontinental ballistic missiles and are intended to obliterate entire cities.\n\nThe Russian announcement was a warning to Ukraine's Western allies about becoming more deeply engaged in the 2-year-old war, where the Kremlin's forces have gained an upper hand amid Ukraine's shortage of manpower and weapons.\n\nSome of Ukraine's Western partners have previously expressed concern that the conflict could spill beyond Ukraine into a war between NATO and Russia.\n\nKremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said on Monday that statements by British officials and a comment by French President Emmanuel Macron about possibly sending soldiers to help in Ukraine had prompted the drills.\n\n\"It's a new round of escalation,\" Peskov said, referring to what the Kremlin regarded as provocative statements. \"It's unprecedented and requires special attention and special

It was the first time such an exercise had been publicly announced by Moscow.\n\nBelarus' Defense Minister Viktor Khrenin said a unit of Iskander short-range missiles and a squadron of Su-25 fighter jets will take part in the drills.\n\nThe maneuvers began as Russian President Vladimir Putin was inaugurated to a fifth term on Tuesday, vowing to ensure Russia's security.\n\nLast year, Russia moved some of its tactical nuclear weapons into Belarus, which also borders Ukraine and NATO members Poland, Latvia and Lithuania. Belarus\u00b4 authoritarian President Alexander Lukashenko has relied on close ties with Russia and provided his country as a staging ground for the war in Ukraine.\n\nMoscow has emphasized that the tactical nuclear weapons deployed to Belarus remain under Russian military control.\n\nFILE - This photo taken from video provided by the Russian Defense Ministry Press Service on Saturday, Feb. 19, 2022, shows a Russian Iskander-K missile launched during a military exercise at a training ground in Russia.

(Russian Defense Ministry Press Service via AP, File)\n\nThe deployment of tactical nuclear weapons to Belarus, which has a 1,084-kilometer (673-mile) border with Ukraine, would allow Russian aircraft and missiles to reach potential targets there more easily and quickly if Moscow decides to use them. It also extends Russia\u00b4s capability to target several NATO allies in Eastern and Central Europe.\n\nUnlike nuclear-tipped intercontinental ballistic missiles that can destroy entire cities, tactical nuclear weapons intended for use against troops on the battlefield are less powerful. Such weapons include aerial bombs, warheads for short-range missiles and artillery munitions.\n\nFILE - In this photo taken from video provided by the Russian Defense Ministry Press Service on Tuesday, Jan. 25, 2022, The Russian army's Iskander missile launchers take positions during drills in Russia.

Nato countries said last week they were deeply concerned by a campaign of hybrid activities on the military alliance's soil, accusing Moscow of being behind them and saying they represent a security threat.\n\nMr Peskov dismissed those claims as \"new, unfounded accusations levelled at our country\".\n\nGermany said on Monday it had recalled its ambassador to Russia for a week of consultations in Berlin after an alleged computer hack of Chancellor Olaf Scholz's party.\n\nMeanwhile, Ukrainian drones hit two vehicles on Monday in Russia's Belgorod region, killing six people and injuring 35 others, including two children, local authorities said. The area has been hit by Kyiv's forces in recent months.\n\nOne of the vehicles was a minibus carrying farm workers, Belgorod governor Vyacheslav Gladkov said.", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk",

Tactical nuclear weapons have a lower yield compared to massive warheads that arm intercontinental ballistic missiles intended to obliterate entire cities.\n\nThe announcement appeared to be a warning to Ukraine\u00b4s Western allies about becoming more deeply involved in the more than two-year war. Some of Ukraine\u00b4s Western partners have previously expressed concern about stoking the war amid fears it could spill beyond Ukraine and into a conflict between NATO and Russia.\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron repeated last week that he doesn\u00b4t exclude sending troops to Ukraine, and U.K. Foreign Secretary David Cameron said Kyiv\u00b4s forces will be able to use British long-range weapons to strike targets inside Russia.\n\nThe Kremlin branded those comments as dangerous, heightening tension between Russia and NATO. The war already has placed significant strain on relations between Moscow and the West.\n\nFILE - In this photo released by the Russian Defense Ministry on March 19, 2024, a Russian tank fires at Ukrainian troops from a position near the border with Ukraine in Russia's Belgorod region. (Russian Defense Ministry Press Service via AP, File)\n\nTactical nuclear weapons include air bombs, warheads for short-range missiles and artillery munitions and are meant for use on the battlefield.\n\nThe ministry said the exercise is intended to \"increase the readiness of non-strategic nuclear forces to fulfill combat tasks\" and will be held on President Vladimir Putin\u00b4s orders. The maneuvers will involve missile units of the Southern Military District along with the air force and the navy, it said.\n\nMeanwhile, Ukrainian drones hit two vehicles Monday in Russia\u00b4s Belgorod region, killing six people and injuring 35 others, including two children, local authorities said, in an area frequently struck by Kyiv\u00b4s forces in recent months.\n\nOne of the vehicles was a minibus that was carrying farm workers, Belgorod Gov. Vyacheslav Gladkov said.\n\nNo other details were immediately available, and it was not possible to independently confirm the report from the border region.\n\nWhile Ukraine\u00b4s army is largely pinned down on the 1,000-kilometer (600-mile) front line due to a shortage of troops and ammunition after more than two years of fighting, it has used its long-range firepower to hit targets deep inside Russia. The apparent aim is to disrupt Russia\u00b4s war logistics system by hitting oil refineries and depots, and unnerve the Russian border regions.\n\nThe Belgorod region was a staging ground for Russia\u00b4s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. It has come under regular attack ever since Russian forces retreated there from northeastern Ukraine early in the war following a counteroffensive by Kyiv.\n\nIn what has largely been a war of attrition, Russia has also relied heavily on long-range missile, artillery and drones to wreak damage on Ukraine.\n\nAt the end of last year, Belgorod officials said 25 people were killed, including five children, and more than 100 were injured in a Ukrainian attack, and regular rocket and drone strikes have continued since then. The area can be reached by relatively simple and mobile weapons such as multiple rocket launchers from forests on the Ukrainian side.\n\nRussian authorities said in March they planned to evacuate about 9,000 children from the area because of continuous shelling, after Putin said he wanted to create a buffer zone to help protect border regions.\n\nFollow AP\u00b4s coverage of the war in Ukraine

Here's a look at tactical nuclear weapons and the part they play in the Kremlin's political messaging.\n\nWhat are tactical nuclear weapons?\n\nUnlike nuclear-tipped intercontinental ballistic missiles that can destroy entire cities, tactical nuclear weapons for use against troops on the battlefield are less powerful and can have a yield as small as about 1 kiloton. The U.S. bomb dropped on Hiroshima during World War II was 15 kilotons.\n\nSuch battlefield nuclear weapons -- aerial bombs, warheads for short-range missiles or artillery munitions -- can be very compact. Their small size allows them to be discreetly carried on a truck or plane.\n\nPeople are also reading...

But he later toned down his statements as Ukraine's offensive last summer failed to reach its goals and Russia scored more gains on the battlefield.\n\nMoscow's defense doctrine envisages a nuclear response to an atomic strike or even an attack with conventional weapons that \"threaten the very existence of the Russian state.\" That vague wording led some pro-Kremlin Russian experts to urge Putin to sharpen it to force the West to take the warnings more seriously.\n\nPutin said last fall that he sees no reason for such a change.\n\n\"There is no situation in which anything would threaten Russian statehood and the existence of the Russian state,\" he said. \"I think that no person of sober mind and clear memory could have an idea to use nuclear weapons against Russia.\"\n\nWhy did Russia send nuclear weapons to Belarus?\n\nLast year, Russia moved some of its tactical nuclear weapons into the territory of Belarus, an ally that neighbors Ukraine and NATO members Poland, Latvia and Lithuania.\n\nBelarus' authoritarian president, Alexander Lukashenko, had long urged Moscow to station nuclear weapons in his country, which has close military ties with Russia and served as a staging ground for the war in Ukraine.\n\nBoth Putin and Lukashenko said that nuclear weapons deployment to Belarus was intended to counter perceived Western threats. Last year, Putin specifically linked the move to the U.K. government's decision to provide Ukraine with armor-piercing shells containing depleted uranium. Neither leader said how many were moved -- only that Soviet-era facilities in the country were readied to accommodate them, and that Belarusian pilots and missile crews were trained to use them. The weapons have remained under Russian military control.\n\nThe deployment of tactical nuclear weapons to Belarus, which has a 673-mile border with Ukraine, would allow Russian aircraft and missiles to reach potential targets there more easily and quickly, if Moscow decides to use them. It also extended Russia's capability to target several NATO allies in Eastern and Central Europe.\n\n0 Comments Love 0 Funny 0 Wow 0 Sad 0 Angry 0\n\nBe the first to know\n\nGet local news delivered

State news agency Belta quoted Defence Minister Viktor Khrenin as saying President Alexander Lukashenko had ordered a surprise inspection of forces in charge of such weapons.\n\nThe entire range of activities from planning, preparation and use of strikes with tactical nuclear weapons will be checked during the inspection, Khrenin said.\n\nThe checks involved an Iskander missile division and a squadron of Su-25 aircraft, he added.\n\nTactical nuclear weapons, unlike their intercontinental counterparts, are designed for battlefield use against troops rather than cities, with yields as small as about 1 kiloton. For comparison, the bomb dropped on Hiroshima during World War II had a yield of 15 kilotons. These weapons, including aerial bombs, short-range missile warheads, or artillery munitions, are compact and can be discreetly transported by truck or plane.\n\nBelarusian President Alexander Lukashenko revealed in April that \"several dozen\" Russian tactical nuclear weapons had been deployed in Belarus under an agreement with President Vladimir Putin, aimed at deterring the West. These weapons are distinct from strategic warheads, which target entire enemy cities.\n\nRussia announced on Monday that it would conduct military exercises involving the deployment of tactical nuclear weapons, citing threats from France, Britain, and the United States. Ukrainian military intelligence dismissed the drill as routine, labelling it as \"nuclear blackmail\" typical of Putin's regime.\n\nUnlike strategic weapons, which are subject to arms control agreements between Moscow and Washington, tactical nuclear weapons have never been limited by such pacts. Russia has not disclosed specific details or numbers regarding these weapons.\n\nLast year, Russia moved some of its tactical nuclear weapons into Belarus, an ally situated near Ukraine and NATO members Poland, Latvia, and Lithuania. Lukashenko, known for his authoritarian rule, had long advocated for the stationing of nuclear weapons in Belarus, which maintains close military ties with Russia and was involved in the conflict in Ukraine.\n\nThe deployment of tactical nuclear weapons to Belarus, which has a 1,084-kilometer (673-mile) border with Ukraine, would allow Russian aircraft and missiles to reach potential targets there more easily and quickly if Moscow decides to use them. It has also extended Russia's capability to target several NATO allies in Eastern and Central Europe.", "source": {"uri": "firstpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Firstpost"}, "authors": [],

They also discuss sending of NATO troops to Ukraine.\n\n\"Everything they are coming up with now, how they scare the whole world... all this may lead to a nuclear conflict that will destroy civilisation,\" Putin warned.\n\nRussia's strategic nuclear forces are in a state of full readiness, Putin noted.\n\nTactical nuclear weapons are weapons of reduced power. They are used to destroy large targets and concentrations of enemy forces at the front and in the immediate rear. Tactical nuclear weapons can be made in the form of bombs, artillery shells, landmines, torpedoes, anti-aircraft missiles and short-range missiles. The power of a tactical nuclear weapon is usually measured as 200-300 tons of TNT.\n\nExercises with the use of non-strategic nuclear weapons are connected with statements that Western representatives have made about \"readiness and even intention\" to send troops to Ukraine.", "source": {"uri": "english.pravda.ru", "dataType": "news", "title": "PravdaReport"}, "authors": [{"uri": "pavel_morozov@english.pravda.ru", "name": "Pavel Morozov", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_exercise", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Military exercise"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vladimir_Putin", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Vladimir Putin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Russia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emmanuel_Macron", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Emmanuel Macron"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukraine", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Staff_of_the_Armed_Forces_of_the_Russian_Federation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "General Staff of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sovereignty", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sovereignty"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Navy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Navy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commander-in-chief", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Commander-in-chief"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ministry_of_Defence_(Russia)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ministry of Defence (Russia)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_France", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "President of France"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strike_action", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Strike action"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_weapon", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nuclear weapon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Europe"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "France"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TNT", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "TNT"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tactical_nuclear_weapon", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tactical nuclear weapon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shell_(projectile)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Shell (projectile)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface-to-air_missile", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Surface-to-air missile"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_warfare", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nuclear warfare"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Land_mine", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Land mine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torpedo", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Torpedo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Missile", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Missile"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NATO", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NATO"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Military", "label": "dmoz/Society/Military", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Military_Science", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Military Science", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Military/Weapons_and_Equipment", "label": "dmoz/Society/Military/Weapons and Equipment", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Pharmacy/Nuclear_Pharmacy", "label": "dmoz/Health/Pharmacy/Nuclear Pharmacy", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 91}], "image": "https://english.pravda.ru/image/preview/article/5/3/1/159531_amp.jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9542018", "eventUri": "eng-9542018", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.02745098039215677, "wgt": 177, "relevance": 1}

The manoeuvres will involve missile units of the Southern Military District along with the air force and the navy, it said.\n\nMeanwhile, Ukrainian drones hit two vehicles on Monday in Russia's Belgorod region, killing six people and injuring 35 others, including two children, local authorities said, in an area frequently struck by Kyiv's forces in recent months.\n\nOne of the vehicles was a minibus that was carrying farm workers, Belgorod governor Vyacheslav Gladkov said.\n\nNo other details were immediately available, and it was not possible to independently confirm the report from the border region.\n\nWhile Ukraine's army is largely pinned down on the 600-mile front line due to a shortage of troops and ammunition after more than two years of fighting, it has used its long-range firepower to hit targets deep inside Russia.\n\nThe apparent aim is to disrupt Russia's war logistics system by hitting oil refineries and depots, and unnerve the Russian border regions.\n\nThe Belgorod region was a staging ground for Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. It has come under regular attack ever since Russian forces retreated there from north-eastern Ukraine early in the war following a counter-offensive by Kyiv.\n\nIn what has largely been a war of attrition, Russia has also relied heavily on long-range missile, artillery and drones to wreak damage on Ukraine.\n\nAt the end of last year, Belgorod officials said 25 people were killed, including five children, and more than 100 were injured in a Ukrainian attack, and regular rocket and drone strikes have continued since then.\n\nThe area can be reached by relatively simple and mobile weapons such as multiple rocket launchers from forests on the Ukrainian side.\n\nRussian authorities said in March they planned to evacuate about 9,000 children from the area because of continuous shelling, after Mr Putin said he wanted to create a buffer zone to help protect border regions.", "source": {"uri": "newschainonline.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NewsChain"}, "authors": [], "concepts":

Here's a look at tactical nuclear weapons and the part they play in the Kremlin's political messaging.\n\nWhat are tactical nuclear weapons?\n\nUnlike nuclear-tipped intercontinental ballistic missiles that can destroy entire cities, tactical nuclear weapons for use against troops on the battlefield are less powerful and can have a yield as small as about 1 kiloton. The U.S. bomb dropped on Hiroshima during World War II was 15 kilotons.\n\nSuch battlefield nuclear weapons -- aerial bombs, warheads for short-range missiles or artillery munitions -- can be very compact. Their small size allows them to be discreetly carried on a truck or plane.\n\nPeople are also reading...

But he later toned down his statements as Ukraine's offensive last summer failed to reach its goals and Russia scored more gains on the battlefield.\n\nMoscow's defense doctrine envisages a nuclear response to an atomic strike or even an attack with conventional weapons that \"threaten the very existence of the Russian state.\" That vague wording led some pro-Kremlin Russian experts to urge Putin to sharpen it to force the West to take the warnings more seriously.\n\nPutin said last fall that he sees no reason for such a change.\n\n\"There is no situation in which anything would threaten Russian statehood and the existence of the Russian state,\" he said. \"I think that no person of sober mind and clear memory could have an idea to use nuclear weapons against Russia.\"\n\nWhy did Russia send nuclear weapons to Belarus?\n\nLast year, Russia moved some of its tactical nuclear weapons into the territory of Belarus, an ally that neighbors Ukraine and NATO members Poland, Latvia and Lithuania.\n\nBelarus' authoritarian president, Alexander Lukashenko, had long urged Moscow to station nuclear weapons in his country, which has close military ties with Russia and served as a staging ground for the war in Ukraine.\n\nBoth Putin and Lukashenko said that nuclear weapons deployment to Belarus was intended to counter perceived Western threats. Last year, Putin specifically linked the move to the U.K. government's decision to provide Ukraine with armor-piercing shells containing depleted uranium. Neither leader said how many were moved -- only that Soviet-era facilities in the country were readied to accommodate them, and that Belarusian pilots and missile crews were trained to use them. The weapons have remained under Russian military control.\n\nThe deployment of tactical nuclear weapons to Belarus, which has a 673-mile border with Ukraine, would allow Russian aircraft and missiles to reach potential targets there more easily and quickly, if Moscow decides to use them. It also extended Russia's capability to target several NATO allies in Eastern and Central Europe.\n\nLove 0 Funny 0 Wow 0 Sad 0 Angry 0\n\nTags Armed Forces Politics Weapons Atomic Physics Government

Gen. Pat Ryder told reporters Monday. \"It's completely inappropriate given the current security situation.\"\n\nRyder's comments came hours after Moscow announced that it will launch drills that simulate missile strikes with battlefield nuclear weapons.\n\nTactical nuclear weapons deliver a smaller yield than strategic nuclear weapons and are intended to clear out opposing forces in a more constrained area.\n\nThe drills are intended to send a signal to European leaders whom Russia's defense ministry on Monday accused of escalating tensions in recent days.\n\nThe Kremlin was likely referring to French President Emmanuel Macron, who has suggested that French troops could have a role to play in Ukraine to support Kyiv in the war against Russia.\n\nBritish Foreign Secretary David Cameron also has sharpened his rhetoric, saying that he backed the idea of Ukraine using missiles supplied by the the U.K. to strike inside Russia.\n\nThe aim of the Kremlin's nuclear exercise is to \"unconditionally ensure the territorial integrity and sovereignty of the Russian state in response to provocative statements and threats by some Western officials,\" the Russian Defense Ministry said.\n\nThe drills will involve missile formations from Russia's Southern Military District, whose headquarters are in Rostov-on-Don, and will incorporate aircraft and naval forces.\n\nState Department spokesman Matthew Miller said Monday that Russia's nuclear rhetoric has been \"reckless and irresponsible\" throughout the Ukraine conflict.\n\n\"That said, we have not seen any reason to adjust our own nuclear posture in response to these announcements, nor any indications that Russia is preparing to use a nuclear weapon in Ukraine,\" Miller said.\n\nSince its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, Russia has made repeated nuclear threats. The situation has become cause for concern among top U.S. military officials.\n\nLast month, U.S. European Command's Gen. Christopher Cavoli said the United States needs to revive lines of communication in place during the Cold War that helped both countries avoid nuclear conflict.\n\n\"We could read each other's signals. We knew how to send signals to each other,\" Cavoli said during an April 8 congressional hearing. \"Almost all of that is gone now.\"\n\nIn the meantime, the U.S. military has stepped up efforts in Europe to prepare for potential nuclear confrontation.\n\nFor example, an F-16 fighter wing at Spangdahlem Air Base in Germany recently practiced how to safely receive and relaunch aircraft exposed to nuclear radiation.\n\nThe drills, a first at that base, dealt with a wide range of technical matters that would be required should the wing need to engage in a counterstrike mission after an adversary had used a tactical nuclear weapon against an ally.\n\nWhile Air Force officials said the training wasn't tied to current events, such drills are nonetheless new to Europe and come at a time when concerns about Russian nuclear threats are at a post-Cold War high.", "source": {"uri": "stripes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Stars and Stripes"}, "authors": [{"uri":

The Russian Defense Ministry said that the events are being held on behalf of dictator Vladimir Putin to increase the readiness of nuclear weapons to perform combat missions.\n\nThe terrorist agency also noted that the exercises will be conducted by units of the Southern Military District with the involvement of aviation and the Navy. This was stated by the Russian Ministry of Defense.\n\nThe occupiers said that during the exercise they would carry out a set of measures to practise the preparation and use of non-strategic nuclear weapons. The Russian Defense Ministry claimed that these exercises are aimed at maintaining the readiness of personnel and equipment to respond to \"provocative statements and threats\" by certain Western officials against the Russian Federation.\n\nHowever, in reality, it is the terrorist state of Russia that regularly organizes nuclear blackmail of the entire civilized world. In particular, in the first days of the full-scale invasion of Ukraine, dictator Putin announced the transfer of nuclear forces to a \"special mode\" of combat alert, and six months later threatened to use \"all available means\" to \"protect\" the occupied territories of Ukraine.\n\nOne of the last portions of Russia's nuclear threats came in early 2024. Back then, the Kremlin dictator said that if European troops appeared in Ukraine, Russia could use nuclear weapons.\n\nMoreover, Deputy Chairman of the Russian Security Council Dmitry Medvedev also linked the current exercises to the West's intention to send troops to Ukraine. Following the dictator, the Ukrainophobe revealed that Russia could use nuclear weapons if European troops enter Ukraine.\n\n\"There is some kind of total degradation of the ruling class in the West. This class does not want to logically connect elementary things. Sending their troops to the territory of Ukraine will entail their countries' direct entry into a war, which we will have to respond to,\" Medvedev said.\n\nIn his turn, Putin's spokesman Dmitry Peskov confirmed that the exercises of non-strategic nuclear forces are being held to blackmail the West. According to him, the exercises are related to the West's statements about its readiness to send troops to Ukraine.\n\nPeskov also complained that the West is allegedly provoking an unprecedented round of tension in Ukraine, which requires retaliatory measures from Russia.\n\nAs a reminder, Russia is actively developing an \"indiscriminate\" anti-satellite nuclear device for use in space. It will threaten all satellites of all countries and companies in the world.\n\nEarlier it became known that Russia blocked the UN Security Council resolution on the prohibition of nuclear weapons in space. In fact, the world agreed on this many decades ago, when more than 130 countries signed the Outer Space Treaty of 1967, which prohibits any anti-satellite systems and nuclear weapons in space.", "source": {"uri": "eng.obozrevatel.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Obozrevatel"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dictator", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dictator"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ministry_of_Defence_(Russia)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ministry of Defence (Russia)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_weapon", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nuclear weapon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrorism", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Terrorism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Russia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vladimir_Putin", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Vladimir Putin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukraine", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_exercise", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Military exercise"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_Military_District", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Southern Military District"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Navy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Navy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian-occupied_territories_of_Ukraine", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Russian-occupied territories of Ukraine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_invasion_of_Ukraine", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Russian invasion of Ukraine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premier_of_the_Soviet_Union", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Premier of the Soviet Union"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_blackmail", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nuclear blackmail"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moscow_Kremlin", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Moscow Kremlin"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_terrorism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "State terrorism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security_Council_of_Russia", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Security Council of Russia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dmitry_Medvedev", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dmitry Medvedev"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-satellite_weapon", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Anti-satellite weapon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outer_Space_Treaty", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Outer Space Treaty"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dmitry_Peskov", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dmitry Peskov"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Security_Council", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United Nations Security Council"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satellite", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Satellite"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Physics/Nuclear", "label": "dmoz/Science/Physics/Nuclear", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Martial_Arts/Russian", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Martial Arts/Russian", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Pharmacy/Nuclear_Pharmacy", "label": "dmoz/Health/Pharmacy/Nuclear Pharmacy", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://i2.obozrevatel.com/news/2024/5/6/1.jpg?size=2010x1050", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9542018", "eventUri": "eng-9542018", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.3333333333333334, "wgt": 176, "relevance": 1}

And it came at the start of a week of extensive publicity for the Russian leader, with his inauguration scheduled for Tuesday, followed on Thursday by the annual Victory Day celebration, which commemorates the Soviet defeat of Nazi Germany in 1945.\n\nThe announcement of the exercise was Russia's most explicit warning in its more than two-year-long invasion of Ukraine that it could use tactical nuclear weapons there.\n\nWestern officials have long worried that Russia could deploy such weapons, especially if it faced serious setbacks on the battlefield. But Mr. Putin denied as recently as March that he had ever considered it, even as he regularly reminds the world of Russia's vast nuclear arsenal as a way of keeping in check the West's military support for Ukraine.\n\nThe Defense Ministry said the exercise would be held \"to unconditionally ensure the territorial integrity and sovereignty of the Russian state in response to provocative statements and threats of individual Western officials against the Russian Federation.\"", "source": {"uri": "nytimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New York Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Russia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_invasion_of_Ukraine", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Russian invasion of Ukraine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_weapon", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Nuclear weapon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_exercise", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Military exercise"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukraine", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ministry_of_Defense_(Israel)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ministry of Defense (Israel)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inauguration", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Inauguration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vladimir_Putin", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Vladimir Putin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/End_of_World_War_II_in_Europe", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "End of World War II in Europe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tactical_nuclear_weapon", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tactical nuclear weapon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Territorial_integrity", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Territorial integrity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victory_Day_(9_May)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Victory Day (9 May)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sovereignty", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sovereignty"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Soviet Union"}, "location": null}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Martial_Arts/Russian", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Martial Arts/Russian", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Military_Science", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Military Science", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Pharmacy/Nuclear_Pharmacy", "label": "dmoz/Health/Pharmacy/Nuclear Pharmacy", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 96}], "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/05/06/multimedia/06russia-nukes-zmpv/06russia-nukes-zmpv-videoSixteenByNine3000.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9542018", "eventUri": "eng-9542018", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.5372549019607843, "wgt": 176, "relevance": 1}

Tactical nuclear weapons have a lower yield compared to massive warheads that arm intercontinental ballistic missiles intended to obliterate entire cities.\n\nThe announcement appeared to be a warning to Ukraine's Western allies about becoming more deeply involved in the more than two-year war. Some of Ukraine's Western partners have previously expressed concern about stoking the war amid fears it could spill beyond Ukraine and into a conflict between NATO and Russia.\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron repeated last week that he doesn't exclude sending troops to Ukraine, and U.K. Foreign Secretary David Cameron said Kyiv's forces will be able to use British long-range weapons to strike targets inside Russia.\n\nThe Kremlin branded those comments as dangerous, heightening tension between Russia and NATO. The war already has placed significant strain on relations between Moscow and the West.\n\nIt wasn't the first time Europe's military support for Ukraine has irked Russian authorities and prompted nuclear saber-rattling. In March last year, after the UK government's decision to provide Ukraine with armor-piercing shells containing depleted uranium, Putin announced that he intends to deploy tactical nuclear weapons on the territory of Belarus.\n\nTactical nuclear weapons include air bombs, warheads for short-range missiles and artillery munitions and are meant for use on the battlefield.\n\nThe ministry said the exercise is intended to \"increase the readiness of non-strategic nuclear forces to fulfill combat tasks\" and will be held on President Vladimir Putin's orders. The maneuvers will involve missile units of the Southern Military District along with the air force and the navy, it said.\n\nMeanwhile, Ukrainian drones hit two vehicles Monday in Russia's Belgorod region, killing six people and injuring 35 others, including two children, local authorities said, in an area frequently struck by Kyiv's forces in recent months.\n\nOne of the vehicles was a minibus that was carrying farm workers, Belgorod Gov. Vyacheslav Gladkov said.\n\nNo other details were immediately available, and it was not possible to independently confirm the report from the border region. While Ukraine's army is largely pinned down on the 1,000-kilometer (600-mile) front line due to a shortage of troops and ammunition after more than two years of fighting, it has used its long-range firepower to hit targets deep inside Russia. The apparent aim is to disrupt Russia's war logistics system by hitting oil refineries and depots, and unnerve the Russian border regions.\n\nThe Belgorod region was a staging ground for Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. It has come under regular attack ever since Russian forces retreated there from northeastern Ukraine early in the war following a counteroffensive by Kyiv.\n\nIn what has largely been a war of attrition, Russia has also relied heavily on long-range missile, artillery and drones to wreak damage on Ukraine.\n\nAt the end of last year, Belgorod officials said 25 people were killed, including five children, and more than 100 were injured in a Ukrainian attack, and regular rocket and drone strikes have continued since then. The area can be reached by relatively simple and mobile weapons such as multiple rocket launchers from forests on the Ukrainian side.\n\nRussian authorities said in March they planned to evacuate about 9,000 children from the area because of continuous shelling, after Putin said he wanted to create a buffer zone to help protect border regions.\n\nAlso, the Kremlin's forces kept up their bombardment of Ukraine's power grid, with a nighttime Russian drone attack targeting energy infrastructure in Ukraine's northern region of Sumy. Multiple towns and villages in the region, including Sumy, lost power, regional authorities said.Russia attacked Ukrainian targets with 13 Shahed drones overnight, 12 of which were intercepted in the Sumy region, Ukraine's air force said.", "source": {"uri": "indianexpress.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Indian Express"}, "authors": [{"uri": "associated_press@indianexpress.com", "name":

But why now?\n\nThe Kremlin, citing recent comments by Western leaders regarding the war in Ukraine, said Monday that it would soon carry out simulated use of battlefield, or tactical, nuclear weapons -- marking the first time Moscow announced such an exercise.\n\nThe announcement drew a sharp response. Defense Department spokesman Maj. Gen. Patrick Ryder called it \"entirely inappropriate.\" NATO spokesperson Farah Dakhlallah termed Moscow's plans \"dangerous and irresponsible,\" and the European Union called on Russia to \"stop the escalation.\"\n\nLike so many pronouncements from Moscow, this one's timing might matter as much as its substance.\n\nThis week holds two red-letter days for Putin: his inauguration on Tuesday to yet another presidential term after an unsurprising landslide election win in March, coupled with Thursday's traditionally bombastic Victory Day celebrations commemorating the Soviet victory over the Nazis.\n\nIt is commonplace for nuclear powers such as Russia -- or the United States, for that matter -- to conduct checks of their weapons stockpiles. But declaring an explicit connection between exercises involving practice use of nuclear weapons and comments by adversarial governments about an ongoing conflict is an unusual diplomatic move.\n\nRussia's Defense Ministry said the planned tactical nuclear drills near Ukraine were intended to \"unconditionally ensure the territorial integrity and sovereignty of the Russian state.\"\n\nTactical nuclear weapons, as the term implies, are far smaller and less powerful than strategic nuclear armaments such as intercontinental ballistic missiles carrying nuclear payloads that could lay waste to large population centers. But nuclear threats, even veiled ones, have a way of grabbing everyone's attention.\n\nUnlike strategic nuclear weapons, battlefield nuclear munitions -- which are relatively compact and easily transportable -- are not subject to international arms agreements, and Russia's stockpiles are shrouded in secrecy. Such weapons can be deployed in the form of air-dropped bombs or short-range missiles.\n\nThe Pentagon closely monitors Russia's nuclear posture, and over the course of the Ukraine war, the Biden administration has reported no changes -- even at times when Russian rhetoric suggests heightened tensions.\n\n...continued", "source": {"uri": "arcamax.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ArcaMax"},

I see this as your deep awareness of our common historical goals, and unwavering resolve to defend our choices, our values, our freedom and Russia's national interests.\"\n\nThe war in Ukraine has entered a tremendously dangerous and uncertain phase that may even veer toward a direct conflict between Russia and NATO as Western leaders consider how best to ensure Ukrainian forces don't collapse in the face of Russia's superior military might.\n\nThe situation for Ukraine has become dire, Western and Ukrainian officials acknowledge. Each day brings new reports of Ukrainian troop losses and surrenders, retreats and lack of ammunition and equipment. In the West, hopes rest with the recent passage of $61 billion in U.S. military aid for Ukraine, but the package won't solve Ukraine's problems with a shortage of troops.\n\nIncreasingly, it even seems possible that Western troops may be sent into Ukraine to fight. In recent days, Russian sources, citing an Asia Times article by a former U.S. deputy undersecretary of defense, claimed troops with the French Foreign Legion had been sent close to the front lines, though France's defense ministry denied that.\n\nStill, France, Poland, Finland and the Baltic nations have not ruled out sending troops to Ukraine and there is growing evidence that Western military officials, often acting as advisers, are becoming more active on the ground in Ukraine.\n\nIn recent weeks, French President Emmanuel Macron has repeatedly confirmed he would not rule out sending troops to Ukraine because, in his words, Europe cannot afford to allow Russia to win. But NATO allies, including Berlin, London and Washington, have dismissed sending forces, saying the risk of war with Russia is too great.\n\nBut the rhetoric from Western officials is becoming more confrontational.\n\nBritish Foreign Secretary David Cameron drew an angry response from Russia after he said Britain would not object to Ukraine using British-supplied missiles to strike inside Russia. Previously, Britain had only backed striking Russian targets inside Ukrainian territory.\n\n\"Just as Russia is striking inside Ukraine, you can quite understand why Ukraine feels the need to make sure it's defending itself,\" Cameron said during a visit to Kyiv last Thursday.\n\nPoland has angered Moscow by voicing interest in receiving U.S. nuclear weapons. In the European Union, Russia is increasingly accused of carrying out aggressive actions. Baltic nations say Russia is disrupting flights by interfering with air traffic navigation by jamming global positioning systems.\n\nGermany blames Moscow for being behind recent cyberattacks on the governing Social Democratic Party and against defense, aerospace, and high-tech companies.\n\nOn Sunday, the Financial Times reported that European intelligence agencies believe Russian agents are plotting violent acts of sabotage against NATO infrastructure across the bloc.\n\nThe newspaper said Swedish security services believe Russia may behind a series of railway derailments; Czechia is investigating whether Russia attempted to destroy signaling systems on railways; Estonia says Russian agents were behind an an attack on the interior minister's car and those of journalists.\n\nIn a major escalation, Putin on Monday ordered Russian troops to hold battlefield drills in the use of so-called tactical nuclear weapons along the border of Ukraine. Belarus said its forces would join the exercises. In April, Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko said several dozen tactical nuclear warheads had been placed in his country.\n\nTactical nuclear weapons, which have never been used in war, are designed to cause massive damage, for example against large logistical hubs, command centers and military installations far from the battlefields. But unlike so-called strategic nuclear weapons, they are not meant to raze entire cities to ash.\n\nThe Russian Foreign Ministry said the military exercises were a response to \"recent bellicose statements by Western officials\" and NATO's moves to provide \"direct assistance\" to Ukraine, including advanced weapons, such as long-range missiles and F-16 fighter jets capable of launching nuclear missiles.\n\nIt also cited claims about the deployment of French troops inside Ukraine as a reason for the nuclear drills.\n\n\"It is difficult to perceive this other than as a manifestation of readiness and intention to enter into direct armed confrontation with Russia, which would mean a head-on military clash of nuclear powers,\" the ministry said. \"We note that the aggressive desire of NATO countries to undermine the security of the Russian Federation is gaining momentum.\"\n\nIt said it hoped the nuclear drills \"will cool down the 'hot heads' in Western capitals\" and \"help them realize the possible catastrophic consequences of the strategic risks they generate.\"\n\nDmitry Medvedev, the former Russian president and deputy chairman of the Russian Security Council, sent a menacing message to London and Paris.\n\n\"Russia will respond to the sending of Western troops to Ukraine with a nuclear attack on Washington, Paris and London,\" Medvedev wrote on social media. \"The sending of their troops to the territory of Ukraine will mean the direct engagement of those countries in the war, to which we [i.e. Russia] will have to respond. And, alas, not on the territory of Ukraine; there will be a global catastrophe.\"\n\nAs in the past, Western leaders denounced Russia's nuclear saber rattling as outrageously dangerous, but they have also treated Moscow's nuclear threats as blackmail and empty threats.\n\nIn his speech Tuesday, Putin said Russia was ready to open talks with Western leaders.\n\n\"We are not rejecting dialogue with Western states. The choice is theirs: whether they intend to continue trying to contain Russia's development, continue the policy of aggression, the relentless pressure they have been exerting on our country for years, or seek a path to cooperation and peace,\" he said. \"We are open to a conversation without arrogance, conceit or exceptionalism - a dialogue on an equal footing and with respect for each other's interests.\"\n\nBut there is little likelihood of any talks taking place any time soon to end the war.\n\nSwitzerland is set to hold a Ukraine peace summit in June based on a set of demands from Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, but it is unlikely to gain much traction because China may not attend because Russia will not be present. Russia has dismissed Zelenskyy's proposals, which call for Russia's withdrawal from Ukrainian territories.\n\nPutin, now serving his fifth term as president, has been in power since Dec. 31, 1999, making him the longest-ruling leader in Moscow since Joseph Stalin.\n\nPolls show that Putin's popularity has grown even more solid since he launched the invasion of Ukraine and dissent against his regime is minimal, though that can be explained in part by Russian authorities conducting a crackdown on antiwar voices.", "source": {"uri": "europesun.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

Since then, the Kremlin has sent mixed messages about the atomic threat it could pose, while its propagandists have made repeated threats about strikes on Western capitals.\n\nThe Russian foreign ministry on Monday announced nuclear exercises involving missile formations from the country's Southern Military District (SMD) and Russian aviation and naval forces, following \"openly declared support\" by the West for Kyiv \"using increasingly advanced weapons.\"\n\nThe statement referred to strikes on Russian infrastructure attributed to Kyiv and the reported appearance of British, French and U.S. long-range missile systems in Ukraine.\n\n\"The United States has openly and clearly embarked on the deployment of ground-based systems with intermediate-range and shorter-range missiles (INF), which were previously banned under the INF Treaty,\" the statement said, referring to the agreement the U.S. withdrew from in 2019 under former President Donald Trump.\n\n\"We explicitly state that whenever and wherever U.S.-made ground-based intermediate-range missiles appear, we reserve the right to respond in kind, which will mean the end of Russia's unilateral moratorium on the deployment of these weapons systems,\" the ministry said.\n\nIt also condemned French President Emmanuel Macron's statements about the possibility of sending French and other NATO troops to Ukraine as indicating the bloc's intention \"to a further escalation of the Ukrainian crisis towards an open military clash between NATO countries and Russia.\"\n\nMoscow also said that it would consider the arrival of F-16 fighter jets to Ukraine as a provocation because \"we cannot ignore the fact that these aircraft are dual-equipped platforms,\" and can be used for nuclear and conventional weapons.\n\nThe U.S. has given the green light for its allies to deliver the aircraft, which are expected to be used in Ukraine in the coming months.\n\n\"Putin is reminding people that Russia has nuclear weapons and they should think very carefully before getting directly involved in the war in Ukraine,\" David Silbey, associate professor of history at Cornell University and a military and defense analyst, told Newsweek.\n\n\"It doesn't mean he's about to use them, just that the weapons exist and are ready to go. Think of it as cocking a gun in an old western movie -- you're not using it yet, but everyone's aware that you've got it,\" he added.\n\nThe latest Russian nuclear threat is among the hybrid warfare tactics the Kremlin is using as part of its \"reflexive control\" campaign to manipulate an adversary's actions, the Institute for the Study of War (ISW) said.\n\nThe Washington, D.C., think tank noted on Monday how Russia's latest nuclear saber-rattling coincides with the imminent arrival of weapons in Ukraine from Kyiv's allies.\n\nBy raising the alert of atomic weapons, Moscow wants \"to scare Western decision-makers out of allowing Ukrainian forces to use Western-provided systems to attack legitimate military targets in Russia,\" the ISW added.", "source": {"uri": "newsweek.com",

The Kremlin explained. David Cameron has spoken about using British-supplied weapons against Russia.\n\nThe Russian Defense Ministry said in a statement that troops from the Southern Military District will practice the issue of preparing and using non-strategic nuclear weapons in response to provocative statements and threats made by some Western officials against the Russian Federation.\n\nThe announcement comes days after President Macron said he would not rule out sending troops to Ukraine and Cameron said it would be up to Kiev how it would use British weapons, including against targets inside Russia.\n\nThe Kremlin on Monday summoned British Ambassador Nigel Casey and the French ambassador to Moscow.\n\nRussia's Foreign Ministry formally complained to Casey about Cameron's recent comments that Ukraine had the right to use British weapons to attack inside Russia.\n\nIt is said that with this remark, the UK effectively became a party to the dispute. The statement came after Ukraine attacked the Iskander short-range ballistic missile system stationed in Crimea.\n\nCasey was warned that if Ukraine attacked Russian territory with British weapons, all British military facilities and equipment on Ukrainian territory and abroad could be targeted, the Russian Foreign Ministry said in a statement.\n\nThe Ambassador was asked to reflect on the inevitable disastrous consequences of such hostile measures from London and to immediately refute in the most decisive and unambiguous manner the belligerent and provocative statements of the Foreign Office.\n\nRussia's southern military district borders Ukraine and is where the full-scale invasion of Ukraine began two years ago, killing tens of thousands of soldiers and civilians.\n\nThe Ministry of Defense stated that this exercise was aimed at unconditionally guaranteeing the territorial integrity and sovereignty of the Russian state.\n\nThe exercises will also include Russian air force and naval forces, the Ministry of Defense said.\n\nThe Russian president has regularly warned that the country is prepared to wage nuclear war, and has regularly ordered strategic nuclear exercises, usually using intercontinental ballistic missiles. It is not uncommon for Russia to conduct tactical nuclear exercises. Tactical nuclear training uses low-yield, low-yield weapons designed for battlefield use.\n\nRussia's Foreign Ministry said Monday that Russia will develop new intermediate- and short-range missiles, following reports that the United States is transferring similar missile systems to Europe and the Asia-Pacific region.\n\nUkrainian government officials dismissed the Kremlin's statement as a nuclear threat.\n\nApart from information effects and statements, you won't see anything new here. Nuclear blackmail is a constant practice of the Putin regime, Ukrainian intelligence spokesman Andriy Yusov told state television.\n\nThe nuclear exercises are scheduled to take place amid heightened diplomatic tensions between Russia and European countries. Germany recalled its ambassador to Russia on Monday after accusing Moscow of carrying out a 2023 cyberattack against Germany's ruling Social Democratic Party.\n\nKremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said he had recently witnessed an unprecedented phase of escalation led by the French president and the British foreign minister. It was a very dangerous investigation.\n\nPeskov said the exercises were prompted by comments by President Macron and British and U.S. officials about the possibility of sending troops to Ukraine.\n\nThey have talked about their readiness and even intentions to send armed units to Ukraine. That is, to actually place NATO soldiers in front of Russian troops, Peskov said.\n\nIn March, Putin told reporters that Russia already believed NATO troops were limited in Ukraine and warned that a direct conflict between Russia and its allies would lead to an all-out World War III. I think very few people are interested in this.\n\nRussia is currently on the offensive in eastern Ukraine, amassing thousands of troops to launch an assault on the strategic town of Chasiv Yar in the Donetsk region. On Sunday it claimed to have captured the front-line town of Ocheretyne, and on Monday it claimed to have captured two more villages - Kotlyarivka and Soviove.\n\nWhat Are The Main Benefits Of

It must be widely condemned,\" the International Campaign to Abolish Nuclear Weapons (ICAN) declared on social media. \"This kind of brinkmanship, typical of 'nuclear deterrence' thinking, can spiral out of control and result in catastrophe.\"\n\n'\"Saber-rattling' like this is part of how all nuclear-armed states show they are serious about using nuclear weapons. But it's reckless: It increases the risk of nuclear weapons use, whether intentionally or by accident, at a time when it is at its highest since the Cold War,\" ICAN continued. \"And let's not forget these 'exercises' train military personnel to mass murder civilians in seconds.\"\n\nWhile strategic nuclear weapons are intended to wipe out cities, nonstrategic or tactical arms have shorter ranges and lower yields, and are designed for battlefield use. However, as ICAN highlighted, \"'tactical' nuclear weapons could have up to 20 times the destructive power of the bomb the U.S. dropped on Hiroshima.\"'\n\n\"What is needed now is de-escalation. Russia can still stop the exercises and should be called on to do so immediately by all states,\" the group said, urging all \"responsible states opposed to nuclear drills and nuclear blackmail\" to join the United Nations Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons (TPNW), passage of which earned ICAN the 2017 Nobel Peace Prize.\n\nSince invading Ukraine in February 2022, Russian President Vladimir Putin and other officials have ramped up fears of nuclear war. Russia has the largest arsenal of the nine nuclear-armed nations, followed closely by the United States -- which has armed Ukrainians throughout the ongoing war. The other countries known to have nukes are China, France, India, Israel, North Korea, Pakistan, and the United Kingdom. None of them support the TPNW.\n\nAs Reutersreported on Monday:\n\nSome Western and Ukrainian officials have said Russia is bluffing over nuclear weapons to scare the West, though the Kremlin has repeatedly indicated that it would consider breaking the nuclear taboo if Russia's existence was threatened.\n\n\"We do not see anything new here,\" said Andriy Yusov, a spokesperson for Ukrainian military intelligence. \"Nuclear blackmail is a constant practice of Putin's regime.\"\n\nThe Russian Defense Ministry said Monday that its exercises would involve troops of the Southern Military District -- which, as The New York Timesnoted, is \"an area that covers Russian-occupied Ukraine and part of Russia's border region with Ukraine.\"\n\nThe ministry explained on social media that its plans \"to practice the preparation and use of nonstrategic nuclear weapons\" come \"in response to provocative statements and threats of individual Western officials against the Russian Federation.\"\n\nDmitry Peskov, a Kremlin spokesperson, echoed that reasoning for the drills, citing statements from British, French, and U.S. officials, according toTASS. He also told reporters that \"deploying NATO soldiers to confront the Russian military in the latest escalation of tensions is an unprecedented move. And, of course, it requires special attention and special measures.\"\n\nNATO in January launched the Steadfast Defender 2024 drills -- its largest exercises since the Cold War, involving more than 90,000 troops, over 1,000 combat vehicles, and dozens of ships and aircraft. The drills in Poland are due to end this month.\n\nHans Kristensen, director of the Nuclear Information Project at the Federation of American Scientists, said that while \"Putin has previously used nuclear rhetoric against [the] West during his war in Ukraine,\" this is the first time he knows of that the Russian leader has ordered tactical nuke drills in this district \"with explicit reference to West,\" and it is \"obviously intended as a signal.\"\n\n\"For NATO this is an opportunity to double down on condemnation of nuclear threats, reaffirm that nuclear war can't be won and should never be fought, and study how Russia operates its tac nuke forces in exercise,\" the expert added. \"Just don't take the bait and respond with NATO nuke operations!\"\n\nPavel Podvig, the Geneva-based director of the Russian Nuclear Forces Project, agreed that \"this is, of course, a signal.\" He urged Western leaders to \"avoid... getting sucked into this\" and rally the world around the message that \"nuclear threats are inadmissible.\"\n\nResponding to Podvig's remarks on social media, former ICAN executive director Beatrice Fihn pointed out that over 70 nations condemned threats to use nuclear weapons at the first TPNW meeting.\n\n\"I wish more NATO states would work with the TPNW states that have close connections to Russia to strengthen and support this kind of work,\" she said.",

It was the first time such an exercise had been publicly announced by Moscow.\n\nBelarus' Defence Minister Viktor Khrenin said a unit of Iskander short-range missiles and a squadron of Su-25 fighter jets will take part in the drills.\n\nThe maneuvers, held jointly with Russia, began as Russian President Vladimir Putin was inaugurated to a fifth term on Tuesday, vowing to ensure Russia's security.\n\nLast year, Russia moved some of its tactical nuclear weapons into Belarus, which also borders Ukraine and NATO members Poland, Latvia and Lithuania. Belarus' authoritarian President Alexander Lukashenko has relied on close ties with Russia and provided his country as a staging ground for the war in Ukraine.\n\nMoscow has emphasised that the tactical nuclear weapons deployed to Belarus remain under Russian military control.\n\nUnlike nuclear-tipped intercontinental ballistic missiles that can destroy entire cities, tactical nuclear weapons intended for use against troops on the battlefield are less powerful. Such weapons include aerial bombs, warheads for short-range missiles and artillery munitions.\n\nThe deployment of tactical nuclear weapons to Belarus, which has a 1,084-kilometer (673-mile) border with Ukraine, would allow Russian aircraft and missiles to reach potential targets there more easily and quickly if Moscow decides to use them. It also extends Russia's capability to target several NATO allies in Eastern and Central Europe.\n\nBoth Putin and Lukashenko said that the Russian nuclear weapons' deployment to Belarus was intended to counter perceived Western threats.\n\nLukashenko on Tuesday cast the drills as \"exclusively defensive,\" arguing that the Russian nuclear weapons are intended to deter any potential aggression against Belarus. \"This is a weapon of deterrence, a defensive weapon,'' Lukashenko said.\n\nThe Belarusian leader said the drills will involve the delivery of tactical nuclear weapons from storage to military units where they will be mounted on missiles and attached to warplanes. The missile units will practice covert deployment to firing positions to simulate a response to an attack on Belarus, he said.\n\nBelarus' opposition leader Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya, who was forced to leave the country under official pressure after challenging Lukashenko in an August 2020 presidential vote, met on Tuesday with NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg and denounced the Russian nuclear weapons' presence in Belarus.\n\n\"Nuclear weapons turn Belarus and Belarusians into targets,\" she said. \"The Russian nuclear weapons in Belarus raise a direct threat to lives and health of citizens of all Europe.\"\n\n(This story has not been edited by Devdiscourse staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)", "source": {"uri": "devdiscourse.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

The drills are aimed at testing the readiness of Russia's non-strategic nuclear forces, which are primarily intended for battlefield use, in contrast to the strategic nuclear arsenal aimed at broader targets.\n\nThese military exercises are unfolding against the backdrop of Macron's statements hinting at the potential involvement of Western troops in Ukraine if the conflict escalates further. Such comments have not only intensified the standoff between Russia and Western countries but have also led to heightened concerns over a potential nuclear confrontation. The Kremlin's decision to proceed with these drills also comes at a time when the U.S. Senate has approved a significant aid package for Ukraine, and the UK has continued its support with military supplies, further straining relations.\n\nRussian officials, including Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov, have articulated that these actions by Western nations represent a new level of threat, necessitating extraordinary responses from Russia. Meanwhile, Western leaders, including the Pentagon's press secretary, have criticized Russia's move as irresponsible, urging a de-escalation of nuclear rhetoric.\n\nThis development marks a stark return to nuclear saber-rattling by Putin, who is poised to begin another term in office, extending his rule amidst ongoing international tensions. The global community remains on edge as these exercises introduce a grave dimension to the already fraught relations between Russia and NATO countries, underlining the severe risks of the current geopolitical climate.\n\nThe concept of \"tactical\" nuclear weapons, such as those Russia plans to drill with, refers to nuclear arms intended for use on the battlefield rather than for strategic, long-range targets. These weapons are designed to have a shorter range and lower yield than strategic nuclear warheads but are still significantly more powerful than conventional explosives. The use of such weapons in combat is considered a last-resort scenario and is heavily contested under international law due to the indiscriminate damage and long-term environmental consequences they can cause.", "source": {"uri": "digitalnewsreport.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Digital News Report"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jessica_olson@digitalnewsreport.com", "name": "Jessica Olson", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_world", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Western world"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Russia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tactical_nuclear_weapon", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tactical nuclear weapon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_exercise", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Military exercise"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emmanuel_Macron", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Emmanuel Macron"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moscow_Kremlin", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Moscow Kremlin"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_France", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "President of France"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_weapon", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nuclear weapon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vladimir_Putin", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Vladimir Putin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "European Union"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukraine", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dmitry_Peskov", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dmitry Peskov"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Press_secretary", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Press secretary"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_parade", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Military parade"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geopolitics", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Geopolitics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_law", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "International law"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Pentagon", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Pentagon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NATO", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NATO"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Physics/Nuclear", "label": "dmoz/Science/Physics/Nuclear", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Military_Science", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Military Science", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Pharmacy/Nuclear_Pharmacy", "label": "dmoz/Health/Pharmacy/Nuclear Pharmacy", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://www.digitalnewsreport.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/war_room.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9542018", "eventUri": "eng-9542018", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.2235294117647059, "wgt": 174, "relevance": 1}

The French president, Emmanuel Macron, repeated in an interview last week that he might send ground forces to shore up beleaguered Ukrainian defenses. Meanwhile, speaking in Kyiv, the British foreign minister, David Cameron, gave Ukraine the green light to strike into Russian territory, clearly signaling that the UK wants a more aggressive approach to the war.\n\nTheir frustration is understandable, as is the temptation to get more directly involved in the war, with more powerful weapons and more guarantees of long-term backing for Ukraine. Perhaps with enough time and a lot more effort, and if Washington can maintain its focus amid all the crises bearing down on it, Ukraine could eventually regain its footing on the battlefield. It might then be able to start taking back some of the territory it has lost to Russia - perhaps in 2025, or maybe the year after that.\n\nBut the problem is that the closer Nato hugs Ukraine, the more Russia is sure to brandish its nuclear weapons, and the greater the chances it actually uses them. In response to Macron and Cameron's remarks last week, the Kremlin on Monday issued an angry statement full of accusations at the west in which it announced that Russia would soon conduct a tactical nuclear weapons exercise near Ukraine. This underscores yet again that Vladimir Putin considers these weapons fair game in this war.\n\nTo be sure, tactical nuclear weapons - sometimes referred to as \"tac nukes\" or non-strategic nuclear weapons (NSNW) - are less destructive than the larger strategic weapons that usually come to mind when one imagines thermonuclear war. But if Russia employed any nuclear weapons, even at a fraction of the destructive power of a strategic warhead, it would obliterate a swath of Ukrainian land, rendering it uninhabitable for decades.\n\nIt would also risk a vastly more destructive conflagration. Having now broken the near 80-year taboo on using nuclear weapons by attacking Ukraine with them, Russia would have far fewer reasons to hold back. Joe Biden would meanwhile face pressure to use America's own nuclear weapons in response, if only to demonstrate that he had the nerve to do so. That's why he has said that if Russia fired a nuclear weapon this would unleash \"Armageddon\".\n\nNato has thus rightly condemned Russia's nuclear posturing this time as irresponsible, and even China has expressed concerns in the past. But Putin is unfortunately a leader with an excellent record of breaking norms and taking western nations by surprise.\n\nIn 2014, Putin's covert operation to seize and then annex Crimea shocked the world. In 2015, Russia launched a surprise military intervention into Syria. The following year Putin directed an unprecedented operation to sway the US presidential elections. He did the same in Europe in 2017. Then he tried to kill off an enemy by poisoning him on British soil, attacked the US with cyberweapons, and, finally, carried out a full-scale invasion of a neighboring country - Ukraine.\n\nWho can know with enough confidence when a reckless autocrat like this, surrounded by yes-men, might decide the time is right to teach the West a lesson with a tactical nuclear strike? Internal Russian documents, as well as the latest Kremlin statement, suggest Russia's threshold for using a nuclear weapon is fairly high but getting lower. The fact is that Putin's nuclear redlines are nearly impossible for Ukraine, Nato, or anyone outside Putin's innermost circle to know with the certainty needed in light of the gravity of the issue.\n\nThat Russia has not used nuclear weapons yet offers little confidence that it won't do so in the future. It's not hard to imagine circumstances in which using a nuclear weapon might seem like the rational choice from the Kremlin's point of view, especially if faced with a rapid reversal of the gains for which Russia has paid dearly, or if confronting western escalation that only nuclear weapons can match. Putin himself may not even know for sure what his red lines are until he perceives Ukraine as having crossed them on the battlefield.\n\nThis is a serious problem, one that the US director of national intelligence, Avril Haines, referenced in her latest testimony to Congress. That Putin's threats are irresponsible doesn't mean the West can blithely ignore them. Too many of Ukraine's hardline advocates are saying otherwise, claiming that Russia would never use nuclear weapons, despite its threats, or that in any case the west cannot give in to \"nuclear blackmail\". But in light of the stakes, these attitudes seem cavalier.\n\nObviously, Nato cannot and should not quiver, cut, and run every time Russia rattles the nuclear saber. Nor is Nato doing so. But western leaders need to be clear-eyed about the risks and prudent in their approach. Rather than envisioning how incremental military steps to help Ukraine might someday bring about a heretofore elusive victory, leaders need to think about how to open up alternative paths to peace - paths that don't rely on military means alone and in which negotiation can play a larger role in the western strategy. The other options are just too dangerous.", "source": {"uri": "theguardian.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Guardian"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

It was the first time such an exercise had been publicly announced by Moscow.\n\nBelarus' Defense Minister Viktor Khrenin said a unit of Iskander short-range missiles and a squadron of Su-25 fighter jets will take part in the drills.\n\nThe maneuvers began as Russian President Vladimir Putin was inaugurated to a fifth term on Tuesday, vowing to ensure Russia's security.\n\nLast year, Russia moved some of its tactical nuclear weapons into Belarus, which also borders Ukraine and NATO members Poland, Latvia and Lithuania.

It is less common for Russia to hold tactical nuclear drills, which use weapons that have a lower yield and are meant to be used on the battlefield.\n\nA Ukrainian government official dismissed the statements from the Kremlin, calling them \"nuclear blackmail\".\n\n\"We do not see here anything new, except for the information effect and statements ... Nuclear blackmail is a constant practice of Putin's regime,\" Andriy Yusov, a spokesperson for Ukrainian intelligence, told national TV.\n\nThe nuclear drills will take place amid an escalation in diplomatic tensions between Russia and European countries.

Although it started the war, Moscow takes a dim view of that capability. Apparently, the Kremlin believes in the ebb and flow, give and take of combat when Russia assaults the sovereign Ukraine homeland but rails at the thought of \"receiving\" when it comes to Ukrainian attacks on Russian soil.\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin is not new to making threats. Early in his unprovoked and illegal invasion of Ukraine, he said he might use nuclear weapons. Putin placed atomic warheads in Belarus, and the fact that Russian nuclear weapons are close to Ukraine in the east and Belarus to the north is a menace to NATO countries. So far, the Kremlin's nuclear saber-rattling seems to stop at threats.\n\nBut recently, \"[t]he Russian foreign ministry summoned British Ambassador Nigel Casey to the Kremlin ... and warned him that if Ukrainian forces use British weaponry to attack Russia, Moscow could hit 'any UK military facility and equipment on Ukrainian territory and beyond,'\" the UK's Daily Mail reported. Moscow's feathers were ruffled when, during a visit to Kyiv, British Foreign Secretary Lord David Cameron made a public statement that Ukraine was well within its rights to use the UK-furnished weapons as its armed forces saw fit, with no limitations.\n\n\"Moscow has been barraging Ukrainian energy facilities, triggering blackouts and energy rationing across the country,\" Voice of America reported. Kyiv's drones have been attacking Russia's logistics and energy infrastructure in retaliation for Moscow's persistent assaults on Ukraine power plants. \"In recent months, Russian refineries and oil terminals have become priority targets of Ukrainian drone attacks, part of stepped-up assaults on Russian territory,\" the Associated Press explained. Reports from the region described fires at an electrical substation and a blaze at \"fuel and energy complexes.\"\n\nThe diplomatic dressing-down Casey received may be part of a broader attempt by Russia to put NATO -- in particular the nuclear nations, the US, UK, and France -- on notice. As part of the bellicose rhetoric from Putin's government, a May 6 \"Russian Offensive Campaign Assessment\" by the Institute for the Study of War (ISW) observed:\n\n\"The Russian Ministry of Defense (MoD) reported on May 6 that Russian President Vladimir Putin instructed the Russian General Staff to prepare to conduct non-strategic (tactical) nuclear weapons exercises to 'practice the preparation and use' of tactical nuclear weapons. The Russian MoD stated that these exercises will involve missile formations of Russia's Southern Military District as well as Russian aviation and naval forces.\"\n\nThe ISW analysis pointed out that Russia's pretext for its nuclear bluster is the fact that the United States has nuclear capability in various parts of the world. Additionally, the Kremlin asserted that the arrival of F-16s in Ukraine represented an escalation of the conflict since F-16 fighter aircraft are capable of carrying tactical nuclear weapons. What the Russian foreign ministry conveniently neglected to say is that most of the Russian fighters and bombers being used against Ukraine are nuclear-capable aircraft. It's also interesting to note that the current crop of threats coincides with large shipments of Western resupply of crucially needed weapons to Kyiv.\n\nNonetheless, it seems ill-advised for the Kremlin foreign ministry to single out the British for a scolding when an attack on UK military forces would be an attack on NATO and bring down the military resources of 32 nations against Russian troops. That should cause Putin some concern. However, whatever the Russian leader's frame of mind, dismissing any Kremlin threats is not a useful tactic. NATO nations, particularly new members and former Warsaw Pact participants, do not cower in the face of Moscow's threats. Recent additions to the alliance -- Sweden and Finland -- are exposed to potential Russian aggression right on their borders. The Scandinavian alliance countries -- Norway, Sweden, and Finland -- have all increased spending on defense above NATO's 2%-of-GDP goal.\n\nWhen the Russian bear starts growling around and threatening to go nuclear, it's no time to go wobbly. There is a reason the United States is the foremost nuclear nation: It's to deter Putin from acting out his threats.", "source": {"uri": "libertynation.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Liberty

The Russian MoD and the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA) both notably claimed that Russia will conduct nuclear exercises in response to \"provocative statements and threats\" made by Western officials against Russia.\n\nThe Russian MFA accused the US of deploying ground-based intermediate and short-range missiles \"in various regions around the world,\" which the Russian MFA claimed allows Russia to reciprocate in kind.\n\nThe Russian MFA also claimed that it will consider the arrival of F-16s to Ukraine as a provocation because Russia will consider F-16s carriers of nuclear weapons, a boilerplate threat that Russian officials have been making since Western states first committed to sending F-16s to Ukraine in summer 2023.\n\nRussian Security Council Deputy Chairperson Dmitry Medvedev accused US, French, and British officials of considering sending their troops to Ukraine and claimed that this justifies Russia testing its tactical nuclear weapons.\n\nMedvedev also directly threatened a \"world catastrophe\" as a result of Western involvement in Ukraine and warned of Russian strikes against Washington, Paris, and London.\n\nRussian officials, particularly Medvedev, are critical elements of Russia's efforts to use nuclear rhetoric as a form of reflexive control, as ISW has frequently reported.\n\nRussian officials consistently time nuclear readiness exercises and vague threats of nuclear retaliation with important Western policy decisions regarding the war in Ukraine to force Western decision-makers to self-deter and temper their support for Ukraine. The current apparent resurgence of nuclear rhetoric, this time in the form of planned tactical nuclear weapons exercises, coincides with the imminent arrival of Western weapons in Ukraine. Russian officials are likely using the nuclear weapons information operation to discourage Ukraine's Western partners from providing additional military support and to scare Western decision-makers out of allowing Ukrainian forces to use Western-provided systems to attack legitimate military targets in Russia. Russian troops engage in routine nuclear exercises as part of this wider nuclear rhetoric information operation, but ISW continues to assess that Russia is highly unlikely to use a tactical nuclear weapon on the battlefield in Ukraine or anywhere else.\n\nThe Russian MFA also summoned the British and French ambassadors to Russia as part of the wider ongoing reflexive control campaign aimed at discouraging Western governments from supporting Ukraine.\n\nThe Russian MFA claimed that it summoned British Ambassador to Russia Nigel Casey in connection with recent statements by British Foreign Minister David Cameron asserting that Ukraine has the right to strike military targets inside of Russia.\n\nThe Russian MFA accused Cameron of \"escalating\" the conflict by stating that Ukraine has the right to strike within Russia and warned that Russia can respond by striking \"any British military facilities and equipment on the territory of Ukraine and beyond its borders.\"\n\nRussian MFA Spokeswoman Maria Zakharova and Kremlin newswire TASS also reported that Russia summoned the French Ambassador to Russia due to French leadership's \"belligerent statements and the growing involvement of France in the conflict in Ukraine,\" in response to French President Emmanuel Macron's recent calls for expanded Western security assistance to Ukraine.\n\nRussia likely summoned these ambassadors to discourage France and the UK, and by extension the rest of the West, from providing further support for Ukraine.", "source": {"uri": "odessa-journal.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

This has become regime survival for [Russian Federation President Vladimir] Putin.\n\n\"If he loses in Ukraine, that's the end of the system he's spent a quarter-century building; of course, he'd use nuclear weapons to defend that system.\"\n\nBut Center for Arms Control & Non-Proliferation Senior Policy Director John Erath said the Kremlin's threat to use tactical \"low-yield\" nuclear weapons doesn't make sense since Russia has ample conventional munitions it's \"shown no hesitancy to use.\"\n\n\"They are already using their nuclear weapons. They have made a very clear choice to use their nuclear weapons, including their non-strategic weapons, as a tool of diplomacy -- for blackmail,\" he told The Epoch Times.\n\nThe Kremlin warned the United Kingdom and France that if weapons they provide Ukraine are used inside Russia, or if they send troops to assist Kyiv, they are \"de facto recognized\" as combatants and risk attack.\n\nRussia's Defense Ministry spokesman Dmitry Peskov said on May 6 that Russian forces will stage tactical nuclear weapons exercises in \"the immediate future\" in response to \"provocative statements and threats of certain Western officials.\"\n\nThe ministry cited statements by UK Foreign Secretary David Cameron that Kyiv \"has that right\" to use British weapons to strike inside Russia, and by French President Emmanuel Macron that French troops could \"have a role to play\" in Ukraine.\n\nThat rhetoric simmered further after UK Ambassador to Russia Nigel Casey was summoned to Russia's Foreign Ministry to field a formal protest.\n\nBoth sides claim they lectured each other during the discussion, which Russians call a rebuke and the British describe as a meeting.\n\nIn an ensuing statement, the Kremlin warned the UK that \"any British military facilities and equipment on the territory of Ukraine and abroad could be targeted,\" stressing UK military bases \"outside Ukraine\" are fair game.\n\nMr. Putin and the Kremlin have been threatening to use tactical nuclear weapons with increasing frequency since Russia's February 2022 invasion of Ukraine.\n\nThis round, too, has generally been dismissed.\n\nThe Pentagon, for instance, announced no precautionary actions in response to the threats.\n\nIt has about 1,560 non-strategic weapons capable of being delivered by land, air, and sea systems -- even by drone, the Kremlin claims -- while the United States has about 150 \"low-yield\" battlefield nukes.\n\nIt's an arsenal Russia has invested heavily in the past two decades. As the saber-rattling indicates, it's an advantage the Kremlin is very aware of, Mr. Peters said.\n\n\"People forget Russia has 10 times the number of non-strategic nuclear weapons as the United States and people think, 'Well, these are 'low-yield' weapons,'\" not the massive mushroom cloud planet-enders.\n\n\"The problem is, they have 2,000 arrayed against Western Europe ... and some of them are pretty big[-yield]. People forget that.\"\n\nThat's apparently what Russia is reminding people of with its threats.\n\nThe specificity of the threat, to strike at British bases \"beyond Ukraine\" in one statement and \"outside Ukraine\" in another, poses a potential nightmare scenario.\n\nWhile Russia, or China, may not \"strike the United States [or NATO] in a way that forces it to unload its strategic arsenal on them,\" Mr. Peters said, \"they could be tempted to roll the dice and say, 'If I use a small number of low-yield nuclear weapons within a confined theater of operations against military targets ... maybe I'm tempted.'\"\n\nThat could put the United States in a position where its only option is a world-ending nuclear exchange.\n\n\"That creates so many dilemmas for American presidents and for the U.S. military,\" he said. \"That really concerns me -- it really concerns me.\"\n\nThis requires a policy update to go along with the Pentagon's 30-year $1.5 trillion program to modernize the nation's nuclear triad -- land-based intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs), submarine-launched missiles, and Air Force bombers.\n\nThe Biden administration's proposed defense budget earmarks $49.2 billion to modernize the triad. It has committed $140.9 billion to modernization over the past three years.\n\nDuring a Nov. 15 hearing before the House Armed Services Committee, chair Rep. Mike Rogers (R-Ala.) said among the differences between Mr. Biden's NPR and the report is the commission's urgency in identifying Russia's \"alarming stockpile of nuclear weapons\" as a real threat.\n\nThe SPC's report is \"what Biden's NPR should have been,\" said Mr. Payne, a former Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense and senior adviser to the Secretary of Defense.\n\n\"If I were advising the president, what I would say is we don't have time to build the non-strategic weapons we need over the next 10 years.\n\n\"We need to take the warheads out of ready reserves, those decommissioned warheads out of the stockpile, and slap them on existing cruise missiles and ballistic missiles,\" he said.\n\nIt would \"not be utterly perfect,\" Mr. Peters said, \"but good enough to make Putin and Xi Jinping say, 'Ah, okay, you know what? I don't want to fight this war today.'\"\n\nRussia's most recent threats guarantee the Kremlin would use tactical nukes if things go badly in Ukraine, he said.\n\n\"NATO entering the war as a co-belligerent would mean Russia losing that war,\" Mr. Peters said. \"Of course, it's a serious threat -- that's my biggest concern across our entire deterrence posture.\n\n\"We have a real problem on the non-strategic side of the house.\"\n\nScrambling to expand tactical nuclear arsenals would essentially mean Russia's intimidation has worked, Mr. Erath said, prefacing what will be a point-counterpoint debate to unfold in summer hearings.\n\n\"It's important to note in SPC's report, there was not a specific recommendation to increase the number of U.S. nuclear forces.\n\n\"It is very carefully worded, saying this is something that might need to be considered if current trends continue. It's very specifically worded not to say [that] we need more nukes now,\" he said.\n\nTactical nuclear weapons \"are not really significant in the military sense,\" Mr. Erath said, \"but they're being used regularly as a tool of intimidation, as we saw again this week.\"\n\nThe Pentagon and NATO will certainly be paying attention to whatever drill the Russians stage, not because there's alarm about one being launched but because, as when Russia seized Crimea in 2014 \"under the guise of conducting an exercise,\" there's always concern \"a publicized drill is cover for something else,\" he said.\n\nBut by raising fear in Europe and Congress, \"they're getting a little more intimidation for their money here,\" Mr. Erath said.", "source": {"uri": "theepochtimes.com", "dataType": "news",

A Kremlin statement said the exercises are planned \"in response to provocative statements and threats by certain Western officials against the Russian Federation,\" per Politico Europe. A Ukrainian military spokesman responded to the announcement by calling it \"nuclear blackmail, and a NATO spokesperson said the plan is \"dangerous and irresponsible,\" the BBC reports.\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron had declined last week to rule out sending troops to help Ukraine, if requested by its government, in the fight against Russia's invasion. And UK Foreign Secretary David Cameron said Ukraine has the right to use British weapons to strike in Russia. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said those statements represent a \"completely new round of escalation of tension.\" Other Russian officials said the UK had provided assurances that the long-range missiles delivered to Ukraine would not be used in Russian territory; Cameron's statement means the UK now is a \"party to the conflict,\" they said.\n\nRussia summoned the French and UK ambassadors in Moscow on Monday. The drills will begin \"in the near future,\" officials said, and will involve air and naval forces and missile formations. Tactical nuclear weapons are small nuclear warheads designed to destroy targets without causing radioactive fallout over a broad area, per the BBC. The TASS news agency said the exercise was ordered by President Vladimir Putin, who will be inaugurated on Tuesday for another six-year term, per the AP.

Belarus, a former Soviet Union republic, has maintained strong relations with Russia since the Russian leader launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.\n\nIn January, the Belarusian president announced that Russian nuclear weapons, controlled by Moscow, had arrived in Belarus. Lukashenko said last month that \"several dozen\" tactical nuclear weapons from Russia had been deployed in his country. The drills will involve those weapons.\n\nNewsweek has contacted the Belarusian Ministry of Foreign Affairs for comment by email.\n\nThe surprise nuclear readiness inspection is likely \"part of the Kremlin's re-intensified reflexive control campaign targeting Western decision-making,\" the ISW said.\n\nIt is \"likely meant to bolster the Kremlin's effort to coerce the West into self-deterring from providing additional military assistance to Ukraine,\" the think tank stated, pointing to the timing of the announcement.\n\nA day earlier, Putin ordered tactical nuclear weapons drills in response to what his defense ministry described as provocative statements and threats from the West. The Kremlin last week condemned French President Emmanuel Macron for reaffirming that he wouldn't rule out deploying Western troops in Ukraine, and U.K. Foreign Minister David Cameron for saying that Ukraine has the right to use British weapons to conduct strikes on Russian soil.\n\nBelarus' Defense Minister Viktor Khrenin said that during the drills, \"the entire range of activities from planning, preparation and use of strikes with tactical nuclear weapons will be checked.\" They will involve a squadron of Su-25 aircraft and an Iskander missile division.\n\nWhile Belarus hasn't directly joined the Ukraine conflict, Russian troops have been allowed to perform exercises on Belarusian territory since before the beginning of the war. The country was used by Russia to launch its invasion of Ukraine.\n\nThe ISW noted that Lukashenko \"reiterated standard rhetoric regarding Belarusian doctrine on the deterrent use of nuclear weapons and his desire to avoid entering the war against Ukraine.\"\n\n\"ISW continues to assess that neither Russia nor Belarus seeks nuclear escalation and that their use of nuclear weapons remains unlikely,\" the think tank said.", "source": {"uri": "newsweek.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Newsweek"}, "authors": [{"uri": "isabel_van_brugen@newsweek.com", "name": "Isabel Van Brugen",

Tactical nuclear weapons have a lower yield compared to massive warheads that arm intercontinental ballistic missiles intended to obliterate entire cities.\n\nThe announcement appeared to be a warning to Ukraine's Western allies about becoming more deeply involved in the more than two-year war. Some of Ukraine's Western partners have previously expressed concern about stoking the war amid fears it could spill beyond Ukraine and into a conflict between NATO and Russia.\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron repeated last week that he doesn't exclude sending troops to Ukraine, and U.K. Foreign Secretary David Cameron said Kyiv's forces will be able to use British long-range weapons to strike targets inside Russia. The Kremlin branded those comments as dangerous, heightening tension between Russia and NATO. The war already has placed significant strain on relations between Moscow and the West.\n\nTactical nuclear weapons include air bombs, warheads for short-range missiles and artillery munitions and are meant for use on the battlefield.\n\nThe ministry said the exercise is intended to \"increase the readiness of non-strategic nuclear forces to fulfill combat tasks\" and will be held on President Vladimir Putin's orders. The maneuvers will involve missile units of the Southern Military District along with the air force and the navy, it said.\n\nMeanwhile, Ukrainian drones hit two vehicles Monday in Russia's Belgorod region, killing six people and injuring 35 others, including two children, local authorities said, in an area frequently struck by Kyiv's forces in recent months.One of the vehicles was a minibus that was carrying farm workers, Belgorod Gov. Vyacheslav Gladkov said.\n\nNo other details were immediately available, and it was not possible to independently confirm the report from the border region.\n\nWhile Ukraine's army is largely pinned down on the 1,000-kilometer (600-mile) front line due to a shortage of troops and ammunition after more than two years of fighting, it has used its long-range firepower to hit targets deep inside Russia. The apparent aim is to disrupt Russia's war logistics system by hitting oil refineries and depots, and unnerve the Russian border regions.\n\nThe Belgorod region was a staging ground for Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. It has come under regular attack ever since Russian forces retreated there from northeastern Ukraine early in the war following a counteroffensive by Kyiv.\n\nIn what has largely been a war of attrition, Russia has also relied heavily on long-range missile, artillery and drones to wreak damage on Ukraine.At the end of last year, Belgorod officials said 25 people were killed, including five children, and more than 100 were injured in a Ukrainian attack, and regular rocket and drone strikes have continued since then. The area can be reached by relatively simple and mobile weapons such as multiple rocket launchers from forests on the Ukrainian side.\n\nRussian authorities said in March they planned to evacuate about 9,000 children from the area because of continuous shelling, after Putin said he wanted to create a buffer zone to help protect border regions.", "source": {"uri": "indianexpress.com",

The Kremlin said it came in response to comments by two European leaders that raised the prospect of more direct Western intervention in the war.\n\nThe exercise, the Defense Ministry said, would involve forces of the Southern Military District, an area that covers Russian-occupied Ukraine and part of Russia's border region with Ukraine. It said the exercise would take place \"in the near future.\"\n\nThe order ratchets up tensions with the West at the start of a week of extensive publicity for Putin. His inauguration is scheduled for Tuesday, followed Thursday by the annual Victory Day celebration, which commemorates the Soviet victory in World War II.\n\nIt also coincided with a visit to Europe by President Xi Jinping of China, which has pledged a \"no limits\" alliance with Russia. China has provided support to Russia's military industry, US officials say, despite persistent lobbying from the West that it refrain from aiding Russia's war effort.\n\nWestern officials have long worried that Russia could deploy tactical nuclear weapons, especially if it faced serious setbacks on the battlefield. But Putin denied as recently as March that he had ever considered it, even as he regularly reminds the world of Russia's vast nuclear arsenal as a way of keeping in check the West's military support for Ukraine.\n\nOn Monday, however, Russian officials asserted that warnings about the possibility of more direct Western involvement in the war had changed the situation. The Defense Ministry said the exercise would be held \"to unconditionally ensure the territorial integrity and sovereignty of the Russian state in response to provocative statements and threats of individual Western officials against the Russian Federation.\"\n\nDmitry Peskov, the Kremlin's spokesperson, said the Western \"threats\" in question included a recent interview with President Emmanuel Macron of France published by The Economist, in which the French leader repeated his refusal to rule out sending ground troops to Ukraine.\n\nPeskov also alluded to a comment made last week by David Cameron, Britain's top diplomat, in which he said Ukraine was free to use British weapons to strike inside Russia -- a departure from Western governments' typical policy of discouraging such strikes to avoid being drawn deeper into the war.\n\n\"This is a completely new round of escalation of tensions -- it is unprecedented,\" Peskov told reporters Monday. \"And, of course, it requires special attention and special measures.\"\n\nThe Russian Foreign Ministry said later in the day that it had summoned the British ambassador to lodge Russia's \"strong protest\" over Cameron's statement, asserting that he was \"de facto recognizing his country as a party to the conflict.\"\n\n\"The ambassador was called upon to think about the inevitable catastrophic consequences of such hostile steps from London,\" the Russian Foreign Ministry said.\n\nA spokesperson for Britain's Foreign Office said later that the ambassador met with Russian officials \"for a diplomatic meeting\" and was not officially summoned. The spokesperson said the ambassador, Nigel Casey, \"reiterated the UK's support for Ukraine in the face of unprovoked Russian aggression.\"\n\nRussia has seized the battlefield initiative after a failed Ukrainian counteroffensive last year. But Moscow's advances remain slow and bloody, and new deliveries of Western weapons are on their way, including those from a $61 billion military aid package that the United States approved last month.\n\nBeyond discouraging the West from greater involvement in Ukraine's war effort, the Kremlin wants to exploit divisions within the NATO military alliance over the risks of doing so. That schism was on display in February after Macron first mentioned the possibility of putting Western troops in Ukraine. Peskov said that such a move would lead to a direct clash with Russian forces.\n\nRecent months have marked a hawkish shift for Macron, who more than two years ago tried to head off the invasion of Ukraine by dangling the possibility of integrating Russia into a new European security architecture.\n\nAlso on Monday, two US officials said an American soldier had been arrested in Russia and accused of stealing. Staff Sergeant Gordon Black, 34, was stationed in South Korea and was in the process of returning home to Fort Cavazos in Texas. Instead, officials said he traveled to Russia.\n\nThe officials spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss personnel details.\n\nCynthia Smith, Army spokeswoman, said Russia notified the United States, and the Army told the soldier's family.\n\nRussia's announcement of tactical nuclear drills drew a sharp response from NATO on Monday.\n\n\"Russia's nuclear rhetoric is dangerous and irresponsible,\" said Farah Dakhlallah, a NATO spokesperson. \"NATO remains vigilant.\"\n\nShe added: \"Ukraine has a right to self-defense, which is enshrined in the UN charter, and NATO allies will continue to support Ukraine. Russia has started this illegal war and must end it.\"\n\nPavel Podvig, a scholar on Russian nuclear forces based in Geneva, said Russia had conducted such exercises before, though it rarely made them public. This time, however, the aim is to send a loud message, he said.\n\n\"This is a reaction to specific statements, a signal saying that Russia has nuclear weapons,\" Podvig said.\n\nUnlike strategic nuclear weapons, which are always in a state of combat readiness, nonstrategic ones are stored in warehouses away from the bombers, missiles, or ships that are supposed to deliver them, Podvig said. During the exercise, Russian army formations are likely to practice how they could be deployed, he said.\n\nBut it would make little sense to use them in the context of the war in Ukraine, Podvig added, because the absence of large-scale, concentrated troop formations would limit their impact on the battlefield.", "source": {"uri": "bostonglobe.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Boston

Sign in You are logged in Switch accounts\n\nThe remarks came on the eve of Russian President Vladimir Putin's inauguration to a fifth term in office and in a week when Moscow on Thursday will celebrate Victory Day, its most important secular holiday, marking its defeat of Nazi Germany in World War II.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nThe drills are a response to \"provocative statements and threats of certain Western officials regarding the Russian Federation,\" the Defense Ministry said in a statement.\n\nIt was the first time Russia has publicly announced drills involving tactical nuclear weapons, although its strategic nuclear forces regularly hold exercises. Tactical nuclear weapons include air bombs, warheads for short-range missiles and artillery munitions and are meant for use on a battlefield. They are less powerful than the strategic weapons -- massive warheads that arm intercontinental ballistic missiles and are intended to obliterate entire cities.\n\nThe Russian announcement was a warning to Ukraine's Western allies about becoming more deeply engaged in the 2-year-old war, where the Kremlin's forces have gained an upper hand amid Ukraine's shortage of manpower and weapons. Some of Ukraine's Western partners have previously expressed concern that the conflict could spill beyond Ukraine into a war between NATO and Russia.\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron repeated last week that he doesn't exclude sending troops to Ukraine, and U.K. Foreign Secretary David Cameron said Kyiv's forces will be able to use British long-range weapons to strike targets inside Russia. Some other NATO countries providing weapons to Kyiv have balked at that possibility.\n\nThe Kremlin branded those comments as dangerous, heightening tension between Russia and NATO. The war already has placed significant strain on relations between Moscow and the West.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nKremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Monday that Macron's recent statement and other remarks by British and U.S. officials had prompted the nuclear drills.\n\n\"It's a new round of escalation,\" Peskov said, referring to what the Kremlin regarded as provocative statements. \"It's unprecedented and requires special attention and special measures.\"\n\nRussia's Foreign Ministry summoned both the French and British ambassadors. It urged the British ambassador \"to think about the inevitable catastrophic consequences of such hostile steps from London.\"\n\nSweden's Foreign Minister Tobias Billstr\u00f6m said the nuclear exercises \"contribute to increasing instability.\"\n\n\"In the current security situation, Russia's actions may be considered particularly irresponsible and reckless,\" Billstr\u00f6m told Swedish news agency TT.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nDmitry Medvedev, the deputy head of Russia's Security Council that's chaired by Putin, said in his typically hawkish fashion that the comments by Macron and Cameron risked pushing the nuclear-armed world toward a \"global catastrophe.\"\n\nIt wasn't the first time Europe's military support for Ukraine has prompted nuclear saber-rattling. In March 2023, after the U.K.'s decision to provide Ukraine with armor-piercing shells containing depleted uranium, Putin said he intends to deploy tactical nuclear weapons on the territory of Ukraine neighbor Belarus.\n\nThe ministry said the exercise is intended to \"increase the readiness of non-strategic nuclear forces to fulfill combat tasks\" and will be held on Putin's orders. The maneuvers will involve missile units of the Southern Military District along with the air force and the navy, it said.\n\nThe Russian announcement stirred little reaction in Ukraine, where the spokesman for the Military Intelligence agency, Andrii Yusov, said on national television: \"Nuclear blackmail is a usual practice of Putin's regime; it does not constitute major news.\"\n\nWestern officials have blamed Russia for threatening a wider war through provocative acts. NATO countries said last week they are deeply concerned by a campaign of hybrid activities on the military alliance's soil, accusing Moscow of being behind them and saying they represent a security threat.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nPeskov dismissed those claims as \"new, unfounded accusations leveled at our country.\"\n\nGermany said Monday it recalled its ambassador to Russia for a week of consultations in Berlin following an alleged computer hack of Chancellor Olaf Scholz's party.\n\nMeanwhile, Ukrainian drones hit two vehicles Monday in Russia's Belgorod region, killing six people and injuring 35 others, including two children, local authorities said. The area has been hit by Kyiv's forces in recent months.\n\nOne of the vehicles was a minibus carrying farm workers, Belgorod Gov. Vyacheslav Gladkov said.\n\nIt was not possible to independently confirm the report.\n\nWhile Ukraine's army is largely pinned down on the 1,000-kilometer (600-mile) front line due to a shortage of troops and ammunition after more than two years of fighting, it has used its long-range firepower to hit targets deep inside Russia.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nIn what has largely been a war of attrition, Russia also has relied heavily on long-range missile, artillery and drones to wreak damage on Ukraine.\n\nThe Kremlin's forces kept up their bombardment of Ukraine's power grid, with a nighttime Russian drone attack targeting energy infrastructure in Ukraine's northern region of Sumy. Multiple towns and villages in the region, including Sumy, lost power, regional authorities said.\n\nRussia attacked Ukrainian targets with 13 Shahed drones overnight, 12 of which were intercepted in the Sumy region, Ukraine's air force said.\n\n___\n\nFollow AP's coverage of the war in Ukraine at https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine", "source": {"uri": "thestar.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

Some of Ukraine's Western partners have previously expressed concern about stoking the war amid fears it could spill beyond Ukraine and into a conflict between Nato and Russia.\n\nEmmanuel Macron, France's president, repeated last week that he does not exclude sending troops to Ukraine, and Lord Cameron, the Foreign Secretary, said Kyiv's forces would be able to use British long-range weapons to strike targets inside Russia.\n\nThe Kremlin described those comments as dangerous, adding to tension between Russia and Nato.\n\n\"It's obvious we are talking about statements from Mr Macron and statements from British representatives,\" Dmitry Peskov, the Kremlin spokesman, said when asked by reporters what had prompted the drills, adding: \"This is a completely new round of escalating tensions. It is unprecedented and requires special measures.\"\n\nTactical nuclear weapons include air bombs, warheads for short-range missiles and artillery munitions and are meant for use on the battlefield.\n\nThe ministry said the exercise is intended to \"increase the readiness of non-strategic nuclear forces to fulfil combat tasks\" and will be held on Putin's orders. The manoeuvers will involve missile units of the Southern Military District along with the air force and the navy, it said.\n\nMeanwhile, Ukrainian drones hit two vehicles Monday in Russia's Belgorod region, killing six people and injuring 35 others, including two children, local authorities said, in an area frequently struck by Kyiv's forces in recent months.\n\nOne of the vehicles was a minibus that was carrying farm workers, Vyacheslav Gladkov, the Belgorod governor, said.\n\nNo other details were immediately available, and it was not possible to independently confirm the report from the border region.\n\nWhile Ukraine's army is largely pinned down on the 1,000-kilometre (600-mile) front line due to a shortage of troops and ammunition after more than two years of fighting, it has used its long-range firepower to hit targets deep inside Russia. The apparent aim is to disrupt Russia's war logistics system by hitting oil refineries and depots, and unnerve the Russian border regions.\n\nThe Belgorod region was a staging ground for Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. It has come under regular attack ever since Russian forces retreated there from northeastern Ukraine early in the war following a counter-offensive by Kyiv.", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com",

It was the first time such an exercise had been publicly announced by Moscow.\n\nBelarus' Defence Minister Viktor Khrenin said a unit of Iskander short-range missiles and a squadron of Su-25 fighter jets will take part in the drills.\n\nThe maneuvers, held jointly with Russia, began as Russian President Vladimir Putin was inaugurated to a fifth term on Tuesday, vowing to ensure Russia's security.\n\nLast year, Russia moved some of its tactical nuclear weapons into Belarus, which also borders Ukraine and NATO members Poland, Latvia and Lithuania. Belarus' authoritarian President Alexander Lukashenko has relied on close ties with Russia and provided his country as a staging ground for the war in Ukraine.\n\nMoscow has emphasized that the tactical nuclear weapons deployed to Belarus remain under Russian military control.\n\nUnlike nuclear-tipped intercontinental ballistic missiles that can destroy entire cities, tactical nuclear weapons intended for use against troops on the battlefield are less powerful. Such weapons include aerial bombs, warheads for short-range missiles and artillery munitions.\n\nThe deployment of tactical nuclear weapons to Belarus, which has a 1,084-kilometre (673-mile) border with Ukraine, would allow Russian aircraft and missiles to reach potential targets there more easily and quickly if Moscow decides to use them. It also extends Russia's capability to target several NATO allies in Eastern and Central Europe.\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin, left, and Belarus President Alexander Lukashenko shake hands. (Dmitry Astakhov, Sputnik, Government Pool Photo via AP, File)\n\nBoth Putin and Lukashenko said that the Russian nuclear weapons' deployment to Belarus was intended to counter perceived Western threats.\n\nLukashenko on Tuesday cast the drills as \"exclusively defensive,\" arguing that the Russian nuclear weapons are intended to deter any potential aggression against Belarus. \"This is a weapon of deterrence, a defensive weapon,\" Lukashenko said.\n\nThe Belarusian leader said the drills will involve the delivery of tactical nuclear weapons from storage to military units where they will be mounted on missiles and attached to warplanes. The missile units will practice covert deployment to firing positions to simulate a response to an attack on Belarus, he said.\n\nBelarus' opposition leader Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya, who was forced to leave the country under official pressure after challenging Lukashenko in an August 2020 presidential vote, met on Tuesday with NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg and denounced the Russian nuclear weapons' presence in Belarus.\n\n\"Nuclear weapons turn Belarus and Belarusians into targets,\" she said. \"The Russian nuclear weapons in Belarus raise a direct threat to lives and health of citizens of all Europe.\"", "source": {"uri": "ctvnews.ca", "dataType": "news", "title": "CTV News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tactical_nuclear_weapon",

Disinformation Digest | UACRISIS.ORG", "body": "Propaganda Digest: This is part of a series of analyses that exposes the most exaggerated, misleading, and outrageous rhetoric from recent Russian media sources, aimed at promoting critical thinking to better debunk the manipulation of Russian propaganda.\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin's recent order to increase the readiness of the Russian Armed Forces to use tactical nuclear weapons was a continuation of the Russian regime's attempts to intimidate Europe and other democracies. The escalating horror stories of Russian propagandists appear every time partners declare increased support for Ukraine in its resistance to Russian aggression. To optimize the impact of blackmail, Moscow strategically disseminates its message across various media platforms, leveraging nuanced connotations to sway European public opinion effectively. In this digest, we analyse how Russian propaganda tries to instrumentalise threats of nuclear weapons against Ukraine's allies.\n\nSergey Markov, Russian political scientist (68, 310 subscribers):\n\n\"That is, these are exercises on the use of tactical nuclear weapons in the Northern Military District. Against who? Against the Ukrainian Armed Forces? No. TNW (tactical nuclear weapon - ed.) will be against French troops, which Macron wants to send to Ukraine. To liberate Ukraine from NATO occupation. The use of tactical nuclear weapons against the NWS (nuclear-weapon state - ed.) of France does not violate international law.\"\n\nYulia Vityazeva, Host at Russian propaganda TV channels (70, 214 subscribers):\n\n\"The insane [meaning the West] are aggressively promising and threatening Putin with retaliatory use of nuclear weapons by NATO. The fact that none of them will survive due to such an exchange of pleasantries does not bother them because they are imbeciles. But the reaction of the West will be fascinating. [...] Right now, they are busy trying to lift their jaws off the floor.\"\n\nLegitimyi, anonymous Telegram channel (1, 020, 331 subscribers):\n\n\"If someone wants to drag Moldova into a war, then the residents of this country should understand that it is not Iskanders that can fly at their military installations, but tactical nuclear weapons.\"\n\nZeRada, anonymous Telegram channel (415, 841 subscribers):\n\n\"Remember when we wrote that F-16s might appear as missile carriers for an attack on the Crimean Bridge? Through rhetorical escalation, the Russian Federation is trying to convince the West not to strike on the night before the inauguration.\"\n\nVerified: The Kremlin uses nuclear weapons as a means of political pressure on the Western politics to deter from countering Russian expansion. Through such threats, Putin's regime is trying to influence public sentiment so that the population of Ukraine's partner states pressures their authorities and delays the adoption of important security decisions.\n\nRussian propaganda used this narrative on the eve of NATO exercises and the transfer of long-range ATACMS missiles to Ukraine.\n\nRussian information forces are trying to intimidate neighboring countries. At the same time, the prospect of a full-scale nuclear war is very threatening for Russia. The open use of nuclear weapons could greatly affect the balance of power around the world and have global consequences for the stability of the Putin regime.\n\nDmitriy Medvedev, Deputy Chairman of the Security Council of the Russian Federation (1, 342, 128 subscribers):\n\n\"There is some total degradation of the ruling class in the West. This class does not want to connect elementary things logically. Sending your troops to the territory of ex-Ukraine will direct their countries into the war, to which we must respond. And, alas, not in the territory of ex-Ukraine.\"\n\nPeskov to TASS, Russian propagandistic media (413, 154 subscribers):\n\n\"The West is provoking an unprecedented round of tension in Ukraine; this requires response measures from Russia.\"\n\nSergey Mardan, Russian publicist (240, 994 subscribers):\n\n\"The talk of Western politicians about sending their soldiers to Ukraine will have consequences. And any real escalation will be met with a magical, crushing response - tactical nuclear weapons. Or maybe it won't. This is the very state of strategic uncertainty that Macron loves to talk about.\"\n\nSergey Markov, Russian political scientist (68,310 subscribers):\n\n\"That is, with the threat of tactical nuclear weapons, Russia is trying to stop a new stage of NATO aggression. They plan to fire missiles at Moscow. We threaten them, don't do it.\"\n\nVerified: Russia uses 'atomic-bloodbath' rhetoric as a magic wand that should influence the decision-making process in NATO countries. At the same time Russia has long refused to allow international observers to inspect its nuclear arsenal and has withdrawn from some important international treaties limiting its use of atomic weapons. In this way, the Kremlin caused tension in the global community.\n\nRussian propaganda uses the potential introduction of a military contingent of NATO countries into Ukraine as an excuse for the use of tactical nuclear weapons. Still, at the same time, it has placed its nuclear weapons on the territory of its ally Belarus, which is a direct escalation against European countries. Moreover, this does not consider the numerous provocations on the NATO border, which we have written about here.", "source": {"uri": "uacrisis.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "Uacrisis.org"},

Here's a look at tactical nuclear weapons and the part they play in the Kremlin's political messaging.\n\nWhat are tactical nuclear weapons?\n\nUnlike nuclear-tipped intercontinental ballistic missiles that can destroy entire cities, tactical nuclear weapons for use against troops on the battlefield are less powerful and can have a yield as small as about 1 kiloton. The U.S. bomb dropped on Hiroshima during World War II was 15 kilotons.\n\nSuch battlefield nuclear weapons -- aerial bombs, warheads for short-range missiles or artillery munitions -- can be very compact. Their small size allows them to be discreetly carried on a truck or plane.\n\nPeople are also reading...

But he later toned down his statements as Ukraine's offensive last summer failed to reach its goals and Russia scored more gains on the battlefield.\n\nMoscow's defense doctrine envisages a nuclear response to an atomic strike or even an attack with conventional weapons that \"threaten the very existence of the Russian state.\" That vague wording led some pro-Kremlin Russian experts to urge Putin to sharpen it to force the West to take the warnings more seriously.\n\nPutin said last fall that he sees no reason for such a change.\n\n\"There is no situation in which anything would threaten Russian statehood and the existence of the Russian state,\" he said. \"I think that no person of sober mind and clear memory could have an idea to use nuclear weapons against Russia.\"\n\nWhy did Russia send nuclear weapons to Belarus?\n\nLast year, Russia moved some of its tactical nuclear weapons into the territory of Belarus, an ally that neighbors Ukraine and NATO members Poland, Latvia and Lithuania.\n\nBelarus' authoritarian president, Alexander Lukashenko, had long urged Moscow to station nuclear weapons in his country, which has close military ties with Russia and served as a staging ground for the war in Ukraine.\n\nBoth Putin and Lukashenko said that nuclear weapons deployment to Belarus was intended to counter perceived Western threats. Last year, Putin specifically linked the move to the U.K. government's decision to provide Ukraine with armor-piercing shells containing depleted uranium. Neither leader said how many were moved -- only that Soviet-era facilities in the country were readied to accommodate them, and that Belarusian pilots and missile crews were trained to use them. The weapons have remained under Russian military control.\n\nThe deployment of tactical nuclear weapons to Belarus, which has a 673-mile border with Ukraine, would allow Russian aircraft and missiles to reach potential targets there more easily and quickly, if Moscow decides to use them. It also extended Russia's capability to target several NATO allies in Eastern and Central Europe.\n\nTags Armed Forces Politics Weapons Atomic Physics Government Departments And Ministries Rocket

It was the first time such an exercise had been publicly announced by Moscow.\n\n\u00d7\n\nAlready a Subscriber? Sign in You are logged in Switch accounts\n\nBelarus' Defense Minister Viktor Khrenin said a unit of Iskander short-range missiles and a squadron of Su-25 fighter jets will take part in the drills.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nThe maneuvers, held jointly with Russia, began as Russian President Vladimir Putin was inaugurated to a fifth term on Tuesday, vowing to ensure Russia's security.\n\nLast year, Russia moved some of its tactical nuclear weapons into Belarus, which also borders Ukraine and NATO members Poland, Latvia and Lithuania. Belarus' authoritarian President Alexander Lukashenko has relied on close ties with Russia and provided his country as a staging ground for the war in Ukraine.\n\nMoscow has emphasized that the tactical nuclear weapons deployed to Belarus remain under Russian military control.\n\nUnlike nuclear-tipped intercontinental ballistic missiles that can destroy entire cities, tactical nuclear weapons intended for use against troops on the battlefield are less powerful. Such weapons include aerial bombs, warheads for short-range missiles and artillery munitions.\n\nThe deployment of tactical nuclear weapons to Belarus, which has a 1,084-kilometer (673-mile) border with Ukraine, would allow Russian aircraft and missiles to reach potential targets there more easily and quickly if Moscow decides to use them. It also extends Russia's capability to target several NATO allies in Eastern and Central Europe.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nBoth Putin and Lukashenko said that the Russian nuclear weapons' deployment to Belarus was intended to counter perceived Western threats.\n\nLukashenko on Tuesday cast the drills as \"exclusively defensive,\" arguing that the Russian nuclear weapons are intended to deter any potential aggression against Belarus. \"This is a weapon of deterrence, a defensive weapon,\" Lukashenko said.\n\nThe Belarusian leader said the drills will involve the delivery of tactical nuclear weapons from storage to military units where they will be mounted on missiles and attached to warplanes. The missile units will practice covert deployment to firing positions to simulate a response to an attack on Belarus, he said.\n\nBelarus' opposition leader Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya, who was forced to leave the country under official pressure after challenging Lukashenko in an August 2020 presidential vote, met on Tuesday with NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg and denounced the Russian nuclear weapons' presence in Belarus.\n\n\"Nuclear weapons turn Belarus and Belarusians into targets,\" she said. \"The Russian nuclear weapons in Belarus raise a direct threat to lives and health of

That's more than can be said about the US nuclear arsenal, with US doctrine allowing for nukes to be used preemptively, and even against non-nuclear armed adversaries.The military observer doesn't think any drills will involve the use of live nuclear rounds, given Russia's continued adherence to a commitment not to engage in nuclear testing of any kind.\"If we're talking about foreign policy, [Kremlin spokesman] Dmitry Peskov said that this is a certain signal to those Western countries 'playing war' in Ukraine, who are planning officially to send contingents of troops there, who are going to supply some types of weapons that will allow Ukraine to fire on our territories,\" Leonkov explained.It's clear that the exercises were ordered by President Putin in his capacity as supreme commander-in-chief, Leonkov believes.\"But before this there was his statement [in March] about F-16 aircraft based in NATO countries participating in hostilities on the territory of Ukraine, and that it doesn't matter who's flying them - Ukrainian or non-Ukrainian pilots - that [Russia] will consider the matter of airfields where these aircraft are based and take off from, that they will become our legitimate targets. But apparently, this warning by our president was not heard in the West,\" Leonkov explained.Regarding Monday's MoD announcement about the planned tactical nuclear missile drills, Leonkov warned that

It was the first time such an exercise had been publicly announced by Moscow.\n\nAlso Read | China Stabbing Update: Death Toll in Zhenxiong County Hospital Attack in Yunnan Province Rises to Ten.\n\nBelarus' Defence Minister Viktor Khrenin said a unit of Iskander short-range missiles and a squadron of Su-25 fighter jets will take part in the drills.\n\nThe maneuvers, held jointly with Russia, began as Russian President Vladimir Putin was inaugurated to a fifth term on Tuesday, vowing to ensure Russia's security.\n\nAlso Read | China Stabbing: Two Killed, 21 Injured in Knife Attack at Zhenxiong County Hospital in Yunnan Province.\n\nLast year, Russia moved some of its tactical nuclear weapons into Belarus, which also borders Ukraine and NATO members Poland, Latvia and Lithuania. Belarus' authoritarian President Alexander Lukashenko has relied on close ties with Russia and provided his country as a staging ground for the war in Ukraine.\n\nMoscow has emphasised that the tactical nuclear weapons deployed to Belarus remain under Russian military control.\n\nUnlike nuclear-tipped intercontinental ballistic missiles that can destroy entire cities, tactical nuclear weapons intended for use against troops on the battlefield are less powerful. Such weapons include aerial bombs, warheads for short-range missiles and artillery munitions.\n\nThe deployment of tactical nuclear weapons to Belarus, which has a 1,084-kilometer (673-mile) border with Ukraine, would allow Russian aircraft and missiles to reach potential targets there more easily and quickly if Moscow decides to use them. It also extends Russia's capability to target several NATO allies in Eastern and Central Europe.\n\nBoth Putin and Lukashenko said that the Russian nuclear weapons' deployment to Belarus was intended to counter perceived Western threats.\n\nLukashenko on Tuesday cast the drills as \"exclusively defensive,\" arguing that the Russian nuclear weapons are intended to deter any potential aggression against Belarus. \"This is a weapon of deterrence, a defensive weapon,\" Lukashenko said.\n\nThe Belarusian leader said the drills will involve the delivery of tactical nuclear weapons from storage to military units where they will be mounted on missiles and attached to warplanes. The missile units will practice covert deployment to firing positions to simulate a response to an attack on Belarus, he said.\n\nBelarus' opposition leader Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya, who was forced to leave the country under official pressure after challenging Lukashenko in an August 2020 presidential vote, met on Tuesday with NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg and denounced the Russian nuclear weapons' presence in Belarus.\n\n\"Nuclear weapons turn Belarus and Belarusians into targets,\" she said. \"The Russian nuclear weapons in Belarus raise a direct threat to lives and health of citizens of all Europe.\" (AP)", "source": {"uri": "latestly.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "LatestLY"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tactical_nuclear_weapon",

It's completely inappropriate given the current security situation,\" Pentagon spokesman Major General Pat Ryder said.\n\n\"We've not seen any change in their strategic force posture.... Obviously, we'll continue to monitor,\" he added.\n\nThe role of strategic nuclear weapons is to strike enemy targets far from the front line, while tactical nuclear weapons are designed to be used on battlefields.\n\nThe exercise is meant to increase the ability of Russia's military to \"ensure the territorial integrity and sovereignty of the Russian state in response to provocative statements and threats of individual Western officials against the Russian Federation,\" the statement said, without elaborating.\n\nKremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov, when asked by journalists what had prompted the announcement on nuclear readiness, said, \"It's obvious we are talking about statements from Mr. Macron and statements from British representatives,\"\n\n\"This is a completely new round of escalating tensions. It is unprecedented and requires special measures,\" Peskov said.\n\nSeparately, the governor of Russia's Belgorod region bordering Ukraine said on Telegram that seven people were killed and 42 wounded by Ukrainian drones near Berezovka, in the Borisov district close to the Ukrainian frontier, when two buses carrying workers to a pig farm were struck by Ukrainian drones.\n\nUkraine has not commented on the claim, which could not be independently confirmed.\n\nUkraine has been subjected to almost daily Russian missile and drone strikes that have caused huge damage to its civilian and energy infrastructure and killed and wounded numerous civilians, including children.\n\nIn response, Kyiv has targeted energy infrastructure inside Russia, especially oil refining installations.\n\nRussia on May 6 said its forces had taken control of the settlements of Solovyove in Ukraine's eastern Donetsk region and Kotlyarivka in the Kharkiv region.\n\nUkrainian authorities did not acknowledge the potential loss of the settlements, but many Ukrainian bloggers appeared to confirm that both had been taken by Russia.\n\nEarlier the Ukrainian Air Force said it had downed 12 out of 13 drones launched by Russia at energy infrastructure targets in the Sumy region. The regional administration said the electricity supply was temporarily cut in Sumy, Romniy, and Okhtyrka.", "source": {"uri": "rferl.org", "dataType": "news", "title":

Tactical nuclear weapons include air bombs, warheads for shortrange missiles and artillery munitions and are meant for use on a battlefield. They are less powerful than the massive warheads that arm intercontinental ballistic missiles and are intended to obliterate entire cities.\n\nPeople are also reading...

Some of Ukraine's Western partners have previously expressed concern that the conflict could spill beyond Ukraine into a war between NATO and Russia.\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron repeated last week that he doesn't exclude sending troops to Ukraine, and U.K. Foreign Secretary David Cameron said Kyiv's forces will be able to use British long-range weapons to strike targets inside Russia. Some other NATO countries providing weapons to Kyiv have balked at that possibility.\n\nThe Kremlin branded those comments as dangerous, heightening tension between Russia and NATO. The war already has placed significant strain on relations between Moscow and the West.\n\nKremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Monday that Macron's recent statement and other remarks by British and U.S. officials had prompted the nuclear drills.\n\n\"It's a new round of escalation,\" Peskov said, referring to what the Kremlin regarded as provocative statements. \"It's unprecedented and requires special attention and special measures.\"\n\nDmitry Medvedev, the deputy head of Russia's Security Council that's chaired by Putin, said in his typically hawkish fashion that the comments by Macron and Cameron risked pushing the nuclear-armed world toward a \"global catastrophe.\"\n\nIt wasn't the first time Europe's military support for Ukraine has prompted nuclear saber-rattling. In March 2023, after the U.K.'s decision to provide Ukraine with armor-piercing shells containing depleted uranium, Putin said he intends to deploy tactical nuclear weapons on the territory of Ukraine neighbor Belarus.\n\n0 Comments Love 0 Funny 0 Wow 0 Sad 0 Angry 0\n\nBe the first to know\n\nGet local news delivered to your inbox!\n\nSign up! * I understand and agree that registration on or use

It has come under regular attack ever since Russian forces retreated there from north-eastern Ukraine early in the war following a counter-offensive by Kyiv.\n\nIn what has largely been a war of attrition, Russia has also relied heavily on long-range missile, artillery and drones to wreak damage on Ukraine.\n\nAt the end of last year, Belgorod officials said 25 people were killed, including five children, and more than 100 were injured in a Ukrainian attack, and regular rocket and drone strikes have continued since then.\n\nThe area can be reached by relatively simple and mobile weapons such as multiple rocket launchers from forests on the Ukrainian side.\n\nRussian authorities said in March they planned to evacuate about 9,000 children from the area because of continuous shelling, after Mr Putin said he wanted to create a buffer zone to help protect border regions.", "source": {"uri": "dailyecho.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Southern Daily Echo"}, "authors": [],

"The announcement of military exercises simulating the use of tactical nuclear weapons announced by Russia's Defence Ministry on the eve of Vladimir Putin's inauguration as president for a fifth term in office were calculated to sow doubt and disunity among western allies, analysts told Euronews.\n\nKremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov labelled comments by Britain's David Cameron and France's Emmanuel Macron \"dangerous\", warning of a direct escalation of the conflict that could potentially threaten European security - though analysts saw the move less as imminent threat so much as a fresh attempt to divide Western support for Ukraine.\n\n\"It's meant to intimidate and create psychological pressure, but not just directly to these countries, but also to countries who are watching and who are perhaps a bit more cautious, because probably that will make them a bit more cautious,\" Maria Martisiute, policy analyst at the European Policy Centre, told Euronews.\n\nEarlier on Monday, Britain's Foreign Secretary David Cameron said during a visit to Kyiv that Ukraine will be able to use British long-range weapons to strike targets inside Russia, while last week French Prime Minister Emmanuel Macron repeated that the possibility of sending troops to Ukraine is not off the table.\n\nThough not new, such remarks make Russia 'uneasy', spurring the regime to respond with threats, especially in the current context, according to Martisiute.\n\n\"We should keep in mind that Chinese President Xi Jinping is in Europe, but also that the $61 billion support from America has been passed and that Ukraine is planning a counter-offensive in 2025,\" the EPC analyst argued.\n\n\"Russia knows that manoeuvres make the West nervous, as in the past, manoeuvres were often part of a preparatory phase for something,\" Gustav Gressel, senior policy fellow with ECFR, told Euronews.\n\nSince the start of the full-scale invasion of Ukraine, Putin has repeatedly reminded Western countries of Russia's nuclear capabilities in an attempt to dissuade them from deepening their military support for the country led by Volodymyr Zelensky - but this is the first time such an exercise has been publicly announced.\n\n\"Russia is clearly trying to inject further ambiguity in its nuclear doctrine with these moves,\" said Dylan Macchiarini, EU foreign policy researcher at CEPS.\n\nMoscow's move follows a decision in 2023 to place its tactical nuclear weapons on Belarusian soil, as part of an effort by both Eastern leaders to counter perceived Western threats.\n\nTactical nuclear weapons, which range from aerial bombs to warheads for short-range missiles and artillery ammunition, are less powerful than strategic weapons because they're designed to be used on the battlefield, not to wipe out entire cities.\n\nBy way of comparison, while the US bomb dropped on Hiroshima in 1945 was 15 kilotons, a tactical nuclear weapon could only yield about one kiloton.\n\nBut since Belarus shares a border of more than 1,000 kilometres with Ukraine, Putin's decision to deploy these tactical nuclear weapons would mean that Russia could reach potential targets more easily and quickly.\n\n\"This move further raises the stakes at play and will create more headaches for military planners in the US, Europe and Ukraine who will continue to grapple with what constitutes the threshold for Russian first use,\" Macchiarini added.\n\nThe number of weapons deployed in Belarus is still unknown, but the CEPS researcher sees the Russian decision as a way of distracting public opinion and undermining Western support for Ukraine, but believes it will have the opposite effect.\n\n\"It would be helpful to remind Moscow that most of these NATO countries also have the same nuclear capability,\" Martisiute also stressed.\n\nWith Moscow celebrating on Thursday its most important secular holiday, Victory Day, marking its defeat of the Nazis in World War II, the ECFR analyst believes that Russia's leader is feeling powerful again, as Putin only issues nuclear threats when he feels strong.\n\n\"This is because he knows that if he uses them, or threatens to use them, he would enter a dangerous game of escalation with the West,\" Gressel stressed, adding that Putin most likely thinks the West will hardly risk escalation for Kyiv at the moment.\n\n\"If we don't like it, we should make him feel weak again,\" the ECFR analyst said, by providing Kyiv with the necessary resources, lifting restrictions on the use of Western weapons systems, or even arming our side with a clear threat of direct involvement in the conflict if they use nuclear weapons.", "source": {"uri": "euronews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Euronews English"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Tactical nuclear weapons include air bombs, warheads for shortrange missiles and artillery munitions and are meant for use on a battlefield. They are less powerful than the massive warheads that arm intercontinental ballistic missiles and are intended to obliterate entire cities.\n\nPeople are also reading...

Some of Ukraine's Western partners have previously expressed concern that the conflict could spill beyond Ukraine into a war between NATO and Russia.\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron repeated last week that he doesn't exclude sending troops to Ukraine, and U.K. Foreign Secretary David Cameron said Kyiv's forces will be able to use British long-range weapons to strike targets inside Russia. Some other NATO countries providing weapons to Kyiv have balked at that possibility.\n\nThe Kremlin branded those comments as dangerous, heightening tension between Russia and NATO. The war already has placed significant strain on relations between Moscow and the West.\n\nKremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Monday that Macron's recent statement and other remarks by British and U.S. officials had prompted the nuclear drills.\n\n\"It's a new round of escalation,\" Peskov said, referring to what the Kremlin regarded as provocative statements. \"It's unprecedented and requires special attention and special measures.\"\n\nDmitry Medvedev, the deputy head of Russia's Security Council that's chaired by Putin, said in his typically hawkish fashion that the comments by Macron and Cameron risked pushing the nuclear-armed world toward a \"global catastrophe.\"\n\nIt wasn't the first time Europe's military support for Ukraine has prompted nuclear saber-rattling. In March 2023, after the U.K.'s decision to provide Ukraine with arm-or-piercing shells containing depleted uranium, Putin said he intends to deploy tactical nuclear weapons on the territory of Ukraine neighbor Belarus.\n\nTags Armed Forces Weapons Politics Job Market International Law Be the first to know\n\nGet local news delivered to your inbox!\n\nSign up! * I understand and agree that

Roughly speaking, they are trying to 'simmer' our country.\"\n\nThe exercises, first announced Monday, would see missile, aviation and naval units of Russia's Southern Military Command \"practice the preparation and use of non-strategic nuclear weapons,\" according to the Russian Defense Ministry.\n\nWhile such maneuvers have been viewed as routine in the past, this is the first such exercise to be conducted since Russia launched its war in Ukraine on February 22, 2022, and the training was said by the Russian military specifically to be taking place \"in response to provocative statements and threats of individual Western officials against the Russian Federation.\"\n\n\"We are not threatening anyone,\" Antonov said. \"However, the strategists in Washington who had gone off the rails as well as its satellites in Europe must understand that in the spurred rise of stakes, Russia will use all means to protect its sovereignty and territorial integrity. The West will not succeed in the unilateral escalation game it tries to play.\"\n\nTensions between Russia and the U.S.-led NATO military alliance have risen substantially since the outbreak of the war in Ukraine. The White House has accused the Kremlin of waging a war of aggression against its neighbor, while Moscow has accused Washington and its allies of looking to use Kyiv to further expand NATO presence along Russia's borders.\n\nWith the conflict predominantly locked in stalemate for more than a year, and recent Russian advances along key axes, the U.S. and other Western supporters have expanded military assistance to Ukraine.\n\nA statement issued Monday by the Russian Foreign Ministry regarding the recent nuclear exercises specifically called out the presence of U.S.-provided MGM-140 Army Tactical Missile Systems (ATACMS) as well as \"British and French long-range missile systems\" on the battlefield. It also cited statements by U.K. Foreign Secretary David Cameron, who suggested Western weapons could be used to strike within Russian territory, and French President Emmanuel Macron, who has repeatedly discussed the potential of sending troops to Ukraine.\n\nThe Russian Foreign Ministry took aim at U.S.-built F-16s approved to be sent to Ukraine as well, arguing that Moscow \"will perceive them as carriers of nuclear weapons and consider this step by the United States and NATO as a deliberate provocation.\"\n\n\"These and some other actions of the member states of the North Atlantic bloc actually indicate that they are deliberately leading to a further escalation of the Ukrainian crisis towards an open military clash between NATO countries and Russia as part of the implementation of a hostile course to inflict a 'strategic defeat' on our country,\" the Russian Foreign Ministry said.\n\nMeanwhile, the ministry expressed \"hope\" that the nuclear drills \"will cool down the 'hotheads' in Western capitals, help them realize the possible catastrophic consequences of the strategic risks they generate, and keep them from assisting the Kiev regime in its terrorist actions and from being drawn into a direct armed confrontation with Russia.\"\n\nBut news of the exercises was met with criticism in Washington, where U.S. State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller stated that, \"Russia's rhetoric -- their nuclear rhetoric -- has been reckless and irresponsible throughout this conflict.\"\n\n\"That said,\" he told reporters, \"we have not seen any reason to adjust our own nuclear posture in response to these announcements, nor any indications that Russia is preparing to use a nuclear weapon in Ukraine.\"\n\nPentagon Press Secretary Air Force Major General Pat Ryder also criticized the announcement during a press briefing Monday, calling it \"an example of the kind of irresponsible rhetoric that we've seen from Russia in the past.\"\n\n\"It's completely inappropriate, given the current security situation,\" Ryder said. \"And, you know, we've not seen any change in their strategic force posture. Obviously, we'll continue to monitor. But it's just, yes, irresponsible rhetoric.\"", "source": {"uri": "newsweek.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Newsweek"}, "authors": [{"uri": "tom_o_connor@newsweek.com", "name": "Tom O'Connor",

To carry it out, the general staffs of the armed forces of Belarus and Russia have envisaged an inspection of the forces and means of a joint regional group of forces, within the framework of which it is planned for the first time to work out the issues of the use of non-strategic nuclear weapons.\n\n\"During the inspection, special ammunition will be supplied to missile and aviation military units, loaded onto launchers, and suspended on aircraft. Missile divisions of the Iskander and Polonez operational-tactical systems will be secretly withdrawn to designated positions and will practice missile strikes to repel a possible attack on Belarus.\"\n\nNon-strategic nuclear weapons, also known as tactical nuclear weapons, are designed for use on the battlefield. They have yet to be used in combat yet their warheads are can be delivered via missiles, aircraft, or artillery. While not as potentially devastating as strategic nuclear weapons, which can destroy whole cities, they could nevertheless be highly destructive.\n\nMoscow and Minsk finalized an agreement in May 2023 to allow Russia to position tactical nuclear weapons in Belarus. In June President Vladimir Putin said that deliveries had begun, then in December Lukashenko confirmed that deliveries had been completed in October. This was the first time that nuclear weapons had been placed outside of Russia's borders.\n\nAlthough Russia has said the retained control of the warheads they provided Belarus with the means of delivery, including Iskander-M ballistic missiles, in January 2024 as well as help in modifying Minsk's Polonez-M 300mm multi-barrelled rocket launcher system to allow it to lanch nuclear-tipped missiles.\n\nA the same time Khrenin announced at a January meeting of Minsk's security council that Belarus had amended its military doctrine to allow the use of nuclear weapons.\n\n\"We will clearly communicate our views on the use of tactical nuclear weapons stationed on our territory,\" Khrenin said. \"A new chapter has appeared, where we will clearly define our allied obligations to our allies.\"\n\nBelarus held both tactical and long-range nuclear weapons when part of the Soviet Union as did Ukraine and Kazakhstan. All three gave up their nuclear weaponsas part of the 1994 Budapest Memorandum on Security Assurances.\n\nThe nuclear weapons Russia sent are tactical weapons intended for battlefield use and have relatively short ranges and comparatively low yields. It is not clear how many weapons have been stationed in Belarus and it was not immediately clear whether this new doctrine would be applied to the Russian weapons.\n\nThe Belarus security council secretary, Alexander Volfovich, said that the deployment of Russian nuclear weapons in Belarus was intended to deter aggression from Poland, a NATO member. \"Unfortunately, statements by our neighbors, in particular Poland ... forced us to strengthen\" Belarus' military doctrine, he said.", "source": {"uri": "kyivpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "KyivPost"}, "authors": [],

The declaration has in fact aroused reactions of great dismay throughout the international press, despite the fact that it concerns rather worn out \"apocalyptic\" rhetorical categories on the part of the Kremlin in a Putinian version, increasingly similar to those of the Brezhnevian Soviet period.\n\nThe announcement of the maneuvers requested directly by the president states that \"a set of initiatives will be implemented for the practical elaboration of issues relating to the preparation and use of non-strategic nuclear weapons\".\n\nA less bombastic statement than it appears: non-strategic, or \"tactical\", weapons are those placed on medium-range missiles (therefore not intercontinental) and with relatively limited power, compared to strategic ones. Air-dropping bombs, torpedo bombs and other types of armament can also be included in this category.\n\nSince the beginning of the war in Ukraine, such weapons have been evoked by the Russians; in March 2023 Putin said he intended to place them on the territory of Belarus, which according to President Alexander Lukashenko would be achieved at the beginning of July. In November Putin signed a law to cancel the ratification of the CTBT treaty on the ban on nuclear tests, promising that Russia would resume them only after a similar choice by the USA.\n\nAs Mariana Budjeryn, a Harvard specialist, observes, at the beginning of the invasion of Ukraine the risk of using tactical nuclear weapons, at least once as a demonstration, was considered highly probable; but Russia refused to follow up on this intention.\n\nIn her opinion \"between March and April 2022 the course of the war clearly went against the plans of the Kremlin, which had failed to conquer Kiev, and there was a real danger that Putin wanted to quickly conclude the operation with a sensational action \". Not even this choice would have led to a global nuclear war, Budjeryn believes, because \"no one would have responded to the bomb in Ukraine, which is not a nuclear power, with a bomb on Russia.\"\n\nIn February this year, in an interview with Tucker Carlson, Putin commented on the accusations against Russia regarding the use of nuclear weapons, declaring them \"purely intimidating\".\n\nNow it seems that Moscow has decided to \"move from rhetoric to warning signals\", as the Norwegian military analyst Tord Are Iversen comments, even if this does not greatly increase the real threat of these atomic war plans. \"It's just a way of reminding that Russia possesses this type of weapon, not that their use is any closer,\" the expert believes, \"and judging by the statements, it is a response to discussions on the possible direct participation of France and other Western countries to the war in Ukraine.\"\n\nAs Pavel Podvig, UN disarmament researcher, explains, the announced maneuvers mean the transfer of nuclear weapons from depots to \"delivery facilities\", i.e. to missile launch facilities and other machinery.\n\n\"This is a complex transport and installation operation, and the maneuver means that these procedures need to be implemented in practice, as until now only formal instructions remained.\" In reality, such exercises had also been implemented in recent times, for example in 2020 in Buryatia, and probably in other locations without disseminating information, using fake nuclear warheads instead of real bombs.\n\nAccording to American calculations, Russia has approximately 2000 tactical nuclear warheads, approximately double those of the USA, stored in 35 depots close to the facilities used for war; but not all of them would be ready for activation. As Podvig believes, for now these maneuvers \"resemble more than anything else a theatrical play\", the repetition of the scene of the Apocalypse.", "source": {"uri": "asianews.it", "dataType":

Russian news outlets later reported that activities practicing the use of nuclear weapons will also feature in the drills - raising concerns abroad of a further escalation in their foreign policy. A defence ministry spokesperson said: \"A set of measures will be taken to practice the preparation and use of non-strategic nuclear weapons.\"\n\nSpeaking to Kremlin-backed Russian news outlet Moskovskij Komsomolets, an expert has claimed that the hostile rhetoric and nuclear drills show a new \"red line\" for Putin and his allies, reports the Daily Star. Dmitry Popov said: \"A kind word and a gun can achieve much more than just a kind word. Therefore, the Russian Armed Forces have begun preparing for exercises on the use of tactical nuclear weapons. This is already a qualitative change in our policy from words to deeds.\n\nVladimir Putin has ramped up the nuclear weapons rhetoric (stock)\n\n\"No matter how many red lines we draw - for the supply of tanks, for the supply of long-range missiles, for aircraft, for the NATO contingent they all intersect or, in the case of personnel of Western armies, intersect before our eyes. Because in the game of escalation we always played number two, and we drew these red lines in the air.\"\n\n\"I would like to believe that this is not an episode, but a process that has begun.\"\n\nIt comes after key Putin ally and former Russian president Dmitry Medvedev warned that 10 Downing Street could be destroyed by nuclear missiles if Britain enters the Ukraine war. He had been responding to recent comments by Foreign Secretary David Cameron, who suggested that Ukraine had the right to use British-supplied missiles against Russian territory.\n\nHe said: \"Sending your troops to the territory of Ukraine will entail the direct entry of their countries into the war, to which we will have to respond. And, alas, not in the territory of Ukraine. In this case, none of them will be able to hide either on Capitol Hill, or in the Elysee Palace, or in 10 Downing Street.

Russia prepares to conduct nuclear drills amid Western threats; Israel issues an evacuation warning ahead of a planned offensive in southern Gaza; and Chinese President Xi Jinping wants to forge connections with the EU while on a European tour. These stories topped Tuesday's newspaper headlines across Russia.\n\nThe Russian Armed Forces will carry out drills to simulate the use of non-strategic nuclear weapons, the Defense Ministry announced. The exercise's goal is said to be \"increasing the preparedness of the non-strategic nuclear forces to perform combat missions.\" These kinds of drills have been few and far between since the collapse of the Soviet Union, but they used to be held annually during Soviet times, Vedomosti notes.\n\nRussia's nuclear doctrine authorizes the first use of nuclear weapons only when the country's existence is at risk or an attempt is made to wipe out the Russian nuclear forces. The announcement of the drills does not change the national nuclear doctrine, Ilya Kramnik, research fellow at the Russian Academy of Sciences' Institute of World Economy and International Relations, said. What is most notable is that the drills come amid certain provocative statements from NATO countries' officials.\n\nWhat we are seeing now is a clear nuclear message, something that has not happened often during Russia's special military operation, Dmitry Stefanovich, a researcher with the Center for International Security at the Russian Academy of Sciences' Institute of World Economy and International Relations, pointed out. This confirms a well-known fact: in case of a high-intensity conflict against a superior opponent, Russia will use non-strategic nuclear weapons, the analyst said.\n\n\"These drills were prompted by the rising tensions triggered by the West, particularly by statements that NATO forces, including US troops, may be deployed to Ukraine,\" Admiral (Ret.) Sergey Avakyants, ex-commander of Russia's Pacific Fleet, told Izvestia.\n\nAlexey Leonkov, military analyst and editor of the Arsenal Otechestva (or Arsenal of the Fatherland) magazine, expects that the upcoming exercise will send a message to any countries who think that Russia does not have the capability to use tactical nuclear weapons.\n\nHowever, Gabor Stier, Hungarian political scientist and Valdai Club member, believes that Western countries will try to avoid a direct conflict with Russia. Moscow is raising the stakes with its messaging, which is exacerbating the situation, but everyone involved still wants to avoid a serious escalation, the expert emphasized.\n\nOn May 6, the Israeli army called on Palestinians to evacuate from the eastern neighborhoods of the southern Gazan city of Rafah into \"an expanded humanitarian zone\" 20 kilometers to the north ahead of a planned ground

He echoed the standard rhetoric regarding the Belarusian nuclear deterrence doctrine and the intention to avoid war against Ukraine.\n\nThe Minister of Defense of Belarus, Lieutenant General Viktor

announced preparations for non-strategic (tactical) nuclear weapons exercises to \"practice the preparation and use\" of tactical nuclear weapons, and is likely meant to bolster the Kremlin's effort to coerce the West into self-deterring from providing additional military assistance to Ukraine,\" the report reads.\n\nISW continues to believe that neither Russia nor Belarus is seeking nuclear escalation and that the use of nuclear weapons remains unlikely.\n\nAt the same time, the U.S. Department of Defense reported on May 6 that no changes were spotted in the Russian nuclear posture

The drill is intended as a warning to the US and its allies not to escalate the Ukraine conflict any further, both the Foreign and Defense Ministries in Moscow said in public statements.\n\nAccording to Antonov, the US and its allies are constantly beefing up supplies of increasingly deadly weapons to Ukraine designed to \"kill Russian people\" and attack the territory of the country.\n\n\"Step by step they are abandoning their previously declared 'self-restraints' in the hybrid war unleashed against us,\" he said. \"Roughly speaking, they are trying to 'simmer' our country.\"\n\nAsked to comment on a statement made by White House national security spokesman John Kirby on Monday, who accused Russia of \"reckless and irresponsible\" nuclear \"saber-rattling,\" Antonov responded that Russia is not threatening anyone.\n\nHowever, the \"unhinged strategists\" in Washington and the EU should understand that in the escalation of the situation surrounding the Ukraine conflict which

tactical nuclear drills are taking place \"in the context of recent belligerent statements by Western officials and sharply destabilizing actions taken by a number of NATO countries\" in connection with the Ukraine conflict, the Russian Foreign Ministry said on Monday.\n\nThe US-led bloc's policy of inflicting a \"strategic defeat\" on Russia is leading it to \"a further escalation of the Ukraine crisis towards an open military clash\" between NATO and Moscow, the ministry added.\n\nThe Russian Defense Ministry cited \"provocative statements and threats against Russia by certain Western officials\" as the reason for the exercise.\n\nThey include Polish statements about the potential stationing of US nuclear weapons in Poland, as well as recent remarks by President Emmanuel Macron about the possibility of sending French and other NATO soldiers to Ukraine.", "source": {"uri": "rt.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "RT"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

The Storm Shadow missile is a air-launched long range deep strike weapon that has been used in Royal Air Force operations, including during the Iraq War.\n\n\"The exercise is aimed at maintaining the readiness of the personnel and equipment of units for the combat use of non-strategic nuclear weapons in order to respond to and unconditionally ensure the territorial integrity and sovereignty of the Russian State in response to provocative statements and threats by certain Western officials against the Russian Federation,\" said the ministry.\n\nRussian officials warned even No.10 Downing Street would not be safe\n\nSimilar non-stragetic nuclear missile drills - seen here on videos - have not been held since the days of high tension in February 2022, shortly before Putin launched the invasion of Ukraine.

Setting a combative tone for the new Putin era, Russian troops in occupied Ukraine started training with battlefield or \"tactical\" nuclear weapons. The order went out yesterday for soldiers of Russia's Southern Military District to \"practice the issues of preparation and use of non-strategic nuclear weapons.\"\n\nThe Kremlin says the order was made in reaction to a string of hardline statements by Western \"hotheads.\" The British foreign secretary, David Cameron, broke a Western taboo and said Thursday at Kyiv that Ukraine could use British-supplied rockets to destroy targets inside Russia. That same day, the Economist posted an interview with President Macron, in which Monsieur Macron warned that, if Ukrainian lines fail, French soldiers could be sent to Ukraine.\n\nFinally, on Sunday, the Biden Administration piled on in Washington. The minority leader in the House, Congressman Hakeem Jeffries, told CBS 60 Minutes: \"We cannot allow Ukraine to fall. If this happens, there is a significant possibility that America will have to intervene in a conflict not only with our money, but also with our military personnel.\"\n\nOn Monday, the Kremlin rattled its nuclear saber in the most threatening way since it embarked on its full scale invasion of Ukraine just over two years ago. Russia has 1,558 tactical nuclear warheads, according to the Bulletin of Atomic Scientists. Russia and America each are believed to have 1,600 active deployed strategic nuclear weapons -- the kind designed to destroy a city.\n\nIn a war where Ukrainian troops are thinly spread out along a 600-mile front line, the battlefield utility of tactical nuclear weapons is seen as limited. However, wartime nuclear training means Mr. Putin's new term starts with a rhetorical bang. America, Britain, Germany, and 19 other European Union countries boycotted Mr. Putin's inauguration today.\n\nMr. Putin's new term was designed to allow him to rule Russia for a span rivaling that of Stalin. This week, the Kremlin's rhetoric is harsher than anything heard out of Moscow since the late Stalin era, the early 1950s.\n\n\"A devastating revenge strike\" will be the reward for Washington and Brussels if Ukraine uses Western-supplied missiles to take out a Putin pet project, the 11-mile road and rail bridge connecting Russia's mainland with Russia-occupied Crimea.\n\n\"The Crimean Bridge is once again in the crosshairs,\" Russia's Foreign Ministry spokeswoman, Maria Zakharova, told reporters in Moscow Friday. \"Preparations for an attack on it, which is hard to believe, are now being carried out openly, with ostentatious bravado and with the absolute direct and shameless support of the collective West.\"\n\nThe next day, the spokeswoman commented on NATO's ongoing Steadfast Defender drills, the alliance's largest exercise in Europe since the Cold War. She warned: \"We have to admit that NATO is seriously preparing for a 'potential conflict' with us.\"\n\nIn reaction to Lord Cameron's green light to Kyiv to use British-supplied weapons to hit Russian targets, Britain's Ambassador to Russia, Nigel Casey was summoned yesterday to the Russian Foreign Ministry. \"Casey was warned that in response to Ukrainian attacks on Russian territory with British weapons, any British military facilities and equipment on the territory of Ukraine and abroad\" could be targeted, the Russian foreign ministry said later. \"The Ambassador was called upon to reflect on the inevitable catastrophic consequences of such hostile steps by London.\"\n\nTwo weeks ago, after the American Congress approved $61 billion in largely military aid to Ukraine, a former Russian president, Dmitry Medvedev expressed his wish on Telegram for America to be \"plunged into a new civil war.\" Responding to a portion of the aid bill that allows for confiscation of Russia state reserves in the United States, he proposed seizing private American assets in Russia.\n\nMoscow's angry rhetoric comes as the intelligence agencies of Britain, Germany, and other European nations report that Russia is planning sabotage attacks across Europe. \"Assessments suggest Kremlin agents preparing covert bombings, arson and attacks on infrastructure,\" is the headline of a story Sunday in the Financial Times.\n\nSome attacks appear to have begun. Based on reporting from Berlin, London, and Oslo, the dispatch cited industrial arson in London, cyber attacks in Germany, physical attacks on journalists in Estonia, and attempts to sabotage Czech and Swedish railways. It said attacks were carried out \"with little apparent concern about causing civilian fatalities.\"\n\nThe Kremlin's militant rhetoric matches the increasingly militarized nature of the new phase of Mr. Putin's Russia. This year, more than one third of government spending is to go to defense -- a post-Soviet record, calculates the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute. In sync with the new trend, Ambassador-at-Large Grigory Mashkov told RIA news agency yesterday Russia should \"build up the missile arsenal, in order to discourage any potential enemy from testing Russia's strength.\"\n\nAmerica, Europe, and China hope that cooler heads will prevail. In Washington, the White House national security spokesman John Kirby told reporters yesterday: \"It's just reckless and irresponsible for a leader of a major nuclear armed power to be 'saber rattling' the way that he is with respect to potential use of nuclear weapons.\"\n\nIn Paris, European leaders recalled that, six months into the conflict, President Xi Jinping in a joint press conference with Chancellor Scholz came out forcefully against Russia breaking the post-World War II moratorium on the use of nuclear bombs in a war.\n\n\"President Xi has played an important role in de-escalating Russia's irresponsible nuclear threats,\" the EU commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, told reporters yesterday after meeting with Messrs. Xi and Macron. \"I'm confident that President Xi will continue to do so against the backdrop of the ongoing nuclear threats by Russia.\"\n\nOn Sunday, Le Figaro posted an essay by Mr. Xi, written to mark his first visit in five years to Europe. Writing last week, before the nuclear training order went out, the Chinese leader wrote of the Russia-Ukraine war: \"I have stressed that nuclear weapons must not be used, and a nuclear war must not be fought.\"", "source": {"uri": "nysun.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New York Sun"}, "authors": [{"uri": "james_brooke@nysun.com", "name": "James Brooke", "type": "author", "isAgency":

The drills have been framed as a response to perceived threats from the West.\n\nOn May 6, the Russian Ministry of Defense announced that President Putin had ordered military drills to test the readiness of tactical nuclear forces for combat missions.\n\nThe Russian Foreign Ministry said that the military drills would serve as a deterrent to Western \"hotheads\" and dissuade them from supporting what Russia alleges are \"terrorist actions by the Kyiv regime.\"\n\n\"We hope that this event will cool down the 'hotheads' in Western capitals, help them realize the possible catastrophic consequences of the strategic risks they generate, and keep them both from assisting the Kyiv regime in its terrorist actions and from being drawn into a direct armed confrontation with Russia,\" the ministry said.\n\nNATO, as part of its defense strategy, routinely conducts tactical nuclear strike exercises, leveraging the capabilities of its member states' aircraft, including the F-16 Viper fighters. These exercises involve training for the deployment of US B61-series nuclear gravity bombs by various tactical jets operated by multiple member states.\n\nSome F-16 Vipers within NATO are currently authorized to employ older variants of the B61 bombs under the alliance's nuclear sharing agreements. Additionally, there are expectations that these aircraft will eventually be armed with the latest B61-12 nuclear gravity bomb.\n\nIn December 2023, a notable development occurred when a photograph surfaced depicting an F-16 Viper fighter stationed at Volkel Air Base in the Netherlands, seemingly armed with an inert training version of the B61-12 nuclear gravity bomb.\n\nHowever, NATO members currently known to be part of nuclear-sharing agreements either possess or are now in the process of acquiring F-35s to replace their F-16s and/or Tornadoes.\n\nIn March 2024, F-35A stealth jets received official certification to deploy the B61-12 thermonuclear gravity bomb. The development made the F-35 the first fifth-generation aircraft cleared for the fitting of such bombs, indicating a transition towards more advanced platforms for potential nuclear missions.\n\nMeanwhile, Poland has expressed interest in potentially hosting US nuclear weapons in the future, given its proximity to Belarus and Russia's Kaliningrad enclave.\n\nRussia's worries about Ukraine possessing nuclear capabilities are largely baseless since Ukraine does not possess a nuclear arsenal, and there have been no signs of any of its allies with nuclear capabilities planning to offer nuclear bombs to Kyiv.", "source": {"uri": "eurasiantimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Latest Asian, Middle-East, EurAsian, Indian News"}, "authors": [{"uri":

It will only prolong the crisis and guarantee that there will be even more hunger during the following winter.\n\nWhere will the next generation of Ukrainian army officers come from when the cadets are all dead?\n\nOver the last days the Democratic Minority Leader in the House Hakeem Jeffries suggested that U.S. troops would have to intervene in Ukraine:\n\nIn an interview with CBS News, Jeffries expressed concerns that despite billions of dollars in military aid from the United States, if Ukraine cannot secure victory over Russia, America may be compelled to intervene directly in the conflict.\n\nThe British Foreign Minister David Cameron has invited Ukraine to use British delivered weapons against Russian territory:\n\nDavid Cameron said Ukraine \"absolutely has the right\" to conduct attacks inside Russia with British weapons as he made his second visit to Kyiv since becoming foreign secretary.\n\nLord Cameron said it was up to Kyiv to decide how to use the ammunition supplied by Britain.\n\n\"In terms of what the Ukrainians do, in our view, it is their decision about how to use these weapons, they are defending their country, they were illegally invaded by Vladimir Putin and they must take those steps,\" he said.\n\nFrance has allegedly deployed parts of its Foreign Legion to Ukraine. The report follows musings by the French president Macron about putting French troops onto the ground in Ukraine.\n\nAll this was a bit too much for Russia. It invited the British ambassador to its Foreign Ministry to get an earful of serious talk:\n\nRussia's foreign ministry said the UK's ambassador to Moscow had been \"summoned\" to make him \"reflect on the inevitable catastrophic consequences of such hostile steps by London\".\n\nRussia also announced a spontaneous drill of the deployment of tactical nuclear weapons:\n\nRussia has threatened to strike British military facilities and said it will hold drills simulating the use of battlefield nuclear weapons in response to UK weapons being used by Ukraine to strike its territory.\n\n...\n\nIt is the first time Russia has publicly announced drills involving tactical nuclear weapons, although its strategic nuclear forces regularly hold exercises.\n\nThe exercises will be held by the southern group of Russian forces which is also involved in the special military operation in Ukraine.\n\nThis should for now shut up the loud voices who dream of defeating Russia in Ukraine.\n\nThere is zero hope that this could be achieved. The Ukrainian army has had 600-700,000 soldiers, maybe even more. It has been defeated. How many soldiers could France deploy into Ukraine? 5,000-10,000? And all NATO together? 100,000?\n\nNo western force is currently configured and equipped to defeat a near peer competitor force. Twenty-five years of 'war of terror' have left those armies in a very sorry state. At least during the first year of an expanded war their troops would have no chance to survive. The Russian forces, by now a well oiled machine with plenty of excellent weapons, would defeat them within one or two weeks. What then?\n\nSince February 2022 Russia's old and new president Vladimir Putin has warned against all interventions:\n\nLet me emphasise once again: if anyone intends to intervene from the outside and create a strategic threat to Russia that is unacceptable to us, they should know that our retaliatory strikes will be lightning-fast. We have the tools we need for this, the likes of which no one else can claim at this point. We will not just brag; we will use them if necessary.

Belarus's authoritarian President Alexander Lukashenko has relied on close ties with Russia and provided his country as a staging ground for the war in Ukraine.\n\nMoscow has emphasized that the tactical nuclear weapons deployed to Belarus remain under Russian military control.\n\nUnlike nuclear-tipped intercontinental ballistic missiles that can destroy entire cities, tactical nuclear weapons intended for use against troops on the battlefield are less powerful. Such weapons include aerial bombs, warheads for short-range missiles, and artillery munitions.\n\nThe deployment of tactical nuclear weapons to Belarus, which has a 673-mile border with Ukraine, would allow Russian aircraft and missiles to reach potential targets there more easily and quickly if Moscow decides to use them. It also extends Russia's capability to target several NATO allies in Eastern and Central Europe.\n\nBoth Putin and Lukashenko said that the Russian nuclear weapons' deployment to Belarus was intended to counter perceived Western threats.\n\nLukashenko on Tuesday cast the drills as \"exclusively defensive,\" arguing that the Russian nuclear weapons are intended to deter any potential aggression against Belarus. \"This is a weapon of deterrence, a defensive weapon,\" Lukashenko said.\n\nThe Belarusian leader said the drills will involve the delivery of tactical nuclear weapons from storage to military units, where they will be mounted on missiles and attached to warplanes. The missile units will practice covert deployment to firing positions to simulate a response to an attack on Belarus, he said.\n\nBelarus's opposition leader, Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya, who was forced to leave the country under official pressure after challenging Lukashenko in an August 2020 presidential vote, met on Tuesday with NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg and denounced the Russian nuclear weapons' presence in Belarus.\n\n\"Nuclear weapons turn Belarus and Belarusians into targets,\" she said. \"The Russian nuclear weapons in Belarus raise a direct threat to lives and health of citizens of all Europe.\"\n\nThe military exercise was the latest development that has raised concerns in Eastern Europe.\n\nIn Warsaw, Poland's Prime Minister Donald Tusk called for a special meeting of the secret services to discuss alleged Russian and Belarusian infiltration after a Polish judge who had access to sensitive state information defected to Belarus.\n\nAuthorities in NATO and European Union member Poland are investigating the judge, Tomasz Szmydt, on suspicions that he was acting on behalf of a foreign intelligence service.\n\nThe Polish government said in a statement Tuesday that \"Szmydt had constant and direct access to classified information. He has also been in contact with Belarusians for a long time. This situation should be of the utmost concern.\"\n\nTusk said the meeting of the Secret Services College on Wednesday would focus on \"alleged Russian and Belarusian influence in the Polish power apparatus.\"\n\nEarlier Tuesday, a Polish official said bugging devices were found in a room where the Polish Cabinet was scheduled to meet. Another official later said the equipment was part of an old sound system in the building, but the incident underlined anxieties in Poland over warnings that Russia is increasing its activities against the West amid the war in Ukraine.", "source": {"uri": "bostonglobe.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Boston Globe"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Putin has upped his nuclear rhetoric since ordering his army into Ukraine in 2022, warning in February there was a \"real\" risk of nuclear war.\n\nThe defence ministry gave no date for the drills, but said they would involve the air force, navy and troops stationed near Ukraine.\n\nIt said they were aimed at ensuring Russian territorial integrity in the face of Western \"threats.\"\n\nThe Kremlin specified that the exercises were a response to statements by French President Emmanuel Macron and British officials.\n\nRussia has in recent days hit out at Macron for telling The Economist magazine he was \"not ruling anything out\" in the West's response to the conflict in Ukraine, including sending troops to the country.\n\nIt has also blasted UK Foreign Secretary David Cameron for

This move comes as a close collaboration with Russia, which has recently deployed such arms in Belarus amidst growing tensions with the West over the conflict in Ukraine. The drills began one day following Russia's announcement of its plans to conduct exercises simulating the use of battlefield nuclear weapons, a decision framed as a reaction to Western officials' statements hinting at a possible escalation of involvement in the Ukrainian conflict. This marks the first occasion Moscow has publicly disclosed such an exercise.\n\nDefence Minister Viktor Khrenin of Belarus detailed that the drills would feature a unit of Iskander short-range missiles and a squadron of Su-25 fighter jets. These exercises are conducted in partnership with Russia, coinciding with Russian President Vladimir Putin's inauguration to a fifth term, where he pledged to prioritize Russia's security. Last year saw Russia relocating some of its tactical nuclear weapons to Belarus, sharing borders with Ukraine and NATO members Poland, Latvia, and Lithuania. Belarus's authoritarian leader, Alexander Lukashenko, has maintained strong ties with Russia, offering his nation as a base for the ongoing war in Ukraine.\n\nRussian officials have clarified that the tactical nuclear weapons stationed in Belarus are under Russian military control. Tactical nuclear weapons, unlike their intercontinental counterparts capable of annihilating entire cities, are designed for battlefield use and possess relatively lower power. These include aerial bombs, warheads for short-range missiles, and artillery munitions. The strategic positioning of these weapons in Belarus enhances Russia's ability to swiftly target potential sites in Ukraine and extend its threat range to several NATO allies in Eastern and Central Europe.\n\nBoth Putin and Lukashenko have described the deployment of Russian nuclear weapons to Belarus as a measure to counteract perceived threats from the West. Lukashenko emphasized that the ongoing drills are \"exclusively defensive,\" aimed at deterring potential aggression against Belarus. He outlined that the exercises would simulate the process from retrieving tactical nuclear weapons from storage to mounting them on missiles and attaching them to warplanes, preparing for a hypothetical attack on Belarus.\n\nOn the international stage, Belarus opposition leader Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya voiced her concerns during a meeting with NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg on Tuesday. Tsikhanouskaya, who fled Belarus following pressure from official channels after contesting Lukashenko in the August 2020 presidential elections, criticized the presence of Russian nuclear weapons in Belarus as a direct threat not only to the safety and health of Belarusians but also to all European citizens.", "source": {"uri": "oneindia.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Oneindia"}, "authors":

Russia's Defense Ministry said that President Vladimir V. Putin had ordered an exercise for missile, aviation and naval personnel to \"increase the readiness of nonstrategic nuclear forces to carry out combat missions.\"\n\nRussian officials claimed the order was in response to comments from the West about the possibility of more direct Western involvement in the war in Ukraine. And it came at the start of a week of extensive publicity for the Russian leader, with his inauguration scheduled for Tuesday, followed on Thursday by the annual Victory Day celebration, which commemorates the Soviet defeat of Nazi Germany in 1945.\n\nThe announcement of the exercise was Russia's most explicit warning in its more than two-year invasion of Ukraine that it could use tactical nuclear weapons there.\n\nRussian intercontinental ballistic missile launchers parading through Moscow during Victory Day celebrations in 2022.Credit...Alexander Nemenov/Agence France-Presse -- Getty Images\n\nRead more: https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/06/world/europe/russia-tactical-nuclear-weapons-drills.html", "source": {"uri": "democraticunderground.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Democratic Underground"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Russia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_weapon", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Nuclear weapon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_invasion_of_Ukraine", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Russian invasion of Ukraine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_exercise", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Military exercise"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_York_Times", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The New York Times"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berlin", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Berlin"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Berlin"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukraine", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warhead", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Warhead"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ministry_of_Defence_(Russia)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ministry of Defence (Russia)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vladimir_Putin", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Vladimir Putin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inauguration_of_Joe_Biden", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Inauguration of Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/End_of_World_War_II_in_Europe", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "End of World War II in Europe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tactical_nuclear_weapon", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tactical nuclear weapon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victory_Day_(9_May)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Victory Day (9 May)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intercontinental_ballistic_missile", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Intercontinental ballistic missile"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Soviet Union"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agence_France-Presse", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Agence France-Presse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moscow", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Moscow"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Moscow"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Martial_Arts/Russian", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Martial Arts/Russian", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Military_Science", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Military Science", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Military/Weapons_and_Equipment", "label": "dmoz/Society/Military/Weapons and Equipment", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Pharmacy/Nuclear_Pharmacy", "label": "dmoz/Health/Pharmacy/Nuclear Pharmacy", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 79}], "image": null, "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9542018", "eventUri": "eng-9542018", "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.4117647058823529, "wgt": 151, "relevance": 1}

Ukraine's foreign ministry has urged countries not to recognize Putin's presidency following his inauguration for a fifth term, while diplomatic responses from various European nations vary.\n\nRelated Items:Drills, Nuclear Threat, Russia, Russia-Ukraine Crisis Recommended for you EU state threatens closure of orthodox monasteries over ties to Russian church Gaza genocide: Russia pushes for UN sanctions on Israel 'Havana syndrome': Mysterious illness affecting US diplomats linked to Russian spy unit, investigation finds Click to comment", "source": {"uri": "freepresskashmir.news", "dataType": "news", "title": "Free Press Kashmir"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukraine", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Russia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_Secretary", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Foreign Secretary"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tactical_nuclear_weapon", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tactical nuclear weapon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emmanuel_Macron", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Emmanuel Macron"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moscow_Kremlin", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Moscow Kremlin"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dmitry_Peskov", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dmitry Peskov"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_France", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "President of France"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Cameron", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "David Cameron"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "BBC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ministry_of_Foreign_Affairs_(Russia)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Russia)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vladimir_Putin", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Vladimir Putin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ministry_for_Europe_and_Foreign_Affairs_(France)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ministry for Europe and Foreign Affairs (France)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Havana_syndrome", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Havana syndrome"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_sanctions", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "International sanctions"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_Orthodox_Church", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Russian Orthodox Church"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genocide", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Genocide"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "European Union"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Espionage", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Espionage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NATO", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NATO"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_Strip", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Military_Science", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Military Science", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Government/Foreign_Ministries", "label": "dmoz/Society/Government/Foreign Ministries", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Military/Weapons_and_Equipment", "label": "dmoz/Society/Military/Weapons and Equipment", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Pharmacy/Nuclear_Pharmacy", "label": "dmoz/Health/Pharmacy/Nuclear Pharmacy", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://freepresskashmir.news/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Army2016demo-075.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9542018", "eventUri": "eng-9542018", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.4509803921568627, "wgt": 150, "relevance": 1}

Our strategic forces are always at combat readiness,\" Putin added, referring to Russia's arsenal of nuclear weapons, the world's largest.\n\nThe parade of military hardware that then trundled past the Lenin mausoleum outside the Kremlin culminated with three RS-24 Yars intercontinental ballistic missile launchers, which Russia claims can strike any target across the globe.\n\nPutin's latest warning to the west came at what the Russian leader feels is an inflection point more than two years into his full-scale war in Ukraine.\n\nThe Russian army is gradually advancing against Ukraine's outgunned, outmanned troops, who are struggling to hold their positions while they await the arrival of US weapons funded by the recently adopted $61bn aid package.\n\nBut the Moscow parade, held in an unseasonal flurry of snow, also underscored the losses Russia's own armed forces had sustained.\n\nThe only tank in the parade was the T-34, the legendary Soviet armoured vehicle from second world war, that traditionally opens it.\n\nRussia has lost more than 3,000 tanks during the war, as many as it had before the invasion, according to a February report by the International Institute for Strategic Studies.\n\nPutin told his troops in Ukraine that Russia was going through a \"difficult-epoch-making period\" and said they enjoyed the whole country's support.\n\nIn separate remarks to commanders fighting in Ukraine, which the Kremlin said were made a day earlier, he said Russia's entire economic and social development depended on the invasion's success.\n\n\"We have every possibility of meeting these targets. But only under one condition -- your successful work on the battlefield. This is the key link at the moment,\" Putin said.\n\nRussia has sought to deter the US and its Nato allies from stepping up their support for Ukraine by making thinly veiled threats about its nuclear arsenal.\n\n\"The Yarses are floating across Red Square, and you can't help remembering someone is planning to defeat us on the battlefield. You really want to ask them how the hell [they'll do that],\" Margarita Simonyan, editor of state foreign news network RT, wrote on social media.\n\nOn Monday, the defence ministry said Putin had ordered it to hold drills rehearsing the use of tactical nuclear weapons in response to \"provocative statements\" from western leaders such as French President Emmanuel Macron, who has floated the idea of sending western troops to fight in Ukraine.\n\nDeputy foreign minister Sergei Ryabkov said on Thursday that the drills were a warning to the west not to escalate tensions with Russia further.\n\n\"We are warning our adversaries that their escalationary tendencies make it necessary for us to take steps to essentially strengthen our deterrence,\" Ryabkov said, according to Interfax.\n\nRyabkov also hinted that Moscow could change its nuclear doctrine, which allows for a nuclear strike only in response to an enemy nuclear attack or if Russia's very existence as a state is threatened.\n\n\"At the moment there are no such changes, but the situation itself is changing,\" Ryabkov said. \"So the relation of our basic documents in the field to our security requirements is the subject of constant analysis.\"\n\nPutin, however, played down the significance of the drills, the first tactical nuclear exercises Russia has ever announced in advance.\n\n\"There is nothing unusual here, it's planned work,\" Putin said in the comments to the commanders.", "source": {"uri": "ft.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Financial Times News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

The exercises, which were ordered by President Vladimir Putin, will be held in the near future, the Russian Defense Ministry said.\n\nAccording to the Foreign Ministry, the move was a response to the continued \"power politics\" pursued by the US and its allies against Russia. Washington and Kiev's other backers openly declare their support for Ukrainian \"terrorist acts\" and \"directly contribute\" to such attacks, the statement read, pointing to the continued supply of ever more powerful Western weapons to Ukraine. It particularly drew attention to the US-made ATACMS missiles capable of \"striking targets deep inside Russian territory.\"\n\nLast week, former UK prime minister and current Foreign Secretary David Cameron stated that Kiev had every right to use British weapons to strike targets inside Russia as well.\n\nThe US has also created new threats to Russia's national security through deployment of its intermediate-range ground-based missile systems around the world, the ministry said. Such weapons were banned under the 1987 Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces Treaty (INF), but Washington unilaterally withdrew from the agreement in 2019.\n\nThe move left Russia with no choice but to leave the treaty as well. However, Moscow introduced a moratorium on fielding weapons that used to be covered by the treaty. Russia now reserves the right to a \"mirror response\" to American actions, the ministry said, adding that the moratorium could be lifted.\n\nMoscow also slammed statements by French President Emmanuel Macron about a potential NATO troop deployment to Ukraine. \"This cannot be perceived in any other way than a demonstration of the readiness and willingness to enter a direct military confrontation with Russia,\" the ministry warned.\n\nLast week, Macron said that Western nations would have to consider such an option if Kiev officially requested it. \"Such actions of the NATO member states show that they deliberately strive for further escalation of the Ukraine crisis towards a direct military clash between NATO and Russia,\" the Russian Foreign Ministry said.", "source":

The decision comes ...\n\nIn a significant development, Russian President Vladimir Putin has ordered nuclear drills amid the ongoing conflict with Ukraine.\n\nThe decision comes amidst heightened tensions in the region, raising concerns about the escalation of the conflict.\n\nRussia's defense ministry announced that President Putin told the Russian military to practice using nuclear weapons in drills with the navy and troops close to Ukraine.\n\nPutin has been talking more about nuclear weapons since the conflict in Ukraine started. In February, during his speech to the nation, he said there's a \"real\" chance of nuclear war.\n\nThe minister said, During the exercise, a set of measures will be taken to practise the preparation and use of non-strategic nuclear weapons. The exercises would take place \"in the near future\" and were aimed at ensuring Russia's territorial integrity in the face of \"threats by certain Western officials.\n\nOfficials in the West are getting more worried about the Kremlin's talk about nuclear weapons during the fighting in Ukraine. Putin often mentions Russia's nuclear strategy, which is making them more concerned.\n\nThough, Last year, Russia decided not to officially accept the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty anymore. Also, it withdrew from an important agreement with the United States that aimed to reduce the number of arms.\n\nAs tensions continue to mount, the world watches closely as Russia conducts these nuclear drills amid the ongoing conflict in Ukraine.\n\n#russiaukrainewar #putin #vladimirputin #russia\n\nYour daily dose of videos for the latest and exclusive news from India and the rest of the world.

Russian President Vladimir Putin has used nuclear saber-rattling as a method to constrain Western assistance to Ukraine over the last two years.\n\n\"Russia will do utmost to avoid a global confrontation, but it will not allow itself to be threatened,\" Putin said Thursday during an event marking the anniversary of the Allies' victory over Nazi Germany during the Second World War. \"Our strategic forces are always in combat readiness.\"\n\nThe efficacy of Russia's nuclear threats has eroded over the last two years as Western governments gradually have stepped up the quality and quantity of the military equipment they send to Ukraine.

Also known as tactical weapons, the lower-yield atomic bombs are intended for battlefield use to destroy opposing armies and fortifications, rather than whole cities or industries, as with long-range strategic missiles.\n\nA statement by the Russian ministry of defence expressed the intentions of the exercise, while blaming Western states for it happening at all. Russian state media quoted the Kremlin as having said:\n\nThe exercise aims to maintain the preparedness of troops and equipment for the combat employment of non-strategic nuclear weapons to react and unconditionally ensure the territorial integrity and sovereignty of the Russian state in response to provocative statements and threats by some Western officials against the Russian Federation...\n\nKremlin media paraphrased this as the exercise being intended to be a retaliation against what it called \"inflammatory statements and threats by some Western officials\"\n\nRussia's nuclear forces exercising isn't exactly unheard of, the Associated Press notes, but this is the first time such a thing has been announced in advance, making clear the apparent intent to intimidate.\n\nLong-time Putin ally and Kremlin attack dog Dmitry Peskov made clear in a statement today exactly what Western statements he blamed for this nuclear provocation, blaming \"...members of US Congress, French and British administration, and some madmen from the Baltic States and Poland\".\n\nOn Sunday, minority leader of the House Democrats Hakeem Jeffries blamed a \"pro-Putin faction\" within the Republicans for trying to slow the rate of U.S. taxpayer's money being sent to Ukraine, and said if the cash wasn't spent, then America would have to send soldiers instead.\n\nThis is just days after France's Emmanuel Macron once again doubled down on his commitment that he would make soldiers available to deploy to Ukraine. The suggestion of actually putting NATO troops into Ukraine is something Macron has been pushing for months, following comments in February which were the first time and Western leader openly discussed the possibility of aid to Ukraine going beyond just cash and bombs.\n\nThe suggestion then triggered a near-panic among some western capitals, particularly Berlin, which to that point had been carefully measuring their military donations to Kyiv to keep the war going without escalating it. Italy has been particularly scathing of Macron's belligerent rhetoric, accusing him of gambling with war to improve his poll ratings, and again this weekend calling him \"dangerous\" and \"desperate\".\n\nRussia's Medvedev attempted to make menaces in response to such comments today, saying NATO nations sending troops to what he called 'former' Ukraine would \"mean direct engagement of their countries in war, and we will have to respond to it... none of them will be able to hide either on Capitol Hill, or in the Elys\u00e9e Palace, or in Downing Street, 10. It will be a global catastrophe.\"\n\nNuclear threats have become almost commonplace from Russia over the course of the Ukraine war, with Peskov threatening at times Armageddon in retaliation against relatively minor slights.", "source": {"uri": "breitbart.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Breitbart"}, "authors": [{"uri": "oliver_jj_lane@breitbart.com", "name": "Oliver Jj Lane", "type":

Kennedy during an address at American University in 1963.The remark, coming a few months after the previous year's Cuban Missile Crisis, demonstrated Kennedy's newfound sense of restraint in navigating Cold War tensions. The confrontation with the Soviet Union brought the world to the brink of nuclear war with both Washington and Moscow poised to save face by unleashing the deadliest weapons ever conceived by mankind.A repeat of the scenario must be avoided, Kennedy reasoned, with each world power tacitly accepting the other's existence.Half a century later the slain leader's realization has been forgotten, claimed former CIA analyst Ray McGovern on Sputnik's The Critical hour program Monday. The founder of Veteran Intelligence Professionals for Sanity joined hosts Garland Nixon and Wilmer Leon to discuss the latest developments in NATO countries' proxy war against Russia in the Donbass.\"Things are getting pretty intense and the Russians are pretty much saying, 'okay, that's enough,'\" said McGovern, responding to the latest statement from Russian government officials. British Foreign Secretary David Cameron was quoted by media saying Ukraine could use UK-supplied weapons to strike within Russian territory during a visit to Kiev last week.The comment provoked a strong response from Moscow suggesting Russia could target British military assets in Ukraine or elsewhere in response to such an attack on its territory.\"We have those reports that [French President Emmanuel] Macron is crazy enough to want to send French troops into battle there in Ukraine, and... the Russians actually have claimed to have killed seven of them this morning,\" McGovern added.McGovern claimed Russia's response could even be nuclear in nature, noting, \"the Russians are waving the nuclear possibility as never before. I can say 'never' because I've been around a while - would you believe six decades of watching Soviet and then Russian leaders? They don't brandish nuclear weapons. Now they are.\"The Russian Ministry of Defense announced Monday they were commencing exercises involving tactical nuclear weapons, suggesting the country could use such armaments if Western nations enable strikes within the country.\"The exercise is aimed at maintaining the readiness of personnel and equipment of units for the combat use of non-strategic nuclear weapons in order to unconditionally ensure Russia's territorial integrity and sovereignty in response to provocative statements and threats from Western officials,\" read the statement.Russia also possesses so-called hypersonic weapons able to evade traditional defensive systems - a technology not yet developed by any of its Western rivals. McGovern noted the armaments could be equipped with nuclear warheads, but only if Russia is significantly provoked.The stance has predictably caused the US and allies to accuse Moscow of \"nuclear saber rattling.\" But McGovern claimed the threat is a response to an unprecedented deterioration of relations between Russia and the West, noting recent analysis by Russian historian Dmitri Trenin.\"But now the US is doing this by proxy,\" he observed. \"That's new... We need to rethink this whole thing because this is an existential threat.\"The former intelligence analyst warned of the potential consequences if Russia continues to feel it is provoked.\"That's the next rung up on the escalation ladder,\" he claimed. \"I'm afraid that if the French and the British and US don't come to their senses and if Zelensky appeals for NATO troops on the ground that there'll be enough pressure on the part of NATO countries - some of them at least - to comply.\"\"These threats about nuclear, tactical weapons being mounted for exercises - well, that may be part of this tough approach. But it still worries me greatly because the Russians don't usually do that.\"", "source": {"uri": "sputnikglobe.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sputnik International"}, "authors": [{"uri": "john_miles@sputnikglobe.com", "name": "John Miles", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_warfare", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nuclear warfare"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Russia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_F._Kennedy", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "John F.

Please try again later{{ /verifyErrors }}\n\nRussia has threatened to strike British military facilities and said it will hold drills simulating the use of battlefield nuclear weapons in response to UK weapons being used by Ukraine to strike its territory.\n\nBritish ambassador Nigel Casey was called to the foreign ministry in Moscow for a formal protest following foreign secretary Lord David Cameron's comments last week that Ukraine had the right to use British weapons to strike Russia.\n\nHe was warned that \"in response to Ukrainian attacks on Russian territory with British weapons, any British military facilities and equipment on the territory of Ukraine and abroad,\" could be targeted, the ministry said, calling Cameron's remarks a serious escalation.\n\n\"The ambassador was called upon to reflect on the inevitable catastrophic consequences of such hostile steps by London and immediately refute the belligerent provocative statements of the head of the foreign office in the most decisive and unambiguous way.\"\n\nIt came on the eve of Vladimir Putin's inauguration to a fifth term in office and as Msocow prepared to mark Victory Day on Thursday - its most important secular holiday, marking its defeat of Nazi Germany in the Second World War.\n\nIt is the first time Russia has publicly announced drills involving tactical nuclear weapons, although its strategic nuclear forces regularly hold exercises.\n\nTactical nuclear weapons include air bombs, warheads for short-range missiles and artillery munitions and are meant for use on a battlefield. They are less powerful than the strategic weapons - massive warheads that arm intercontinental ballistic missiles and are intended to obliterate entire cities.\n\nUN spokesman Stephane Dujarric expressed concern that various parties have been talking about issues regarding nuclear weapons recently.\n\n\"Current nuclear risks are at an alarmingly high level,\" he said. \"All actions that could lead to miscalculation, escalation with catastrophic consequences, must be avoided.\"\n\nBritain's foreign office said Casey had used the meeting to restate Britain's support for Ukraine.", "source": {"uri": "independent.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Independent"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strike_action", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Strike action"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukraine", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Russia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Cameron", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "David Cameron"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ministry_for_Europe_and_Foreign_Affairs_(France)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ministry for Europe and Foreign Affairs (France)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_Secretary", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Foreign Secretary"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_weapon", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nuclear weapon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moscow", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Moscow"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Moscow"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tactical_nuclear_weapon", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tactical nuclear weapon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victory_Day_(9_May)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Victory Day (9 May)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vladimir_Putin", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Vladimir Putin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "London"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "London"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/End_of_World_War_II_in_Europe", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "End of World War II in Europe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warhead", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Warhead"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intercontinental_ballistic_missile", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Intercontinental ballistic missile"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artillery", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Artillery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ammunition", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ammunition"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secularism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Secularism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Missile", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Missile"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "World War II"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weapon_of_mass_destruction", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Weapon of mass destruction"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United Nations"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Military_Science", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Military Science", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Military/Weapons_and_Equipment", "label": "dmoz/Society/Military/Weapons and Equipment", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Pharmacy/Nuclear_Pharmacy", "label": "dmoz/Health/Pharmacy/Nuclear Pharmacy", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 84}], "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/2024/05/06/20/SEI202869600.jpg?quality=75&width=1200&auto=webp", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9542018", "eventUri": "eng-9542018", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.5058823529411764, "wgt": 148, "relevance": 1}

Previous packages have required weeks of closed-door negotiations.\n\nEuropean Commission Vice-President Vera Jourova said on Sunday that the EU would sanction Voice of Europe, a website accused of spreading pro-Russian disinformation, along with Rossiiskaja Gazeta, Ria Novosti and Izvestia.\n\n\"We don't recognise them as media, they are simply Putin's propaganda tools,\" Jourova told Czech public television.\n\nThe push to crack down on Russian political funding into the EU comes amid rising concerns about disinformation pushed by Moscow tied to the European Parliament's elections in early June. France, with the Baltic nations, Poland and the Netherlands, had urged the bloc to sanction Russian election interference, Bloomberg reported previously.\n\nPresident Vladimir Putin ordered Russia's military to carry out combat drills involving tactical nuclear weapons, ramping up his confrontation with the West just a day before his inauguration for a fifth term.\n\nThe army will carry out exercises in southern Russia to \"practise the preparation and use of non-strategic nuclear weapons,\" the Defence Ministry said in a Telegram statement on Monday. The drills involving air and naval forces were being held in response to \"provocative statements and threats made by certain Western officials\", it said.\n\nPutin has at times brandished the threat of nuclear weapons since his February 2022 invasion of Ukraine, which borders southern Russia. In October, Russia rehearsed its ability to deliver a \"massive\" retaliatory nuclear strike, including with the launch of ballistic and cruise missiles.\n\nIn February, the Russian leader warned the North Atlantic Treaty Organization it risked a nuclear conflict if the alliance were to send troops to Ukraine.\n\nThe US and Europe \"must understand that we also have weapons that can hit targets on their territory and that all this really threatens a conflict with the use of nuclear weapons, and therefore the destruction of civilisation\", Putin said in his annual State of the Nation Address.\n\nThat threat came after French President Emmanuel Macron refused to rule out sending troops to Ukraine, even as the idea was rebuffed by other Nato allies. Macron on Monday was hosting Chinese President Xi Jinping, who despite growing diplomatic and economic ties with Russia, has warned Putin against the use of nuclear weapons.\n\nRead more: How serious is Putin's threat to use nuclear weapons?: QuickTake\n\nKremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov on Monday blamed Macron and UK Foreign Secretary David Cameron for sparking \"an unprecedented spike in tensions\", RIA Novosti reported. Cameron last week said Ukraine had the right to use weapons it receives from Britain to strike Russia.\n\nRussia's army made further incremental gains in its quest to capture a strategically important town of Chasiv Yar in the eastern Donetsk region, while missile and drone strikes disrupted power supplies in the north and east of Ukraine.\n\nMoscow intensified attacks against Chasiv Yar, a hilltop settlement seen as key for Putin's objective of capturing what was once Ukraine's industrial heartland. The Kremlin is racing to seize territory before US military aid reaches Kyiv's troops on the frontline.\n\n\"The battles are taking place quite close to the town, already on the outskirts,\" Kyrylo Sazonov, a former Ukrainian political consultant who joined the 41st Separate Mechanised Brigade and is serving in Chasiv Yar, told the 1+1 TV channel.\n\n\"Over the last two weeks we see and sense that Russians have a task to occupy Chasiv Yar by May 9th,\" he said, referring to the date when Russia celebrates its victory over Germany in World War 2.\n\nUkraine's task is to win time to form and prepare reserves while disrupting Russia's plans, causing maximum losses and exhausting their forces, Commander-in-Chief Oleksandr Syrskyi said on Facebook, after spending two days on the eastern frontline. Russia had numerous advantages in personnel, weapons and military equipment, he said.\n\nChasiv Yar is situated on high ground and convenient to defend, Sazonov said. If Ukraine abandoned the town, it would give Russian forces a \"direct path\" to Kostyantynivka, and further west to Slovyansk, Kramatorsk and Pokrovsk, he said. The \"Pokrovsk-Kostyantynivka\" road has become a vital supply route for the Ukrainian Army.\n\nRussian forces were storming \"well-prepared\" Ukrainian positions and trying to bypass the town, he said. \"We should admit that the Russians are well prepared too, especially their paratroopers,\" he said.\n\nMeanwhile, north of Donetsk, in the Sumy region, attacks damaged a high-voltage power facility, cutting the power supply to 400,000 households, while about 100,000 households had rolling blackouts in neighbouring Kharkiv, the national grid operator Ukrenergo said on Facebook.\n\nUkraine intercepted 12 of 13 Shahed drones in the Sumy region that were launched from the north at night, the air force said on Telegram. Russia has stepped up attacks across much of Ukraine in recent days as the country celebrates Orthodox Easter.\n\nChancellor Olaf Scholz pledged to defend Germany's three Baltic Nato allies in case of a Russian attack and to complete the establishment of a permanent brigade in Lithuania by the end of 2027.\n\n\"Germany stands firmly at the side of the Baltic states,\" Scholz told reporters on Monday during a visit to a German tank battalion stationed in Lithuania, his third trip to the region since taking office in 2021.\n\nScholz is also meeting counterparts from Estonia, Lithuania and Latvia in Riga to discuss closer defence and energy cooperation.\n\n\"We are committed to each other, that is part of the understandings we have reached in Nato,\" Scholz said. \"And that means that we grant each other protection and that all states can rely on us to defend every inch of their territory.\"\n\nA preliminary command of some 20 German soldiers arrived in Lithuania in April and is set to expand to around 150 personnel by the end of the year. As many as 5,000 soldiers will be permanently stationed at the military bases of Rukla near Kaunas in central Lithuania and Rudninkai near the capital Vilnius and the border with Belarus.\n\nSpeaking alongside Scholz, Lithuanian President Gitanas Naus\u0117da urged Germany to speed up the deployment given Russia's invasion of Ukraine and threats against other former Soviet states.\n\n\"We can't afford the luxury of wasting even a minute,\" Naus\u0117da warned.

The maneuvers, ordered by President Vladimir Putin, aim to test the readiness of non-strategic nuclear forces and will include preparation and deployment drills.\n\nAccording to the Russian Defense Ministry, missile forces from the Southern Military District and the Russian Navy will participate in the exercises. The objective is to ensure Russia's territorial integrity and sovereignty, particularly in response to perceived provocations and threats from Western representatives.\n\nThe strategic location of the units involved, near Ukraine, underscores the heightened tensions in the region following Russia's invasion of Ukraine. The conflict has strained relations between Moscow and the West, reaching levels of hostility not seen since the Cuban Missile Crisis in 1962.\n\nKremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov emphasized that the tactical nuclear exercises are a direct response to Western discussions about potentially deploying NATO troops to Ukraine. Statements from French President Emmanuel Macron and representatives of Great Britain and the United States regarding troop deployments have escalated tensions further.\n\nPeskov characterized the possibility of Western troop deployments to Ukraine as an unprecedented escalation, warranting special attention and measures. He also addressed concerns about alleged Russian acts of sabotage in Europe, dismissing them as groundless allegations.\n\nAdditionally, Peskov responded to questions regarding the use of North Korean missiles by Russian forces in Ukraine, redirecting inquiries to the Ministry of Defense. Accusations have surfaced claiming North Korea supplied weapons to Russia for use in the Ukrainian conflict, further complicating the geopolitical landscape.", "source": {"uri": "novinite.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Novinite.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Russia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tactical_nuclear_weapon", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tactical nuclear weapon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_exercise", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Military exercise"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_Military_District", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Southern Military District"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_Navy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Russian Navy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vladimir_Putin", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Vladimir Putin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukraine", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_invasion_of_Ukraine", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Russian invasion of Ukraine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cuban_Missile_Crisis", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cuban Missile Crisis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moscow_Kremlin", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Moscow Kremlin"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ministry_of_Defence_(Russia)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ministry of Defence (Russia)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sovereignty", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sovereignty"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dmitry_Peskov", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dmitry Peskov"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moscow", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Moscow"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Moscow"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_in_Donbas_(2014\u20132022)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "War in Donbas (2014\u20132022)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geopolitics", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Geopolitics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emmanuel_Macron", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Emmanuel Macron"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_Armed_Forces", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Russian Armed Forces"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sabotage", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sabotage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_France", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "President of France"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Missile", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Missile"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Europe"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agence_France-Presse", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Agence France-Presse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reuters", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Reuters"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NATO", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NATO"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Korea", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "North Korea"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "North Korea"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Military", "label": "dmoz/Society/Military", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Martial_Arts/Russian", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Martial Arts/Russian", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Military_Science", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Military Science", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 93}], "image": "https://www.novinite.com/media/images/2024-05/photo_verybig_225933.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9542018", "eventUri": "eng-9542018", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.05098039215686279, "wgt": 146, "relevance": 1}

Russian officials consistently time nuclear readiness exercises and vague threats of nuclear retaliation with important Western policy decisions regarding the war in Ukraine to force Western decision-makers to self-deter and temper their support for Ukraine.\n\nThe current apparent resurgence of nuclear rhetoric, this time in the form of planned tactical nuclear weapons exercises, coincides with the imminent arrival of Western weapons in Ukraine, analysts said.\n\n\"Russian officials are likely using the nuclear weapons information operation to discourage Ukraine's Western partners from providing additional military support and to scare Western decision-makers out of allowing Ukrainian forces to use Western-provided systems to attack legitimate military targets in Russia,\" ISW said.\n\nRussian troops engage in routine nuclear exercises as part of this wider nuclear rhetoric information operation, but ISW continues to assess that Russia is highly unlikely to use a tactical nuclear weapon on the battlefield in Ukraine or anywhere else.", "source": {"uri": "ukrinform.net", "dataType": "news", "title": "Ukrinform-EN"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Institute_for_the_Study_of_War", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Institute for the Study of War"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Russia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_invasion_of_Ukraine", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Russian invasion of Ukraine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hybrid_warfare", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hybrid warfare"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukrinform", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ukrinform"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moscow_Kremlin", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Moscow Kremlin"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_warfare", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Information warfare"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukraine", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tactical_nuclear_weapon", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tactical nuclear weapon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armed_Forces_of_Ukraine", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Armed Forces of Ukraine"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_weapon", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nuclear weapon"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Physics/Nuclear", "label": "dmoz/Science/Physics/Nuclear", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Martial_Arts/Russian", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Martial Arts/Russian", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Pharmacy/Nuclear_Pharmacy", "label": "dmoz/Health/Pharmacy/Nuclear Pharmacy", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 85}], "image": "https://static.ukrinform.com/photos/2022_09/thumb_files/630_360_1662644530-782.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9542018", "eventUri": "eng-9542018", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.4666666666666667, "wgt": 146, "relevance": 1}

That said, we have not seen any reason to adjust our own nuclear posture and, in response, to these announcements nor any indications that Russia is preparing to use nuclear weapons in Ukraine,\" Miller said during the briefing.\n\nEarlier in the day, the Russian Defense Ministry said that the General Staff of the Russian armed forces had started preparations for exercises involving missile units of the Southern Military District, aviation, as well as naval forces, in order to increase the readiness of non-strategic nuclear forces to carry out combat missions.\n\nDuring the exercises, the Russian armed forces will practice a set of activities for the preparation and use of non-strategic nuclear weapons, the ministry said.\n\nThe drills should be perceived in the context of NATO's recent destabilizing actions as well as the latest bellicose statements made by Western officials, the Russian Foreign Ministry said.\n\nLast week, French President Emmanuel Macron said in an interview with The Economist that he did not exclude the possibility of sending troops to Ukraine should Kiev send a request. UK Foreign Secretary David Cameron rejected the idea but said that Kiev had the right to use the weapons provided by London to attack Russian territory.\n\nOn Sunday, US House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries told CBS that \"there's a significant likelihood\" that America will have to send its troops to the conflict zone if Ukraine falls. He claimed that the US must continue supporting Kiev to \"prevent a broader war.\"\n\nRafah Operation Would Jeopardize Delivery of Humanitarian Assistance\n\n\"Certainly, a Rafah operation would make it incredibly difficult to sustain the increases in humanitarian assistance that we have been able to deliver over the past few weeks since the president's call with Prime Minister Netanyahu on April 4, you have seen an increase in the number of trucks going in through Kerem Shalom, you have seen an increase in the distribution inside of Gaza, including inside southern Gaza. All of that would be put in jeopardy by Rafah's offensive,\" Miller told a press briefing.\n\nThe US has proposed to the Israeli government targeted and effective strategies to address legitimate military objectives against Hamas battalions in Rafah, Miller added.\n\nUS Will Not Have Representative at Putin's Inauguration\n\nThe United States will not have any representative attending the inauguration of Russian President Vladimir Putin, Miller noted.\n\n\"We will not have a representative at his inauguration,\" he said.\n\nMiller said that the US \"certainly did not consider\" Russia's March presidential election free and fair but Putin is \"the President of Russia and is going to continue in that capacity.\"", "source": {"uri": "globalsecurity.org", "dataType": "news",

The spokesperson said the ambassador, Nigel Casey, \"reiterated the UK's support for Ukraine in the face of unprovoked Russian aggression.\"\n\nRussia has seized the battlefield initiative after a failed Ukrainian counteroffensive last year. But Moscow's advances remain slow and bloody, and new deliveries of Western weapons are on their way, including those from a $61 billion military aid package that the United States approved last month.\n\nBeyond discouraging the West from greater involvement in Ukraine's war effort, the Kremlin wants to exploit divisions within the NATO military alliance over the risks of doing so. That schism was on display in February after Macron first mentioned the possibility of putting Western troops in Ukraine. Peskov said that such a move would lead to a direct clash with Russian forces.\n\nRecent months have marked a hawkish shift for Macron, who more than two years ago tried to head off the invasion of Ukraine by dangling the possibility of integrating Russia into a new European security architecture.\n\nRussia's announcement of tactical nuclear drills drew a sharp response from NATO on Monday.\n\n\"Russia's nuclear rhetoric is dangerous and irresponsible,\" said Farah Dakhlallah, a NATO spokesperson. \"NATO remains vigilant.\"\n\nShe added: \"Ukraine has a right to self-defense, which is enshrined in the UN charter, and NATO allies will continue to support Ukraine.

This time, however, the aim is to send a loud message, he said.\n\n\"This is a reaction to specific statements, a signal saying that Russia has nuclear weapons,\" Podvig said.\n\nUnlike strategic nuclear weapons, which are always in a state of combat readiness, nonstrategic ones are stored in warehouses away from the bombers, missiles, or ships that are supposed to deliver them, Podvig said. During the exercise, Russian army formations are likely to practice how they could be deployed, he said.\n\nBut it would make little sense to use them in the context of the war in Ukraine, Podvig added, because the absence of large-scale, concentrated troop formations would limit their impact on the battlefield.\n\nOther analysts have also cast doubt on the military efficacy of using battlefield nuclear weapons in Ukraine, given the spread-out nature of Ukrainian forces.

He revealed that the General Staff is currently prepping for a military exercise. This training involves the assembly and utilization of non-strategic nuclear weapons. The significant announcement was perfectly timed, coinciding with an identical revelation by Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov at exactly 0500 EST.\n\nPeskov connected these exercises to recent declarations from the Western world regarding their willingness to deploy troops to Ukraine. The presidential press secretary tagged these declarations as potentially dangerous. He argued that the extraordinary surge in tensions, which he deemed unprecedented in its intensity, calls for special attention and extraordinary measures.\n\nMedvedev, on his part, likened some members of the US Congress, along with the French and British administrations, and what he termed as \"some crazy Baltic states and Poland,\" to a \"choir of irresponsible bastards\". Medvedev advocated for the deployment of their missile weapons, which were previously dispatched to Ukraine, across the entire Russian border.\n\nCapitol Hill, 10 Downing Street, and the Elysee Palace\n\nMedvedev attributes these actions to a calculated political gain, identifying what he perceives as decay in the Western ruling elite. According to him, this group fails to draw simple logical conclusions. His sharp statement insinuates that \"important international figures, regardless of whether they reside in Capitol Hill, Elys\u00e9e Palace, or 10 Downing Street, wouldn't escape in the event of a global disaster,\" his Twitter post highlighted. He draws parallels between the current situation and the Cuban Missile Crisis that the world faced several decades ago. However, he vocally critiques today's Western leaders, contending that they lack the wisdom of their Cold War counterparts such as Kennedy and Khrushchev.\n\nIn an additional but related development, the Russian press has insinuated that the British Ambassador to the Russian Federation has been summoned to the Foreign Office. However, neither the Foreign, Commonwealth, and Development Office [FCDO] nor the Russian Foreign Ministry have corroborated this report.\n\nReports of the ambassador being summoned were paired with statements made by France's President Macron, suggesting possible troop deployment to Ukraine, were Ukraine to request it. Furthermore, the reports indicated that the UK could potentially deliver long-range weapons, without any precautions about their usage deep within Russia's borders.\n\nWhat are these exercises?\n\nA large-scale exercise involving tactical nuclear weapons or forces in the Southern Military District would be significant, especially considering that Ukraine is actively striking in the Rostov Oblast and even further afield. If these weapons are transported to air bases or frontline facilities, the potential for escalation and miscalculation significantly increases.\n\nA military exercise to prepare and deploy a non-strategic nuclear weapon, also known as a tactical nuclear weapon, involves several stages. The first stage is the planning phase, which includes determining the target, the type of weapon to be used, and the method of delivery. The second stage involves the physical preparation of the weapon, which may include assembly, testing, and loading onto the delivery vehicle.\n\nThe third stage involves the actual firing or deployment of the weapon. Depending on the method of delivery, this could involve launching from a submarine, dropping from an aircraft, or launching from the ground. The fourth stage involves analyzing the results of the operation to determine its effectiveness. Finally, the fifth stage is the post-operative phase. This includes debriefing personnel, analyzing the entire operation, and identifying lessons learned. This phase is critical for improving future operations and ensures the continued effectiveness of the Army's non-strategic nuclear capability.\n\nTypes of Russian non-strategic weapons\n\nThe Russian Federation maintains a diverse arsenal of weapons. One type is nuclear depth charges, which are designed to be dropped from aircraft or deployed from surface ships or submarines to attack enemy submarines. Another type is nuclear torpedoes, which are self-propelled underwater projectiles designed to detonate upon reaching a predetermined target.\n\nRussia also possesses nuclear artillery shells. These are essentially standard artillery shells but with a nuclear warhead. Russia's arsenal also includes nuclear land mines. These devices are placed in the ground and detonated either by a timer, remote control, or the presence of a vehicle or person.\n\nAnother category includes air-to-surface missiles, which are designed to be launched from aircraft at ground targets. These can carry nuclear warheads and are designed for use against a variety of targets, including enemy air defenses, infrastructure, and troop concentrations. Finally, there are short-range ballistic missiles, such as the Iskander-M, which can carry nuclear warheads and are intended for use against targets such as enemy troop concentrations, command posts, and infrastructure.", "source": {"uri": "bulgarianmilitary.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Bulgarian Military Industry Review"}, "authors": [{"uri": "boyko_nikolov@bulgarianmilitary.com", "name": "Boyko Nikolov", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/\u00c9lys\u00e9e_Palace", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "\u00c9lys\u00e9e Palace"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/10_Downing_Street", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "10 Downing Street"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dmitry_Medvedev", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dmitry Medvedev"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukraine", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Russia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capitol_Hill", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Capitol Hill"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign,_Commonwealth_and_Development_Office", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premier_of_the_Soviet_Union", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Premier of the Soviet Union"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_exercise", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Military exercise"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Capitol", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Capitol"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baltic_states", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Baltic states"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moscow_Kremlin", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Moscow Kremlin"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dmitry_Peskov", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dmitry Peskov"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security_Council_of_Russia", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Security Council of Russia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_world", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Western world"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_weapon", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nuclear weapon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poland", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Poland"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Poland"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "France"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cuban_Missile_Crisis", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cuban Missile Crisis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tactical_nuclear_weapon", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tactical nuclear weapon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikita_Khrushchev", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nikita Khrushchev"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_Military_District", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Southern Military District"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ministry_of_Foreign_Affairs_(Russia)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Russia)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emmanuel_Macron", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Emmanuel Macron"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_F._Kennedy", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "John F.

This would be a Russian response to the claims of French President Emmanuel Macron and other senior British officials \"to be willing to send military contingents to Ukraine\".

So, What Now?", "body": "On Monday, Russia announced its Southern Military District would hold snap tactical nuclear weapons drills involving its ground, navy, and air forces that will help \"iron out\" how exactly it might conduct a tactical nuclear strike.\n\nWhile such drills are not unprecedented, announcing them in advance was, as Moscow usually only gives advance warning of its long-range strategic weapons capable of reaching the U.S. soil.\n\n\"This, to my knowledge, is the first time [Russia] has ordered tactical nuke exercise of forces in a district [bordering] Ukraine with explicit reference to the West,\" nuclear arms control analyst Hans Krinstensen writes. \"Obviously intended as a signal.\"\n\nFortunately, the drills do not involve actual weapons launches, and a Pentagon spokesman told the media he doesn't see any movement of Russia indicating actual planning to use nukes now any more than it has after making dozens of past nuclear threats.\n\nRussia's tactical (or 'non-strategic') nuclear weapons have the range to hit targets out to Germany, if ground-launched by Iskander missile launchers in the Baltic enclave of Kaliningrad) or across most of Europe using Kh-32 cruise missiles air-launched by Russian bombers or (possibly) Kinzhal hypersonic missiles mounted on MiG-31 interceptors. Various Russian warships also can launch nuclear-capable Kalibr and P-800 Oniks cruise missiles.\n\nRussian rhetoric specifically indicates the drill is in response to comments by British Foreign Secretary David Cameron that it would permit Ukraine to use-long range weapons supplied by the U.K. (presumably, highly effective Storm Shadow cruise missiles) for strikes on Russian soil. Meanwhile, French President Emmanuel Macron has also inspired Russian ire with comments suggesting he might consider deploying a limited number of French troops to aid Ukraine.\n\nOther grievances cited by Russia's foreign ministry include Poland's requests to join NATO's nuclear-sharing policy (which involves U.S. B61 tactical nuclear gravity bombs mounted on F-16, F-35 or Tornado jet fighters of allies) and false claims that F-16s newly supplied to Ukraine can carry nuclear weapons. While some F-16s are wired to deliver nuclear weapons, that is not true of those delivered to Ukraine in particular.\n\nPrior to now, such NATO-supplied weapons have been provided on the stipulation they're used only on targets in Ukrainian soil -- a policy that has led Ukraine to rely only on its own improvised drones and missiles for such attacks.\n\nBut the Russian drills might be more than a response to Western rhetoric. On social media, RAND defense analyst Dara Massicot connects the drills to a Ukrainian strike on Crimea on the evening of May 4 involving newly delivered American ATACMS ballistic missiles that may have destroyed Russian Iskander missile launchers.\n\nAfter receiving an initial batch of older, shorter-range (max 103 miles) M39 ATACMS missiles that Ukraine used to destroy around 20 landed Russian helicopters last Fall, there was a pause in ATACMS deliveries due to opposition from Republicans in Congress.\n\nBut nearly a half year later in, April U.S. aid finally resumed, now including deliveries of much longer-range M57 ATACMs missiles with a max range of 186 miles and GPS-enhanced precision, considerably expanding Ukraine's strike options.\n\nThe May 4 strike may have knocked out Iskander ballistic missiles launchers trucks, which are dual-capable, meaning they can be used for both nuclear and conventional attacks.\n\nSatellite imagery on May 5 confirms fires and scorch marks on the ground where Iskander launchers were spotted in earlier satellite photos made public on May 2. Russian sources claim to have shot down four ATACMS missiles over Crimea missile that evening. However, other Russian social media posts suggest two Iskander-M launchers and an ammunition warehouse were hit.\n\nThe latest images don't conclusively confirm whether any Iskander launchers were knocked out.\n\nDara Massicot, Senior Fellow, Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, Russia and Eurasia Program, writes:\n\n\"If [Ukraine] destroyed or damaged an Iskander SRBM [short-range ballistic missile], it would be a first for this war. And I suspect, if this site was targeted -regardless of damage, they want to make sure everyone knows those launchers are dual-use. The launchers are a critical vulnerability for Russia's ability to strike Ukraine. They cannot replace launchers quickly and there's not that many.\"\n\nIt's important to emphasize Iskanders are 'fair game', as Russia has used conventionally armed Iskander missiles extensively to attack both military and civilian targets in Ukraine; the system's hypersonic ballistic missiles are much harder for Ukrainian defense to intercept than more common subsonic cruise missiles and Shahed drones.\n\nAnd Iskanders in occupied Crimea are situated on what is legally Ukrainian soil (much as Putin vehemently insists otherwise after seizing the peninsula in 2014) and thus not in violation of any U.S.-Ukrainian agreement forbidding attacks on Russian soil using U.S. weapons.\n\nWhile Russia is undoubtedly mad about Cameron's recent statement authorizing Ukraine to use British weapons for strikes on Russian soil, ironically, Russia itself has repeatedly led the pack in violating treaties and norms on long-range weapons and nuclear arms when it deployed longer-range Iskander-K nuclear missiles in violation of the INF treaty during the 2010s (leading to the treaty's collapse), then deployed nuclear weapons to Belarus, and apparently acquired ballistic missiles from North Korea and launched them at Ukraine.\n\nWhile expensive nuclear arsenals have never again been used in war since the two U.S. atomic bombings of Japan in 1945, in recent years, Russia has particularly sought to derive additional value from its nukes by hinting they might get used in response should it suffer major military defeats or face escalated western support for Ukraine.\n\nMore explicitly, but less officially, senior Russian politicians like former president Dmitry Medvedev and propagandists like Margarita Simonyan have fantasized on state television regarding unleashing nuclear weapons to secure victory in Ukraine.\n\nGrowing reliance on nuclear threats reflects Russia's relative weakness in conventional military power vis-\u00e0-vis NATO in the post-Soviet era.\n\nThough Putin's bluffed nuclear redlines have been crossed many times in the last two years, nuclear threats have nonetheless affected the thinking of certain Western policy makers -- notably German Chancellor Olaf Scholz and U.S. National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan -- and thereby curbed the volume and kinds of military aid certain states are willing to provide Ukraine.\n\nAfter all, there's still no telling which redlines are false and which are real, a state of ambiguity Putin appears happy to exploit despite the inherent risks.\n\nGenerally, Russia is believed to possess just over 160 Iskander-M launchers (NATO codename SS-26 Stone) including 12 attached to Russia's Coastal Defense force, as the Iskander does have a terminal seeker that may enable engagement of moving naval targets.\n\nThe basic eight-wheeled Iskander MZKT-79306 ASTROLOG transport-erector-launcher (TEL) truck carries two 9M723 missiles. A separate MZKT truck carries two reload missiles, while various six-wheeled trucks by Kamaz serve as command and equipment transport vehicles.\n\nThe standard missile used is the 9M723 quasi-ballistic missile, landing on average within 7 meters when aided by satellite navigation, or 30 meters when not. That's a major improvement over its Soviet predecessor, the OTR-21 Tochka (codename SS-21 Scarab). Iskander ostensibly has a maximum range of 310 miles, but that has likely been extended substantially since Russia withdrew from the INF treaty.\n\n9M723s are also much harder to shoot down thanks to an extreme peak speed of Mach 6-7, and ability to maneuver evasively mid-flight and ability to release six air defense decoys (known as 'penetration aids'). The 9M723 can be armed with a nuclear warhead of up to 50 kilotons yield, a regular high explosives warhead, cluster sub-munitions -- or more rarely, thermobaric, ground-penetrating, and EMP payloads. Each missile allegedly costs $3 million, a particularly steep price by Russian standards.\n\nAn Iskander-K variant armed with the slower 9M729 Novator cruise missile also exists and was a key factor in the collapse of the INF arms control treaty due to its range likely exceeding 1,000 miles.\n\nEarly in the war, Iskanders particularly targeted Ukrainian airbases and air defense radars. More recently, Russia has used Iskanders supported by drone-forward spotters for successful time-sensitive strikes that destroyed one or more launchers belonging to a Ukrainian Patriot air defense battery and an HIMARS M142 rocket-launching truck.\n\nFortunately, Russia's use of Iskanders missiles is constrained by monthly production after using up most of its back inventory early in the war. Presently 'fresh' Iskander strikes are limited by a production rate of roughly 30 new 9M723 ballistic missiles per month (up from only 6 produced monthly at the war's onset) supplemented by 12 additional 9M729 cruise missiles monthly.\n\nAs a result, Russia has also withdrawn from retirement the much-less-accurate Tochka-U ballistic missile for strikes on Ukraine, including a notorious cluster munition attack that killed 58 civilians fleeing the war at the Kramatorsk's train station on April 8, 2022.", "source": {"uri": "popularmechanics.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Popular

Our strategic forces are always in a state of combat readiness.'\n\nPutin accused the West of 'attempts to distort the truth about World War Two', all the while holding onto one of Russia's nuclear briefcases.\n\nPlain-clothed aides carried the so-called 'Cheget' (named after Mount Cheget in the Caucasus Mountains), which is with the president at all times.\n\nShoigu, and the chief of the general staff, currently Valery Gerasimov, are thought to have such briefcases too.\n\nProtection shields were also within spitting distance in the event of an attempt to assassinate the dictator.\n\nNot much is known about the briefcase, but it is understood that it does not have a nuclear button.\n\nInstead, it is a link between the despot and the command and control network of Russia's strategic nuclear forces, transmitting launch orders.\n\nAccording to a 2020 document called 'Basic Principles of State Policy of the Russian Federation on Nuclear Deterrence', it is the Russian president who takes the decision to use nuclear weapons.\n\nThe Victory Day parade comes just days after the Kremlin announced plans topractice the deployment of tactical nuclear weapons after 'threats' from France, Britain and the US.\n\nBoth Russia and allied Belarus will take part in the military drills after the transfer of some tactical nuclear weapons across the border.\n\n'There is nothing unusual here, this is planned work,' Putin said. 'It is training.'\n\nRussia's defence ministry, in its announcement on Monday, explicitly linked the nuclear exercise to 'provocative statements and threats by certain Western officials against the Russian Federation'.\n\nWar-crimes expert Wayne Jordash, who is based in Kyiv, said: 'The irony is clearly lost on president Putin as Russia parades on Victory Day, in celebration of the defeat of fascism in Europe, while simultaneously actively pursuing its inherently criminal plan to militarily invade and occupy Ukraine, subjugate and Russify its population and eliminate any semblance of Ukrainian identity.\n\n'We are now beyond 130,000 registered Russian war crimes in Ukraine, including thousands of civilians dead and injured, and thousands more arbitrarily detained, tortured and sexually abused in the course of Russia's full-scale invasion and occupation.\n\n'Far from protecting Russia from fascism, Putin as dictator has turned Russia into an autocratic, militaristic, revanchist state, seemingly determined to do whatever it takes - including crimes against humanity - to lock down territory and force a population to accept an identity which they resolutely resist.'\n\nMORE : US soldier charged in Russia after 'visiting girlfriend told her he supported Trump'\n\nMORE : Putin 'ready to launch mini-invasion against Nato nations' to test West", "source":

The exercises declared on Monday center on Russia's southern military district, which has responsibility for operations in Ukraine. This is clearly an effort to intimidate the West over the war in Ukraine.\n\nTwo key points bear note.\n\nFirst, this announcement fits within a broader portfolio of escalating Russian intimidation tactics. Recent weeks have seen numerous covert sabotage attacks and plots across Europe, including a successful arson attack in London. Western intelligence services are highly confident that further attacks of this kind are being planned. The Russian rationale for these attacks is clear. Russian President Vladimir Putin is infuriated by French President Emmanuel Macron's warning that a major Russian military breakthrough of Ukrainian defensive lines would lead him to consider deploying French forces to Ukraine.\n\nPutin is also attempting to intimidate the United Kingdom. Following the Russian arson attack in London back in March orchestrated by the Russian intelligence service, the U.K. allowed Ukraine to use British weapons, such as the Storm Shadow cruise missile system, against targets inside Russia. Responding to the U.K., the Kremlin summoned the British ambassador to Moscow on Monday. Foreign ministry officials informed him that if U.K. weapons are used in Russia, then Russia may target U.K. military sites \"beyond\" Ukraine. The U.K. response to this threat will be to reinforce its commitment to defending itself and to triggering NATO's Article 5 mutual defense stipulation if necessary.\n\nNevertheless, Putin's intent is clear. He wants to provoke fear among Western populations that their governments are taking excessive risks in Ukraine's support. Putin knows that the more cautious bloc of European leaders, led by Germany's Olaf Scholz and supported by others such as Spain's Pedro Sanchez, tends to bend whenever Russia ups the intimidation ante. Putin wants to catalyze this dynamic and see these leaders put pressure on their counterparts in France, the U.K., and Poland to placate Russia. He wants political and military breathing room to launch a major summer offensive in Ukraine.\n\nThe second takeaway here involves China.\n\nChinese leader Xi Jinping is on an official state visit to France. And while Xi has shown resolute support for Russia's war effort via massively increased trade and the provision to Russia of sanctioned goods, he has also made clear that China views any prospective use of nuclear weapons in Ukraine as a red-line concern.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM THE WASHINGTON EXAMINER\n\nScheduling these exercises just after Xi arrived in Paris, Putin is thus sending a message to European leaders that Xi's influence over him has limits. The Chinese will be infuriated by Putin's action, viewing it as disrespectful and undermining of Xi's very carefully cultivated leadership narrative. Putin knows this. But he also knows that the Europeans and the United States also know it. In turn, his calculated repudiation of Xi is designed to reinforce the credibility of his nuclear brinkmanship against the West. Put simply, Putin is saying, \"Don't view these exercises as just for show.\"\n\nFrance, the U.K., the U.S., and other allies cannot afford to bow before Putin's nuclear dagger. As in the Cold War, Russian nuclear brinkmanship can be deterred by two things: first, the presentation of a significantly greater nuclear threat against Russia than what Russia can present against the West and, second, the assurance by rhetoric and action that Russian brinkmanship will result only in greater Western resolution and excess risks to Putin's standing. Oh, and the U.S. should also push China to explain how its pledge to seek only \"win-win cooperation\" with Europe is compatible with its close partner threatening to use nuclear weapons against Europe.", "source": {"uri": "washingtonexaminer.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Washington Examiner"}, "authors": [{"uri": "tom_rogan@washingtonexaminer.com", "name": "Tom Rogan", "type":

Since the deliberate target of such strikes is often civilian objects, this leads to numerous casualties among the civilian population. However, this does not bother the sponsors of the clique entrenched in Kyiv, who are pushing it to commit new crimes. Thus, British Foreign Minister D. Cameron and representatives of some other NATO capitals directly state that Ukraine has the right to attack Russian territory with weapons supplied to it.\n\nIn addition to the British and French long-range missile systems, which have long been spotted in Ukraine, against this background we especially highlight those versions of the American missiles of the ATACMS family, which have recently been supplied to Kyiv and are also capable of hitting targets deep in Russian territory.\n\nAt the same time, in an effort to increase multifaceted missile threats to our country, the United States has openly and clearly taken the path of deploying ground-based systems with intermediate- and shorter-range missiles (INF), which were previously prohibited under the INF Treaty, in various regions of the world. By torpedoing Russian initiatives to maintain the viability of this agreement, which involved eliminating counter-concerns on the basis of mutual verification measures, Washington deliberately destroyed this Treaty, which for many years served as one of the pillars of international security and strategic stability. After this, the United States immediately intensified the development and testing of missile systems of this class, and also began to form specialized military units with regional reference and study the issue of creating the necessary infrastructure. Now the United States has begun to import the corresponding missile systems to Europe and the Asia-Pacific region, allegedly for the duration of exercises with allies, which indicates that the production and \"testing\" of these weapons is in full swing.\n\nWe expressly declare that whenever and wherever American-made ground-based INF missiles appear, we reserve the right to respond in a mirror manner, which will mean the termination of the unilateral Russian moratorium on the deployment of these weapons systems. In response to US actions, Russia is intensifying its development and starting production of similar missile systems. Moreover, taking into account the previously announced R&D and the accumulated developments of the Russian military-industrial complex, this process will not take much time. When making potential decisions on the deployment of such weapons, we leave the geography of their deployment at our discretion.\n\nIn the near future, multifunctional American-made F-16 aircraft are expected to appear on the Ukrainian theater of operations. As the Russian side has repeatedly pointed out, we cannot ignore the fact that these aircraft belong to dual-equipped platforms - non-nuclear and nuclear. For many years, aircraft of this particular type formed the basis of the aircraft fleet, which is used in the so-called \"joint nuclear missions\" of NATO. Regardless of what specific modification these aircraft will be supplied in, we will perceive them as carriers of nuclear weapons and consider this step by the United States and NATO as a targeted provocation.\n\nIn this regard, we pay special attention to the statements of the Polish leadership that the question of the need to place American nuclear weapons on Polish territory was directly raised by Warsaw to Washington, and on a practical level.\n\nThe statements of French President E. Macron about the possibility of sending French and other NATO contingents to Ukraine cannot but amaze with their irresponsibility and thoughtlessness . Moreover, information has appeared in the Western media that a number of mercenaries from the French Foreign Legion are already in Ukraine. It is difficult to perceive this other than as a manifestation of readiness and intention to enter into direct armed confrontation with Russia, which would mean a head-on military clash of nuclear powers. We have also recorded a series of steps from the French side, including military exercises and other events, which, apparently, should support E. Macron's statements by demonstrating the nuclear capabilities of Paris.\n\nThese and some other actions of the member states of the North Atlantic bloc actually indicate that they are deliberately leading the matter towards a further escalation of the Ukrainian crisis towards an open military clash between NATO countries and Russia as part of the implementation of a hostile course to inflict \"strategic defeat\" on our country.\n\nWe note that the aggressive desire of NATO countries to undermine the security of the Russian Federation is gaining momentum. In this regard, we would like to remind you that the guaranteed protection of the sovereignty and territorial integrity of our country is the highest priority of Russian policy in the field of military security, including the aspect of nuclear deterrence.\n\nThe regime in Kyiv and its Western inspirers should finally realize that their reckless steps are bringing the situation ever closer to the accumulation of an explosive \"critical mass.\" The military dangers created in this way and the resulting threats to our country are clearly outlined in the Military Doctrine of the Russian Federation and the Fundamentals of the State Policy of the Russian Federation in the field of nuclear deterrence.\n\nThe assessments outlined above formed the basis for the decision to conduct Russian military exercises involving part of the forces and means of nuclear deterrence, which are intended to become a sobering signal to the West and its puppets in Kyiv.\n\nWe hope that this event will cool down the \"hot heads\" in Western capitals, will help them realize the possible catastrophic consequences of the strategic risks they generate and will keep them from both assisting the Kyiv regime in its terrorist actions and from being drawn into direct armed confrontation with Russia.", "source": {"uri": "globalsecurity.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "GlobalSecurity.org"},

Read more Russia has the world's largest arsenal of nuclear weapons.\n\nThe exercise is aimed at ensuring Russia's territorial integrity and sovereignty \"in response to provocative statements and threats by certain Western officials against the Russian Federation\", the ministry said.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nPutin's 2022 invasion of Ukraine touched off the worst breakdown in relations between Russia and the West since the 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis, according to Russian and US diplomats.\n\nRussia casts the war as a battle with the West, which Putin says ignored Moscow's attempt at friendship after the 1991 fall of the Soviet Union and sought to grab control of Ukraine while enlarging the Nato military alliance eastwards.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe West and Ukraine say they will not rest until Russian forces are defeated, and cast the war as an imperial-style land grab aimed at forcing the country back into Moscow's orbit.\n\nStay up-to-date by following Daily Express's Telegram channel.\n\nDaily Express Malaysia\n\n* Follow us on Instagram and join our Telegram and/or WhatsApp channel(s) for the latest news you don't want to miss.\n\n* Do you have access to the Daily Express e-paper and online exclusive news?

If debate on a NATO intervention raises the pressure on Russia's government to the point it acts out, real, concrete steps to intercede, putting NATO \"boots on the ground\", may do a lot to end Russia's disruptive, decade-long campaign to subjugate Kyiv.\n\nThere's no immediate need for Western troops to take combat roles. In Ukraine, Western or other allied help with border security, logistics and administration can free an enormous number of Ukrainian troops from ancillary support missions, allowing the country to better handle front-line challenges.\n\nA physical, \"boots-on-the-ground\" deployment of Western troops into Ukraine offers Kyiv a much-needed morale and battlefield capability boost. Intervention by Western troops -- coupled with viable threats elsewhere on the Russian-NATO border -- puts real pressure on Russia's beleaguered dictator, Vladimir Putin. In Ukraine, foreign troops complicate Russia's targeting efforts. They may even encourage Russia to study their unfavorable strategic situation and get real about ending their illegal invasion of a free European country and halting their unremitting -- and very warlike -- campaign against democracies across the globe.\n\nThe road to peace may only open after Europe draws a red line and backs it with force.\n\nCertainly, Western troops operating in Ukraine will be at some risk. But Western troops often operate under perilous circumstances, helping endangered governments or people.\n\nMilitaries can handle the risks in Ukraine's rear areas. Right now, as the United States prepares to begin operation of a massive, 1,800-foot-long floating pier off Gaza, the Secretary of Defense is unable to guarantee deployed U.S. troops from the Army's 7 Transportation Brigade won't be fired upon as they bring much-needed humanitarian aid to Gaza.\n\nThe U.S. troops on the Gaza pier will be in a dangerous situation. With Israel and Hamas both continuing their war, U.S. troops offer an enormous high-value/high-status target. Hamas has already attacked the pier's presumed operational area, and Israel, charged with securing the pier area, can't help but wonder if a nihilistic Hamas strike on U.S. troops might deepen U.S. support of Israel.\n\nThe Gaza humanitarian mission is a complicated and fraught situation, but, despite the real risks to U.S. soldiers and sailors, America moved forward on the pier with little debate or hesitation. Ukraine offers a similar risky situation, with U.S. troops working, under hazard, to support a beleaguered population. An operation to support Ukraine, couched in similar humanitarian assistance terms as the Gaza pier effort, can be done just as quickly and with little debate as well.\n\nThe idea of a confrontation between nuclear-armed states is always disconcerting to the West. In response to President Macron, Russia, wasted no time in announcing it would be carrying out exercises to \"increase the readiness of non-strategic nuclear weapons forces to carry out combat missions...in response to provocative statements and threats of individual Western officials against the Russian Federation.\"\n\nBut fears that Western engagement -- even fighting -- in Ukraine will lead to a nuclear confrontation are overblown. Russia has long used nuclear weaponry as a provocative cudgel, threatening and unveiling doomsday devices well before the full-scale invasion of Ukraine got underway. Bluster is a common Russian tactic.\n\nDespite the West's delicate efforts to avoid a nuclear confrontation, Russia has shown no hesitation in striking out at nuclear-armed rivals.\n\nIn nuclear-armed England, Russia employed chemical and radiological weaponry to assassinate residents and citizens. A nuclear exchange didn't happen.\n\nRussia has been at odds with nuclear-armed France for years without sparking a nuclear standoff. Russian mercenaries, backed by a comprehensive and dirty Russian disinformation campaign, have, over the past several years, chased French military forces out of the Sahel region in Africa.\n\nRussian sources have, since January, claimed French mercenaries were operating in Ukraine and that Russian forces had carried out a \"precision strike\" that killed \"French mercenaries.\" Rather than turn to nuclear weapons, according to Politico, the French turned to the diplomatic option, summoning the Russian ambassador \"over the deaths of two French humanitarian workers in Ukraine and disinformation campaigns targeting France.\"\n\nU.S. and Russian forces have come to blows and have even fought. In early 2023, Russian Su-27 jets brought down a U.S. MQ-9 surveillance drone. And, in 2018, in Syria, Russian mercenaries squared off against U.S. Special Forces troops, at an estimated cost of around 300 Russian casualties (Russia acknowledged the loss of only five citizens). Even this direct confrontation did not turn into an exercise in nuclear brinksmanship.\n\nAfter so many Russian provocations, it is a wonder that the West hasn't done more to turn up the heat on Putin's regime, giving Russia a dose of its own saber-rattling medicine in the form of a direct, boots-on-the-ground intervention in Ukraine.\n\nIn short, any open theoretical discussion of a Western military intervention in Ukraine is healthy. Marcon's musings, though somewhat shocking to some, prepares NATO for tough options in the future. With Russia on a war footing, there is no viable reason as to why Russia, if it takes Kyiv, would stop at Ukraine's borders.\n\nBy making a \"boots-on-the-ground\" intervention in Ukraine a real and concrete option, the prospect of a wider wartime-level of commitment can force Europe and others to get real about exploring less directly confrontational options, like remedying Europe's increasingly lackadaisical approach to sanctions enforcement and Russian asset seizures.\n\nIf Europe is unwilling to take the tough economic steps required to really squeeze Russia into ending their invasion -- and halting Russia's unremitting -- and rather warlike -- effort to destabilize Europe and other Western democracies -- without the threat of war, the only options for Europe will be to either get directly involved in the fight or to get about surrendering to Russian-style authoritarianism.", "source": {"uri": "forbes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Forbes"}, "authors": [], "concepts":

The Kremlin argues the move comes in response to proposals by some Western leaders to deploy troops in Ukraine. \"The exercise is aimed at maintaining the readiness of personnel and equipment of units for the combat use of non-strategic nuclear weapons in order to unconditionally ensure Russia's territorial integrity and sovereignty in response to provocative statements and threats from Western officials,\" the Russian Defense Ministry said in a statement Monday. The announcement, a warning signal, also comes after French President Emmanuel Macron raised the use of the nuclear force Paris possesses as a deterrence tool to protect its European partners.\n\nThe Kremlin issued the threat in a symbolic week: Putin will be inaugurated for a new presidential term on May 7 and two days later, May 9, is a date sacred to Russia: Victory Day, the anniversary of the Soviet triumph over Nazi Germany.\n\nKremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov specified that Putin's order responds to statements made by Macron, British Foreign Minister David Cameron, and U.S. officials. Peskov said that any discussion of deploying troops from NATO member states in Ukraine represented \"a completely new round of escalation of tension; it is unprecedented, and of course it requires special attention and special measures.\"\n\nThe missile formations of the Russian southern military district will coordinate with the air force and navy to \"practise the issues of preparation and use of non-strategic nuclear weapons,\" the Defense Ministry said. Although the Kremlin's official military doctrine envisages using its 6,000 nuclear warheads only if \"the very existence of the Russian Federation is under threat,\" the military high command also has the option of launching tactical and less powerful nuclear weapons to achieve its objectives by instilling fear in its enemies. This strategy, which has been on the table since Putin came to power in the early 2000s in the face of NATO's technological superiority, has been called \"escalate to de-escalate.\"\n\nThe French president mentioned a taboo subject for NATO last February: deploying troops inside Ukraine. Although the Elys\u00e9e later clarified that it would only be a question of military advisors for the Ukrainian army, Macron insisted again on May 2 on the possibility of sending Western troops \"if the Russians were to break through the front lines, if there were a Ukrainian request, which is not the case today.\"\n\nFor his part, David Cameron said last week in an interview with Sky News that reinforcing Ukrainian forces with Atlantic Alliance soldiers would be a \"dangerous escalation.\" Moscow, however, accuses London of straining the situation by authorizing Kyiv to fire the long-range weapons it has supplied against enemy military groups and infrastructure inside Russian territory.\n\nUkraine is awaiting the arrival of ammunition stocks promised by the U.S. and U.K., but continues to fight its war for existence with its own means. Hit by an unprecedented Ukrainian drone offensive against its refineries, Russian exports by ship of oil derivatives plummeted in April by more than 20% compared to the same month in 2023, and by more than 11% compared to March. The new Ukrainian strategy has taken its toll on Moscow, whose foreign sales of fuel oil and gasoline fell to their lowest level since consultancy Kpler began tracking its market in 2017.\n\nKyiv initiated a bombing campaign against the Russian oil industry in March to strike at one of the Kremlin's main sources of income. The aim of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy is to intensify the difficulties Russia is experiencing in maintaining its refineries in the face of the shortage of spare parts caused by Western sanctions. According to estimates by the Russian state statistics agency, Rosstat, production of petroleum products had fallen by more than 10% since the attacks began up to mid-April.\n\nUkrainian attacks have targeted refineries deep in Russia's European zone. In March alone, facilities in far-flung regions such as Nizhny Novgorod, Samara, Oryol, Ryazan, Rostov and Leningrad, some bordering Finland and others in the Caucasus, were hit.\n\nKpler's data show that fuel oil exports by ship were down 24% year-on-year in April as a whole and 11% as of March this year, to 815,000 barrels per day. Meanwhile, gasoline seaborne exports were down 20% and 15%, respectively, to 322,000 barrels per day. In the case of diesel, of which Russia was selling more than one million barrels per day as of February, its exports plunged to 762,000 barrels, down 28% year-on-year and 23% from the previous month.\n\n\"The situation is not critical because the oil can be diverted to other refineries that operate at 75% or 80% of their capacity,\" Stanislav Mitrakhovich, an expert at the Russian National Energy Security Fund, told this newspaper by telephone, although he stressed that this measure will be a headache for Russian rail transport and Ukrainian attacks may have an impact on the price of products inside the country.\n\nThe Kremlin has banned the export of gasoline between March 1 and August 1 to prevent a price escalation in the domestic market. \"The downside is that companies and the government make quite a lot of money from gasoline exports,\" says Mitrakhovich, who does not rule out the risk of a rise in fuel prices \"in the summer, when there will be an increase in demand for gasoline, although so far it has not had a terrible impact.\"", "source": {"uri": "english.elpais.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "EL PA\u00cdS"}, "authors": [{"uri": "javier_g_cuesta@english.elpais.com", "name": "Javier G.

China has the third-largest nuclear arsenal, followed by France and Britain.\n\nRussia has about 1,560 non-strategic nuclear warheads, according to the Federation of American Scientists, though there is uncertainty about exact figures due to a lack of transparency.\n\n(Reporting by Phil Stewart; Editing by Bill Berkrot)", "source": {"uri": "theprint.in", "dataType": "news", "title": "ThePrint"}, "authors": [{"uri": "reuters@theprint.in", "name": "Reuters", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Russia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_Military_District", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Southern Military District"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_general", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Major general"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Air_Force", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Air Force"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Pentagon", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Pentagon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aviation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Aviation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ministry_for_Europe_and_Foreign_Affairs_(France)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ministry for Europe and Foreign Affairs (France)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_alliance", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Military alliance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Territorial_integrity", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Territorial integrity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sovereignty", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sovereignty"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NATO", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NATO"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moscow", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Moscow"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Moscow"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federation_of_American_Scientists", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Federation of American Scientists"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_weapon", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nuclear weapon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "France"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Military", "label": "dmoz/Society/Military", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Physics/Nuclear", "label": "dmoz/Science/Physics/Nuclear", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Military_Science", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Military Science", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Pharmacy/Nuclear_Pharmacy", "label": "dmoz/Health/Pharmacy/Nuclear Pharmacy", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 92}], "image": null, "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9542018", "eventUri": "eng-9542018", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.01960784313725483, "wgt": 131, "relevance": 1}

Kennan in his essay \"The sources of Soviet behavior\", published in the journal Foreign Affairs in 1947 and whose main ideas are summarized in the quote \"Soviet power is impervious to the logic of reason but very sensitive to the logic of force\".\n\nThis would include the entry of Finland and Sweden into NATO military structures and the increase of military forces with four new battalions deployed on the European border with Russia and the Russian response to the installation of missiles in Belarus Iskander-M equipped with multi-purpose warheads as well as S-40 anti-aircraft missiles following the dynamics of the Cold War (action-reaction).\n\nFor their part, Russia would have installed in Kaliningrad the Iskander M missiles equipped with multi-purpose warheads as well as S-400 anti-aircraft missiles and in the event of NATO closing the exit of the Soviet enclave of Kaliningrad to the Baltic Sea, could be reissued the Kennedy-Khrushchev Missile Crisis (October, 1962) which would have as its epicenter Kaliningrad.\n\nNATO's Entry Into the Ukraine War?\n\nWith the US immersed in the electoral campaign for the November presidential elections, France, Poland and the United Kingdom would be the trident chosen by the globalists to implode the Ukrainian front next summer and provoke the subsequent entry of NATO into open conflict with Russia of a re-elected Putin until 2030.\n\nPoland seeks to become a local player in the Eastern European hornet's nest and extend its influence to the Ukrainian area by claiming its right to incorporate the Ukrainian region of Lviv on the Polish map, which was occupied by Poland from 1918 to 1939.\n\nThus, the Polish president, Andrzej Duda, affirmed that his country is \"willing to accept nuclear weapons\" from allied countries in its territory, which has received the harsh and forceful response of Moscow when warning that \"the deployment of such weapons in Poland will make Poland a priority objective in Russian military planning\".\n\nLikewise, in a statement from the Russian Foreign Ministry, Russia has warned that \"the arrival of F-16 fighters in Ukraine will see them as carriers of nuclear weapons and we will consider that step by the US and NATO as a deliberate provocation\"'while accusing the West of openly supporting Ukraine's sabotage actions on Russian territory and supplying Kiev with British and French long-range missiles as well as the new US ATACMS, which can reach Russian territory.\n\nWithin the dynamics of action-reaction typical of the new scenario of Cold War 2.0, Putin has ordered the Armed Forces of his country to conduct shortly tactical nuclear weapons maneuvers on the southern border with Ukraine. This would be a Russian response to the claims of French President Emmanuel Macron and other senior British officials \"to be willing to send military contingents to Ukraine\". Thus, France had already deployed in Ukraine its first troops from the French Third Infantry Regiment, which is one of the main units of the French Foreign Legion (L\u00e9gion \u00e9trang\u00e8re).\n\nUse of Tactical Nuclear Weapons?\n\nIf nobody prevents it, everything indicates that we are heading to the next entry of NATO in open conflict with Russia, not being disposable the use of \"non-strategic\" nuclear weapons, also known as \"tactical nuclear weapons\", according to the Nuclear Threat Initiative (NTI) and of which Russia would have about 1,800 warheads and NATO would have 250 warheads deployed in Europe.\n\nTactical warheads refer to those designed to be used on a limited battlefield, for example, to destroy a tank column or carrier battle group if used at sea, so they are also known as \"low performance\".\n\n[This official interpretation and narrative regarding \"low performance\" is misleading. Tactical nuclear weapons have an explosive capacity between one third (1/3) of a Hiroshima to 12 times a Hiroshima bomb, M. Ch.]\n\nHowever, according to Union of Concerned Scientists, a simulation by Princeton University of a US-Russia conflict that begins with the use of a tactical nuclear weapon predicts \"a rapid escalation that would leave more than 90 million dead and injured\", with which the onset of a low-intensity nuclear conflict could degenerate into a large-scale nuclear conflagration with disastrous results for humanity.\n\n*\n\nNote to readers: Please click the share button above.

The Order of Battle is being set and like the 1980's movie, The Day After, the strangulation by NATO of the Soviets, produced an aggressive response which led to a nuclear war.\n\nWhat is taking place now in Ukraine is that Russia has successfully breached, obliterated and neutralized the Nazi lines, so that NATO forces are filling the gaps in direct war with Russia. As Russia is singling out England and France, the role of advisor has become the role of active combatant, and Russia is running the prelude to all of this in tactical nuclear war strikes on select targets in Europe.\n\n\"Casey was warned that the response to Ukrainian strikes using British weapons on Russian territory could be any British military facilities and equipment on the territory of Ukraine and beyond,\" the Russian Foreign Ministry said in a statement following the meeting.\n\nUK & French ambassadors summoned to Russian Foreign Ministry\n\nAmbassadors of the United Kingdom and France visit the Russian Foreign Ministry\n\nThe reasons for this visit are not revealed.\n\nHalf an hour after his arrival, the British ambassador left the forum without... Show more\n\nIn addition to this, Russia has stated that with the arrival of American F 16's which can be armed with British nuclear storm shadow missiles, in addition to attacks on Russian soil, Russia will attack any British and French military interests of it's choosing in retaliation. This means Russia will use it's hypersoncis to not just cut the command and control of NATO off, but it will be direct attacks upon British and French bases on their respective soil.\n\nThis is the Fire Wall. This is the Kremlin making it plain, that it will strike London and Paris, but not the United States as the last alternative to direct strikes upon US Carrier groups and the United States.\n\nRussia understands it is not capable of a protection of world war with conventional forces. It will use nuclear weapons to fight this out in attempt to save herself.\n\nGenerals Call For 'Tough Show' Of Force From Putin - They Want\n\nA Mercenary Center In Ukraine To Be Hit With Nuclear Missiles\n\nRussia Delivered A Three-Point 'Nuclear Ultimatum' To France\n\nAnd Britain - 'We Will Bomb Your Countries Directly!'\n\nThe Germans are still hiding in the forest though but in mock support showing support for NATO. It will benefit the Germans to have NATO beheaded and enough of France and England smoldering heaps, leaving Germany intact for dominating Europe west and central with Russia in the east.\n\nIf this comes to tactical nuclear strikes, Russia will for security measures take Finland, the Baltics and the Baltic Sea.\n\nBelow is the results of a Russian fuel bomb, or air bomb attack, where the American technology of spraying gas into the air and igniting the fuel is like a mini nuclear bomb going off. It sucks all the oxygen out in the burn and kills everything.\n\nThis is the type of weapon that Russia will use in Romania and other forward NATO bases to neutralize and cleanse the threat.\n\nRussia is winning in Ukraine and this will escalate. America is in dire need of the dead Henry Kissinger and not these woke Ashkenaz Kaganites ruling policy around the world and making us all targets of death. Kissinger stated that when you have a failed state like Ukraine, you do not start a nuclear war. You get a new state to carry on the policy.\n\nAs of now this is head strikes at NATO and tactical nuclear strikes. Russia has not moved to America proper. Russia should not strike the North Dakota, Montana, Wyoming, and South Dakota ICBM silos as those nuke are obsolete, 25% will not fire off, and Russia's S 500 system will shoot them all down. Russia would obliterate the Missouri Whiteman and Minot North Dakota SAC nuclear bases so they would be available for rearming bombers. Those strikes would be Protestant Christian survival strikes in only polluting the vicinity of the strikes. Russia in logic would save the 400 warheads to double tap the woke metro areas which are causing all of this maniac policy in the world.\n\nIt would behoove a number of these shit for brains Governors in America to proclaim non aggression against Russia, as it might be the thing which saves their states from death, as these GOPlite Governors are not going to be invited into DC bunkers.", "source":

At the same time, Vladimir Putin addressed Western countries, stating that Russia is open to talking with them, especially on the topics of security and strategic stability.\n\nOn May 7, the Russian government handed over power to the newly elected president, as required by law. Experts told Izvestia they expect the president to pick a candidate for prime minister either on inauguration day or the day after. Chairwoman of the Federation Council Valentina Matviyenko announced some personnel changes but emphasized that the \"backbone\" of the government would remain in place.\n\nAccording to Vladimir Volokh, professor at the State University of Management and a member of the Russian Presidential Council on Interethnic Relations, the country's primary goal going forward will be to resolve issues related to the special military operation, in addition to further improving the country's socioeconomic situation.\n\nAt the same time, political expert Dmitry Fetisov pointed out that Russia's growth strategy was previously based on its position in the oil and gas markets. According to the expert, the country is now moving away from this, but foreign policy will continue to be at the top of the agenda for the incoming president.\n\nThe majority of Western countries refused to send representatives to the inauguration. According to the US media, France (whose President Emmanuel Macron has recently been the EU's major hawk), Hungary, Slovakia, Greece, Malta, and Cyprus were the only countries to come to the Kremlin Palace on May 7. According to Evgeny Minchenko, Head of the International Institute of Political Expertise, the West is trying to send a message that Moscow is on its own. \"But this is not very important now for Russia, given the fact that these countries have taken a mostly hostile position towards it,\" the expert noted.\n\nIn his inauguration speech, President Vladimir Putin stated that Russia is willing to negotiate security and strategic stability with the West. However, it appears that the West was unimpressed by the news of Russia's non-strategic nuclear force exercises, which the Kremlin says are meant to deter the US and NATO from getting further involved in the Ukraine crisis, Nezavisimaya Gazeta writes. The EU did not respond to the news about the exercises, but on May 6-7 representatives of 140 factories from 25 EU countries discussed cooperation with Kiev in the production of ammunition and other weapons that, according to Ukraine's Minister of Strategic Industry Alexander Kamyshin, Ukrainian troops need to carry on fighting.\n\nAccording to military expert Nikolay Shulgin, Moscow's preparations to undertake drills involving the deployment of tactical nuclear weapons were made \"to cool down the 'hot heads' in the West.\"\n\nShulgin told Nezavisimaya Gazeta he believes that if Western assistance for the Ukrainian Armed Forces threatens important state and military facilities, or compromises Russia's integrity and sovereignty, the country is sure to use its tactical nuclear weapons against the enemy. \"In Ukraine, these targets for Russian non-strategic nuclear forces include control points, basing and launching long-range precision weapons from France and the UK, as well as US ATACMS operational-strategic missiles, which will most likely be staffed by foreign experts and consultants. This will also apply to Ukrainian Armed Forces military airfields, where F-16 jets, which are regarded as potential nuclear carriers in Russia, will be stationed,\" Shulgin said.\n\nMeanwhile, the media reported that Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky has submitted proposals to the Verkhovna Rada to prolong martial law and general mobilization for another three months beginning May 14. These documents were authorized by the Verkhovna Rada Defense Committee on May 7, and experts expect the Ukrainian Parliament to vote on them on May 8.\n\nChinese President Xi Jinping concluded his visit to France on May 7. Following that, the Chinese leader paid his first visit to Serbia in eight years, on the 25th anniversary of the US bombing of the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade. The day prior, Macron and Xi gave a joint press conference, where Xi advocated for convening an international peace conference that would be recognized by both Russia and Ukraine and have equal participation from all parties and an unbiased discussion of all settlement proposals. Thus, China is unlikely to endorse the conference scheduled for mid-June in Switzerland, to which no Russian delegates have been invited, Vedomosti writes.", "source": {"uri": "tass.com", "dataType":

Kennan in his essay \"The Sources of Soviet Behaviour\" published in the journal Foreign Affairs in 1947 and whose main ideas are summarized in the quote \"Soviet power is impervious to the logic of reason but very sensitive to the logic of force\".\n\nBy Germ\u00e1n Gorraiz L\u00f3pez, Political analyst\n\nThis would include the entry of Finland and Sweden into NATO military structures and the increase of military forces with 4 new battalions deployed on the European border with Russia and the Russian response to the installation of missiles in Belarus Iskander-M equipped with multi-purpose warheads as well as S-40 anti-aircraft missiles following the dynamics of the Cold War (action-reaction).\n\nFor their part, Russia would have installed in Kaliningrad the Iskander M missiles equipped with multi-purpose warheads as well as S-400 anti-aircraft missiles and, in the event of NATO closing the exit of the Soviet enclave of Kaliningrad to the Baltic Sea, could reissue the Kennedy-Khrushchev Missile Crisis (October 1962) which would have as its epicentre Kaliningrad.\n\nWith the US immersed in the electoral campaign for the November presidential elections, France, Poland and the United Kingdom would be the trident chosen by the globalists to implode the Ukrainian front next summer and provoke the subsequent entry of NATO into open conflict with Russia of a re-elected Putin until 2030.\n\nPoland seeks to become a local player in the Eastern European hornet's nest and extend its influence to the Ukrainian area by claiming its right to incorporate the Ukrainian region of Lviv on the Polish map, which was occupied by Poland from 1918 to 1939.\n\nThus, the Polish president, Andrzej Duda, affirmed that his country is \"willing to accept nuclear weapons\" from allied countries in its territory, which has received the harsh and forceful response of Moscow when warning that \"the deployment of such weapons in Poland will make Poland a priority objective in Russian military planning\".\n\nLikewise, in a statement from the Russian Foreign Ministry, Russia has warned that \"the arrival of F-16 fighters in Ukraine will see them as carriers of nuclear weapons, and we will consider that step by the US and NATO as a deliberate provocation\" while accusing the West of openly supporting Ukraine's sabotage actions on Russian territory and supplying Kyiv with British and French long-range missiles as well as the new US ATACMS, which can reach Russian territory.\n\nWithin the dynamics of action-reaction typical of the new scenario of Cold War 2.0, Putin has ordered the Armed Forces of his country to conduct shortly tactical nuclear weapons manoeuvres on the southern border with Ukraine.\n\nThis would be a Russian response to the claims of French President Emmanuel Macron and other senior British officials \"to be willing to send military contingents to Ukraine\". Thus, France had already deployed in Ukraine its first troops from the French Third Infantry Regiment, which is one of the main units of the French Foreign Legion (L\u00e9gion \u00e9trang\u00e8re).\n\nIf nobody prevents it, everything indicates that we are heading to the next entry of NATO in open conflict with Putin's Russia, not being disposable the use of \"non-strategic\" nuclear weapons, also known as \"tactical nuclear weapons\", according to the Nuclear Threat Initiative (NTI) and of which Russia would have about 1,800 warheads and NATO would have 250 warheads deployed in Europe.\n\nTactical warheads are those designed to be used on a limited battlefield, such as to destroy a tank column or carrier battle group if used at sea.

Ukrainian Air Force spokesperson Ilya Yevlash said that the planes would be ready for battle after Orthodox Easter, which was Sunday.\n\nThe F-16s -- provided by Western allies including Denmark, the Netherlands, Norway and Belgium -- will represent a much-needed update to Ukraine's aging fleet of largely Soviet-made aircraft that have been battered and depleted after more than two years of combat.\n\nWhile F-16s can accommodate certain nuclear weapons in the right configuration, Ukraine does not have a nuclear arsenal and there have been no indications that any allies who do possess nuclear weapons intend on sharing them with Kyiv.\n\nRegardless, Russia's Ministry of Foreign Affairs warned Ukraine in a statement on Monday that it \"cannot ignore\" the possibility that the planes could have the capability of delivering nuclear weapons.\n\nRussia also claimed that the arrival of the F-16s was a \"purposeful provocation\" by \"the United States and NATO,\" despite neither having supplied the aircraft to Ukraine.\n\n\"We cannot ignore the fact that these planes are dual-purpose platforms that can be used both for nuclear and non-nuclear tasks,\" the Russian Foreign Ministry statement reads.\n\n\"No matter what modification of the aircraft will be supplied [to Ukraine] we will treat them as nuclear-capable and we will consider this step of the United States and NATO as a purposeful provocation,\" it continues.\n\nThe ministry's statement goes on to warn that \"the regime in Kyiv and its Western sponsors should realize that their reckless steps are bringing the situation closer to the point where it will attain 'critical mass' and explode.\"\n\nNewsweek reached out for comment to the Ukrainian Ministry of Foreign Affairs via email on Monday evening.\n\nThe Russian government argues that French President Emmanuel Macron's suggestion of NATO troops intervening in the Russia-Ukraine war means that the West is \"deliberately trying to turn the Ukrainian crisis into an open military clash between NATO countries and Russia,\" according to Russian-state news agency Sputnik.\n\nNearly all other NATO allies, including the U.S., have rejected the idea of sending troops to Ukraine for potential combat. President Joe Biden said during his State of the Union address in March that there are \"no American soldiers at war in Ukraine, and I'm determined to keep it that way.\"\n\nMonday was not the first time that Russia has warned F-16s will be considered a nuclear threat once a Ukrainian fleet is operative. Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov repeatedly made similar remarks after it was announced that Kyiv would be receiving the jets last year.\n\n\"Any aircraft is actually nuclear weapons capable,\" U.S. Air Force Weapons School alumnus and former F-16 pilot Christopher Stewart said in comments last year to The Kyiv Post, where Stewart also serves as an editor. \"A blimp, dirigible, zeppelin or

Pat Ryder, spokesman for the US Department of Defense, stressed that despite the announcements, no changes in the deployment of Russian strategic forces had been detected, which the US would continue to monitor closely.\n\nThe announcement came at a time when Russia was also making military threats to the UK in response to statements made by French President Emmanuel Macron and UK Foreign Secretary David Cameron on the Ukraine crisis (Guardian).\n\nDiplomatic discord and nuclear diplomacy\n\nIn addition to the military exercises, there is also an escalation on a diplomatic level, as reported by Reuters. Recently, Russia rejected a US-drafted resolution in the UN Security Council aimed at preventing an arms race in space. This rejection led to sharp words between the US and Russian representatives at the United Nations, with the US accusing Moscow of possibly developing an anti-satellite nuclear weapon.\n\nEconomic sanctions and their global impact\n\nAmid these geopolitical tensions, the US government is continuing its strategy of economic sanctions against Russia, AP News reported. Recently, it imposed new sanctions on hundreds of companies and individuals linked to Russia's weapons development program, as well as Chinese companies that helped Russia evade previous sanctions. These measures are aimed at further undermining Russia's war effort and disrupting networks that support Russia's military capability.\n\nLooking to the future: Escalation or diplomacy?\n\nThe international community thus faces a critical crossroads: will the increase in nuclear threat posturing and military exercises lead to further escalation, or will it be possible to find a solution through diplomatic efforts?

The spectre of nuclear confrontation, long relegated to the annals of history, has once again reared its ugly head, reminding us all of the precariousness of our global situation. The pretext for these drills, according to Russia, lies in what they perceive as threats from Western powers, particularly France, Britain, and the United States. This comes amid the on-going conflict in Ukraine, where Russia's invasion has sparked international condemnation and a surge of support for the embattled nation from the West.\n\nHowever, the decision to incorporate nuclear scenarios into military exercises represents a dangerous escalation, one that risks plunging us into a new era of nuclear brinkmanship. While it is tempting to dismiss Russia's actions as mere sabre-rattling, we cannot afford to underestimate the gravity of the situation. The use of tactical nuclear weapons, even in a simulated scenario, sends a chilling message to the world: that the threshold for nuclear warfare may be lower than it imagined. In a world already grappling with existential threats such as climate change and pandemics, the addition of nuclear brinkmanship to the mix is nothing short of reckless.\n\nThe world community must respond with a unified voice against this escalation. Diplomatic channels must be kept open, and dialogue between all parties involved must be prioritised. Now more than ever, the need is for cool heads and steady hands at the helm, individuals committed to de-escalating tensions. Moreover, we must use this moment as an opportunity to reassess our collective approach to nuclear deterrence. The Cold War doctrine of mutually assured destruction may have kept the peace for decades, but in today's interconnected world, where rogue actors and non-state actors pose new threats, we need a more nuanced and multilateral approach to nuclear disarmament.\n\nUltimately, the events unfolding before us serve as a stark reminder of the fragility of the world order. We cannot afford to be complacent or naive about the risks we face. Now is the time for vigilance, for diplomacy, and for a renewed commitment to peace. The alternative is too grim to contemplate. As we navigate these turbulent waters, let us not lose sight of our common humanity.\n\nIt is incumbent upon all of us, as global citizens, to work towards a future where the threat of nuclear annihilation is but a distant memory. Leaders on both sides must exercise restraint and prioritise dialogue over brinkmanship. The stakes could not be higher, and the consequences of failure are too dire to contemplate. As citizens of this fragile planet, we must demand accountability from leaders and insist on a path towards de-escalation and peace.

Belarusian forces are set to rehearse efforts to plan and deliver tactical nuclear strikes as part of a snap readiness test that just got underway, Belarusian Defense Minister Viktor Khrenin said.\n\nAn order was received on Tuesday from Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko, who is the country's commander-in-chief to conduct \"a snap readiness test of forces and capabilities of delivery vehicles for non-strategic nuclear weapons,\" the ministry quoted Khrenin as saying in a statement.\n\nAn Iskander missile system battalion and a squadron of Su-25 airplanes are being brought to readiness to perform planned missions. Khrenin said the effort \"will test the whole range of activities ranging from planning to preparation to delivery of strikes with tactical nuclear munitions.\"\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin announced on March 25, 2023 that Moscow would deploy its tactical nuclear weapons in Belarus at Minsk's request, similar to how the US has long done on the territory of its allies. Moscow has given Minsk the nuclear-capable Iskander missile system and has assisted in retrofitting Belarusian aircraft to enable them to carry nuclear munitions. Belarusian missile crews and pilots have received appropriate training in Russia. In June 2023, Putin said the first Russian nuclear charges had been delivered to Belarus, and the remainder of the shipment would arrive by the end of 2023. In late April 2024, Lukashenko said that Russia had deployed several dozen nuclear munitions in Belarus.\n\nThe updated Belarusian military doctrine, which was adopted by the All-Belarusian People's Assembly in April, states that Minsk's ability to prevent military danger relies, among other things, on the support of its allies, primarily Russia.

Shoigu said at a May 3 meeting with top commanders.\n\n\"But under the weight of our onslaught, they've been forced to retreat and abandon their positions,\" he added.\n\nAlong with Ocheretyne, at least three other villages in Donetsk have recently fallen to advancing Russian forces.\n\nLast week, Russia's defense ministry announced the capture of the village of Berdychi, which sits roughly 10 miles northeast of Avdiivka.\n\nBerdychi is 45 miles south of Bakhmut, which Russian forces overran last summer after nine months of intense ground fighting.\n\nOleksandr Syrskyi, Kyiv's top military commander, has confirmed that Ukrainian troops deployed in Donetsk have since fallen back to positions west of the frontline.\n\n\"The situation at the front has worsened,\" he said on April 29, adding that the ongoing fighting was \"most difficult\" in areas northwest of Avdiivka.\n\nAccording to Gen. Syrskyi, Ukrainian troops have retreated to safer positions west of the string of Donetsk villages recently captured by Russian forces.\n\n\"The enemy has achieved certain tactical successes in these areas but has been unable to gain any operational advantages,\" he said.\n\nOn the afternoon of May 6, Russia's defense ministry claimed that the Donetsk village of Soloviove had also been taken \"as a result of successful operations.\"\n\n\"The General Staff has begun preparations for holding drills in the immediate future with missile formations of the Southern Military District,\" the defense ministry said in a May 6 statement.\n\nThe drills, which include aircraft and naval forces, are meant to enhance \"the preparedness of non-strategic nuclear forces with a view to achieve combat objectives,\" the statement read.\n\nThe exercises, it added, will seek to \"maintain the preparedness of troops and equipment for the combat employment of non-strategic nuclear weapons to ... ensure the territorial integrity and sovereignty of the Russian state.\"\n\nAccording to the ministry, the drills are a response to what it called \"provocative statements and threats by Western officials against the Russian Federation.\"\n\nThe ministry did not name the Western officials in question.\n\nBut French President Emmanuel Macron has raised the idea in recent weeks of sending European troops to Ukraine to fight Russia's ongoing invasion.\n\nLast week, the United Kingdom's Foreign Secretary David Cameron stated that Kyiv had the right to use Western-supplied missile systems to strike targets inside Russia.\n\nAsked about the planned drills, a Kremlin spokesman described the deployment of Western troops to Ukraine -- as proposed by Mr. Macron -- as an \"unprecedented move.\"\n\n\"And this requires a special response,\" he told reporters on May 6.\n\nMoscow often accuses Kyiv's Western allies of pushing the world to the brink of nuclear conflict by providing Kyiv with long-range offensive weaponry -- some of which has been used to strike targets in Russia.\n\nAndriy Yusov, a spokesman for Ukraine's military intelligence apparatus, appeared to play down the seriousness of Russia's planned nuclear exercises.\n\n\"We don't see anything new here,\" he told Reuters. \"Nuclear blackmail is a constant practice of [Russian President Vladimir] Putin's regime.\"", "source": {"uri": "theepochtimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "www.theepochtimes.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocheretyne", "type": "wiki",

anymore.\n\nPutin told his Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu to prepare military drills \"in order to increase the readiness of non-strategic nuclear forces to fulfil combat missions\", it has been reported.\n\nThis is believed to involve land, air and sea practice and preparations, say the defence ministry.\n\nThe drills are thought to be linked to the US, UK and France in particular after French President Emmanuel Macron declared he will send his troops to Ukraine if Putin breaks through the frontline.\n\nIf France was to send their troops into Ukraine's backyard then it could cause major issues.\n\nThe French would prove to be the first set of troops with Nato links to step up to Putin's war machine and go head-to-head with the Russian army.\n\nNato has consistently wanted to keep the idea of an escalation of a larger conflict minimal.\n\nThe reason why it could cause a potential major issue is as Article 5 in Nato's handbook states that all members are obliged to defend each other if there is an attack.\n\nRussia are thought to be well aware that if they attack and kill French troops then it could draw in UK, German and even US troops into the battle.\n\nUkraine have also been using Storm Shadow missiles provided to them by Nato allies in the war with Russia.\n\nA raging Putin has previously slammed some of Lord David Cameron's comments as \"dangerous and

Russian President Vladimir Putin has used nuclear saber-rattling as a method to constrain Western assistance to Ukraine over the last two years.\n\n\"Russia will do utmost to avoid a global confrontation, but it will not allow itself to be threatened,\" Putin said Thursday during an event marking the anniversary of the Allies' victory over Nazi Germany during the Second World War. \"Our strategic forces are always in combat readiness.\"\n\nThe efficacy of Russia's nuclear threats has eroded over the last two years as Western governments gradually have stepped up the quality and quantity of the military equipment they send to Ukraine. And some NATO allies are chafing at the idea of deferring to Putin's nuclear threats given the negative consequences for Ukraine and the trans-Atlantic alliance if the war ends with a Russian victory.\n\nIf we just thought about the Russian response, then we could not send anything,\" Lithuanian Prime Minister Ingrida Simonyte told the Financial Times this week. \"Every second week, you hear that somebody will be nuked.\"\n\nFeatured Local Savings\n\nSimonyte and some other NATO members have begun to speak of upgrading their support for Ukraine in part due to a growing anxiety that the protracted lapse in U.S. aid to Ukraine has raised the specter of a crisis on the battlefield.\n\n\"If the Russians were to break through the front lines, if there were a Ukrainian request, which is not the case today, we would legitimately have to ask ourselves this question,\" French President Emmanuel Macron told the Economist in a recent interview. \"It would be wrong in terms of credibility and deterrence vis-a-vis the Russians to rule it out.

Those military exercises involve the weapons that Western officials perceive as most likely to be used if the Kremlin decides to use nuclear weapons in an offensive military campaign.\n\n\"We warn our opponents that their course towards escalation will, of course, prompt the need for us to take steps that actually mean enhancing deterrence measures,\" Ryabkov said. \"The drills of practicing the skills of employing nonstrategic nuclear weapons are an element of these efforts.\"\n\nSign Up for Springs AM Update Your morning rundown of the latest news from Colorado Springs and around the country\n\nSign Up View all of our newsletters.

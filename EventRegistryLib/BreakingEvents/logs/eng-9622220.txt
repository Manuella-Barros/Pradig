The votes will be counted and the results will be declared on Tuesday.

With the results expected to be declared by the end of the day, it brings to an end a marathon polling exercise that stretched for over 80 days with around 64.2 crore votes polled. Most pollsters have predicted a third term for Prime Minister Narendra Modi, placing BJP-led NDA comfortably beyond the halfway mark of 272 in the Lower House comprising of 543 members. If Modi wins, he would equal Jawaharlal Nehru's record of being the second PM to be elected three times in a row, fortifying the saffron party s authority in Indian politics.The INDIA opposition bloc hopes for a turnaround, even as its leaders have raised questions this time over the polling process, including the Election Commission (EC). The INDIA has expressed doubts over the electronic voting machines (EVMs), has accused the prime minister of sending a signal to the bureaucracy through fantasy exit polls and have marched to the EC, urging the poll watchdog to follow the counting guidelines.As for the state election results today, in Odisha BJP and Naveen Patnaik led BJP are locked in a battle, while in Andhra Pradesh, the BJP-TDP-Jana Sena alliance is fighting against the ruling YSRCP. Stay on this page as ETV Bharat brings you all the latest updates from the polling day today.\n\nThe marathon exercise of the counting of votes will being with Postal ballots across all centres, according to the Conduct of Election Rules. Chief Election Commissioner Rajiv Kumar, in a presser a day ahead of the counting, said after half-an-hour of the start of the postal ballot count, the counting of votes recorded in the electronic voting machines will commence.\n\n\"Rules clearly state (Rule 54A) that postal ballot count will start first. On all centres in the country it will start first, no doubt about it. After half-an-hour we start the EVM count. So, there are three countings which are happening simultaneously -- it happened in the 2019 elections, it happened in all the assembly polls held thereafter. It happened yesterday also in case of Arunachal Pradesh and Sikkim assembly (vote count). We can't change anything mid course.

As stipulated by the Conduct of Election Rules, the process began with the counting of postal ballots, followed by votes recorded in electronic voting machines (EVMs) after a half-hour interval. Chief Election Commissioner Rajiv Kumar reaffirmed the procedural adherence during a press conference on Monday, emphasising the clarity of the rules. \"Rules clearly state (Rule 54A) that postal ballot count will start first. On all centres in the country, it will start first, no doubt about it,\" Kumar stated.\n\nThe Election Commission's statement followed a meeting with opposition party representatives on Sunday, who had insisted that the counting of postal ballots should precede and their results be announced first.\n\nKumar elaborated on the procedural consistency, \"So, there are three countings which are happening simultaneously -- it happened in the 2019 elections, it happened in all the assembly polls held thereafter. It happened yesterday also in the case of Arunachal Pradesh and Sikkim assembly vote counts. We can't change anything mid-course. Why can't we change? Because it is compliant with the rules.\"\n\nThe steps of the counting process involve the counting of VVPAT (Voter Verified Paper Audit Trail) slips from five randomly selected polling stations per assembly constituency would follow the EVM count for enhanced transparency. \" In majority of the booths, the number of postal ballot is less. It will automatically end first,\" CEC Kumar said.\n\n\"Since 2019, VVPAT slips from five randomly selected polling stations per assembly constituency (or segment in cases of Lok Sabha seats) are matched with the EVM count for greater transparency,\" he noted.\n\nALSO READ | Lok Sabha Elections 2029 To Conclude Before Summer?

{"id": 231292858, "title": "Doctor warns about one way parents should never pick up their children", "text": "An emergency room doctor has the warned of the one way parents should avoid lifting their children. Dr J Mack Slaughter is known for his TikTok videos where he shares what he\u2019s witnessed as an ER doctor. One of his recent videos explained the possible consequences of lifting a child up by the wrist. \u201cWhat\u2019s one way you should never pick up a child?\u201d his video started as he asked his viewers. The conversation quickly turned into an explanation of an injury known as nursemaid\u2019s elbow. The term nursemaid\u2019s elbow dates back to when nursemaids took care of children and were blamed for causing the injury by tugging on children\u2019s arms, according to the Boston Children\u2019s Hospital. The injury is also called a pulled elbow or radial head subluxation. The injury will occur when the radius part of the elbow joint slips out of place, leaving the elbow partially dislocated. Nursemaid\u2019s elbow is only temporary and can be fixed through a reduction of the elbow to have the radius returned to its proper position. It is most common in toddlers between the ages of two and six and rare in children above that age due to how mature their ligaments are, according to the hospital. According to Slaughter, one way the injury can occur is when parents \u201cgrab their kids by the wrist and just start swinging.\u201d He said children normally love this interaction \u201cuntil the head of the radial bone gets dislocated.\u201d The ER doctor even admitted that he\u2019s accidentally given his own child a nurse\u2019s elbow before. \u201cDon\u2019t tell my wife, but I accidentally did this to our child one day,\u201d he told his viewers. \u201cMy daughter was two at the time and started falling down the stairs. I pulled her up by the wrist, saving her from falling down the stairs but dislocating her elbow. The good news is that I popped it right back into place.\u201d \u201cNursemaid\u2019s elbow (aka radial head subluxation) affects over 20,000 children per year in the US with over 80 percent of those patients being between the ages of one and three,\u201d Slaughter further explained in his video\u2019s caption. His TikTok went on to receive over 20,000 views, with many people taking to the comments to reveal they\u2019ve accidentally given their own children nursemaid\u2019s elbow, and how easy it is to cause the injury with simple actions like picking up their child\u2019s hand. \u201cMy friend did this accidentally with my two year old. He felt so bad! Incredible ER staff though!\u201d one comment read. \u201cThis happened once when I was holding my toddler\u2019s hand and they suddenly fell. Super scary but easy to fix once the ER staff told us how to!\u201d another story read. \u201cMy son had nursemaid\u2019s elbow,\u201d a third commenter wrote. \u201cIt would pop out just reaching to take his hand sometimes. After a ton of ER visits, I learned to pop it back in myself.\u201d \u201cI did this to my daughter accidentally. I was terrified that they were gonna take me to jail when we went to the ER. Turns out they see it frequently,\u201d a fourth story read.", "summary": "<p>Grabbing a toddler by the wrist can result in injury called nursemaid\u2019s elbow </p>", "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/doctor-warning-parents-children-wrist-warning-b2559198.html", "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/2024/06/07/18/MixCollage-07-Jun-2024-01-48-PM-3523.jpg?width=1200", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-08 14:54:47", "author": "Brittany Miller", "authors": ["Brittany Miller"], "language": "en", "source_country": "gb", "sentiment": -0.441}

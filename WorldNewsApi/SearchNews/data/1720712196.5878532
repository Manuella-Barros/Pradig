It\u2019s devastating to have lost Michael, my wonderful, funny, kind and brilliant husband. We had an incredibly lucky life together. \"We loved each other very much and were so happy together. I am incredibly proud of our children, their resilience and support over the past days. \"My family and I have been hugely comforted by the outpouring of love from people from around the world. It\u2019s clear that Michael meant a huge amount to so many of you. \"We\u2019re taking comfort in the fact that he so very nearly made it. He did an incredible climb, took the wrong route and collapsed where he couldn\u2019t be easily seen by the extensive search team. \"Michael was an adventurous man, it\u2019s part of what made him so special. \"We are so grateful to the extraordinary people on Symi who have worked tirelessly to help find him. Some of these people on the island, who hadn\u2019t even heard of Michael, worked from dawn till dusk unasked. We\u2019re also very grateful to the press who have dealt with us with great respect. \"I feel so lucky to have our children and my amazing friends. Most of all, I feel so lucky to have had this life with Michael. \"Thank you all.\"", "summary": "The married pair were together for 44 years", "url": "https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/news/uk-news/michael-mosleys-wife-clare-bailey-29321640", "image": "https://i2-prod.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/incoming/article29321673.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_MOSLEY.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-09 12:50:40", "author": "Joseph Timan", "authors": ["Joseph Timan"], "language": "en", "source_country": "gb", "sentiment": 0.335}

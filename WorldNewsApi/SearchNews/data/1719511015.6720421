Dubbed a \u201ckey member\u201d of Walt Disney\u2019s creative inner circle, Sherman was born on June 12, 1928. He and his older brother Robert (who passed in 2012) were part of a double act called the Sherman Brothers that started writing songs together after being challenged by their father Al, himself a popular songwriter. Robert founded the Music World Corporation in 1958, which would come to work with Disney\u2019s broadcast music company Wonderland. The success of the brothers\u2019 single \u201cTall Paul\u201d (as sung by Mouseketeer Annette Funicello) drew Walt Disney\u2019s attention, and he hired them on as songwriters for Walt Disney Studios. It was there the pair created and released \u201cIt\u2019s a Small World After All\u201d for the 1964 New York World\u2019s Fair, and it\u2019d be played throughout in Disney theme parks, eventually becoming one of, if not the most, popular songs for the company. Over the decades, Richard and Robert made songs that would go on to shape and define Disney.\u201cSupercalifragliciousexpialidocious\u201d in Mary Poppins and \u201cI Wan\u2019na Be Like You\u201d in The Jungle Book remain some of their best-known songs to this day behind \u201cSmall World,\u201d and the duo had other films like The Sword in the Stone, The Aristocats, and The Parent Trap (both the 1961 and 1998 versions) under their belt. And that\u2019s just from Disney: after going freelance following Walt\u2019s death in 1966, the brothers also made music for Charlotte\u2019s Web and Snoopy: Come Home. Between them, the Sherman brothers are said to have written 1,000 songs and pieces of music across 50 movies. They\u2019re also considered to be the writers of the most movie musical songs in all of film history. Both men would rack up plenty of awards and nominations, and Richard specifically won three Grammys and saw 24 of his albums go gold or platinum. \u201cRichard Sherman was the embodiment of what it means to be a Disney Legend,\u201d wrote Disney CEO Bob Iger, \u201ccreating along with his brother Robert the beloved classics that have become a cherished part of the soundtrack of our lives. [...] The music of the Sherman Brothers has captured the hearts of generations of audiences. We are forever grateful for the mark Richard left on the world, and we extend our deepest condolences to his family.\u201d Added film historian Leonard Maltin, the Sherman brothers were \u201cprofessional optimists who found a perfect patron in Walt Disney. Their songs had an upbeat outlook that spilled over into Richard\u2019s life, which was not without its troubles and challenges. He was especially proud that he and his brother carried on a songwriting career like their father, who encouraged them early on.\u201d Sherman is survived by his Elizabeth, his children Gregory, Victoria, Lynda, and his grandchildren and great-grandchildren. A private service is scheduled for Friday, May 31, and plans for a larger celebration of his life will be revealed at a later date. [via THR] Want more io9 news?

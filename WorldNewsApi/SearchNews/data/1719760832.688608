{"id": 225023876, "title": "A Growing Gap: As Recognition Spend Increases, The Unrecognized Nearly Double", "text": "The State of Recognition is an annual survey AWI conducts to examine trends, best practices, and priorities in employee recognition programs. This year, AWI surveyed 3,600 employees and 1,390 HR leaders. The study indicates that one main driver for shadow contributors is cultural. One-quarter of respondents say people at their company simply do not recognize each other. Many organizations are highly focused on retaining top performers, focusing resources and recognition on the 20% or so who consistently outperform. However, there is considerable opportunity in increasing recognition across the board, likely improving outcomes for both average and low performers. In contrast to the year-over-year increase in shadow contributors, 63% of HR leaders surveyed are planning to increase their recognition program budgets, despite a majority (60%) saying they don\u2019t see business results from their program. This disconnect indicates that many HR leaders are treating recognition in a silo, rather than aligning it with company objectives. If companies have a recognition program just to check the box and aren\u2019t connecting to business results, then no wonder many non-HR leaders see the function as a cost center, not a business driver. \u201cWhile it\u2019s great to see recognition platforms grow in popularity, it\u2019s truly troubling that shadow contributors have doubled,\u201d said Caitlin Nobes, head of Workforce Research and Content at AWI. \u201cRecognition is not just about celebrating a few star players. It\u2019s even more critical that unseen talent receives kudos for their work. What gets recognized gets repeated, and organizations must start treating their recognition programs for what they are \u2013 powerful positive reinforcement strategies. These tools nudge key behaviors to ensure even the most under-recognized workforces can shift their mindset and embrace praise at every level. Nudging the right behaviors for each organization is the difference between a nice-to-have program and truly strategic recognition.\u201d Adopt a science-backed recognition formula AWI finds that the most successful recognition programs share several key traits. Data consistently validates monthly recognition as the top results driver, and organizations that meet this threshold for every employee double their productivity and employee engagement and more than double employee rates of high belonging.", "summary": "Achievers survey of 3,600 employees and 1,390 HR leaders shows that 63% of HR leaders are increasing recognition spending, yet \u2018shadow contributors\u2019 are on the rise TORONTO &#8212; The number of &#8220;shadow contributors,&#8221; or employees that are never recognized, has doubled in the last two years, according to the 2024 State of Recognition report from [&#8230;]", "url": "https://financialpost.com/pmn/business-wire-news-releases-pmn/a-growing-gap-as-recognition-spend-increases-the-unrecognized-nearly-double", "image": "https://smartcdn.gprod.postmedia.digital/financialpost/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/commuters-on-bay-street-as-canadian-stocks-mixed.jpg?quality=5&strip=all&w=100&sig=gCsOruxPhrA8bPqdSVYb6g", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-05-29 13:09:09", "author": "Business Wire", "authors": ["Business Wire"], "language": "en", "source_country": "CA", "sentiment": 0.027}

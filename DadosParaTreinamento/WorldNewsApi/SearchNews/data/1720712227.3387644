ALSO READ: \u2018Journalistic dystopian nightmare\u2019: Inside a Tennessee college media meltdown It turns out, however, according to a Raw Story analysis, that the news footage used to show a \u201cdangerous open border,\u201d as the video called it, was actually from November 2018 \u2014 during the middle of Republican Donald Trump\u2019s presidency. That\u2019s not the only misleading part of the two-minute, 37-second video, which uses a montage of images to evoke fear and blame, all in the name of Paxton, who survived 16 articles of impeachment last year. The Dallas Morning News said the Paxton video resembled \"a trailer for an action-hero movie.\" But the stock images used in the video \u2014 including a sad boy staring forlornly out a window \u2014 did not depict Texans, or even Americans. Instead, they came from companies or artists representing a veritable United Nations of foreign countries. The sad boy and the dejected face of a young girl? Switzerland. Stacks of $100 bills? Spain. A person representing the \u201cliberal establishment\u201d who\u2019s putting $100 bills into an envelope? Ukraine. The silhouette of a man walking onto a stage? Russia. Paxton\u2019s office did not immediately respond to Raw Story\u2019s request for comment. In the video, Paxton, who in March struck a deal that ended a federal criminal securities fraud case against him, is called \u201cAmerica\u2019s most conservative attorney general\u201d and \u201csomebody who has been brave and strong.\u201d Paxton spent part of April in New York attending the trial of former president Donald Trump, who was found guilty of 34 felony fraud counts. The video charges that the \u201cliberal establishment\u201d wanted to eliminate Paxton because it \u201cresents who they cannot control. They hatched a secret and shameful plan to overturn an election and take out our conservative champion.\u201d Actually, 70 percent of his fellow Republicans in the Republican-controlled state House voted to impeach Paxton on charges of bribery and corruption in trying to help a wealthy political donor. The impeachment trial, which ended with the Republican-controlled Texas Senate acquitting Paxton, included testimony from a staff member that Paxton\u2019s extramarital affair could make him vulnerable to bribery. Among the people who listened to the testimony and adjudicated the case: Paxton\u2019s wife, state Sen. Angela Paxton. They are still married. They were shown in a photo at the GOP Convention holding hands and waving to the crowd. When it was his turn to speak, Paxton claimed migration was part of a plan to \"steal another election.\" He said, falsely, \u201cThe Biden Administration wants the illegals here to vote.\u201d", "summary": "<img src=\"https://www.alternet.org/media-library/image.jpg?id=52433065&width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C1\"/><br/><br/><p>At the start of a video blaming Democrats for a laundry list of problems, a narrator says in an ominous baritone, \u201cDo they know what they have done?\u201d</p><p>Moments later, a free-for-all of migrants are shown charging at the U.S. border from Tijuana, Mexico \u2014 part of a tribute to \u201ctireless conservative warrior\u201d Ken Paxton, the embattled attorney general of Texas.

This call is being webcast and can be accessed at Oil States' website. A replay of the conference call will be available 2 hours after the completion of this call and will continue to be available for 12 months. I'll now turn the call over to Cindy.\n\nCindy Taylor: Thank you, Ellen. Good morning, and thank you for joining our conference call today, where we will discuss our second quarter 2024 results and provide our thoughts on market trends in addition to discussing our company specific outlook comments. Our second quarter consolidated revenues and adjusted EBITDA increased 11% and 38% sequentially, driven by increased drilling, subsea and production system demand in key offshore basins, along with the advancement of several significant projects in our Offshore/Manufactured Products segment. On a consolidated basis, our offshore and international revenues were up 18% sequentially, while U.S. land driven revenues increased 1%. Our results in the current quarter also benefited from continued customer adoption of our newer technologies and strategic optimization of our Well Site Services segment with the exit of certain underperforming U.S. locations. Given these initiatives, our Well Site Services adjusted segment EBITDA increased 30% sequentially in an otherwise declining U.S. land market. During the quarter, our Offshore/Manufactured Products segment revenues increased 17% sequentially totaling $102 million, while adjusted segment EBITDA rose 27%. Bookings totaled $101 million compared to $66 million received in the first quarter of 2024, yielding backlog of $300 million as of June 30 and a quarterly book-to-bill ratio of 1 times. Our bookings improvement was partially driven by our newer technology offerings, including orders for our managed pressure drilling systems. Our Well Site Services segment revenues decreased 2% on a sequential quarter basis, given the impact of lower U.S. activity, along with the segment's consolidation and exit over the past six months of four underperforming locations. Adjusted segment EBITDA increased 30% from the first quarter of 2024 due to stronger offshore activity in the Gulf of Mexico, along with modest market share gains in the Permian Basin. Our cost reduction initiatives helped yield very strong incremental margins. In our Downhole Technologies segment, revenues and adjusted segment EBITDA increased 16% and 42%, respectively, from the first quarter of 2024, driven primarily by increased completion product and international purporting sales. We will continue to focus on improving operations and allocating capital to efficiently and safely provide our customers with advanced technologies and services, while enhancing returns, reducing debt and returning cash to our stockholders. During the quarter, we generated cash flows from operations totaling $10 million, repurchased some of our convertible debt at a discount to par and also made share repurchases. Our gross debt to EBITDA at June 30 was 1.5 times and net was 1.2 times, giving us significant flexibility. Lloyd will now review our operational results along with our financial position in more detail.\n\nLloyd Hajdik: Thanks, Cindy. Good morning, everyone. During the second quarter, Oil States generated revenues of $186 million, adjusted consolidated EBITDA of $21 million and net income of $1.3 million or $0.02 per share. Our reported second quarter results included pretax facility consolidation exit charges of $3.5 million, patent defense charges of $1 million and gains of $0.5 million on debt extinguishment. Excluding these net charges and credits, our adjusted net income was $4.4 million or $0.07 per share. Our Offshore/Manufactured Products segment generated revenues of $102 million and adjusted segment EBITDA of $20 million in the second quarter. During the second quarter, charges of $1.5 million were recorded at the segment due to the consolidation of Oil States' Southeast Asian operations. Excluding the facility consolidation charges, adjusted segment EBITDA margin was 20% in the second quarter compared to 18% in the first quarter. Regarding our facility planning, we have strategically relocated our Southeast Asian manufacturing and service operations from Singapore to Batam, Indonesia, which is expected to produce future manufacturing costs for a number of our global product offerings. During the second quarter, we sold our facility in Singapore and received net cash proceeds of $10 million. While construction of our long-term Batam facility continues, with completion targeted for the first half of 2025, provisional operations were established in Batam during the quarter allowing us to efficiently execute both our contracted backlog and subsequent orders during the construction phase. We own one remaining U.S. facility that was classified as a held for sale asset at June 30. Net proceeds from the sale of this facility, which is expected to close in late 2024, are expected to total approximately $25 million. In our Well Site Services segment, we generated revenues of $46 million and adjusted segment EBITDA of $9 million in the second quarter. During the quarter, the segment recognized $2 million in costs associated with the consolidation and exit of underperforming locations. Additionally, the segment recorded charges of $1 million associated with the enforcement of patents related to its proprietary technologies. Excluding these charges, adjusted segment EBITDA margin was 18% in the second quarter compared to 14% in the first quarter. In our Downhole Technologies segment, we reported revenues of $38 million and adjusted segment EBITDA of $3 million for the second quarter. Adjusted segment EBITDA margin was 8% in the second quarter compared to 7% in the first quarter. And during the second quarter, Oil States generated $10 million in cash flows from operations and received $10 million in proceeds from the facility sale. Cash was used to fund capital expenditures of $6 million, purchased $11.5 million principal amount of our 4.75% convertible senior notes at a discount and buy back $2.4 million of our common stock. Now Cindy will offer some market outlook and concluding comments.\n\nCindy Taylor: Despite some concerns about oil demand in China and the possibility of OPEC+ ceasing voluntary production cuts in 2025, crude oil pricing has remained relatively stable over the first half of the year, generally in the $75 to $85 per barrel price range, which has provided our E&P customers a predictable environment for planning and sanctioning major offshore and international projects. Stable oil prices and a strong long-term outlook for natural gas and LNG demand supports significant levels of capital investment in offshore field development led by the U.S., Latin America, Asia and Africa. Major subsea OEMs continue to experience significant backlog growth as a result of orders for subsea production systems. We expect this trend to positively influence our business and future bookings. Growth trends continue to look favorable, given the level of offshore capital investment, our bidding and quoting activity, new product introductions, along with strong levels of bookings and backlog. Second quarter U.S. land activity levels have declined despite favorable WTI crude oil prices. Even with lower activity levels and weak natural gas prices, production and inventory levels have remained high, leading to a more challenging land market. Given current industry dynamics, we expect U.S. land drilling and completion spending over the balance of 2024 to remain at or near current level. We expect our Well Site Services and Downhole Technologies segments to perform in line with market activity indicators, which are weighted to U.S. land activity. The consolidation and exit of underperforming locations and the implementation of additional cost control measures should provide tangible margin benefits in subsequent quarters as assets are redeployed to more favorable operating locations. We are benefiting from the continued adoption and deployment of our new technologies, including our proprietary active seat valves within our Well Site Services segment. Within our Downhole Technologies segment, we expect to see further market penetration with the recent introduction of our new EPIC portfolio of perforating systems. Considering market dynamics, we are able to confirm our adjusted EBITDA guidance of $85 million to $90 million for 2024. In terms of free cash flow generation, we expect to generate approximately $40 million in free cash flow during 2024, which excludes the planned fourth quarter U.S. facility sale and remains in line with prior guidance, implying a free cash flow yield of 10% or greater. We will continue to maintain disciplined capital allocation priorities by judiciously investing in growth CapEx and organic research and development opportunities to drive additional technology differentiation. We will continue to evaluate debt reduction opportunities, share repurchases and targeted acquisitions. Now I would like to offer some concluding comments. We remain focused on optimizing our operations and pursuing profitable activity in support of our global customer base. As market opportunities unfold, both in the U.S. and in international and offshore markets, we will continue to focus on core areas of expertise with the deployment of our recently enhanced equipment and technologies to further differentiate our product and service offerings. Our core competencies are well entrenched in the markets we serve, and we continue to bid on potential opportunities supporting our traditional subsea, floating and fixed production systems, drilling and military customers while also bidding to support multiple new customers and projects involved in developments such as deep sea minerals gathering, fixed and floating offshore wind, carbon capture and storage, geothermal applications and other renewable and clean tech energy opportunities. These new energy transition opportunities create strong potential for us to expand our product and service offerings and our revenue base over the longer term. Oil States will continue to conduct safe operations and will remain focused on providing technology leadership in our various product and service offerings with value added products and services available to meet customer demands globally. That completes our prepared comments. Eric, would you open up the call for questions and answers at this time?\n\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from the line of Jim Rollyson with Raymond James. Please go ahead.\n\nJim Rollyson: Cindy, it was obviously great to see a nice sequential rebound in the offshore manufactured products business, which kind of falls in line typically, I guess, with your seasonal factors. But curious with kind of the orders and backlog and as you see that over the back half of the year, how are you thinking about kind of revenue and margin trajectory based on kind of the timing of what's in backlog today, kind of a similar trend to last year or something different?\n\nCindy Taylor: Clearly, if you kind of look at the guidance, to some degree, the revenue and trajectory, I'll call it, over the next couple of quarters looks, I'm going to call it strong, but fairly level given that our bookings to date are at 0.9 times. And so a lot of the momentum we're seeing, I would say, carries into 2025. We -- again, I don't know if we made comments about our bookings outlook, but we still expect our overall book-to-bill to be north of 1, which implies greater than a one-time book-to-bill for the second half of this year. And again, I think that sets up very well for 2025. I haven't looked at my individual quarters in terms of revenue generation. But again, embedded in our guidance, a lot of the activity is going to be driven by offshore and international. No surprise there based on the overall macro environment that we're looking at, and that implies strong results for this particular segment.\n\nJim Rollyson: Perfect. Yeah. Just looking for confirmation there. So I appreciate that. And on the Well Site Services and Downhole Technologies, you mentioned similar in the past, your revenues kind of performed in line with activity. But clearly, some of the kind of internal things you're doing on the cost side and managing operations that weren't performing have obviously paid through in margin benefits this quarter. And you mentioned just that growing as you continue to work on those things. Any sense of kind of how you're thinking about magnitude of potential margin expansion in the kind of flattish from here outlook?\n\nLloyd Hajdik: Yeah. So Jim, I'll take that. So when we're looking at Well Site Services with us closing some of these underperforming locations, we could see that the margins overall getting into the low 20% range, EBITDA margins.\n\nJim Rollyson: Okay. Yes. No. That's very healthy. And what are you thinking about for Downhole Technologies because that obviously had an improved quarter as well from a few different things.\n\nJim Rollyson: Yeah. Perfect. Well, I appreciate that. I'll turn it back to someone else for the next question.\n\nCindy Taylor: Thanks, Jim.\n\nOperator: The next question comes from the line of Stephen Gengaro with Stifel. Please go ahead.\n\nStephen Gengaro: Thanks. Good morning, everybody. So just quickly to clarify, were you guiding -- were you suggesting Well Site margins in the low-20s in the second half of the year. Is that -- was that your -- I was trying to just make sure I understood that correctly.\n\nStephen Gengaro: Okay. Great. Thank you. I guess two things for me. First, Cindy, you've been watching this market a long time like I have, and we've been kind of consistently frustrated by the lack of U.S. activity growth on the land side. And I know there's M&A reasons and the gas market has been soft. But what are you -- do you see anything else there? And maybe how do you think about maybe the catalyst or what needs to happen to get kind of a recovery on the U.S. land side even if it's several quarters out?\n\nCindy Taylor: Yeah. Well, first and foremost, embedded in my comments is just the statement. If you look back for the last 15 months, maybe 18 months. Activity on land is down kind of 20% plus. It's kind of shocking quite frankly. And yet despite that, we're producing record levels. And the way I look at that, I don't do basin by basin analysis. But certainly, there are a lot of analysts that do that say productivity per foot is flat to down in most of the basins. And so it is my opinion that a lot of this M&A activity is for geared towards the resource play and being able to move from 2-mile laterals to 3. And when you do that, the real answer is, you're just drilling and completing a lot of available footage, and we're benefiting from that. And so this Efficiency Measure gets a little more elusive when you're talking about productivity per foot versus just extended laterals, it's all good for the operator. But again, I think we and everybody else believe that production is going to turn at some point. And the question that -- agile question is when does that happen? But clearly, in my opinion, 2025 kind of spells a different level of overall production as some of these decline curves hit, that's number one. Number two is just natural gas. They're in anyone that really debates the long-term contribution and benefit from both natural gas and LNG. It will come, and if you get kind of the double trigger, if you will, between natural gas activity and an improved crude oil activity environment, those are clearly the drivers for a service company like us as it relates to U.S. land. It's just very hard for me to see how that does not happen in 2025. But all I hear from everybody right now is kind of a muted 2025 U.S. land outlook, and that's because of 2 things right now, this perception of reduced demand in China, which I mentioned in my notes, coupled with the fact that OPEC+ has voluntary production cut in place that they're telling the market they may reverse late this year, early 2025. So it's always about the macro in this world. And maybe I'm just an optimist because you need to be an optimist in this space, but I see a better 2025 shaping up than maybe the analysts have in their models and what they're thinking. In fact, we had one kind of cut our outlook for 2025, and I just don't see it right now.\n\nStephen Gengaro: Got you. Great. Thanks for the color. And then maybe as a follow-up to that, when you think about rig efficiency and completion efficiency and longer laterals, where does that benefit you guys the most? Which product lines -- yeah, that might be helpful. Just some color on that.\n\nCindy Taylor: It's really across - it's across both our Well Site Services and our Downhole Technologies segments, predominantly because the -- you're really talking again about a U.S. land-driven activity at this point in time. And with our active seat valves, number one, they are more efficient to the operating. They work very well in extended laterals multi-pad type work and its cost effective for us to bring those to market just from the efficiency at the Well Site. And then our new suite of Downhole Technologies, again, the EPIC product line, we have hoped to gain market share even in a flatter market, much less an improving market. That, coupled with international penetration, we believe, helps us turn that segment around.\n\nStephen Gengaro: Great. No, that's very helpful. And then just maybe one final one for me. I think you mentioned maybe a book-to-bill of over 1 in offshore manufactured products in the back half of the year. Is there -- when we think about the trajectory of growth for that business, should we just really be thinking about offshore deepwater rig activity and then any rigs that get added and how that kind of ultimately morphs into demand for your products? Is it the best proxy we can use for what that growth could look like in '25 and '26?\n\nCindy Taylor: Yeah. It's kind of near term, long term, and let me explain that a little bit. Rigs go to work in development drilling profiles prove up work that leads into longer-term production infrastructure. Again, you know all of that. It used to be we were not heavily exposed, and we're still weighted to offshore production facility development. My however is with the recent introduction of our new Managed Pressure Drilling Technologies, as rigs do go to work, we are seeing incremental demand for particularly MPD equipment. But even deck equipment and other types of riser products that we have. So we'll see some - that's what I call, nearer term because everybody knows rigs are going to work. They're being upgraded. They're getting longer-term contracts. But the great news is the follow-on from that will be increased subsea and production infrastructure development. And again, you've seen other larger companies in the space with some very good bookings that kind of are a precursor to the demand for some of our products and services.\n\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from the line of John Daniel with Daniel Energy Partners. Please go ahead.\n\nJohn Daniel: Just two for me. You noted in the prepared remarks that you anticipate activity in the, I guess, lower 48 to be at or near current levels. I'm just curious if that's where we stay for the balance of the year and maybe even into Q1. How do you see that changing the competitive landscape and your -- in the areas you serve and how many people don't make it, if you will. Just your thoughts on that.\n\nCindy Taylor: I'm sorry, you're asking kind of the competitive landscape on U.S. land activity?\n\nJohn Daniel: If we stay in this sort of flattish range right now, do you see it changing the competitive landscape at all over the next six months to nine months?\n\nCindy Taylor: Yeah. I'm going to respond to that, and I'll see if Lloyd has any add-on comments. So we get anecdotal comments and evidence of smaller players kind of shutting down local operations, various facilities, trimming headcount, tamping down for the summer. I almost think of those as one-offs that do modestly improve the competitive landscape. But I'll offer you a bigger picture comment that what I've probably not seen as many M&A opportunities in a very long time. And so I think when everybody recognizes how competitive the energy services market is, they're looking for opportunities to either exit or just kind of optimize their operations through M&A. And we see quite a lot. And certainly, on a basin specific level, we're seeing that. But I'd say even importantly, larger service companies are, I'll call it, drinking our customers' cooled in the sense that they're seeing the market consolidation. They're seeing the need for size and scale from an operating perspective, not to mention from a shareholder perspective. And so we have all kinds of inbounds right now from both private and public entities. And so while, yes, I think some of the smaller players fall out just by closing locations, facilities, trimming headcount, I think the bigger picture is going to be the consolidation which it seems like is heating up.\n\nJohn Daniel: Okay. Thank you for that. The next one is on the new products and technologies that you guys are introducing. Can you just address customer willingness to try new products at this stage and sort of how you see the expected adoption rates playing out over the next year or two -- one to two years?\n\nCindy Taylor: Yeah. And again, my comments may not surprise you. There's much greater willingness to trial a one-off technology introduction on U.S. land. And just think about it, the wells are smaller, the AFE costs are smaller. Generally, they're going with proven operators in the first place. And secondarily, those types of customers are really coming to us and others telling us the enhancements that they need. And so to some degree, these are being developed in conjunction with operator involvement and communication. And so their willingness to trial them is better. Now that being said, I'll use my example of Downhole Technologies, there's a lot of offerings in the market right now. And when activity is down to the degree it has been over the last 15 months to 18 months, it is harder to get a partner to trial, new technology. And so it's maybe the uptake is a little bit slower. I'll put that in complete contrast to deepwater offshore. And our company has been participating in that space for 80 years, and the barriers to entry are just significant. And it always would stun me if a, I'll call it, a one-off newer company tried to get a product introduced. I think it'd be very, very difficult as opposed to someone that has a deep, long demonstrated operating history in this space. And I'll use a couple of examples. Number one is our high-pressure riser systems. We've been putting riser systems in the market for decades. So you're more willing to be able to adapt and advance that technology and get market acceptance. Probably the newer technology I'll talk about is the MPD systems that we've got great acceptance thus far of our products and great interest thus far, but we brought a newer, more advanced, more efficient offering to the market that was already there, again, in conjunction with conversations around customer needs to get there. And I want to say, and by the way, we've been working on this off and on for probably seven years. And so complete difference in terms of market introductions, and we're going to be cautious about bringing any new technology to bear just because the risk of reputation and the risk of failure is great offshore, right? But -- and then I'll take this a step further, as we prove up technologies on U.S. land, then we're going to take those into international markets more efficiently.\n\nOperator: I will now turn the call back over to Cindy Taylor, President and CEO for closing remarks. Please go ahead.\n\nCindy Taylor: You bet. Thank you, Eric, and thanks to all of you for joining our call today. I know it's a very busy portion of the earnings season. We're very glad to report stronger improved results, both this quarter and our outlook, I think, will guide to better days ahead as well. And so hope the rest of the earnings season goes well, and we look forward to catching up with each of you throughout the next several months. Take care.\n\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's call.

My name is Eric, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Oil States Second Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. I would now like to turn the call over to Ellen Pennington, Oil States' Assistant Corporate Secretary. Please go ahead.\n\nEllen Pennington: Good morning, and welcome to Oil States' second quarter 2024 earnings conference call. Our call today will be led by our President and CEO, Cindy Taylor, and Lloyd Hajdik, Oil States' Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Before we begin, we would like to caution listeners regarding forward-looking statements. To the extent that our remarks today contain anything -- contain information other than historical information, please note that we are relying on the safe harbor protections afforded by federal law. No one should assume these forward-looking statements remain valid later in the quarter or beyond. Any such remarks should be weighed in the context of the many factors that affect our business, including those risks disclosed in our 2023 Form 10-K, along with other recent SEC filings. This call is being webcast and can be accessed at Oil States' website. A replay of the conference call will be available 2 hours after the completion of this call and will continue to be available for 12 months. I'll now turn the call over to Cindy.\n\nCindy Taylor: Thank you, Ellen. Good morning, and thank you for joining our conference call today, where we will discuss our second quarter 2024 results and provide our thoughts on market trends in addition to discussing our company specific outlook comments. Our second quarter consolidated revenues and adjusted EBITDA increased 11% and 38% sequentially, driven by increased drilling, subsea and production system demand in key offshore basins, along with the advancement of several significant projects in our Offshore/Manufactured Products segment. On a consolidated basis, our offshore and international revenues were up 18% sequentially, while U.S. land driven revenues increased 1%. Our results in the current quarter also benefited from continued customer adoption of our newer technologies and strategic optimization of our Well Site Services segment with the exit of certain underperforming U.S. locations. Given these initiatives, our Well Site Services adjusted segment EBITDA increased 30% sequentially in an otherwise declining U.S. land market. During the quarter, our Offshore/Manufactured Products segment revenues increased 17% sequentially totaling $102 million, while adjusted segment EBITDA rose 27%. Bookings totaled $101 million compared to $66 million received in the first quarter of 2024, yielding backlog of $300 million as of June 30 and a quarterly book-to-bill ratio of 1 times. Our bookings improvement was partially driven by our newer technology offerings, including orders for our managed pressure drilling systems. Our Well Site Services segment revenues decreased 2% on a sequential quarter basis, given the impact of lower U.S. activity, along with the segment's consolidation and exit over the past six months of four underperforming locations. Adjusted segment EBITDA increased 30% from the first quarter of 2024 due to stronger offshore activity in the Gulf of Mexico, along with modest market share gains in the Permian Basin. Our cost reduction initiatives helped yield very strong incremental margins. In our Downhole Technologies segment, revenues and adjusted segment EBITDA increased 16% and 42%, respectively, from the first quarter of 2024, driven primarily by increased completion product and international purporting sales. We will continue to focus on improving operations and allocating capital to efficiently and safely provide our customers with advanced technologies and services, while enhancing returns, reducing debt and returning cash to our stockholders. During the quarter, we generated cash flows from operations totaling $10 million, repurchased some of our convertible debt at a discount to par and also made share repurchases. Our gross debt to EBITDA at June 30 was 1.5 times and net was 1.2 times, giving us significant flexibility. Lloyd will now review our operational results along with our financial position in more detail.\n\nLloyd Hajdik: Thanks, Cindy. Good morning, everyone. During the second quarter, Oil States generated revenues of $186 million, adjusted consolidated EBITDA of $21 million and net income of $1.3 million or $0.02 per share. Our reported second quarter results included pretax facility consolidation exit charges of $3.5 million, patent defense charges of $1 million and gains of $0.5 million on debt extinguishment. Excluding these net charges and credits, our adjusted net income was $4.4 million or $0.07 per share. Our Offshore/Manufactured Products segment generated revenues of $102 million and adjusted segment EBITDA of $20 million in the second quarter. During the second quarter, charges of $1.5 million were recorded at the segment due to the consolidation of Oil States' Southeast Asian operations. Excluding the facility consolidation charges, adjusted segment EBITDA margin was 20% in the second quarter compared to 18% in the first quarter. Regarding our facility planning, we have strategically relocated our Southeast Asian manufacturing and service operations from Singapore to Batam, Indonesia, which is expected to produce future manufacturing costs for a number of our global product offerings. During the second quarter, we sold our facility in Singapore and received net cash proceeds of $10 million. While construction of our long-term Batam facility continues, with completion targeted for the first half of 2025, provisional operations were established in Batam during the quarter allowing us to efficiently execute both our contracted backlog and subsequent orders during the construction phase. We own one remaining U.S. facility that was classified as a held for sale asset at June 30. Net proceeds from the sale of this facility, which is expected to close in late 2024, are expected to total approximately $25 million. In our Well Site Services segment, we generated revenues of $46 million and adjusted segment EBITDA of $9 million in the second quarter. During the quarter, the segment recognized $2 million in costs associated with the consolidation and exit of underperforming locations. Additionally, the segment recorded charges of $1 million associated with the enforcement of patents related to its proprietary technologies. Excluding these charges, adjusted segment EBITDA margin was 18% in the second quarter compared to 14% in the first quarter. In our Downhole Technologies segment, we reported revenues of $38 million and adjusted segment EBITDA of $3 million for the second quarter. Adjusted segment EBITDA margin was 8% in the second quarter compared to 7% in the first quarter. And during the second quarter, Oil States generated $10 million in cash flows from operations and received $10 million in proceeds from the facility sale. Cash was used to fund capital expenditures of $6 million, purchased $11.5 million principal amount of our 4.75% convertible senior notes at a discount and buy back $2.4 million of our common stock. Now Cindy will offer some market outlook and concluding comments.\n\nCindy Taylor: Despite some concerns about oil demand in China and the possibility of OPEC+ ceasing voluntary production cuts in 2025, crude oil pricing has remained relatively stable over the first half of the year, generally in the $75 to $85 per barrel price range, which has provided our E&P customers a predictable environment for planning and sanctioning major offshore and international projects. Stable oil prices and a strong long-term outlook for natural gas and LNG demand supports significant levels of capital investment in offshore field development led by the U.S., Latin America, Asia and Africa. Major subsea OEMs continue to experience significant backlog growth as a result of orders for subsea production systems. We expect this trend to positively influence our business and future bookings. Growth trends continue to look favorable, given the level of offshore capital investment, our bidding and quoting activity, new product introductions, along with strong levels of bookings and backlog. Second quarter U.S. land activity levels have declined despite favorable WTI crude oil prices. Even with lower activity levels and weak natural gas prices, production and inventory levels have remained high, leading to a more challenging land market. Given current industry dynamics, we expect U.S. land drilling and completion spending over the balance of 2024 to remain at or near current level. We expect our Well Site Services and Downhole Technologies segments to perform in line with market activity indicators, which are weighted to U.S. land activity. The consolidation and exit of underperforming locations and the implementation of additional cost control measures should provide tangible margin benefits in subsequent quarters as assets are redeployed to more favorable operating locations. We are benefiting from the continued adoption and deployment of our new technologies, including our proprietary active seat valves within our Well Site Services segment. Within our Downhole Technologies segment, we expect to see further market penetration with the recent introduction of our new EPIC portfolio of perforating systems. Considering market dynamics, we are able to confirm our adjusted EBITDA guidance of $85 million to $90 million for 2024. In terms of free cash flow generation, we expect to generate approximately $40 million in free cash flow during 2024, which excludes the planned fourth quarter U.S. facility sale and remains in line with prior guidance, implying a free cash flow yield of 10% or greater. We will continue to maintain disciplined capital allocation priorities by judiciously investing in growth CapEx and organic research and development opportunities to drive additional technology differentiation. We will continue to evaluate debt reduction opportunities, share repurchases and targeted acquisitions. Now I would like to offer some concluding comments. We remain focused on optimizing our operations and pursuing profitable activity in support of our global customer base. As market opportunities unfold, both in the U.S. and in international and offshore markets, we will continue to focus on core areas of expertise with the deployment of our recently enhanced equipment and technologies to further differentiate our product and service offerings. Our core competencies are well entrenched in the markets we serve, and we continue to bid on potential opportunities supporting our traditional subsea, floating and fixed production systems, drilling and military customers while also bidding to support multiple new customers and projects involved in developments such as deep sea minerals gathering, fixed and floating offshore wind, carbon capture and storage, geothermal applications and other renewable and clean tech energy opportunities. These new energy transition opportunities create strong potential for us to expand our product and service offerings and our revenue base over the longer term. Oil States will continue to conduct safe operations and will remain focused on providing technology leadership in our various product and service offerings with value added products and services available to meet customer demands globally. That completes our prepared comments. Eric, would you open up the call for questions and answers at this time?\n\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from the line of Jim Rollyson with Raymond James. Please go ahead.\n\nJim Rollyson: Cindy, it was obviously great to see a nice sequential rebound in the offshore manufactured products business, which kind of falls in line typically, I guess, with your seasonal factors. But curious with kind of the orders and backlog and as you see that over the back half of the year, how are you thinking about kind of revenue and margin trajectory based on kind of the timing of what's in backlog today, kind of a similar trend to last year or something different?\n\nCindy Taylor: Clearly, if you kind of look at the guidance, to some degree, the revenue and trajectory, I'll call it, over the next couple of quarters looks, I'm going to call it strong, but fairly level given that our bookings to date are at 0.9 times. And so a lot of the momentum we're seeing, I would say, carries into 2025. We -- again, I don't know if we made comments about our bookings outlook, but we still expect our overall book-to-bill to be north of 1, which implies greater than a one-time book-to-bill for the second half of this year. And again, I think that sets up very well for 2025. I haven't looked at my individual quarters in terms of revenue generation. But again, embedded in our guidance, a lot of the activity is going to be driven by offshore and international. No surprise there based on the overall macro environment that we're looking at, and that implies strong results for this particular segment.\n\nJim Rollyson: Perfect. Yeah. Just looking for confirmation there. So I appreciate that. And on the Well Site Services and Downhole Technologies, you mentioned similar in the past, your revenues kind of performed in line with activity. But clearly, some of the kind of internal things you're doing on the cost side and managing operations that weren't performing have obviously paid through in margin benefits this quarter. And you mentioned just that growing as you continue to work on those things. Any sense of kind of how you're thinking about magnitude of potential margin expansion in the kind of flattish from here outlook?\n\nLloyd Hajdik: Yeah. So Jim, I'll take that. So when we're looking at Well Site Services with us closing some of these underperforming locations, we could see that the margins overall getting into the low 20% range, EBITDA margins.\n\nJim Rollyson: Okay. Yes. No. That's very healthy. And what are you thinking about for Downhole Technologies because that obviously had an improved quarter as well from a few different things.\n\nJim Rollyson: Yeah. Perfect. Well, I appreciate that. I'll turn it back to someone else for the next question.\n\nCindy Taylor: Thanks, Jim.\n\nOperator: The next question comes from the line of Stephen Gengaro with Stifel. Please go ahead.\n\nStephen Gengaro: Thanks. Good morning, everybody. So just quickly to clarify, were you guiding -- were you suggesting Well Site margins in the low-20s in the second half of the year. Is that -- was that your -- I was trying to just make sure I understood that correctly.\n\nStephen Gengaro: Okay. Great. Thank you. I guess two things for me. First, Cindy, you've been watching this market a long time like I have, and we've been kind of consistently frustrated by the lack of U.S. activity growth on the land side. And I know there's M&A reasons and the gas market has been soft. But what are you -- do you see anything else there? And maybe how do you think about maybe the catalyst or what needs to happen to get kind of a recovery on the U.S. land side even if it's several quarters out?\n\nCindy Taylor: Yeah. Well, first and foremost, embedded in my comments is just the statement. If you look back for the last 15 months, maybe 18 months. Activity on land is down kind of 20% plus. It's kind of shocking quite frankly. And yet despite that, we're producing record levels. And the way I look at that, I don't do basin by basin analysis. But certainly, there are a lot of analysts that do that say productivity per foot is flat to down in most of the basins. And so it is my opinion that a lot of this M&A activity is for geared towards the resource play and being able to move from 2-mile laterals to 3. And when you do that, the real answer is, you're just drilling and completing a lot of available footage, and we're benefiting from that. And so this Efficiency Measure gets a little more elusive when you're talking about productivity per foot versus just extended laterals, it's all good for the operator. But again, I think we and everybody else believe that production is going to turn at some point. And the question that -- agile question is when does that happen? But clearly, in my opinion, 2025 kind of spells a different level of overall production as some of these decline curves hit, that's number one. Number two is just natural gas. They're in anyone that really debates the long-term contribution and benefit from both natural gas and LNG. It will come, and if you get kind of the double trigger, if you will, between natural gas activity and an improved crude oil activity environment, those are clearly the drivers for a service company like us as it relates to U.S. land. It's just very hard for me to see how that does not happen in 2025. But all I hear from everybody right now is kind of a muted 2025 U.S. land outlook, and that's because of 2 things right now, this perception of reduced demand in China, which I mentioned in my notes, coupled with the fact that OPEC+ has voluntary production cut in place that they're telling the market they may reverse late this year, early 2025. So it's always about the macro in this world. And maybe I'm just an optimist because you need to be an optimist in this space, but I see a better 2025 shaping up than maybe the analysts have in their models and what they're thinking. In fact, we had one kind of cut our outlook for 2025, and I just don't see it right now.\n\nStephen Gengaro: Got you. Great. Thanks for the color. And then maybe as a follow-up to that, when you think about rig efficiency and completion efficiency and longer laterals, where does that benefit you guys the most? Which product lines -- yeah, that might be helpful. Just some color on that.\n\nCindy Taylor: It's really across - it's across both our Well Site Services and our Downhole Technologies segments, predominantly because the -- you're really talking again about a U.S. land-driven activity at this point in time. And with our active seat valves, number one, they are more efficient to the operating. They work very well in extended laterals multi-pad type work and its cost effective for us to bring those to market just from the efficiency at the Well Site. And then our new suite of Downhole Technologies, again, the EPIC product line, we have hoped to gain market share even in a flatter market, much less an improving market. That, coupled with international penetration, we believe, helps us turn that segment around.\n\nStephen Gengaro: Great. No, that's very helpful. And then just maybe one final one for me. I think you mentioned maybe a book-to-bill of over 1 in offshore manufactured products in the back half of the year. Is there -- when we think about the trajectory of growth for that business, should we just really be thinking about offshore deepwater rig activity and then any rigs that get added and how that kind of ultimately morphs into demand for your products? Is it the best proxy we can use for what that growth could look like in '25 and '26?\n\nCindy Taylor: Yeah. It's kind of near term, long term, and let me explain that a little bit. Rigs go to work in development drilling profiles prove up work that leads into longer-term production infrastructure. Again, you know all of that. It used to be we were not heavily exposed, and we're still weighted to offshore production facility development. My however is with the recent introduction of our new Managed Pressure Drilling Technologies, as rigs do go to work, we are seeing incremental demand for particularly MPD equipment. But even deck equipment and other types of riser products that we have. So we'll see some - that's what I call, nearer term because everybody knows rigs are going to work. They're being upgraded. They're getting longer-term contracts. But the great news is the follow-on from that will be increased subsea and production infrastructure development. And again, you've seen other larger companies in the space with some very good bookings that kind of are a precursor to the demand for some of our products and services.\n\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from the line of John Daniel with Daniel Energy Partners. Please go ahead.\n\nJohn Daniel: Just two for me. You noted in the prepared remarks that you anticipate activity in the, I guess, lower 48 to be at or near current levels. I'm just curious if that's where we stay for the balance of the year and maybe even into Q1. How do you see that changing the competitive landscape and your -- in the areas you serve and how many people don't make it, if you will. Just your thoughts on that.\n\nCindy Taylor: I'm sorry, you're asking kind of the competitive landscape on U.S. land activity?\n\nJohn Daniel: If we stay in this sort of flattish range right now, do you see it changing the competitive landscape at all over the next six months to nine months?\n\nCindy Taylor: Yeah. I'm going to respond to that, and I'll see if Lloyd has any add-on comments. So we get anecdotal comments and evidence of smaller players kind of shutting down local operations, various facilities, trimming headcount, tamping down for the summer. I almost think of those as one-offs that do modestly improve the competitive landscape. But I'll offer you a bigger picture comment that what I've probably not seen as many M&A opportunities in a very long time. And so I think when everybody recognizes how competitive the energy services market is, they're looking for opportunities to either exit or just kind of optimize their operations through M&A. And we see quite a lot. And certainly, on a basin specific level, we're seeing that. But I'd say even importantly, larger service companies are, I'll call it, drinking our customers' cooled in the sense that they're seeing the market consolidation. They're seeing the need for size and scale from an operating perspective, not to mention from a shareholder perspective. And so we have all kinds of inbounds right now from both private and public entities. And so while, yes, I think some of the smaller players fall out just by closing locations, facilities, trimming headcount, I think the bigger picture is going to be the consolidation which it seems like is heating up.\n\nJohn Daniel: Okay. Thank you for that. The next one is on the new products and technologies that you guys are introducing. Can you just address customer willingness to try new products at this stage and sort of how you see the expected adoption rates playing out over the next year or two -- one to two years?\n\nCindy Taylor: Yeah. And again, my comments may not surprise you. There's much greater willingness to trial a one-off technology introduction on U.S. land. And just think about it, the wells are smaller, the AFE costs are smaller. Generally, they're going with proven operators in the first place. And secondarily, those types of customers are really coming to us and others telling us the enhancements that they need. And so to some degree, these are being developed in conjunction with operator involvement and communication. And so their willingness to trial them is better. Now that being said, I'll use my example of Downhole Technologies, there's a lot of offerings in the market right now. And when activity is down to the degree it has been over the last 15 months to 18 months, it is harder to get a partner to trial, new technology. And so it's maybe the uptake is a little bit slower. I'll put that in complete contrast to deepwater offshore. And our company has been participating in that space for 80 years, and the barriers to entry are just significant. And it always would stun me if a, I'll call it, a one-off newer company tried to get a product introduced. I think it'd be very, very difficult as opposed to someone that has a deep, long demonstrated operating history in this space. And I'll use a couple of examples. Number one is our high-pressure riser systems. We've been putting riser systems in the market for decades. So you're more willing to be able to adapt and advance that technology and get market acceptance. Probably the newer technology I'll talk about is the MPD systems that we've got great acceptance thus far of our products and great interest thus far, but we brought a newer, more advanced, more efficient offering to the market that was already there, again, in conjunction with conversations around customer needs to get there. And I want to say, and by the way, we've been working on this off and on for probably seven years. And so complete difference in terms of market introductions, and we're going to be cautious about bringing any new technology to bear just because the risk of reputation and the risk of failure is great offshore, right? But -- and then I'll take this a step further, as we prove up technologies on U.S. land, then we're going to take those into international markets more efficiently.\n\nOperator: I will now turn the call back over to Cindy Taylor, President and CEO for closing remarks. Please go ahead.\n\nCindy Taylor: You bet. Thank you, Eric, and thanks to all of you for joining our call today. I know it's a very busy portion of the earnings season. We're very glad to report stronger improved results, both this quarter and our outlook, I think, will guide to better days ahead as well. And so hope the rest of the earnings season goes well, and we look forward to catching up with each of you throughout the next several months. Take care.\n\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's call.

My name is Eric, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Oil States second-quarter 2024 earnings conference call. (Operator Instructions)\n\nThank you. I would now like to turn the call over to Ellen Pennington, Oil States' Assistant Corporate Secretary. Please go ahead.\n\nEllen Pennington\n\nGood morning, and welcome to Oil States' second-quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call. Our call today will be led by our President and CEO, Cindy Taylor, and Lloyd Hajdik, Oil States' Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.\n\nBefore we begin, we would like to caution listeners regarding forward-looking statements. To the extent that our remarks today contain anything -- contain information other than historical information, please note that we are relying on the safe harbor protections afforded by federal law.\n\nNo one should assume these forward-looking statements remain valid later in the quarter or beyond. Any such remarks should be weighed in the context of the many factors that affect our business, including those risks disclosed in our 2023 Form 10-K, along with other recent SEC filings. This call is being webcast and can be accessed at Oil States' website. A replay of the conference call will be available two hours after the completion of this call and will continue to be available for 12 months.\n\nI'll now turn the call over to Cindy.\n\nCynthia Taylor\n\nThank you, Ellen. Good morning, and thank you for joining our conference call today, where we will discuss our second-quarter 2024 results and provide our thoughts on market trends in addition to discussing our company-specific outlook comments.\n\nOur second quarter consolidated revenues and adjusted EBITDA increased 11% and 38% sequentially, driven by increased drilling, subsea and production system demand in key offshore basins, along with the advancement of several significant projects in our offshore, manufactured products segment.\n\nOn a consolidated basis, our offshore and international revenues were up 18% sequentially, while US land-driven revenues increased 1%. Our results in the current quarter also benefited from continued customer adoption of our newer technologies and strategic optimization of our well site services segment with the exit of certain underperforming US locations. Given these initiatives, our well site services adjusted segment EBITDA increased 30% sequentially in an otherwise declining US land market.\n\nDuring the quarter, our offshore, manufactured products segment revenues increased 17% sequentially totaling $102 million, while adjusted segment EBITDA rose 27%. Bookings totaled $101 million compared to $66 million received in the first quarter of 2024, yielding backlog of $300 million as of June 30 and a quarterly book-to-bill ratio of 1 time.\n\nOur bookings improvement was partially driven by our newer technology offerings, including orders for our managed pressure drilling systems. Our well site services segment revenues decreased 2% on a sequential quarter basis, given the impact of lower US activity, along with the segment's consolidation and exit over the past six months of four underperforming locations.\n\nAdjusted segment EBITDA increased 30% from the first quarter of 2024 due to stronger offshore activity in the Gulf of Mexico, along with modest market share gains in the Permian Basin. Our cost reduction initiatives helped yield very strong incremental margins.\n\nIn our downhole technologies segment, revenues and adjusted segment EBITDA increased 16% and 42%, respectively, from the first quarter of 2024, driven primarily by increased completion product and international purporting sales. We will continue to focus on improving operations and allocating capital to efficiently and safely provide our customers with advanced technologies and services, while enhancing returns, reducing debt and returning cash to our stockholders.\n\nDuring the quarter, we generated cash flows from operations totaling $10 million, repurchased some of our convertible debt at a discount to par and also made share repurchases. Our gross debt to EBITDA at June 30 was 1.5 times and net was 1.2 times, giving us significant flexibility.\n\nLloyd will now review our operational results along with our financial position in more detail.\n\nLloyd Hajdik\n\nThanks, Cindy. Good morning, everyone.\n\nDuring the second quarter, Oil States generated revenues of $186 million, adjusted consolidated EBITDA of $21 million and net income of $1.3 million or $0.02 per share. Our reported second quarter results included pretax facility consolidation exit charges of $3.5 million, patent defense charges of $1 million and gains of $0.5 million on debt extinguishment.Excluding these net charges and credits, our adjusted net income was $4.4 million or $0.07 per share.\n\nOur offshore, manufactured products segment generated revenues of $102 million and adjusted segment EBITDA of $20 million in the second quarter. During the second quarter, charges of $1.5 million were recorded at the segment due to the consolidation of Oil States' Southeast Asian operations. Excluding the facility consolidation charges, adjusted segment EBITDA margin was 20% in the second quarter compared to 18% in the first quarter.\n\nRegarding our facility planning, we have strategically relocated our Southeast Asian manufacturing and service operations from Singapore to Batam, Indonesia, which is expected to produce future manufacturing costs for a number of our global product offerings.\n\nDuring the second quarter, we sold our facility in Singapore and received net cash proceeds of $10 million. While construction of our long-term Batam facility continues, with completion targeted for the first half of 2025, provisional operations were established in Batam during the quarter allowing us to efficiently execute both our contracted backlog and subsequent orders during the construction phase.\n\nWe own one remaining US facility that was classified as a held for sale asset at June 30. Net proceeds from the sale of this facility, which is expected to close in late 2024, are expected to total approximately $25 million. In our well site services segment, we generated revenues of $46 million and adjusted segment EBITDA of $9 million in the second quarter.\n\nDuring the quarter, the segment recognized $2 million in costs associated with the consolidation and exit of underperforming locations. Additionally, the segment recorded charges of $1 million associated with the enforcement of patents related to its proprietary technologies. Excluding these charges, adjusted segment EBITDA margin was 18% in the second quarter compared to 14% in the first quarter.\n\nIn our downhole technologies segment, we reported revenues of $38 million and adjusted segment EBITDA of $3 million for the second quarter. Adjusted segment EBITDA margin was 8% in the second quarter compared to 7% in the first quarter.\n\nAnd during the second quarter, Oil States generated $10 million in cash flows from operations and received $10 million in proceeds from the facility sale. Cash was used to fund capital expenditures of $6 million, purchased $11.5 million principal amount of our 4.75% convertible senior notes at a discount and buy back $2.4 million of our common stock.\n\nNow Cindy will offer some market outlook and concluding comments.\n\nCynthia Taylor\n\nDespite some concerns about oil demand in China and the possibility of OPEC+ ceasing voluntary production cuts in 2025, crude oil pricing has remained relatively stable over the first half of the year, generally in the $75 to $85 per barrel price range which has provided our E&P customers a predictable environment for planning and sanctioning major offshore and international projects.\n\nStable oil prices and a strong long-term outlook for natural gas and LNG demand supports significant levels of capital investment in offshore field development led by the US, Latin America, Asia, and Africa. Major subsea OEMs continue to experience significant backlog growth as a result of orders for subsea production systems. We expect this trend to positively influence our business and future bookings.\n\nGrowth trends continue to look favorable, given the level of offshore capital investment, our bidding and quoting activity, new product introductions, along with strong levels of bookings and backlog. Second-quarter US land activity levels have declined despite favorable WTI crude oil prices. Even with lower activity levels and weak natural gas prices, production and inventory levels have remained high, leading to a more challenging land market.\n\nGiven current industry dynamics, we expect US land drilling and completion spending over the balance of 2024 to remain at or near current levels. We expect our well site services and downhole technologies segments to perform in line with market activity indicators, which are weighted to US land activity.\n\nThe consolidation and exit of underperforming locations and the implementation of additional cost control measures should provide tangible margin benefits in subsequent quarters as assets are redeployed to more favorable operating locations.\n\nWe are benefiting from the continued adoption and deployment of our new technologies, including our proprietary active seat valves within our well site services segment. Within our downhole technologies segment, we expect to see further market penetration with the recent introduction of our new EPIC portfolio of perforating systems.\n\nConsidering market dynamics, we are able to confirm our adjusted EBITDA guidance of $85 million to $90 million for 2024. In terms of free cash flow generation, we expect to generate approximately $40 million in free cash flow during 2024, which excludes the planned fourth quarter US facility sale and remains in line with prior guidance, implying a free cash flow yield of 10% or greater.\n\nWe will continue to maintain disciplined capital allocation priorities by judiciously investing in growth CapEx and organic research and development opportunities to drive additional technology differentiation. We will continue to evaluate debt reduction opportunities, share repurchases, and targeted acquisitions.\n\nNow I would like to offer some concluding comments. We remain focused on optimizing our operations and pursuing profitable activity in support of our global customer base. As market opportunities unfold, both in the US and in international and offshore markets, we will continue to focus on core areas of expertise with the deployment of our recently enhanced equipment and technologies to further differentiate our product and service offerings.\n\nOur core competencies are well entrenched in the markets we serve, and we continue to bid on potential opportunities supporting our traditional subsea, floating and fixed production systems, drilling and military customers while also bidding to support multiple new customers and projects involved in developments such as deep-sea minerals gathering, fixed and floating offshore wind, carbon capture and storage, geothermal applications, and other renewable and clean tech energy opportunities.\n\nThese new energy transition opportunities create strong potential for us to expand our product and service offerings and our revenue base over the longer term. Oil States will continue to conduct safe operations and will remain focused on providing technology leadership in our various product and service offerings with value-added products and services available to meet customer demands globally.\n\nThat completes our prepared comments. Eric, would you open up the call for questions and answers at this time?\n\n(Operator Instructions) Jim Rollyson, Raymond James.\n\nJim Rollyson\n\nCindy, it was obviously great to see a nice sequential rebound in the offshore manufactured products business, which kind of falls in line typically, I guess, with your seasonal factors. But curious with kind of the orders and backlog and as you see that over the back half of the year, how are you thinking about kind of revenue and margin trajectory based on kind of the timing of what's in backlog today, kind of a similar trend to last year or something different?\n\nCynthia Taylor\n\nClearly, if you kind of look at the guidance, to some degree, the revenue and trajectory, I'll call it, over the next couple of quarters looks -- I'm going to call it strong, but fairly level given that our bookings to date are at 0.9 times. And so a lot of the momentum we're seeing, I would say, carries into 2025. We -- again, I don't know if we made comments about our bookings outlook, but we still expect our overall book-to-bill to be north of 1, which implies greater than a 1 time book-to-bill for the second half of this year.\n\nAnd again, I think that sets up very well for 2025. I haven't looked at my individual quarters in terms of revenue generation. But again, embedded in our guidance, a lot of the activity is going to be driven by offshore and international. No surprise there based on the overall macro environment that we're looking at, and that implies strong results for this particular segment.\n\nJim Rollyson\n\nPerfect. Yes, just looking for confirmation there. So I appreciate that. And on the well site services and downhole technologies, you mentioned similar in the past, your revenues kind of performed in line with activity. But clearly, some of the kind of internal things you're doing on the cost side and managing operations that weren't performing have obviously paid through in margin benefits this quarter.\n\nAnd you mentioned just that growing as you continue to work on those things. Any sense of kind of how you're thinking about magnitude of potential margin expansion in the kind of flattish from here outlook?\n\nLloyd Hajdik\n\nYeah. So Jim, I'll take that. So when we're looking at well site services with us closing some of these underperforming locations, we could see that the margins overall getting into the low 20% range, EBITDA margins.\n\nJim Rollyson\n\nOkay. Yeah. No, that's very healthy. And what are you thinking about for downhole technologies because that obviously had an improved quarter as well from a few different things.\n\nThanks. Good morning, everybody. So just quickly to clarify, were you guiding -- were you suggesting well site margins in the low 20s in the second half of the year. Is that -- was that your -- I was trying to just make sure I understood that correctly.\n\nOkay. Thank you. Great. I guess two things for me. First, Cindy, you've been watching this market a long time like I have, and we've been kind of consistently frustrated by the lack of US activity growth on the land side. And I know there's M&A reasons and the gas market has been soft. But what are you -- do you see anything else there? And maybe how do you think about maybe the catalyst or what needs to happen to get kind of a recovery on the US land side even if it's several quarters out?\n\nCynthia Taylor\n\nYes. Well, first and foremost, embedded in my comments is just the statement. If you look back for the last 15 months, maybe 18 months. Activity on land is down kind of 20%-plus. It's kind of shocking quite frankly. And yet despite that, we're producing record levels.\n\nAnd the way I look at that, I don't do basin by basin analysis. But certainly, there are a lot of analysts that do that say productivity per foot is flat to down in most of the basins. And so it is my opinion that a lot of this M&A activity is for geared towards the resource play and being able to move from 2-mile laterals to 3.\n\nAnd when you do that, the real answer is you're just drilling and completing a lot of available footage, and we're benefiting from that. And so this efficiency measure gets a little more elusive when you're talking about productivity per foot versus just extended laterals, it's all good for the operator.\n\nBut again, I think we and everybody else believe that production is going to turn at some point. And the question that -- agile question is when does that happen? But clearly, in my opinion, 2025 kind of spells a different level of overall production as some of these decline curves hit, that's number one.\n\nNumber two is just natural gas. They're in anyone that really debates the long-term contribution and benefit from both natural gas and LNG. It will come, and if you get kind of the double trigger, if you will, between natural gas activity and an improved crude oil activity environment, those are clearly the drivers for a service company like us as it relates to US land.\n\nIt's just very hard for me to see how that does not happen in 2025. But all I hear from everybody right now is kind of a muted 2025 US land outlook, and that's because of two things right now, this perception of reduced demand in China, which I mentioned in my notes, coupled with the fact that OPEC+ has voluntary production cut in place that they're telling the market they may reverse late this year, early 2025.\n\nSo it's always about the macro in this world. And maybe I'm just an optimist because you need to be an optimist in this space, but I see a better 2025 shaping up than maybe the analysts have in their models and what they're thinking. In fact, we had one kind of cut our outlook for 2025, and I just don't see it right now.\n\nStephen Gengaro\n\nGot you. Great. Thanks for the color. And then maybe as a follow-up to that, when you think about rig efficiency and completion efficiency and longer laterals, where does that benefit you guys the most? Which product lines -- yeah, that might be helpful. Just some color on that.\n\nCynthia Taylor\n\nIt's across both our well site services and our downhole technologies segments, predominantly because the -- you're really talking again about a US land-driven activity at this point in time. And with our active seat valves, number one, they are more efficient to the operating. They work very well in extended laterals multi-pad type work, and it's cost effective for us to bring those to market just from the efficiency at the well site.\n\nAnd then our new suite of downhole technologies, again, the EPIC product line, we have hoped to gain market share even in a flatter market, much less an improving market. That, coupled with international penetration, we believe, helps us turn that segment around.\n\nStephen Gengaro\n\nGreat. No, that's very helpful. And then just maybe one final one for me. I think you mentioned maybe a book-to-bill of over 1 in offshore manufactured products in the back half of the year. Is there -- when we think about the trajectory of growth for that business, should we just really be thinking about offshore deepwater rig activity and then any rigs that get added and how that kind of ultimately morphs into demand for your products? Is it the best proxy we can use for what that growth could look like in '25 and '26?\n\nCynthia Taylor\n\nYes. It's kind of near term, long term, and let me explain that a little bit. Rigs go to work in development drilling profiles prove up work that leads into longer-term production infrastructure. Again, you know all of that. It used to be we were not heavily exposed, and we're still weighted to offshore production facility development.\n\nMy however is with the recent introduction of our new managed pressure drilling technologies, as rigs do go to work, we are seeing incremental demand for particularly MPD equipment. But even deck equipment and other types of riser products that we have.\n\nSo we'll see some -- that's what I call, nearer term because everybody knows rigs are going to work. They're being upgraded. They're getting longer-term contracts. But the great news is the follow-on from that will be increased subsea and production infrastructure development. And again, you've seen other larger companies in the space with some very good bookings that kind of are a precursor to the demand for some of our products and services.\n\nOperator\n\n(Operator Instructions) John Daniel, Daniel Energy Partners.\n\nJohn Daniel\n\nThank you. Morning, Cindy and Lloyd. Just two for me. You noted in the prepared remarks that you anticipate activity in the, I guess, lower 48 to be at or near current levels. I'm just curious if that's where we stay for the balance of the year and maybe even into Q1. How do you see that changing the competitive landscape and your -- in the areas you serve and how many people don't make it, if you will? Just your thoughts on that.\n\nCynthia Taylor\n\nI'm sorry, you're asking kind of the competitive landscape on US land activity?\n\nJohn Daniel\n\nIf we stay in this sort of flattish range right now, do you see it changing the competitive landscape at all over the next six to nine months?\n\nCynthia Taylor\n\nYeah. I'm going to respond to that, and I'll see if Lloyd has any add-on comments. So we get anecdotal comments and evidence of smaller players kind of shutting down local operations, various facilities, trimming headcount, tamping down for the summer. I almost think of those as one-offs that do modestly improve the competitive landscape.\n\nBut I'll offer you a bigger picture comment that what I've probably not seen as many M&A opportunities in a very long time. And so I think when everybody recognizes how competitive the energy services market is, they're looking for opportunities to either exit or just kind of optimize their operations through M&A. And we see quite a lot. And certainly, on a basin specific level, we're seeing that.\n\nBut I'd say even importantly, larger service companies are, I'll call it, drinking our customers' Kool-Aid in the sense that they're seeing the market consolidation. They're seeing the need for size and scale from an operating perspective, not to mention from a shareholder perspective.\n\nAnd so we have all kinds of inbounds right now from both private and public entities. And so while, yes, I think some of the smaller players fall out just by closing locations, facilities, trimming headcount, I think the bigger picture is going to be the consolidation which it seems like is heating up.\n\nJohn Daniel\n\nOkay. Thank you for that. The next one is on the new products and technologies that you guys are introducing. Can you just address customer willingness to try new products at this stage and sort of how you see the expected adoption rates playing out over the next year or two -- one to two years?\n\nCynthia Taylor\n\nYeah. And again, my comments may not surprise you. There's much greater willingness to trial a one-off technology introduction on US land. And just think about it, the wells are smaller, the AFE costs are smaller. Generally, they're going with proven operators in the first place.\n\nAnd secondarily, those types of customers are really coming to us and others telling us the enhancements that they need. And so to some degree, these are being developed in conjunction with operator involvement and communication. And so their willingness to trial them is better.\n\nNow that being said, I'll use my example of downhole technologies, there's a lot of offerings in the market right now. And when activity is down to the degree it has been over the last 15 to 18 months, it is harder to get a partner to trial, new technology. And so it's maybe the uptake is a little bit slower.\n\nI'll put that in complete contrast to deepwater offshore. And our company has been participating in that space for 80 years, and the barriers to entry are just significant. And it always would stun me if a, I'll call it, a one-off newer company tried to get a product introduced. I think it'd be very, very difficult as opposed to someone that has a deep, long demonstrated operating history in this space. And I'll use a couple of examples.\n\nNumber one is our high-pressure riser systems. We've been putting riser systems in the market for decades. So you're more willing to be able to adapt and advance that technology and get market acceptance. Probably the newer technology I'll talk about is the MPD systems that we've got great acceptance thus far of our products and great interest thus far, but we brought a newer, more advanced, more efficient offering to the market that was already there, again, in conjunction with conversations around customer needs to get there.\n\nAnd I want to say, and oh, by the way, we've been working on this off and on for probably seven years. And so complete difference in terms of market introductions, and we're going to be cautious about bringing any new technology to bear just because the risk of reputation and the risk of failure is great offshore, right? But -- and then I'll take this a step further, as we prove up technologies on US land, then we're going to take those into international markets more efficiently.\n\nOperator\n\nI will now turn the call back over to Cindy Taylor, President and CEO, for closing remarks. Please go ahead.\n\nCynthia Taylor\n\nYou bet. Thank you, Eric, and thanks to all of you for joining our call today. I know it's a very busy portion of the earnings season. We're very glad to report stronger improved results, both this quarter and our outlook, I think, will guide to better days ahead as well.

Adjusted Segment EBITDA increased 30% from the first quarter of 2024 - reflective of higher customer activity in the Gulf of Mexico and the Permian Basin along with various cost reduction initiatives.\n\n\"Our Downhole Technologies segment revenues and Adjusted Segment EBITDA increased 16% and 42%, respectively, from the first quarter of 2024, driven primarily by increased completion product and international perforating sales.\n\n\"We continue to focus on improving operations and allocating capital to efficiently and safely provide our customers with advanced technologies and services, while enhancing returns, reducing debt and returning cash to our stockholders. Strong cash flows from operations totaling $10 million allowed for convertible debt and share repurchases in the quarter.\"\n\nBusiness Segment Results\n\nIn first quarter 2024, certain short-cycle, consumable product operations historically reported within the Offshore Manufactured Products segment (legacy frac plugs and elastomer products) were integrated into our Downhole Technologies segment to better align with the underlying activity demand drivers and current segment management structure, as well as provide for additional operational synergies.

Strong cash flows from operations totaling $10 million allowed for convertible debt and share repurchases in the quarter.\"\n\nBusiness Segment Results\n\nIn first quarter 2024, certain short-cycle, consumable product operations historically reported within the Offshore Manufactured Products segment (legacy frac plugs and elastomer products) were integrated into our Downhole Technologies segment to better align with the underlying activity demand drivers and current segment management structure, as well as provide for additional operational synergies.

Adjusted EBITDA is not a measure of financial performance under generally accepted accounting principles (\"GAAP\") and should not be considered in isolation from or as a substitute for net income (loss) or cash flow measures prepared in accordance with GAAP or as a measure of profitability or liquidity. Additionally, Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies.

This represents growth of more than 6% compared to an already strong second quarter in 2023. We are especially pleased that all three of our business segments reported increased revenue. Materialise Medical turned in another strong performance, growing by 13%, while also Materialise Software and Materialise Manufacturing posted higher revenues. This solid topline performance enabled us to intensify our investments while maintaining net profitability. In another step forward, in July 2024 we acquired FEops, a Belgian company that develops AI-driven simulation technology to improve procedure efficiency and clinical outcomes for structural heart interventions. The acquisition positions Materialise to advance the personalized treatment of patients with heart diseases.\"\n\nSecond Quarter 2024 Results\n\nTotal revenue for the second quarter of 2024 increased 6.2% to 68,797 kEUR from 64,810 kEUR for the second quarter of 2023. Adjusted EBIT increased to 3,872 kEUR for the second quarter of 2024 from (597) kEUR for the 2023 period. The Adjusted EBIT margin (Adjusted EBIT divided by total revenue) for the second quarter of 2024 was 5.6%, compared to (0.9)% for the second quarter of 2023. Adjusted EBITDA increased to 9,188 kEUR for the second quarter of 2024 from 4,755 kEUR for the 2023 period.\n\nRevenue from our Materialise Medical segment increased 12.8% to 28,141 kEUR for the second quarter of 2024 compared to 24,945 kEUR for the same period in 2023. Segment Adjusted EBITDA amounted to 8,199 kEUR for the second quarter of 2024 compared to 2,683 kEUR while the segment Adjusted EBITDA margin was 29.1% compared to 10.8% for the second quarter of 2023.\n\nRevenue from our Materialise Software segment increased 1.8% to 11,226 kEUR for the second quarter of 2024 from 11,030 kEUR for the same quarter last year. Segment Adjusted EBITDA decreased to 1,374 kEUR from 1,973 kEUR while the segment Adjusted EBITDA margin was 12.2% compared to 17.9% for the corresponding prior-year period reflecting the impact of increased development investments.\n\nRevenue from our Materialise Manufacturing segment increased 2.1% to 29,429 kEUR for the second quarter of 2024 from 28,835 kEUR for the second quarter of 2023. Segment Adjusted EBITDA amounted to 2,416 kEUR compared to 2,708 kEUR for last year's same period, while the segment Adjusted EBITDA margin was 8.2% compared to 9.4% for the second quarter of 2023.\n\nGross profit was 39,227 kEUR for the second quarter of 2024 compared to 37,047 kEUR for the same period last year, while gross profit as a percentage of revenue remained stable at 57.0% compared to 57.2% for the second quarter of 2023.\n\nResearch and development (\"R&D\"), sales and marketing (\"S&M\") and general and administrative (\"G&A\") expenses increased in the aggregate by 10.4% to 36,631 kEUR for the second quarter of 2024 from 33,176 kEUR for the second quarter of 2023.\n\nNet other operating income was 1,205 kEUR compared to (4,468) kEUR for the second quarter of 2023.\n\nOperating result amounted to 3,801 kEUR compared to (597) kEUR for the second quarter of 2023.\n\nNet financial result was 1,033 kEUR compared to 635 kEUR for the second quarter of 2023.\n\nThe second quarter of 2024 contained income tax expenses of (959) kEUR, compared to (532) kEUR in the second quarter of 2023.\n\nAs a result of the above, net result for the second quarter of 2024 was 3,875 kEUR, compared to (494) kEUR for the same period in 2023. Total comprehensive income for the second quarter of 2024, which includes exchange differences on translation of foreign operations, was 3,093 kEUR compared to 140 kEUR for the corresponding 2023 period.\n\nAt June 30, 2024, we had cash and cash equivalents of 125,492 kEUR compared to 127,573 kEUR at December 31, 2023. Gross debt amounted to 57,968 kEUR, compared to 64,398 kEUR at December 31, 2023. As a result, our net cash position (cash and cash equivalents less gross debt) was 67,524 kEUR, an increase of 4,349 kEUR compared to December 31, 2023.\n\nCash flow from operating activities for the second quarter of 2024 was 8,400 kEUR compared to 775 kEUR for the same period in 2023. Total cash out from capital expenditures for the second quarter of 2024 amounted to 8,459 kEUR.\n\nNet shareholders' equity at June 30, 2024 was 243,140 kEUR compared to 236,594 kEUR at December 31, 2023.\n\n2024 Guidance\n\nMrs. de Vet-Veithen concluded, \"Given the strength of our operational performance half-way through 2024 we believe that we are well on track to deliver the growth targets we set earlier. Accordingly, we continue to expect to report consolidated revenue for the full fiscal year 2024 within the 265,000 to 275,000 kEUR range we communicated earlier. We are also maintaining our Adjusted EBIT guidance of 11,000 kEUR to 14,000 kEUR for fiscal year 2024.\"\n\nNon-IFRS Measures\n\nMaterialise uses EBIT, EBITDA, Adjusted EBIT and Adjusted EBITDA as supplemental financial measures of its financial performance. EBIT is calculated as net profit plus income taxes, financial expenses (less financial income) and shares of profit or loss in a joint venture. EBITDA is calculated as net profit plus income taxes, financial expenses (less financial income), shares of profit or loss in a joint venture and depreciation and amortization. Adjusted EBIT and Adjusted EBITDA are determined by adding share-based compensation expenses, acquisition-related expenses of business combinations, impairments and revaluation of fair value due to business combinations to EBIT and EBITDA, respectively. Management believes these non-IFRS measures to be important measures as they exclude the effects of items which primarily reflect the impact of financing decisions and, in the case of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA, long term investment, rather than the performance of the company's day-to-day operations. The company also uses segment Adjusted EBITDA to evaluate the performance of its three business segments. As compared to net profit, these measures are limited in that they do not reflect the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments on the company's indebtedness and, in the case of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA, these measures are further limited in that they do not reflect the periodic costs of certain capitalized tangible and intangible assets used in generating revenues in the company's business, or the changes associated with impairments. Management evaluates such items through other financial measures such as financial expenses, capital expenditures and cash flow provided by operating activities. The company believes that these measurements are useful to measure a company's ability to grow or as a valuation measurement. The company's calculation of EBIT, EBITDA, Adjusted EBIT and Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. EBIT, EBITDA, Adjusted EBIT and Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered as alternatives to net profit or any other performance measure derived in accordance with IFRS. The company's presentation of EBIT, EBITDA, Adjusted EBIT and Adjusted EBITDA should not be construed to imply that its future results will be unaffected by unusual or non-recurring items.\n\nExchange Rate\n\nThis document contains translations of certain euro amounts into U.S. dollars at specified rates solely for the convenience of readers.

This represents growth of more than 6% compared to an already strong second quarter in 2023. We are especially pleased that all three of our business segments reported increased revenue. Materialise Medical turned in another strong performance, growing by 13%, while also Materialise Software and Materialise Manufacturing posted higher revenues. This solid topline performance enabled us to intensify our investments while maintaining net profitability. In another step forward, in July 2024 we acquired FEops, a Belgian company that develops AI-driven simulation technology to improve procedure efficiency and clinical outcomes for structural heart interventions. The acquisition positions Materialise to advance the personalized treatment of patients with heart diseases.\"\n\nSecond Quarter 2024 Results\n\nTotal revenue for the second quarter of 2024 increased 6.2% to 68,797 kEUR from 64,810 kEUR for the second quarter of 2023.

Segment Adjusted EBITDA decreased to 1,374 kEUR from 1,973 kEUR while the segment Adjusted EBITDA margin was 12.2% compared to 17.9% for the corresponding prior-year period reflecting the impact of increased development investments.\n\nRevenue from our Materialise Manufacturing segment increased 2.1% to 29,429 kEUR for the second quarter of 2024 from 28,835 kEUR for the second quarter of 2023. Segment Adjusted EBITDA amounted to 2,416 kEUR compared to 2,708 kEUR for last year's same period, while the segment Adjusted EBITDA margin was 8.2% compared to 9.4% for the second quarter of 2023.\n\nGross profit was 39,227 kEUR for the second quarter of 2024 compared to 37,047 kEUR for the same period last year, while gross profit as a percentage of revenue remained stable at 57.0% compared to 57.2% for the second quarter of 2023.\n\nResearch and development (\"R&D\"), sales and marketing (\"S&M\") and general and administrative (\"G&A\") expenses increased in the aggregate by 10.4% to 36,631 kEUR for the second quarter of 2024 from 33,176 kEUR for the second quarter of 2023.\n\nNet other operating income was 1,205 kEUR compared to (4,468) kEUR for the second quarter of 2023.\n\nOperating result amounted to 3,801 kEUR compared to (597) kEUR for the second quarter of 2023.\n\nNet financial result was 1,033 kEUR compared to 635 kEUR for the second quarter of 2023.\n\nThe second quarter of 2024 contained income tax expenses of (959) kEUR, compared to (532) kEUR in the second quarter of 2023.\n\nAs a result of the above, net result for the second quarter of 2024 was 3,875 kEUR, compared to (494) kEUR for the same period in 2023. Total comprehensive income for the second quarter of 2024, which includes exchange differences on translation of foreign operations, was 3,093 kEUR compared to 140 kEUR for the corresponding 2023 period.\n\nAt June 30, 2024, we had cash and cash equivalents of 125,492 kEUR compared to 127,573 kEUR at December 31, 2023. Gross debt amounted to 57,968 kEUR, compared to 64,398 kEUR at December 31, 2023. As a result, our net cash position (cash and cash equivalents less gross debt) was 67,524 kEUR, an increase of 4,349 kEUR compared to December 31, 2023.\n\nCash flow from operating activities for the second quarter of 2024 was 8,400 kEUR compared to 775 kEUR for the same period in 2023. Total cash out from capital expenditures for the second quarter of 2024 amounted to 8,459 kEUR.\n\nNet shareholders' equity at June 30, 2024 was 243,140 kEUR compared to 236,594 kEUR at December 31, 2023.\n\n2024 Guidance\n\nMrs. de Vet-Veithen concluded, \"Given the strength of our operational performance half-way through 2024 we believe that we are well on track to deliver the growth targets we set earlier. Accordingly, we continue to expect to report consolidated revenue for the full fiscal year 2024 within the 265,000 to 275,000 kEUR range we communicated earlier. We are also maintaining our Adjusted EBIT guidance of 11,000 kEUR to 14,000 kEUR for fiscal year 2024.\"\n\nNon-IFRS Measures\n\nMaterialise uses EBIT, EBITDA, Adjusted EBIT and Adjusted EBITDA as supplemental financial measures of its financial performance. EBIT is calculated as net profit plus income taxes, financial expenses (less financial income) and shares of profit or loss in a joint venture. EBITDA is calculated as net profit plus income taxes, financial expenses (less financial income), shares of profit or loss in a joint venture and depreciation and amortization. Adjusted EBIT and Adjusted EBITDA are determined by adding share-based compensation expenses, acquisition-related expenses of business combinations, impairments and revaluation of fair value due to business combinations to EBIT and EBITDA, respectively. Management believes these non-IFRS measures to be important measures as they exclude the effects of items which primarily reflect the impact of financing decisions and, in the case of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA, long term investment, rather than the performance of the company's day-to-day operations. The company also uses segment Adjusted EBITDA to evaluate the performance of its three business segments. As compared to net profit, these measures are limited in that they do not reflect the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments on the company's indebtedness and, in the case of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA, these measures are further limited in that they do not reflect the periodic costs of certain capitalized tangible and intangible assets used in generating revenues in the company's business, or the changes associated with impairments. Management evaluates such items through other financial measures such as financial expenses, capital expenditures and cash flow provided by operating activities. The company believes that these measurements are useful to measure a company's ability to grow or as a valuation measurement. The company's calculation of EBIT, EBITDA, Adjusted EBIT and Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. EBIT, EBITDA, Adjusted EBIT and Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered as alternatives to net profit or any other performance measure derived in accordance with IFRS. The company's presentation of EBIT, EBITDA, Adjusted EBIT and Adjusted EBITDA should not be construed to imply that its future results will be unaffected by unusual or non-recurring items.\n\nExchange Rate\n\nThis document contains translations of certain euro amounts into U.S. dollars at specified rates solely for the convenience of readers.

Our Environmental Services (ES) segment benefited from strong organic growth and the late March acquisition of HEPACO. Safety-Kleen Sustainability Solutions (SKSS) rebounded sequentially from the first quarter on improved base oil and lubricant pricing momentum. Our safety results for the quarter were consistent with the prior year as we achieved a YTD Total Recordable Incident Rate (TRIR) of 0.70.\"\n\nRevenues grew 11% to $1.55 billion compared with $1.40 billion in the same period of 2023. Income from operations increased 14% to $215.5 million compared with $189.8 million in the second quarter of 2023.\n\nNet income was $133.3 million, or $2.46 per diluted share, compared with $115.8 million, or $2.13 per diluted share, for the same period in 2023.\n\nAdjusted EBITDA (see description and reconciliation below) grew 14% to $327.8 million compared with $287.5 million in the same period of 2023.\n\nQ2 2024 Segment Review\n\n\"Our ES segment achieved a 12% increase in revenue and 18% growth in Adjusted EBITDA, leading to a 140-basis point year-over-year improvement in segment margin,\" said Eric Gerstenberg, Co-Chief Executive Officer. \"Field Services drove the revenue growth with a 64% increase, primarily reflecting the acquisition of HEPACO combined with strong organic growth in our legacy business. During the quarter, the HEPACO integration proceeded well, as evidenced by the HEPACO and legacy Field Services teams collaborating on several large emergency response events. Technical Services experienced 14% revenue growth compared to the second quarter of 2023 due to higher network volumes. Incineration utilization was 88% for the quarter, up from 84% in the same period a year ago. Average price in the incinerators was up 3%. Landfill tonnage increased 4% from Q2 2023, and the average landfill price per ton increased by 5%. Safety-Kleen Environmental Services continued its momentum with 11% revenue growth in the ES segment, driven by high demand for its core offerings. Our Industrial Services revenue declined by 10% due to reduced turnaround activity compared with Q2 of last year, particularly in the refinery space.\"\n\n\"Within SKSS, we rebounded from a challenging Q1 with profitable growth on a sequential basis,\" said Battles. \"Revenue in this segment grew 8% from the second quarter of 2023, driven by a 3% increase in volumes sold and our acquisition of Noble Oil in March. Profitability was modestly lower than a year ago. Our plants performed well in the quarter, and waste oil collections increased 5% to a record 67 million gallons.\"\n\nBusiness Outlook and Financial Guidance\n\n\"We enter the second half of 2024 with healthy demand and momentum in our core disposal, recycling and service businesses,\" Gerstenberg concluded. \"Within Environmental Services, we believe that our record backlog, healthy project pipeline, upcoming incinerator opening and steady demand for our broad suite of services positions us well for continued success. Our new Kimball, Nebraska incinerator is on track to begin processing hazardous waste in the fourth quarter of 2024. We also expect the HEPACO acquisition, which is off to a terrific start, to further bolster our Field Services business and emergency response capabilities, while providing numerous synergy opportunities. Within our SKSS segment, we expect to see stable performance in the coming quarters, despite the current demand environment for base oil. We plan to capitalize on initiatives like Group III production, higher blended sales and our new partnership with Castrol for its MoreCircular offering, which has the potential to lower the carbon footprints of fleets in the years ahead. Overall, we continue to maintain a favorable outlook for the Company for the remainder of the year. We expect to deliver an outstanding financial performance to shareholders in 2024 and are on track to achieve our Vision 2027 goals.\"\n\nIn the third quarter of 2024, Clean Harbors expects Adjusted EBITDA to grow 20% to 24% from the third quarter of 2023. For full-year 2024, Clean Harbors now expects:\n\nNon-GAAP Results\n\nClean Harbors reports Adjusted EBITDA, which is a non-GAAP financial measure and should not be considered an alternative to net income or other measurements under generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) but viewed only as a supplement to those measurements. Adjusted EBITDA is not calculated identically by all companies, and therefore the Company's measurement of Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. Clean Harbors believes that Adjusted EBITDA provides additional useful information to investors because the Company's management routinely evaluates the performance of its businesses based upon levels of Adjusted EBITDA, which excludes certain expenses relating to transactions not reflective of our core operations, and because the Company's loan covenants are based upon levels of Adjusted EBITDA achieved. The Company defines Adjusted EBITDA consistent with its existing revolving credit agreement, as described in the following reconciliation showing the differences between reported GAAP net income and Adjusted EBITDA for the three and six months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023 (in thousands, except percentages):\n\nAdjusted Free Cash Flow Reconciliation\n\nClean Harbors reports adjusted free cash flow, which is a non-GAAP financial measure that should not be considered an alternative to net cash from operating activities or other measurements under GAAP. The Company considers adjusted free cash flow to be a measurement of liquidity that provides useful information to investors about its ability to generate cash. The Company defines adjusted free cash flow as net cash from operating activities excluding cash impacts of items derived from non-operating activities, less additions to property, plant and equipment plus proceeds from sale and disposal of fixed assets. Adjusted free cash flow is not calculated identically by all companies, and therefore the Company's measurement of adjusted free cash flow may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies.\n\nAn itemized reconciliation between reported GAAP net cash from operating activities and adjusted free cash flow is as follows for the three and six months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023 (in thousands):\n\nAdjusted EBITDA Guidance Reconciliation\n\nAn itemized reconciliation between projected GAAP net income and projected Adjusted EBITDA is as follows (in millions):\n\nAdjusted Free Cash Flow Guidance Reconciliation\n\nAn itemized reconciliation between projected GAAP net cash from operating activities and projected adjusted free cash flow is as follows (in millions):\n\nConference Call Information\n\nClean Harbors will conduct a conference call for investors today at 9:00 a.m. (ET) to discuss the information contained in this press release.

Australia continues to produce strong results in 2024, for both Civeo-owned villages and integrated services. At the same time, as expected, our Canadian segment is facing headwinds with the wind down of LNG-related construction activity. Our near-term focus has been and will continue to be managing through the wildfire activity in northern Alberta, Canada. Our employees are working around-the-clock to ensure the safety of our guests, first responders and assets, and while this is a fluid situation, we are not currently expecting a material financial impact to Civeo, negative or positive.\"\n\nIn the second quarter of 2024, Civeo generated revenues of $188.7 million and reported net income of $8.2 million, or $0.56 per diluted share. During the second quarter of 2024, Civeo produced operating cash flow of $32.4 million, Adjusted EBITDA of $31.3 million and free cash flow of $30.9 million.\n\nBy comparison, in the second quarter of 2023, Civeo generated revenues of $178.8 million and reported net income of $4.5 million, or $0.30 per diluted share. During the same quarter, Civeo produced operating cash flow of $19.4 million, Adjusted EBITDA of $31.6 million and free cash flow of $12.9 million.\n\nThe year-over-year modest decrease in Adjusted EBITDA in the second quarter of 2024 was primarily driven by the expected wind-down of LNG-related Canadian mobile camp activity, including $1.4 million in mobile camp demobilization costs. This decrease was largely offset by increased billed rooms at the Canadian lodges and Australian owned-villages coupled with increased Australian integrated services revenues related to new business with existing clients.\n\nBusiness Segment Results\n\n(Unless otherwise noted, the following discussion compares the quarterly results for the second quarter of 2024 to the results for the second quarter of 2023.)\n\nCanada\n\nDuring the second quarter of 2024, the Canadian segment generated revenues of $79.5 million, operating income of $4.9 million and Adjusted EBITDA of $17.2 million, compared to revenues of $95.5 million, operating income of $3.2 million and Adjusted EBITDA of $19.8 million in the second quarter of 2023.\n\nThe Canadian segment experienced a 17% period-over-period decrease in revenues and a 13% decrease in Adjusted EBITDA driven by the anticipated wind-down of LNG-related mobile camp activity, including $1.4 million of mobile camp demobilization costs.\n\nAustralia\n\nDuring the second quarter of 2024, the Australian segment generated revenues of $108.6 million, operating income of $11.7 million and Adjusted EBITDA of $21.6 million, compared to revenues of $82.5 million, operating income of $9.2 million and Adjusted EBITDA of $19.6 million in the second quarter of 2023.\n\nRevenue from the Australian segment increased 32% period-over-period and Adjusted EBITDA was up 10% driven by a 6% year-over-year increase in billed rooms and increased integrated services activity from existing clients, building on a history of substantial multi-year growth.\n\nFinancial Condition and Capital Allocation\n\nAs of June 30, 2024, Civeo had total liquidity of approximately $159.0 million, consisting of $151.5 million available under its revolving credit facilities and $7.4 million of cash on hand.\n\nCiveo's total debt outstanding on June 30, 2024 was $47.5 million, a $31.1 million decrease since March 31, 2024. Civeo's net debt on June 30, 2024 was $40.1 million, a $21.8 million decrease since March 31, 2024.\n\nCiveo reported a net leverage ratio of 0.3x as of June 30, 2024.\n\nDuring the second quarter of 2024, Civeo invested $5.3 million in capital expenditures compared to $6.9 million invested during the second quarter of 2023. Capital expenditures in both periods were primarily related to maintenance spending on the Company's lodges and villages. Capital expenditures in the second quarter of 2024 also included $0.5 million related to customer-funded infrastructure upgrades at three Australian villages, compared to $0.8 million in the second quarter of 2023.\n\nThe Company announced today that its board of directors has declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.25 per common share, payable on September 16, 2024 to shareholders of record as of close of business on August 26, 2024. For purposes of the Income Tax Act (Canada), the Company has designated this dividend to be an \"eligible dividend\".\n\nIn the second quarter of 2024, Civeo repurchased approximately 274,000 shares through its share repurchase program for approximately $6.6 million.\n\nFull Year 2024 Guidance\n\nFor the full year of 2024, Civeo is maintaining its previously provided revenue and Adjusted EBITDA guidance ranges of $625 million to $700 million and $80 million to $90 million, respectively. The Company is also maintaining its full year 2024 capital expenditure guidance of $30 million to $35 million.\n\nConference Call\n\nCiveo will host a conference call to discuss its second quarter 2024 financial results today at 11:00 a.m. Eastern time.

Over the last three years, we have transformed the company into a high-value solutions provider that differentiates by leveraging software and cutting-edge technology,\" said Carey Smith, chair, president, and chief executive officer. This has resulted in another quarter of record revenue, profitability and cash flow, industry-leading organic revenue growth in both segments, improved win rates and a demonstrated ability to win larger contracts.\"\n\n\"We achieved over 20% organic growth for the fifth consecutive quarter and double-digit growth across all business units and geographies. We also announced a strategic acquisition that expands our customer base and strengthens our offensive cyber operations and electronic warfare, while adding new capabilities in the counterspace radio frequency domain at a time when near peer adversaries are becoming increasingly aggressive. We are excited about our future as we are well-positioned to take advantage of the tailwinds that are positively impacting both of our segments and six end-markets.\"\n\nSecond Quarter 2024 Results\n\nYear-over-Year Comparisons (Q2 2024 vs. Q2 2023)\n\nTotal revenue for the second quarter of 2024 increased by $314 million, or 23%, to $1.7 billion. This increase was primarily driven by organic growth of 22% due to the continued ramp-up on recent contract awards and execution on the company's backlog programs including significant growth from its critical infrastructure protection, cyber, and urban development markets. Operating income increased 46% to $111 million primarily due to the ramp-up of new and existing contracts. Net income increased 60% to $69 million. GAAP diluted earnings per share (EPS) attributable to Parsons was $0.63 in the second quarter of 2024, compared to $0.38 in the prior year period.\n\nAdjusted EBITDA including noncontrolling interests for the second quarter of 2024 was $150 million, a 27% increase over the prior year period. Adjusted EBITDA margin expanded 30 basis points to 9.0% in the second quarter of 2024, compared to 8.7% in the second quarter of 2023. The year-over-year adjusted EBITDA and margin increases were driven primarily by higher volume on margin accretive contracts, program execution, and a deliberate focus on indirect cost management. Adjusted EPS was $0.84 in the second quarter of 2024, compared to $0.63 in the second quarter of 2023. The year-over-year adjusted EPS increase was driven by the previously mentioned adjusted EBITDA increase noted above.\n\nSecond quarter 2024 Federal Solutions revenue increased $226 million, or 30%, compared to the prior year period due to organic growth of 27% and the contribution from the company's SealingTech acquisition. Organic growth was driven primarily by the ramp-up of recent contract wins and growth on existing contracts to include strength in the company's critical infrastructure protection and cyber markets.\n\nSecond quarter 2024 Federal Solutions adjusted EBITDA including noncontrolling interests increased by $17 million, or 20%. Adjusted EBITDA margin decreased to 10.4% from 11.2% in the prior year period as a result of the $20 million dollars in non-recurring incentive fees realized in Q2 2023. Excluding these incentive fees, Federal Solutions adjusted EBITDA margin would have increased by 160 basis points from the second quarter of 2023.\n\nSecond quarter 2024 Critical Infrastructure revenue increased $88 million, or 15% from the prior year period on both an organic and inorganic basis. Organic growth was driven by higher volume in the company's Middle East and North American infrastructure portfolios.\n\nSecond quarter 2024 adjusted EBITDA including noncontrolling interests increased by $15 million, or 46%, compared to the prior year period. Adjusted EBITDA margin increased 150 basis points to 7.0% from 5.5% in the prior year period. The adjusted EBITDA increases were driven by growth on accretive programs and improved operating performance.\n\nSecond Quarter 2024 Key Performance Indicators\n\nSignificant Contract Wins\n\nParsons continues to win new business across both segments and all six end markets. During the second quarter of 2024, the company won two single-award contracts worth more than $100 million each.\n\nAdditional Corporate Highlights\n\nParsons continues its successful track record of acquiring strategic companies in high-growth markets that broaden its portfolio and customer footprint. During the quarter, the company was recognized as a top three global industry leader for professional services by Engineering News-Record and received multiple awards for its sustainable practices and innovative solutions. Parsons was also recognized as one of the best places to work for new graduates.\n\nFiscal Year 2024 Guidance\n\nThe company is increasing its fiscal year 2024 revenue, adjusted EBITDA, and cash flow from operations guidance ranges to reflect its strong second quarter operating performance and its outlook for the remainder of the year. The table below summarizes the company's fiscal year 2024 guidance.\n\nNet income guidance is not presented as the company believes volatility associated with interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization and other matters affecting net income, including but not limited to one-time and nonrecurring events and impact of M&A, will preclude the company from providing accurate net income guidance for fiscal year 2024.\n\nConference Call Information\n\nParsons will host a conference call today, July 31, 2024, at 8:00 a.m. ET to discuss the financial results for its second quarter 2024.\n\nAccess to a webcast of the live conference call can be obtained through the Investor Relations section of the company's website (https://investors.parsons.com).

Numerous factors could cause actual future performance, results and events to differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements, including, among others: the impact of COVID-19; any issue that compromises our relationships with the U.S. federal government or its agencies or other state, local or foreign governments or agencies; any issues that damage our professional reputation; changes in governmental priorities that shift expenditures away from agencies or programs that we support; our dependence on long-term government contracts, which are subject to the government's budgetary approval process; the size of addressable markets and the amount of government spending on private contractors; failure by us or our employees to obtain and maintain necessary security clearances or certifications; failure to comply with numerous laws and regulations; changes in government procurement, contract or other practices or the adoption by governments of new laws, rules, regulations and programs in a manner adverse to us; the termination or nonrenewal of our government contracts, particularly our contracts with the U.S. government; our ability to compete effectively in the competitive bidding process and delays, contract terminations or cancellations caused by competitors' protests of major contract awards received by us; our ability to generate revenue under certain of our contracts; any inability to attract, train or retain employees with the requisite skills, experience and security clearances; the loss of members of senior management or failure to develop new leaders; misconduct or other improper activities from our employees or subcontractors; our ability to realize the full value of our backlog and the timing of our receipt of revenue under contracts included in backlog; changes in the mix of our contracts and our ability to accurately estimate or otherwise recover expenses, time and resources for our contracts; changes in estimates used in recognizing revenue; internal system or service failures and security breaches; and inherent uncertainties and potential adverse developments in legal proceedings including litigation, audits, reviews and investigations, which may result in material adverse judgments, settlements or other unfavorable outcomes. These factors are not exhaustive and additional factors could adversely affect our business and financial performance. For a discussion of additional factors that could materially adversely affect our business and financial performance, see the factors including under the caption \"Risk Factors\" in our Annual Report with the Securities and Exchange Commission pursuant to Section 13 or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, on Form 10-K, filed on February 14, 2024, and our other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.\n\nAll forward-looking statements are based on currently available information and speak only as of the date on which they are made. We assume no obligation to update any forward-looking statements made in this presentation that becomes untrue because of subsequent events, new information or otherwise, except to the extent we are required to do so in connection with our ongoing requirements under federal securities laws.\n\nNon-GAAP Financial Information\n\nThe tables under \"Parsons Corporation Inc. Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Measures\" present Adjusted Net Income attributable to Parsons Corporation, Adjusted Earnings per Share, Earnings before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization (\"EBITDA\"), Adjusted EBITDA, EBITDA Margin, and Adjusted EBITDA Margin, reconciled to their most directly comparable GAAP measure. These financial measures are calculated and presented on the basis of methodologies other than in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (\"Non-GAAP Measures\"). Parsons has provided these Non-GAAP Measures to adjust for, among other things, the impact of amortization expenses related to our acquisitions, costs associated with a loss or gain on the disposal or sale of property, plant and equipment, restructuring and related expenses, costs associated with mergers and acquisitions, software implementation costs, legal and settlement costs, and other costs considered non-operational in nature. These items have been Adjusted because they are not considered core to the company's business or otherwise not considered operational or because these charges are non-cash or non-recurring. The company presents these Non-GAAP Measures because management believes that they are meaningful to understanding Parsons's performance during the periods presented and the company's ongoing business. Non-GAAP Measures are not prepared in accordance with GAAP and therefore are not necessarily comparable to similarly titled metrics or the financial results of other companies. These Non-GAAP Measures should be considered a supplement to, not a substitute for, or superior to, the corresponding financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP.\n\nBook-to-Bill ratio is calculated as total contract awards divided by total revenue for the period.\n\n(a) Depreciation and amortization for the three and six months ended June 30, 2024, is $19.5 million and $39.3 million, respectively in the Federal Solutions Segment and $4.9 million and $9.7 million, respectively in the Critical Infrastructure Segment. Depreciation and amortization for the three and six months ended June 30, 2023, is $24.4 million and $48.4 million, respectively in the Federal Solutions Segment and $4.3 million and $8.6 million, respectively in the Critical Infrastructure Segment.\n\n(b) Reflects costs incurred in connection with acquisitions and other non-recurring transaction costs, primarily fees paid for professional services and employee retention.\n\n(c) Reflects costs associated with and related to our corporate restructuring initiatives.\n\n(d) Includes a combination of gain/loss related to sale of fixed assets, software implementation costs, and other individually insignificant items that are non-recurring in nature.\n\n(a) Reflects costs incurred in connection with acquisitions and other non-recurring transaction costs, primarily fees paid for professional services and employee retention.\n\n(b) Reflects costs associated with and related to our corporate restructuring initiatives.\n\n(c) Includes a combination of gain/loss related to sale of fixed assets, software implementation costs, and other individually insignificant items that are non-recurring in nature.\n\n(d) Excludes dilutive effect of convertible senior notes due 2025 due to bond hedge.", "source": {"uri": "wallstreet-online.de", "dataType": "news", "title": "wallstreet:online"},

With record quarterly revenue, the highest quarterly operating income in three years, a 190 basis point year-over-year expansion in Adjusted EBITDA margin rate, and $660 million in automotive new business awards \" including our first proprietary Puls.A\u2122 massage solution award, the Gentherm team continues to deliver solid results in this challenging environment.\n\nHe continued, Our Automotive Climate and Comfort Solutions revenue outperformed actual light vehicle production in our key markets by 500 basis points, fueled by double-digit growth in our Lumbar and Massage Comfort Solutions, validating our investment thesis for the strategic acquisition of Alfmeier.\n\nHe concluded, We continue to make significant strides in the development of our next generation technologies, including ClimateSense \u00ae, WellSense\u2122, and ComfortScale\u2122. Our second quarter automotive new business awards brought our year-to-date total to $1.2 billion. This momentum, and our continued progress on Fit-For-Growth 2.0, make us confident in our ability to reach high-teens Adjusted EBITDA margin rate over time.\n\n2024 Second Quarter Financial Review\n\nProduct revenues for the second quarter of 2024 increased by $3.4 million, or 0.9%, as compared with the prior-year period. Excluding the impact of foreign currency translation, product revenues increased 2.0% year over year.\n\nAutomotive revenues increased 0.7% year over year. Adjusting for foreign currency translation, phasing out the non-automotive electronics business as well as one-time benefits from recoveries in both periods, Automotive revenues increased 2.8% year over year. Revenues from Automotive Climate and Comfort Solutions increased 4.8% in the second quarter compared to the prior year period.\n\nAccording to S&P Global's mid-July report, actual light vehicle production decreased by 0.2% in the second quarter when compared with the same quarter of 2023 in the Company's key markets of North America, Europe, China, Japan, and Korea.\n\nGentherm Medical revenue increased 8.3% year over year, primarily as a result of higher Blanketrol \u00ae sales. Adjusting for the impact of foreign currency translation, Medical revenues increased 8.7%.\n\nSee the Revenues by Product Category and Reconciliation of Foreign Currency Translation Impact table included below for additional detail.\n\nGross margin rate increased to 25.7% in the current-year period, as compared with 23.6% in the prior-year period. The increase from the prior-year period was driven by Fit-for-Growth 2.0 initiatives including supplier cost reductions, value engineering activities, and net productivity at the factories as well the impact of our previously announced exit of the non-automotive electronics business. These were partially offset by annual price reductions and start-up costs from our new plants opening in Tangier, Morrocco and Monterrey, Mexico.\n\nNet research and development expenses of $21.9 million in the quarter decreased $2.8 million, or 11.5% over the prior-year period, primarily related to the reduction in resources allocated to certain battery performance solutions products and higher R&D reimbursements.\n\nSelling, general and administrative expenses of $39.4 million in the quarter increased $1.0 million, or 2.6%, versus the prior-year period. The year-over-year increase was primarily driven by higher compensation expenses.\n\nRestructuring expenses of $2.4 million in the current-year period increased $1.4 million, versus the prior-year period primarily as a result of discrete restructuring activities associated with the Company's Fit-for-Growth 2.0 initiatives and previously announced footprint optimization.\n\nAs described more fully in the Reconciliation of Net Income (Loss) to Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin table included below, the Company recorded Adjusted EBITDA of $49.9 million in the quarter compared with $42.4 million in the prior-year period, an increase of $7.5 million or 17.7%.\n\nIncome tax expense in the quarter was $9.5 million, as compared with $4.8 million in the prior-year period. The effective tax rate was approximately 34% in the quarter.\n\nGAAP diluted earnings per share for the quarter was $0.60 compared with a loss of $0.05 for the prior-year period. Adjusted diluted earnings per share, excluding restructuring expenses, non-cash purchase accounting impact, non-automotive electronics inventory benefit, unrealized currency gain, and other items specified on the table below, was $0.66. Adjusted diluted earnings per share in the prior-year period was $0.58.\n\nThe Company provides various non-GAAP financial measures in this release. See Use of Non-GAAP Measures below for additional information, including definitions, usefulness for investors and limitations, as well as reconciliations below to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures.\n\nGuidance\n\nThe Company's full-year 2024 guidance as of July 31, 2024 is shown below:\n\nConference Call\n\nAs previously announced, Gentherm will conduct a conference call today at 8:00 am Eastern Time to review these results.

These forward-looking statements represent Gentherm Incorporated's goals, beliefs, plans and expectations about its prospects for the future and other future events. The forward-looking statements included in this release are made as of the date hereof or as of the date specified herein and are based on management's reasonable expectations and beliefs. In making these statements we rely on assumptions and analysis based on our experience and perception of historical trends, current conditions and expected future developments, as well as other factors we consider appropriate under the circumstances. Such statements are subject to a number of important assumptions, significant risks and uncertainties (some of which are beyond our control) and other factors that may cause actual results or performance to differ materially from that described in or indicated by the forward-looking statements, including but not limited to:\n\nThe foregoing risks should be read in conjunction with the Company's reports filed with or furnished to the Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC), including Risk Factors, in its most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K and subsequent SEC filings, for a discussion of these and other risks and uncertainties. In addition, with reasonable frequency, we have entered into business combinations, acquisitions, divestitures, strategic investments and other significant transactions. Such forward-looking statements do not include the potential impact of any such transactions that may be completed after the date hereof, each of which may present material risks to the Company's future business and financial results.\n\nExcept as required by law, the Company expressly disclaims any obligation or undertaking to update any forward-looking statements to reflect any change in its expectations with regard thereto or any change in events, conditions or circumstances on which any such statement is based.\n\nUse of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\n\nIn addition to the results reported in accordance with GAAP throughout this release, the Company has provided here or elsewhere information regarding: adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (Adjusted EBITDA); Adjusted EBITDA margin; adjusted earnings per share (Adjusted earnings per share or Adjusted EPS); free cash flow; Net Debt, revenue, segment revenue and product revenue excluding foreign currency translation and other specified gains and losses; Automotive Climate and Comfort Solutions revenues; and adjusted operating expenses, each a non-GAAP financial measure. The Company defines Adjusted EBITDA as earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, deferred financing cost amortization, non-cash stock-based compensation expenses, and other gains and losses not reflective of the Company's ongoing operations and related tax effects including transaction expenses, debt retirement expenses, impairment of assets held for sale, impairment of goodwill, gain or loss on sale of business, restructuring expense, unrealized currency gain or loss and unrealized revaluation of derivatives. The Company defines Adjusted EBITDA margin as Adjusted EBITDA divided by product revenues. The Company defines Adjusted EPS as earnings adjusted by gains and losses not reflective of the Company's ongoing operations and related tax effects including transaction expenses, debt retirement expenses, impairment of assets held for sale, impairment of goodwill, gain or loss on sale of business, restructuring expense, unrealized currency gain or loss and unrealized revaluation of derivatives. The Company defines Free Cash Flow as Net cash provided by operating activities less Purchases of property and equipment. The Company defines Net Debt as the principal amount of all Consolidated Funded Indebtedness (as defined in the Credit Agreement) less cash and cash equivalents. The Company defines revenue, segment revenue or product revenue excluding foreign currency translation and other specified gains and losses as such revenue, excluding the estimated effects of foreign currency exchange on revenue by translating actual revenue using the prior period foreign currency exchange rates and excluding the other items specified in the reconciliation tables herein. The Company defines Automotive Climate and Comfort Solutions revenues as Automotive revenue excluding specified product revenues and the impact of non-automotive electronics and contract manufacturing electronics revenues. The Company defines adjusted operating expenses as operating expenses excluding impairment of intangible assets and property and equipment, restructuring, related non-cash stock-based compensation, acquisition, integration and divestiture expenses.\n\nThe Company's reconciliations are included in this release or can be found in the supplemental materials furnished as Exhibit 99.2 to the Company's Form 8-K dated July 31, 2024.\n\nIn evaluating its business, the Company considers and uses Free Cash Flow and Net Debt as supplemental measures of its liquidity and the other non-GAAP financial measures as supplemental measures of its operating performance. Management provides such non-GAAP financial measures so that investors will have the same financial information that management uses with the belief that it will assist investors in properly assessing the Company's performance on a period-over-period basis by excluding matters not indicative of the Company's ongoing operating or liquidity results and therefore enhance the comparability of the Company's results and provide additional information for analyzing trends in the business. In evaluating our non-GAAP financial measures, you should be aware that in the future we may incur revenues, expenses, and cash and non-cash obligations that are the same as or similar to some of the adjustments in our presentation of non-GAAP financial measures. Our presentation of non-GAAP financial measures should not be construed as an inference that our future results will be unaffected by unusual or non-recurring items. There also can be no assurance that we will not modify the presentation of our non-GAAP financial measures in the future, and any such modification may be material. Other companies in our industry may define and calculate these non-GAAP financial measures differently than we do and those calculations may not be comparable to our metrics. These non-GAAP measures have limitations as analytical tools, and when assessing the Company's operating performance or liquidity, investors should not consider these non-GAAP measures in isolation, or as a substitute for net income (loss), revenue or other consolidated income statement or cash flow statement data prepared in accordance with GAAP.\n\nNon-GAAP measures referenced in this release and other public communications may include estimates of future Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA margin and Adjusted EPS. The Company has not reconciled the non-GAAP forward-looking guidance included in this release to the most directly comparable GAAP measures because this cannot be done without unreasonable effort due to the variability and low visibility with respect to taxes and non-recurring items, which are potential adjustments to future earnings. We expect the variability of these items to have a potentially unpredictable, and a potentially significant, impact on our future GAAP financial results.", "source": {"uri": "uk.investing.com",

Interim financial figures are unaudited. This press release includes certain non-IFRS alternative performance measures such as Adjusted EBITDA, Cash Operating Income, Net Cash, Free Cash Flow, Adjusted Net Income, Adjusted Equity Holders' Net Income and Adjusted Earnings per ADS. The reconciliation of these figures to the most directly comparable IFRS measures is included in Exhibit I.\n\nAmerican Depositary Share. Each ADS represents 10 shares of Ternium's common stock. Results are based on a weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding (net of treasury shares) of 1,963,076,776.\n\nSecond Quarter of 2024 Highlights\n\nTernium's Adjusted EBITDA reached $545 million in the period on Adjusted EBITDA Margin of 12%, with a relatively weak pricing environment in Ternium's main steel markets. Adjusted EBITDA decreased sequentially in the second quarter mainly reflecting lower realized steel prices and a slight increase in costs, as steel shipments remained relatively stable.\n\nThe company recorded in the second quarter of 2024 a $783 million provision for ongoing litigation related to the acquisition of a participation in Usiminas in 2012 as a result of an adverse Brazilian court decision issued in June 2024. Ternium believes that such decision is contrary to applicable substantive and procedural law; consequently, it plans to vigorously defend its position, which has been confirmed by a long line of precedents and court decisions, and file all motions and appeals available to it. For more information, see note 13(i) \"Tax claims and other contingencies - Provision for ongoing litigation in process related to the acquisition of a participation in Usiminas\" included in the company's Consolidated Condensed Interim Financial Statements as of June 30, 2024.\n\nIn the second quarter of 2024, Ternium had a net loss of $743 million. Net of the aforementioned provision, Adjusted Net Income in the second quarter was $40 million, including a deferred tax loss for an amount of $183 million.\n\nIn May 2024, Ternium paid a dividend of $432 million to the company's shareholders, corresponding to the remaining of the total dividend declared for the year 2023. Capital expenditures in the period amounted to $409 million as Ternium progressed with its expansion programs in Mexico and with its new wind farm in Argentina. Despite this demanding capital allocation, net cash position as of the end of June 2024 was $1.9 billion, a slight decrease compared to net cash position of $2.0 billion as of the end of March. Strong cash provided by operating activities of $656 million and a $160 million increase in the fair value of financial instruments contributed to maintain Ternium's solid financial position as of the end of the second quarter.\n\nSteel shipments in the second quarter of 2024 increased in Brazil and the Southern Region. Such increases, however, were offset by a slight decrease in sales volumes in Mexico and lower shipments in Other Markets.\n\nIn Mexico, steel demand from automotive manufacturers continued growing during the second quarter, reflecting the positive momentum of this industry. On the other hand, activity in the Mexican commercial steel market was negatively affected by a downward trend in steel prices. Furthermore, customer demand in the home appliances and HVAC sectors softened in the period, reflecting a relatively sluggish construction market in North America in a context of high interest rates.\n\nIn Brazil, there was a pick-up in steel demand in the second quarter, particularly in the automotive and industrial sectors. However, imports of steel products remained high, with a significant year-over-year expansion in the first half of 2024.\n\nIn the Southern Region, steel demand in the second quarter reflected improving conditions in the Argentine market, as industrial customer demand and the commercial market showed a gradual recovery.\n\nOutlook\n\nTernium expects a sequential decline in adjusted EBITDA for the third quarter of 2024, primarily attributed to reduced margins partially offset by an increase in shipments across key markets. The company anticipates a drop in realized steel prices, largely as a result of the reset of quarterly and six-months contract prices in Mexico.\n\nThe company expects consistent demand in Mexico's industrial and commercial markets, with supply chain stocks at manageable levels. The automotive industry continues to grow and the construction sector is enjoying an upswing in investment from nearshoring activities, leading to the establishment of new factories and a growing need for warehousing and logistics facilities.\n\nIn Brazil, Ternium anticipates a modest rise in shipments, supported by the automotive industry's projected growth and better activity in the construction sector. On the other hand, despite the recent establishment of a quota system to regulate steel imports in the country, imports during the second quarter remained elevated.\n\nIn Argentina, Ternium expects shipments to increase in the third quarter of 2024 after a destocking process in the second quarter, although the pace of the recovery remains uncertain.\n\nNote: other products include mainly electricity sales in Mexico and Brazil.\n\nAdjusted EBITDA in the second quarter of 2024 equals Net Income adjusted to exclude:\n\nAnd adjusted to include the proportional EBITDA in Unigal (70% participation).\n\nAdjusted EBITDA Margin equals Adjusted EBITDA divided by net sales. For more information see Exhibit I - Alternative performance measures - \"Adjusted EBITDA\".\n\nSteel Segment\n\nThe Steel Segment net sales were down sequentially in the second quarter of 2024, mostly as a result of decreasing realized steel prices in Ternium's main steel markets. On a year-over-year basis, the consolidation of Usiminas added $1.1 billion to steel segment net sales and 1.0 million tons to steel product shipments.\n\nSteel products shipments in Mexico were slightly down sequentially in the second quarter, as the strength of Mexican automotive industry was offset by soft demand in the home appliances and HVAC sectors. In addition, the company's value chain was subject to disruptions caused by a tropical storm in June. Activity in Mexican commercial market remained affected by a downward trend in steel prices.\n\nIn Brazil, shipments in the second quarter reflected a widespread pick-up in steel demand. On a year-over-year basis, sales volumes increased 0.9 million tons due to the consolidation of Usiminas.\n\nIn the Southern Region, steel shipments in the quarter showed certain sequential recovery mainly as a result of a gradual improvement in the Argentine market.\n\nSteel revenue per ton in the second quarter of 2024 decreased sequentially and on a year-over-year basis, reflecting a weak pricing environment in Ternium's main steel markets. Particularly in North America, reference spot prices for hot-rolled flat products decreased to levels close to the lowest recorded in the last 12 months.\n\nCash Operating Income equals Operating Income adjusted to exclude depreciation and amortization as well as certain other non-cash and/or non-recurring items. The steel segment's Cash Operating Income per Ton and Margin equal the steel segment's Cash Operating Income divided by Steel Segment's Shipments and Net Sales, respectively. For more information see Exhibit I - Alternative performance measures - \"Cash Operating Income - Steel Segment\".\n\nTernium recorded sequentially lower steel segment Cash Operating Income per Ton and Margin in the second quarter of 2024. Reported ratios were negatively impacted by a decrease in realized steel prices in Ternium's main steel markets. In addition, cost per ton in the second quarter increased slightly compared to cost per ton in the prior quarter.\n\nMining revenue per ton in the second quarter of 2024 remained stable sequentially, as higher realized iron ore prices were offset by a lower participation of higher-priced pellets in the sales mix. Iron ore price volatility remained high in the first half of 2024, with reference prices reaching a 12-month peak early in January and then falling to near the lowest level recorded in the last 12 months.\n\nCash Operating Income equals Operating Income adjusted to exclude depreciation and amortization as well as certain other non-cash and/or non-recurring items. The mining segment Cash Operating Income per Ton and Cash Operating Income Margin equal the mining segment's Cash Operating Income divided by its Shipments and Net Sales, respectively. For more information see Exhibit I - Alternative performance measures - \"Cash Operating Income - Mining Segment\".\n\nThe mining segment's Cash Operating Income per Ton and Margin increased sequentially in the second quarter of 2024, mainly as result of higher iron ore prices partially offset by a lower participation of higher-margin iron ore pellets in the sales mix.\n\nIn the second quarter of 2024, Adjusted Net Income equaled the period's Net Loss adjusted to exclude a $783 million provision for ongoing litigation related to the acquisition of a participation in Usiminas. In the third quarter of 2023, Adjusted Net Income equaled the period's Net Loss adjusted to exclude a loss of $1.1 billion in connection with an increase in the participation in Usiminas in such quarter. Adjusted Earnings (Losses) per ADS equaled each period's Adjusted Equity Holders' Net Result divided by 1,963 million outstanding shares of Ternium's common stock, net of treasury shares, expressed in ADS equivalent (each ADS represents 10 shares).\n\nNet Loss and Adjusted Net Income in the second quarter of 2024 included a deferred tax loss of $183 million.\n\nTernium's net cash position decreased slightly in the second quarter, to $1.9 billion as of June 30, 2024.\n\nDuring the period, Ternium paid a dividend to shareholders of $432 million, corresponding to the remaining of the dividend declared for the year 2023, for a total of $648 million.\n\nIn the second quarter, cash used in Ternium's capital expenditures program and for the dividend payment was largely offset mainly by cash provided by operating activities and a $160 million increase in the fair value of financial instruments.\n\nThese non-IFRS measures should not be considered in isolation of, or as a substitute for, measures of performance prepared in accordance with IFRS. These non-IFRS measures do not have a standardized meaning under IFRS and, therefore, may not correspond to similar non-IFRS financial measures reported by other companies.\n\nAdjusted

Adjusted operating income margin excluding special items was 22.0%, up approximately 370 basis points year over year.\n\nHowmet Aerospace Executive Chairman and Chief Executive Officer John Plant said, \"In the second quarter 2024, the Howmet Aerospace team drove another very strong set of results, again exceeding the high end of guidance on all fronts. Revenue grew a healthy 14% year over year, with commercial aerospace revenue up 27%, continuing a strong trend. For the second consecutive quarter, Howmet achieved record quarterly results in revenue, adjusted EBITDA*, adjusted EBITDA margin* and adjusted earnings per share*. Adjusted EBITDA margin* of 25.7% was up approximately 340 basis points year over year, and adjusted earnings per share* grew 52%.\"\n\nMr. Plant continued, \"The outlook for commercial aerospace continues to be robust, with strong travel demand and an aging aircraft fleet, leading to an extremely high backlog at the aircraft OEMs. The issue faced by Howmet Aerospace continues to be the aircraft manufacturers' ability to build and deliver aircraft on a consistent basis. We continue to take these factors into account in our guidance. Despite these challenges, we are again raising full year 2024 guidance above the second quarter 2024 beat, reflecting strong continued performance at Howmet Aerospace.\"\n\n\"Howmet Aerospace generated very healthy free cash flow of $342 million in the second quarter 2024 and $437 million in the first half 2024, which enabled the Company to redeem the remaining $205 million of our notes due in October 2024 and $23 million of our notes due in May 2025, and repurchase $210 million of common stock year to date. We are pleased that the Board of Directors approved a 60% increase in the common stock dividend to $0.08 per share for the third quarter 2024. Moreover, the Board of Directors approved the establishment of a 2025 dividend policy on common stock of 15% plus or minus 5% of net income excluding special items. Finally, the Board of Directors authorized an increase in the share repurchase program by $2 billion to $2.487 billion, reflecting the Company's strong free cash flow outlook.\"\n\n*\n\nExcluding special items\n\nSecond Quarter 2024 Segment Performance\n\nEngine Products\n\n(in U.S. dollar millions)\n\nQ2 2023\n\nQ3 2023\n\nQ4 2023\n\nQ1 2024\n\nQ2 2024\n\nThird-party sales\n\n$ 821\n\n$ 798\n\n$ 852\n\n$ 885\n\n$ 933\n\nInter-segment sales\n\n$ 5\n\n$ 5\n\n$ 1\n\n$ 2\n\n$ 1\n\nProvision for depreciation and amortization\n\n$ 32\n\n$ 33\n\n$ 33\n\n$ 33\n\n$ 33\n\nSegment Adjusted EBITDA\n\n$ 223\n\n$ 219\n\n$ 233\n\n$ 249\n\n$ 292\n\nSegment Adjusted EBITDA Margin\n\n27.2 %\n\n27.4 %\n\n27.3 %\n\n28.1 %\n\n31.3 %\n\nRestructuring and other credits\n\n$ (1)\n\n$ --\n\n$ (1)\n\n$ --\n\n$ (1)\n\nCapital expenditures\n\n$ 21\n\n$ 30\n\n$ 28\n\n$ 55\n\n$ 33\n\nEngine Products reported revenue of $933 million, an increase of 14% year over year, due to growth in the commercial aerospace, defense aerospace, oil & gas, and industrial gas turbine markets.

In addition, there is inherent variability already included in the GAAP measures, including, but not limited to, price/mix and volume. Howmet Aerospace believes such reconciliations would imply a degree of precision that would be confusing or misleading to investors.\n\nHowmet Aerospace will hold its quarterly conference call at 10:00 AM Eastern Time on Tuesday, July 30, 2024.

Management believes that this measure is meaningful to investors because Total Segment Adjusted EBITDA provides additional information with respect to the Company's operating performance and the Company's ability to meet its financial obligations. The Total Segment Adjusted EBITDA presented may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies. Howmet's definition of Total Segment Adjusted EBITDA (Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization) is net margin plus an add-back for depreciation and amortization. Net margin is equivalent to Sales minus the following items: Cost of goods sold; Selling, general administrative, and other expenses; Research and development expenses; and Provision for depreciation and amortization. Special items, including Restructuring and other charges, are excluded from net margin and Segment Adjusted EBITDA.

Management believes that this measure is meaningful to investors because management reviews cash flows generated from operations after taking into consideration capital expenditures (due to the fact that these expenditures are considered necessary to maintain and expand the Company's asset base and are expected to generate future cash flows from operations). It is important to note that Free cash flow does not represent the residual cash flow available for discretionary expenditures since other non-discretionary expenditures, such as mandatory debt service requirements, are not deducted from the measure.\n\nHowmet Aerospace Inc. and subsidiaries\n\nCalculation of Financial Measures (unaudited), continued\n\n(in U.S. dollar millions, except per-share and share amounts)\n\nReconciliation of Net income excluding Special items\n\nQuarter ended\n\nSix months ended\n\n2Q23\n\n1Q24\n\n2Q24\n\nJune 30, 2023\n\nJune 30, 2024\n\nNet income\n\n$\n\n193\n\n$\n\n243\n\n$\n\n266\n\n$\n\n341\n\n$\n\n509\n\nDiluted earnings per share (EPS)\n\n$\n\n0.46\n\n$\n\n0.59\n\n$\n\n0.65\n\n$\n\n0.81\n\n$\n\n1.23\n\nSpecial items:\n\nRestructuring and other charges (1)\n\n3\n\n--\n\n22\n\n4\n\n22\n\nLoss on debt redemption and related costs\n\n--\n\n--\n\n--\n\n1\n\n--\n\nPlant fire reimbursements, net\n\n(4\n\n)\n\n--\n\n(6\n\n)\n\n--\n\n(6\n\n)\n\nCollective bargaining agreement negotiations\n\n7\n\n--\n\n--\n\n7\n\n--\n\nSettlement from legal proceeding (2)\n\n(24\n\n)\n\n--\n\n--\n\n(24\n\n)\n\n--\n\nCosts associated with closures, supply chain disruptions, and other items\n\n9\n\n1\n\n--\n\n10\n\n1\n\nSubtotal: Pre-tax special items\n\n(9\n\n)\n\n1\n\n16\n\n(2\n\n)\n\n17\n\nTax impact of Pre-tax special items (3)\n\n2\n\n--\n\n--\n\n1\n\n--\n\nSubtotal\n\n(7\n\n)\n\n1\n\n16\n\n(1\n\n)\n\n17\n\nDiscrete and other tax special items (4)\n\n(5\n\n)\n\n(6\n\n)\n\n(6\n\n)\n\n16\n\n(12\n\n)\n\nTotal: After-tax special items\n\n(12\n\n)\n\n(5\n\n)\n\n10\n\n15\n\n5\n\nNet income excluding Special items\n\n$\n\n181\n\n$\n\n238\n\n$\n\n276\n\n$\n\n356\n\n$\n\n514\n\nDiluted EPS excluding Special items\n\n$\n\n0.44\n\n$\n\n0.57\n\n$\n\n0.67\n\n$\n\n0.85\n\n$\n\n1.25\n\nAverage number of shares - diluted EPS excluding Special items\n\n417\n\n412\n\n411\n\n417\n\n411\n\nNet income excluding Special items and Diluted EPS excluding Special items are non-GAAP financial measures.

Net income in the second quarter of 2024 was lower compared to the prior quarter primarily due to lower sales of Methanex-produced methanol and the negative impact of the mark-to-market portion of share-based compensation due to changes in Methanex's share price, offset by a higher average realized price and by the one-time impact of the cost of the ineffective portion of natural gas hedges at our Geismar site recognized during the first quarter of 2024. Adjusted EBITDA for the second quarter of 2024 was $164 million and Adjusted net income was $42 million ($0.62 Adjusted net income per common share).

Reports Second Quarter 2024 Results", "body": "Caesars Digital Adjusted EBITDA of $40 million versus $11 million for the comparable prior-year period.\n\nTom Reeg, Chief Executive Officer of Caesars Entertainment, Inc., commented, \"On a consolidated basis, the Company generated $1 billion of Adjusted EBITDA. Our operating results reflect year over year growth in Adjusted EBITDA in our Las Vegas segment driven by record same store revenues, hotel occupancy and Average Daily Rate (ADR). Our Caesars Digital segment posted a new second-quarter Adjusted EBITDA record, driven by strong revenue growth and solid flow through. Regional segment results reflect competition in new markets partially offset by our temporary facility in Danville, Virginia and our property in Columbus, Nebraska. We remain optimistic for the balance of 2024 driven by strong operating trends in our Las Vegas and Caesars Digital segments and the expected openings of the permanent facility in Danville coupled with our $430 million capital investment in our newly rebranded Caesars New Orleans property.\"\n\nSecond Quarter 2024 Financial Results Summary and Segment Information\n\nAfter adjusting for the effects of our completed divestiture, the following tables present adjustments to net revenues, net income (loss) and Adjusted EBITDA as reported, in order to reflect a same-store basis:\n\nBalance Sheet and Liquidity\n\nAs of June 30, 2024, Caesars had $12.4 billion in aggregate principal amount of debt outstanding. Total cash and cash equivalents were $830 million, excluding restricted cash of $129 million.\n\nAs of June 30, 2024, our cash on hand and borrowing capacity was as follows:\n\n\"Our debt reduction plan continued in the second quarter, with Term Loan B repayments of over $100 million. We continue to forecast 2024 full year capital expenditures of $800 million, excluding our Danville project which is funded within the joint venture,\" said Bret Yunker, Chief Financial Officer.\n\nReconciliation of GAAP Measures to Non-GAAP Measures\n\nAdjusted EBITDA (described below), a non-GAAP financial measure, has been presented as a supplemental disclosure because it is a widely used measure of performance and basis for valuation of companies in our industry and we believe that this non-GAAP supplemental information will be helpful in understanding our ongoing operating results. Management has historically used Adjusted EBITDA when evaluating operating performance because we believe that the inclusion or exclusion of certain recurring and non-recurring items is necessary to provide a full understanding of our core operating results and as a means to evaluate period-to-period results. Adjusted EBITDA represents net income (loss) before interest income and interest expense, net of interest capitalized, (benefit) provision for income taxes, depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation expense, (gain) loss on extinguishment of debt, impairment charges, other (income) loss, net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests, transaction costs associated with our acquisitions, developments and divestitures, and non-cash changes in equity method investments. Adjusted EBITDA also excludes the expense associated with certain of our leases as these transactions were accounted for as financing obligations and the associated expense is included in interest expense. Adjusted EBITDA is not a measure of performance or liquidity calculated in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (\"GAAP\"). Adjusted EBITDA is unaudited and should not be considered an alternative to, or more meaningful than, net income (loss) as an indicator of our operating performance. Uses of cash flows that are not reflected in Adjusted EBITDA include capital expenditures, interest payments, income taxes, debt principal repayments, and payments under our leases with affiliates of GLPI and VICI Properties, Inc., which can be significant. As a result, Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered as a measure of our liquidity. Other companies that provide EBITDA information may calculate Adjusted EBITDA differently than we do. The definition of Adjusted EBITDA may not be the same as the definitions used in any of our debt agreements.\n\nConference Call Information\n\nThe Company will host a conference call to discuss its results on July 30, 2024 at 2:30 p.m. Pacific Time, 5:30 p.m. Eastern Time.

Despite these challenges, we are again raising full year 2024 guidance above the second quarter 2024 beat, reflecting strong continued performance at Howmet Aerospace.\"\n\n\"Howmet Aerospace generated very healthy free cash flow of $342 million in the second quarter 2024 and $437 million in the first half 2024, which enabled the Company to redeem the remaining $205 million of our notes due in October 2024 and $23 million of our notes due in May 2025, and repurchase $210 million of common stock year to date.

Through the first half 2024, the Company repurchased $210 million of common stock at an average price of $70.52 per share, retiring approximately 3.0 million shares.\n\nBoard of Directors Approved Share Repurchase Program Authorization Increase to $2.487 Billion\n\nOn July 30, 2024, the Board of Directors authorized an increase in the Company's share repurchase program by $2 billion, which, together with the remaining authorization of $487 million, results in authorization to repurchase up to $2.487 billion of the Company's outstanding common stock. There is no stated expiration, and the Company is not obligated to repurchase any specific number of shares.\n\nQuarterly Common Stock Dividend Increased 60% to $0.08 Per Share in Third Quarter 2024\n\nOn July 30, 2024, the Board of Directors declared a dividend of $0.08 per share on its common stock to be paid on August 26, 2024 to holders of record as of the close of business on August 9, 2024.

Under its share repurchase program, the Company may repurchase shares from time to time, in amounts, at prices, and at such times as the Company deems appropriate, subject to market conditions, legal requirements and other considerations. The Company is not obligated to repurchase any specific number of shares or to do so at any particular time. The declaration of any future dividends is subject to the discretion and approval of the Board of Directors after the Board's consideration of all factors it deems relevant and subject to applicable law. The Company may modify, suspend, or cancel its share repurchase program or its dividend policy in any manner and at any time that it may deem necessary or appropriate. Credit ratings are not a recommendation to buy or hold any Howmet Aerospace securities, and they may be revised or revoked at any time at the sole discretion of the credit rating organizations. The statements in this release are made as of the date of this release, even if subsequently made available by Howmet Aerospace on its website or otherwise. Howmet Aerospace disclaims any intention or obligation to update publicly any forward-looking statements, whether in response to new information, future events, or otherwise, except as required by applicable law.\n\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\n\nSome of the information included in this release is derived from Howmet Aerospace's consolidated financial information but is not presented in Howmet Aerospace's financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP). Certain of these data are considered \"non-GAAP financial measures\" under SEC rules. These non-GAAP financial measures supplement our GAAP disclosures and should not be considered an alternative to the GAAP measure. Reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures and management's rationale for the use of the non-GAAP financial measures can be found in the schedules to this release.\n\nOther Information\n\nIn this press release, the acronym \"FY\" means \"full year\" and \"Q\" means \"quarter\"; and references to Howmet Aerospace performance that is \"record\" means its best result since April 1, 2020 when Howmet Aerospace Inc. (previously named Arconic Inc.) separated from Arconic Corporation.\n\nTotal Segment Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure. Management believes that this measure is meaningful to investors because Total Segment Adjusted EBITDA provides additional information with respect to the Company's operating performance and the Company's ability to meet its financial obligations. The Total Segment Adjusted EBITDA presented may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies. Howmet's definition of Total Segment Adjusted EBITDA (Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization) is net margin plus an add-back for depreciation and amortization. Net margin is equivalent to Sales minus the following items: Cost of goods sold; Selling, general administrative, and other expenses; Research and development expenses; and Provision for depreciation and amortization. Special items, including Restructuring and other charges, are excluded from net margin and Segment Adjusted EBITDA. Differences between the total segment and consolidated totals are in Corporate.\n\nThe Accounts Receivable Securitization program remains unchanged at $250 outstanding.\n\nFree cash flow is a non-GAAP financial measure. Management believes that this measure is meaningful to investors because management reviews cash flows generated from operations after taking into consideration capital expenditures (due to the fact that these expenditures are considered necessary to maintain and expand the Company's asset base and are expected to generate future cash flows from operations). It is important to note that Free cash flow does not represent the residual cash flow available for discretionary expenditures since other non-discretionary expenditures, such as mandatory debt service requirements, are not deducted from the measure.\n\nNet income excluding Special items and Diluted EPS excluding Special items are non-GAAP financial measures. Management believes that these measures are meaningful to investors because management reviews the operating results of the Company excluding the impacts of Restructuring and other charges, Discrete tax items, and Other special items (collectively, \"Special items\"). There can be no assurances that additional Special items will not occur in future periods. To compensate for this limitation, management believes that it is appropriate to consider both Net income and Diluted EPS determined under GAAP as well as Net income excluding Special items and Diluted EPS excluding Special items.\n\nOperational tax rate is a non-GAAP financial measure. Management believes that this measure is meaningful to investors because management reviews the operating results of the Company excluding the impacts of Special items. There can be no assurances that additional Special items will not occur in future periods. To compensate for this limitation, management believes that it is appropriate to consider both the Effective tax rate determined under GAAP as well as the Operational tax rate.\n\nAdjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA excluding Special items, Adjusted EBITDA margin excluding Special items, Third-party sales, and Incremental margin are non-GAAP financial measures. Management believes that these measures are meaningful to investors because they provide additional information with respect to the Company's operating performance and the Company's ability to meet its financial obligations. The Adjusted EBITDA presented may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies. The Company's definition of Adjusted EBITDA (Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization) is net margin plus an add-back for depreciation and amortization. Net margin is equivalent to Sales minus the following items: Cost of goods sold, Selling, general administrative, and other expenses, Research and development expenses, and Provision for depreciation and amortization. Special items, including Restructuring and other charges, are excluded from Adjusted EBITDA.\n\nAdjusted operating income excluding Special items and Adjusted operating income margin excluding Special items are non-GAAP financial measures. Management believes that these measures are meaningful to investors because management reviews the operating results of the Company excluding the impacts of Special items. There can be no assurances that additional Special items will not occur in future periods. To compensate for this limitation, management believes that it is appropriate to consider both Operating income determined under GAAP as well as Operating income excluding Special items.", "source": {"uri": "wallstreet-online.de", "dataType": "news", "title": "wallstreet:online"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Howmet_Aerospace", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Howmet Aerospace"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dividend_policy", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dividend policy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aerospace", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Aerospace"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_stock", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Common stock"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earnings_before_interest_and_taxes", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Earnings before interest and taxes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basis_point", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Basis point"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Net_income", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Net income"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earnings_before_interest,_taxes,_depreciation,_and_amortization", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dividend", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dividend"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gas_turbine", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Gas turbine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_cash_flow", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Free cash flow"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fossil_fuel", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Fossil fuel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Share_repurchase", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Share repurchase"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earnings_per_share", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Earnings per share"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chairperson", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chairperson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Productivity", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Productivity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barrel", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Barrel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aluminium", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Aluminium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revenue", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Revenue"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pittsburgh"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Pittsburgh"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arconic", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Arconic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Funds", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Funds", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/Cash_Flow", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/Cash Flow", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance/Investing", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance/Investing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Guides", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Guides", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://assets.wallstreet-online.de/_media/6/source1280/size_645/businesswire-1280.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9774674", "eventUri": "eng-9774674", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-30", "textStart": 8262, "textEnd": 8269}, {"amb": false, "date": "2020-04-01", "textStart": 15094, "textEnd": 15107}], "sentiment": 0.3647058823529412, "wgt": 148, "relevance": 1}

As we look forward, our more flexible cost structure can better adjust to demand volatility as we support internal combustion, hybrid, and electric-vehicle propulsion technologies across all mobility markets.\"\n\nSales for the second quarter of 2024 totaled $2.74 billion, compared with $2.75 billion in the same period of 2023.\n\nAdjusted EBITDA for the second quarter of 2024 was $244 million or 8.9 percent of sales, compared with $243 million or 8.8 percent of sales for the same period in 2023. Company-wide efficiency improvements continue to offset the margin impact of inflation and spending on development for electric-vehicle products.\n\nOperating cash flow in the second quarter of 2024 was $215 million, compared with $256 million in the same period of 2023. Free cash flow was $104 million, $30 million lower than the second quarter of 2023 due to the timing of working capital requirements.\n\n\"While our outlook for sales is lower due to weakening demand for electric vehicles and in some of our traditional markets, Dana is maintaining guidance for Adjusted EBITDA, while raising profit margin and again increasing the free-cash-flow range,\" said Timothy Kraus, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. \"As we look to the second half of the year, we anticipate company-wide cost management and production efficiencies will continue to offset the impact of softer end-market demand, and lower capital requirements will drive higher free cash flow.\"\n\nRevised 2024 Financial Targets\n\nDana to Host Conference Call at 9 a.m., Wednesday, July 31\n\nDana will discuss its second-quarter results in a conference call at 9 a.m. EDT on Wednesday, July 31. The conference call can be accessed by telephone from both domestic and international locations using the information provided below:\n\nConference ID: 9943139\n\nParticipant Toll-Free Dial-In Number: 1 (888) 440-5873\n\nParticipant Toll Dial-In Number: 1 (646) 960-0319\n\nAudio streaming and slides will be available online via a link provided on the Dana investor website: www.dana.com/investors. Phone registration will be available beginning at 8:30 a.m. EDT.\n\nA webcast replay can be accessed via Dana's investor website following the call.\n\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\n\nAdjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure which we have defined as net income (loss) before interest, income taxes, depreciation, amortization, equity grant expense, restructuring expense, non-service cost components of pension and other postretirement benefit costs and other adjustments not related to our core operations (gain/loss on debt extinguishment, pension settlements, divestitures, impairment, etc.). Adjusted EBITDA is a measure of our ability to maintain and continue to invest in our operations and provide shareholder returns. We use adjusted EBITDA in assessing the effectiveness of our business strategies, evaluating and pricing potential acquisitions and as a factor in making incentive compensation decisions. In addition to its use by management, we also believe adjusted EBITDA is a measure widely used by securities analysts, investors and others to evaluate financial performance of our company relative to other Tier 1 automotive suppliers. Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered a substitute for earnings (loss) before income taxes, net income (loss) or other results reported in accordance with GAAP. Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies.\n\nAdjusted net income (loss) attributable to the parent company is a non-GAAP financial measure which we have defined as net income (loss) attributable to the parent company, excluding any discrete income tax items, restructuring charges, amortization expense and other adjustments not related to our core operations (as used in adjusted EBITDA), net of any associated income tax effects. This measure is considered useful for purposes of providing investors, analysts and other interested parties with an indicator of ongoing financial performance that provides enhanced comparability to net income (loss) attributable to the parent company reported by other companies. Adjusted net income (loss) attributable to the parent company is neither intended to represent nor be an alternative measure to net income (loss) attributable to the parent company reported in accordance with GAAP.\n\nDiluted adjusted EPS is a non-GAAP financial measure which we have defined as adjusted net income (loss) attributable to the parent company divided by adjusted diluted shares. We define adjusted diluted shares as diluted shares as determined in accordance with GAAP based on adjusted net income (loss) attributable to the parent company. This measure is considered useful for purposes of providing investors, analysts and other interested parties with an indicator of ongoing financial performance that provides enhanced comparability to EPS reported by other companies. Diluted adjusted EPS is neither intended to represent nor be an alternative measure to diluted EPS reported in accordance with GAAP.\n\nFree cash flow is a non-GAAP financial measure which we have defined as net cash provided by (used in) operating activities less purchases of property, plant and equipment. We believe free cash flow is useful to investors in evaluating the operational cash flow of the company inclusive of the spending required to maintain the operations. Free cash flow is not intended to represent nor be an alternative to the measure of net cash provided by (used in) operating activities reported in accordance with GAAP. Free cash flow may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies.\n\nThe accompanying financial information provides reconciliations of adjusted EBITDA, diluted adjusted EPS and free cash flow to the most directly comparable financial measures calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP. We have not provided a reconciliation of our adjusted EBITDA and diluted adjusted EPS outlook to the most comparable GAAP measures of net income (loss) and diluted EPS. Providing net income (loss) and diluted EPS guidance is potentially misleading and not practical given the difficulty of projecting event driven transactional and other non-core operating items that are included in net income (loss) and diluted EPS, including restructuring actions, asset impairments and certain income tax adjustments. The accompanying reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures with the most comparable GAAP measures for the historical periods presented are indicative of the reconciliations that will be prepared upon completion of the periods covered by the non-GAAP guidance.\n\nForward-Looking Statements\n\nCertain statements and projections contained in this news release are, by their nature, forward-looking within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These forward-looking statements are based on our current expectations, estimates, and projections about our industry and business, management's beliefs, and certain assumptions made by us, all of which are subject to change. Forward-looking statements can often be identified by words such as \"anticipates,\" \"expects,\" \"intends,\" \"plans,\" \"predicts,\" \"believes,\" \"seeks,\" \"estimates,\" \"may,\" \"will,\" \"should,\" \"would,\" \"could,\" \"potential,\" \"continue,\" \"ongoing,\" and similar expressions, and variations or negatives of these words. These forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future results and are subject to risks, uncertainties, and assumptions that could cause our actual results to differ materially and adversely from those expressed in any forward-looking statement.\n\nDana's Annual Report on Form 10-K, subsequent Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, recent Current Reports on Form 8-K, and other Securities and Exchange Commission filings discuss important risk factors that could affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. The forward-looking statements in this news release speak only as of this date. Dana does not undertake any obligation to revise or update publicly any forward-looking statement for any reason.\n\nAbout Dana Incorporated\n\nDana is a leader in the design and manufacture of highly efficient propulsion and energy-management solutions that power vehicles and machines in all mobility markets across the globe.

This compares to second quarter 2023 Net Income of $150 million, or $0.49 per share, based upon 309.1 million weighted average diluted shares. The second quarter of 2024 was impacted by a net gain from special items of $22 million and the second quarter of 2023 was impacted by a net charge from special items of $37 million. When adjusting for special items and amortization of purchased intangibles, Adjusted Net Income for the second quarter of 2024 was $183 million, or $0.60 per diluted share. This compares to second quarter 2023 Adjusted Net Income of $203 million, or $0.66 per diluted share.\n\n, the Company's President and CEO said, \"Second quarter played out largely as expected, with continued strength in Foodservice and Beverage results, and strong execution driving solid Adjusted EBITDA. Consumers are responding to higher prices by shifting their purchasing patterns, and our portfolio, designed to move with the consumer, is doing just that. Graphic Packaging's innovation leadership was on full display in the quarter with a big win for Paperseal\u2122 Shape at one of the largest food retailers. We are delivering the sustainable packaging solutions consumers prefer and are on track to reach in Innovation Sales Growth during 2024.\n\n\"On , we divested the bleached paperboard manufacturing facility, eliminating most of our open market bleached paperboard sales and removing a significant source of earnings volatility. We used a portion of the proceeds to repurchase approximately 2.4% of our outstanding common shares and will continue to return substantial cash to stockholders through dividends and share repurchase over the next several years as sales and cash flow grow.\"\n\nEBITDA for the second quarter of 2024 was , higher than the second quarter of 2023. After adjusting both periods for business combinations and other special items, Adjusted EBITDA was million in the second quarter of 2024 versus in the second quarter of 2023. The decline in Adjusted EBITDA was driven primarily by the divestiture of the bleached paperboard manufacturing facility, related bleached paperboard price and volume declines, and incremental planned maintenance expense (totaling ), in line with expectations. Excluding those items, the negative impact of lower sales and modest cost inflation were offset by Net Performance. Other acquisitions and divestitures (excluding ) had a favorable impact on EBITDA in the quarter, while foreign exchange had an unfavorable impact. Adjusted EBITDA Margin including the negative impact of maintenance, the divestiture, and reduced open market paperboard participation was 18.0% versus 18.9% in the prior year quarter.\n\nThe Company returned approximately to stockholders during first half of 2024 through dividends and share repurchase activity. During the second quarter, the Company repurchased approximately 2.4%, or approximately 7.2 million shares of its common stock outstanding, for . Regular dividends of approximately and were paid in the first and second quarter, respectively.\n\nInnovation Sales Growth, Net Performance, and Non-GAAP Reconciliations\n\nInnovation Sales Growth is defined as incremental sales of a product that delivers a significant change in materials used, package functionality, or design to a new or existing customer.

Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Net Income exclude gains or charges associated with: the Company's business combinations, facility shutdowns, and other special items. The Company's management believes that the presentation of EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Net Income, Adjusted Earnings Per Share, Adjusted Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities, Adjusted Cash Flow, and Net Leverage Ratio provides useful information to investors because these measures are regularly used by management in assessing the Company's performance. EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Net Income, Adjusted Earnings Per Share, Adjusted Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities, Adjusted Cash Flow, and Net Leverage Ratio are financial measures not calculated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in (\"GAAP\"), and are not measures of net income, operating income, operating performance, or liquidity presented in accordance with GAAP.\n\nEBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Net Income, Adjusted Earnings Per Share, Adjusted Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities, Adjusted Cash Flow, and Net Leverage Ratio should be considered in addition to results prepared in accordance with GAAP, but should not be considered substitutes for or superior to GAAP results. In addition, our EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Net Income, Adjusted Earnings Per Share, Adjusted Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities, Adjusted Cash Flow, and Net Leverage Ratio may not be comparable to Adjusted EBITDA or similarly titled measures utilized by other companies since such other companies may not calculate such measures in the same manner as we do.", "source": {"uri": "investing.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Investing.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paperboard", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Paperboard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divestment", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Divestment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Net_income", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Net income"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earnings_before_interest,_taxes,_depreciation,_and_amortization", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dividend", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dividend"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphic_Packaging", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Graphic Packaging"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_stock", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Common stock"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Share_repurchase", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Share repurchase"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shareholder", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Shareholder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amortization_(accounting)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Amortization (accounting)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Income_tax_in_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Income tax in the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intangible_asset", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Intangible asset"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Packaging_and_labeling", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Packaging and labeling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volatility_(finance)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Volatility (finance)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Productivity", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Productivity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foodservice", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Foodservice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cash_flow", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cash flow"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leverage_(American_TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Leverage (American TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reform_Judaism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Reform Judaism"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks_and_Bonds", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks and Bonds", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/Cash_Flow", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/Cash Flow", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities", "label": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Guides", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Guides", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://i-invdn-com.investing.com/news/news_six_pile_69x52._800x533_L_1419494215.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9774674", "eventUri": "eng-9774674", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.5215686274509803, "wgt": 141, "relevance": 1}

Our second quarter automotive new business awards brought our year-to-date total to $1.2 billion.

Excluding the impact of foreign currency translation, product revenues increased 2.0% year over year.\n\nAutomotive revenues increased 0.7% year over year. Adjusting for foreign currency translation, phasing out the non-automotive electronics business as well as one-time benefits from recoveries in both periods, Automotive revenues increased 2.8% year over year. Revenues from Automotive Climate and Comfort Solutions increased 4.8% in the second quarter compared to the prior year period.\n\nAccording to S&P Global's mid-July report, actual light vehicle production decreased by 0.2% in the second quarter when compared with the same quarter of 2023 in the Company's key markets of North America, Europe, China, Japan, and Korea.\n\nGentherm Medical revenue increased 8.3% year over year, primarily as a result of higher Blanketrol sales. Adjusting for the impact of foreign currency translation, Medical revenues increased 8.7%.\n\nSee the \"Revenues by Product Category and Reconciliation of Foreign Currency Translation Impact\" table included below for additional detail.\n\nGross margin rate increased to 25.7% in the current-year period, as compared with 23.6% in the prior-year period. The increase from the prior-year period was driven by Fit-for-Growth 2.0 initiatives including supplier cost reductions, value engineering activities, and net productivity at the factories as well the impact of our previously announced exit of the non-automotive electronics business. These were partially offset by annual price reductions and start-up costs from our new plants opening in Tangier, Morrocco and Monterrey, Mexico.\n\nNet research and development expenses of $21.9 million in the quarter decreased $2.8 million, or 11.5% over the prior-year period, primarily related to the reduction in resources allocated to certain battery performance solutions products and higher R&D reimbursements.\n\nSelling, general and administrative expenses of $39.4 million in the quarter increased $1.0 million, or 2.6%, versus the prior-year period. The year-over-year increase was primarily driven by higher compensation expenses.\n\nRestructuring expenses of $2.4 million in the current-year period increased $1.4 million, versus the prior-year period primarily as a result of discrete restructuring activities associated with the Company's Fit-for-Growth 2.0 initiatives and previously announced footprint optimization.\n\nAs described more fully in the \"Reconciliation of Net Income (Loss) to Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin\" table included below, the Company recorded Adjusted EBITDA of $49.9 million in the quarter compared with $42.4 million in the prior-year period, an increase of $7.5 million or 17.7%.\n\nIncome tax expense in the quarter was $9.5 million, as compared with $4.8 million in the prior-year period. The effective tax rate was approximately 34% in the quarter.\n\nGAAP diluted earnings per share for the quarter was $0.60 compared with a loss of $0.05 for the prior-year period. Adjusted diluted earnings per share, excluding restructuring expenses, non-cash purchase accounting impact, non-automotive electronics inventory benefit, unrealized currency gain, and other items specified on the table below, was $0.66. Adjusted diluted earnings per share in the prior-year period was $0.58.\n\nThe Company provides various non-GAAP financial measures in this release.

These forward-looking statements represent Gentherm Incorporated's goals, beliefs, plans and expectations about its prospects for the future and other future events. The forward-looking statements included in this release are made as of the date hereof or as of the date specified herein and are based on management's reasonable expectations and beliefs. In making these statements we rely on assumptions and analysis based on our experience and perception of historical trends, current conditions and expected future developments, as well as other factors we consider appropriate under the circumstances. Such statements are subject to a number of important assumptions, significant risks and uncertainties (some of which are beyond our control) and other factors that may cause actual results or performance to differ materially from that described in or indicated by the forward-looking statements, including but not limited to:\n\nThe foregoing risks should be read in conjunction with the Company's reports filed with or furnished to the Securities and Exchange Commission (the \"SEC\"), including \"Risk Factors,\" in its most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K and subsequent SEC filings, for a discussion of these and other risks and uncertainties. In addition, with reasonable frequency, we have entered into business combinations, acquisitions, divestitures, strategic investments and other significant transactions. Such forward-looking statements do not include the potential impact of any such transactions that may be completed after the date hereof, each of which may present material risks to the Company's future business and financial results.\n\nExcept as required by law, the Company expressly disclaims any obligation or undertaking to update any forward-looking statements to reflect any change in its expectations with regard thereto or any change in events, conditions or circumstances on which any such statement is based.\n\nUse of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\n\nIn addition to the results reported in accordance with GAAP throughout this release, the Company has provided here or elsewhere information regarding: adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (\"Adjusted EBITDA\"); Adjusted EBITDA margin; adjusted earnings per share (\"Adjusted earnings per share\" or \"Adjusted EPS\"); free cash flow; Net Debt, revenue, segment revenue and product revenue excluding foreign currency translation and other specified gains and losses; Automotive Climate and Comfort Solutions revenues; and adjusted operating expenses, each a non-GAAP financial measure. The Company defines Adjusted EBITDA as earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, deferred financing cost amortization, non-cash stock-based compensation expenses, and other gains and losses not reflective of the Company's ongoing operations and related tax effects including transaction expenses, debt retirement expenses, impairment of assets held for sale, impairment of goodwill, gain or loss on sale of business, restructuring expense, unrealized currency gain or loss and unrealized revaluation of derivatives. The Company defines Adjusted EBITDA margin as Adjusted EBITDA divided by product revenues. The Company defines Adjusted EPS as earnings adjusted by gains and losses not reflective of the Company's ongoing operations and related tax effects including transaction expenses, debt retirement expenses, impairment of assets held for sale, impairment of goodwill, gain or loss on sale of business, restructuring expense, unrealized currency gain or loss and unrealized revaluation of derivatives. The Company defines Free Cash Flow as Net cash provided by operating activities less Purchases of property and equipment. The Company defines Net Debt as the principal amount of all Consolidated Funded Indebtedness (as defined in the Credit Agreement) less cash and cash equivalents. The Company defines revenue, segment revenue or product revenue excluding foreign currency translation and other specified gains and losses as such revenue, excluding the estimated effects of foreign currency exchange on revenue by translating actual revenue using the prior period foreign currency exchange rates and excluding the other items specified in the reconciliation tables herein. The Company defines Automotive Climate and Comfort Solutions revenues as Automotive revenue excluding specified product revenues and the impact of non-automotive electronics and contract manufacturing electronics revenues. The Company defines adjusted operating expenses as operating expenses excluding impairment of intangible assets and property and equipment, restructuring, related non-cash stock-based compensation, acquisition, integration and divestiture expenses.\n\nThe Company's reconciliations are included in this release or can be found in the supplemental materials furnished as Exhibit 99.2 to the Company's Form 8-K dated July 31, 2024.\n\nIn evaluating its business, the Company considers and uses Free Cash Flow and Net Debt as supplemental measures of its liquidity and the other non-GAAP financial measures as supplemental measures of its operating performance. Management provides such non-GAAP financial measures so that investors will have the same financial information that management uses with the belief that it will assist investors in properly assessing the Company's performance on a period-over-period basis by excluding matters not indicative of the Company's ongoing operating or liquidity results and therefore enhance the comparability of the Company's results and provide additional information for analyzing trends in the business. In evaluating our non-GAAP financial measures, you should be aware that in the future we may incur revenues, expenses, and cash and non-cash obligations that are the same as or similar to some of the adjustments in our presentation of non-GAAP financial measures. Our presentation of non-GAAP financial measures should not be construed as an inference that our future results will be unaffected by unusual or non-recurring items. There also can be no assurance that we will not modify the presentation of our non-GAAP financial measures in the future, and any such modification may be material. Other companies in our industry may define and calculate these non-GAAP financial measures differently than we do and those calculations may not be comparable to our metrics. These non-GAAP measures have limitations as analytical tools, and when assessing the Company's operating performance or liquidity, investors should not consider these non-GAAP measures in isolation, or as a substitute for net income (loss), revenue or other consolidated income statement or cash flow statement data prepared in accordance with GAAP.\n\nNon-GAAP measures referenced in this release and other public communications may include estimates of future Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA margin and Adjusted EPS. The Company has not reconciled the non-GAAP forward-looking guidance included in this release to the most directly comparable GAAP measures because this cannot be done without unreasonable effort due to the variability and low visibility with respect to taxes and non-recurring items, which are potential adjustments to future earnings. We expect the variability of these items to have a potentially unpredictable, and a potentially significant, impact on our future GAAP financial results.", "source": {"uri": "wallstreet-online.de",

(\"SECURE\" or the \"Corporation\") (TSX: SES), a leading waste management and energy infrastructure company, reported today its operational and financial results for the three and six months ended June 30, 2024.\n\n\"Strong second quarter results were driven by robust industry fundamentals, favourable weather conditions, and continued operational execution across our business units, resulting in double digit revenue growth on a same store sales basis,\" said Allen Gransch, President and CEO. \"We achieved significant milestones in our capital allocation strategy, repurchasing approximately 14% of our outstanding shares in the second quarter and reinforcing our commitment to enhancing shareholder value and effectively managing proceeds from dispositions. Year to date, we have invested $60 million into the business, advancing organic projects backed by solid commercial agreements and ensuring consistent cash flows for the Corporation. Additionally, we were pleased to close a strategic tuck-in acquisition in our metal recycling business, expanding our network into a new operating region, diversifying our supply base, and bolstering our processing capabilities and logistics strategies.\n\n\"Reflecting on our strong results in the first half of 2024, the success of our organic growth investments, and the additional Adjusted EBITDA from our metal recycling acquisition, we are pleased to raise our full year 2024 Adjusted EBITDA guidance to $470 - $490 million, up from the previously disclosed $450 - $465 million.\"\n\nSECOND QUARTER HIGHLIGHTS\n\nThe Corporation's operating and financial highlights for the three and six months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023 can be summarized as follows:\n\nOUTLOOK\n\nSECURE is well positioned for success with a constructive industry backdrop, growth opportunities, and the financial capacity to execute on our strategic initiatives and deliver enhanced shareholder returns. Sustained and expanded industry activity levels in the coming years are expected to drive higher volumes and overall demand for SECURE's infrastructure as new infrastructure developments in western Canada provide our customers with increased takeaway capacity and improved access to global markets.\n\nWith our waste processing facilities currently operating at approximately 60 percent utilization, we have ample capacity to accommodate growing customer needs for processing, disposal, recycling, recovery, and terminalling, all with minimal incremental fixed costs or additional capital investment. With the completion of the Trans Mountain Expansion Pipeline in May, and commissioning of LNG Canada's export terminal expected by early 2025, increased capacity for our customers to gain stronger pricing with access to global markets is expected to result in sustained and growing activity levels in the years to come. Furthermore, the industrial sector is expected to remain stable, characterized by sustained volumes, continued demand for our infrastructure services and activity linked to long-term and recurring projects.\n\nThe accretive multiple achieved from the mandated facilities divestiture to Waste Connections in the first quarter highlights the underlying value of SECURE's business. The Board of Directors and management believe a substantive disparity remains between SECURE's share price and its fundamental value, which supported the share buybacks executed in the second quarter. In the coming months, the Board of Directors and management will continue to evaluate our capital allocation priorities. We intend to remain active under our Normal Course Issuer Bid (\"NCIB\") and may repurchase up to the remaining 6.3 million shares before the NCIB renewal on December 13, 2024. These repurchases may occur through open market transactions at SECURE's discretion, in accordance with TSX rules and applicable regulatory restrictions.\n\nLow leverage following the receipt of proceeds from the Sale Transaction, as well as continued strong free cash flow generation, provides the Corporation with significant capacity to execute on SECURE's strategic priorities. With a solid foundation and clear direction, we're confident in our ability to protect the base business, continue to advance our strategy as a leader in waste management and energy infrastructure and seize new opportunities to create value for our shareholders.\n\n2024 EXPECTATIONS\n\nNON-GAAP AND OTHER SPECIFIED FINANCIAL MEASURES\n\nThe Corporation uses accounting principles that are generally accepted in Canada (the issuer's \"GAAP\"), which includes International Financial Reporting Standards (\"IFRS\"). This news release contains certain supplementary non-GAAP financial measures, such as Adjusted EBITDA and discretionary free cash flow and certain non-GAAP financial ratios, such as Adjusted EBITDA margin, Adjusted EBITDA per share, and discretionary free cash flow per share which do not have any standardized meaning as prescribed by IFRS. These measures are intended as a complement to results provided in accordance with IFRS. The Corporation believes these measures provide additional useful information to analysts, shareholders and other users to understand the Corporation's financial results, profitability, cost management, liquidity and ability to generate funds to finance its operations.\n\nHowever, these measures should not be used as an alternative to IFRS measures because they are not standardized financial measures under IFRS and therefore might not be comparable to similar financial measures disclosed by other companies. See the \"Non-GAAP and other specified financial measures\" section of the Corporation's MD&A for the three and six months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023 for further details, which is incorporated by reference herein and available on SECURE's profile at www.sedarplus.ca and on our website at www.SECURE-energy.com.\n\nAdjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA margin and Adjusted EBITDA per share\n\nAdjusted EBITDA is calculated as noted in the table below and reflects items that the Corporation considers appropriate to adjust given the irregular nature and relevance to comparable operations. Adjusted EBITDA margin is defined as Adjusted EBITDA divided by revenue (excluding oil purchase and resale). Adjusted EBITDA per basic and diluted share is defined as Adjusted EBITDA divided by basic and diluted weighted average common shares. For the three and six months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023, transaction and related costs have been adjusted as they are costs outside the normal course of business.\n\nThe following table reconciles the Corporation's net income, being the most directly comparable financial measure disclosed in the Corporation's financial statements, to Adjusted EBITDA for the three and six months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023.\n\nDiscretionary Free Cash Flow and Discretionary Free Cash Flow per share\n\nDiscretionary free cash flow is defined as funds flow from operations adjusted for sustaining capital expenditures, and lease payments. The Corporation may deduct or include additional items in its calculation of discretionary free cash flow that are unusual, non-recurring, or non-operating in nature. Discretionary free cash flow per basic and diluted share is defined as Discretionary Free Cash Flow divided by basic and diluted weighted average common shares. For the three and six months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023, transaction and related costs have been adjusted as they are costs outside the normal course of business.\n\nThe following table reconciles the Corporation's funds flow from operations, being the most directly comparable financial measure disclosed in the Corporation's financial statements, to discretionary free cash flow.\n\nFINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND MD&A\n\nThe Corporation's consolidated financial statements and notes thereto and Management's Discussion and Analysis for the three and six months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023 are available on SECURE's website at www.secure-energy.com and on SEDAR+ at www.sedarplus.ca.\n\nSECOND QUARTER 2024 CONFERENCE CALL\n\nSECURE will host a conference call Tuesday, July 30, 2024, at 9:00 a.m. MST to discuss the second quarter results.

Given that trend, we were pleased to see conditions improve in June and achieve an Organic Daily Sales decline of only 3% for the quarter,\" said Doug Black, SiteOne's Chairman and CEO. \"With the benefit from acquisitions and with actions by our teams to control operating cost and maintain gross margin, we were also pleased to deliver adjusted EBITDA that was comparable to last year. Additionally, we added four attractive new companies to SiteOne during the quarter and one in July as we continue to build our full product line capability across the US and Canada. While we expect market softness and deflation to dampen this year's results, our teams are executing our strategy and driving improvements as we manage through the near-term challenges. With a clear leadership position in wholesale landscape distribution, strong teams, a robust acquisition pipeline, and a winning strategy to create value for our stakeholders, we are confident in our ability to perform and grow in the years to come.\"\n\nNet sales for the Second Quarter 2024 increased to $1.41 billion, or 4%, compared to $1.35 billion for the prior-year period. Organic Daily Sales decreased 3% compared to the prior-year period due to soft demand and price deflation for commodity products. Acquisitions contributed $103.2 million, or 8%, to Net sales growth for the quarter.\n\nGross profit increased 4% to $510.3 million for the Second Quarter 2024 compared to $489.4 million for the prior-year period. Gross margin contracted 10 basis points to 36.1% due to lower price realization, partially offset by a positive impact from acquisitions.\n\nSelling, general and administrative expenses (\"SG&A\") for the Second Quarter 2024 increased to $343.8 million from $320.6 million for the prior-year period. SG&A as a percentage of Net sales increased 60 basis points to 24.3% primarily due to the impact of acquisitions.\n\nNet income attributable to common shares for the Second Quarter 2024 was $120.2 million, compared to $124.0 million for the same period in the prior year due to increased SG&A expenses from acquisitions and lower gross margin.\n\nAdjusted EBITDA decreased $0.7 million to $210.5 million for the Second Quarter 2024, compared to $211.2 million for the prior-year period. Adjusted EBITDA margin decreased 70 basis points to 14.9%.\n\nOperating cash flow for the Second Quarter 2024 decreased to $147.4 million compared to $253.8 million in the prior-year period primarily reflecting seasonal timing differences in working capital.\n\nNet debt, calculated as long-term debt (net of issuance costs and discounts) plus finance leases, net of cash and cash equivalents on our balance sheet as of June 30, 2024, was $523.6 million compared to $385.4 million as of July 2, 2023. Net debt to Adjusted EBITDA for the last twelve months was 1.3 times compared to 0.9 times during the prior year period.\n\nOn July 2, 2024, we refinanced our term loan, extending the maturity by two years to March 2030 and reducing the interest rate by 25 basis points to Term SOFR plus 175 basis points. The term loan was also increased by $25.0 million to $392.7 million.\n\n______________________________\n\n1. Adjusted EBITDA includes contribution from non-controlling interest of $0.9 million for the Second Quarter 2024.\n\nOutlook\n\n\"Our maintenance and new construction markets remain resilient, but we are continuing to experience soft demand driven primarily by a weaker repair and remodel end market. Additionally, pricing continues to have a negative impact on our growth due to the ongoing deflation in commodities like PVC pipe and grass seed. We now expect those trends to continue throughout the second half of 2024. Our teams are executing our commercial and operational initiatives well, and we expect to continue outperforming the market with a low single digit Organic Daily Sales decline for the remainder of the year,\" Doug Black continued. \"With the benefit of acquisitions, we expect overall sales growth to be positive in the second half of 2024 but with a lower adjusted EBITDA margin than last year.\"\n\nFor Fiscal 2024, we now expect our Adjusted EBITDA to be in the range of $380 million to $400 million. Our guidance does not include any contributions from unannounced acquisitions.\n\nConference Call Information\n\nSiteOne management will host a conference call today, July 31, 2024, at 8:00 a.m. Eastern Time, to discuss the Company's financial results.

Forward-looking statements may include, but are not limited to, statements relating to our 2024 Adjusted EBITDA outlook and our share repurchase program. Some of the forward-looking statements can be identified by the use of terms such as \"may,\" \"intend,\" \"might,\" \"will,\" \"should,\" \"could,\" \"would,\" \"expect,\" \"believe,\" \"estimate,\" \"anticipate,\" \"predict,\" \"project,\" \"potential,\" or the negative of these terms, and similar expressions. You should be aware that these forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that are beyond our control. Further, any forward-looking statement speaks only as of the date on which it is made, and we undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statement to reflect events or circumstances after the date on which it is made or to reflect the occurrence of anticipated or unanticipated events or circumstances. New factors emerge from time to time that may cause our business not to develop as we expect, and it is not possible for us to predict all of them. Factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, the following: cyclicality in residential and commercial construction markets; general business, financial market, and economic conditions; seasonality of our business and its impact on demand for our products; weather and climate conditions; prices for the products we purchase may fluctuate; market variables, including inflation and elevated interest rates for prolonged periods; increases in operating costs; public perceptions that our products and services are not environmentally friendly or that our practices are not sustainable; climate, environmental, health and safety laws and regulations; hazardous materials and related materials; laws and government regulations applicable to our business that could negatively impact demand for our products; competitive industry pressures, including competition for our talent base; supply chain disruptions, product or labor shortages, and the loss of key suppliers; inventory management risks; ability to implement our business strategies and achieve our growth objectives; acquisition and integration risks, including increased competition for acquisitions; risks associated with our large labor force and our customers' labor force and labor market disruptions; retention of key personnel; construction defect and product liability claims; impairment of goodwill; adverse credit and financial markets events and conditions; inefficient or ineffective allocation of capital; credit sale risks; performance of individual branches; cybersecurity incidents involving our systems or third-party systems; failure or malfunctions in our information technology systems; security of personal information about our customers; intellectual property and other proprietary rights; unanticipated changes in our tax provisions; threats from terrorism, violence, uncertain political conditions, and geopolitical conflicts such as the ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine, the conflict in the Gaza Strip, and unrest in the Middle East; risks related to our current indebtedness and our ability to obtain financing in the future; financial institution disruptions; risks related to our common stock; and other risks, as described in Item 1A, \"Risk Factors\", and elsewhere in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, as may be updated by subsequent filings under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, including Forms 10-Q and 8-K.\n\nNon-GAAP Financial Information\n\nThis release includes certain financial information, not prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Because not all companies calculate non-GAAP financial information identically (or at all), the presentations herein may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures used by other companies. Further, these measures should not be considered substitutes for the information contained in the historical financial information of the Company prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP that is set forth herein.\n\nWe present Adjusted EBITDA in order to evaluate the operating performance and efficiency of our business. Adjusted EBITDA represents EBITDA as further adjusted for items permitted under the covenants of our credit facilities. EBITDA represents Net income (loss) plus the sum of income tax (benefit) expense, interest expense, net of interest income, and depreciation and amortization. Adjusted EBITDA represents EBITDA as further adjusted for stock-based compensation expense, (gain) loss on sale of assets and termination of finance leases not in the ordinary course of business, financing fees, as well as other fees and expenses related to acquisitions, and other non-recurring (income) loss. Adjusted EBITDA includes Adjusted EBITDA attributable to non-controlling interest. Adjusted EBITDA does not include pre-acquisition acquired Adjusted EBITDA. Adjusted EBITDA is not a measure of our liquidity or financial performance under U.S. GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to Net income, operating income or any other performance measures derived in accordance with U.S. GAAP, or as an alternative to cash flow from operating activities as a measure of our liquidity. The use of Adjusted EBITDA instead of Net income has limitations as an analytical tool. Because not all companies use identical calculations, our presentation of Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies, limiting its usefulness as a comparative measure. Net debt is defined as long-term debt (net of issuance costs and discounts) plus finance leases, net of cash and cash-equivalents on our balance sheet. Leverage Ratio is defined as Net debt to trailing twelve months Adjusted EBITDA. Free Cash Flow is defined as Cash Flow from Operating Activities, less capital expenditures. We define Organic Daily Sales as Organic Sales divided by the number of Selling Days in the relevant reporting period. We define Organic Sales as Net sales, including Net sales from newly-opened greenfield branches, but excluding Net sales from acquired branches until they have been under our ownership for at least four full fiscal quarters at the start of the fiscal year. Selling Days are the number of business days, excluding Saturdays, Sundays, and holidays, that SiteOne branches are open during the relevant reporting period.", "source": {"uri": "wallstreet-online.de", "dataType": "news", "title": "wallstreet:online"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SG&A", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "SG&A"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gross_margin", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gross margin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Deflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basis_point", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Basis point"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earnings_before_interest,_taxes,_depreciation,_and_amortization", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wholesaling", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Wholesaling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debt", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Debt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commodity", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Commodity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Canada"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chairperson", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chairperson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operating_cost", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Operating cost"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gross_income", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gross income"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cash_and_cash_equivalents", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cash and cash equivalents"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_stock", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Common stock"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Working_capital", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Working capital"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stakeholder_(corporate)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stakeholder (corporate)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refinancing", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Refinancing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pipeline_transport", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pipeline transport"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operating_cash_flow", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Operating cash flow"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Net_income", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Net income"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interest_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Interest rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_East", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Middle East"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_Strip", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business", "label": "dmoz/Business", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Marketing_and_Advertising/Salesmanship", "label": "dmoz/Business/Marketing and Advertising/Salesmanship", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Real_Estate/Commercial", "label": "dmoz/Business/Real Estate/Commercial", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/Information_Services", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/Information Services", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://assets.wallstreet-online.de/_media/6/source1280/size_645/businesswire-1280.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9774674", "eventUri": "eng-9774674", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2014-08-", "textStart": 5024, "textEnd": 5033}], "sentiment": 0.3254901960784313, "wgt": 134, "relevance": 1}

Our strong operating leverage and cost discipline led to 8.5% OCC adjusted EBITDA growth and 15.2% adjusted EPS growth. We continue to invest our strong free cash flow in future growth opportunities while also returning capital to shareholders through dividends and repurchases.\"\n\nSummary of Results (GAAP and Non-GAAP) from Continuing Operations\n\n(in millions, except per share amounts)\n\nNote: Adjusted EBITDA, diluted adjusted EPS, and free cash flow are non-GAAP measures.\n\nRevenues from Continuing Operations\n\nConsolidated and OCC revenues increased 6.2% and 6.0%, respectively, with growth contributions from both underwriting and claims within Insurance.\n\nInsurance revenues grew 6.2% in the second quarter and 6.0% on an OCC basis.\n\nIncome and Adjusted EBITDA from Continuing Operations\n\nDuring second-quarter 2024, income from continuing operations was $308 million, an increase of 50.7%. The increase in income from continuing operations was primarily driven by net gains of $98.3 million associated with the settlement of retained interests related to the prior sales of our healthcare business in 2016 and our specialized markets business in 2022, and a net gain of $3.6 million on the early extinguishment of debt related to a cash tender of $400.0 million aggregate principal of our 2025 Senior Notes.\n\nAdjusted EBITDA increased 8.8%, and 8.5% on an OCC basis, primarily due to strong revenue growth and cost discipline.\n\nEBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA\n\n(in millions)\n\nNote: Consolidated EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are non-GAAP measures. Margin is calculated as a percentage of revenues. See \"Non-GAAP Reconciliations\" below for a reconciliation to the nearest GAAP measure. All OCC figures exclude results from the disposition of the Energy business.\n\nEarnings Per Share and Diluted Adjusted Earnings Per Share\n\nDiluted EPS attributable to Verisk increased 52.5% to $2.15 for the second quarter of 2024. Diluted adjusted EPS increased 15.2% to $1.74 for the second quarter of 2024, which reflects revenue and profit growth, a lower effective tax rate and a lower average share count due to our accelerated share repurchase program.\n\nCash Flow and Free Cash Flow\n\nNet cash provided by operating activities was $212 million for the second quarter of 2024, up 9.7%, and free cash flow was $154 million, up 14.3%.\n\nDividend\n\nOn June 28, 2024, we paid a cash dividend of 39 cents per share of common stock issued and outstanding to the holders of record as of June 15, 2024.\n\nOn July 24, 2024, our Board of Directors approved a cash dividend of 39 cents per share of common stock issued and outstanding. The dividend is payable on September 30, 2024, to holders of record as of September 15, 2024.\n\nShare Repurchases\n\nDuring the second quarter of 2024, we initiated a $150 million Accelerated Share Repurchase program, which was completed in July 2024, resulting in a repurchase of 552,406 shares, at an average price of $271.54. As of June 30, 2024, we had $1.3 billion remaining under our share repurchase authorization.\n\n2024 Financial Guidance\n\nThe company's financial outlook for 2024 remains unchanged and is as follows:\n\nConference Call\n\nOur management team will host a live audio webcast to discuss the financial results and business highlights on Wednesday, July 31, 2024, at 8:30 a.m. EDT (5:30 a.m. PDT, 12:30 p.m. GMT).

These measures are not in accordance with, or an alternative for, U.S. GAAP and may be different from non-GAAP measures reported by other companies. We believe that our presentation of non-GAAP measures provides useful information to management and investors regarding certain financial and business trends relating to our financial condition and results of operations. In addition, our management uses these measures for reviewing our financial results, for budgeting and planning purposes, and for evaluating the performance of senior management.\n\nEBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, and Adjusted EBITDA Expenses: EBITDA represents GAAP net income adjusted for (i) depreciation and amortization of fixed assets; (ii) amortization of intangible assets; (iii) interest expense, net; and (iv) provision for income taxes. Adjusted EBITDA represents EBITDA adjusted for acquisition-related adjustments (earn-outs), gain/loss from dispositions (which includes businesses held for sale), and nonrecurring gain/loss. Adjusted EBITDA expenses represent adjusted EBITDA net of revenues. We believe these measures are useful and meaningful because they help us allocate resources, make business decisions, allow for greater transparency regarding our operating performance, and facilitate period-to-period comparison.\n\nAdjusted Net Income and Diluted Adjusted EPS: Adjusted net income represents GAAP net income adjusted for (i) amortization of intangible assets, net of tax; (ii) acquisition-related adjustments (earn-outs), net of tax; (iii) gain/loss from dispositions (which includes businesses held for sale), net of tax; and (iv) nonrecurring gain/loss, net of tax. Diluted adjusted EPS represents adjusted net income divided by weighted-average diluted shares. We believe these measures are useful and meaningful because they allow evaluation of the after-tax profitability of our results excluding the after-tax effect of acquisition-related costs and nonrecurring items.\n\nFree Cash Flow: Free cash flow represents net cash provided by operating activities determined in accordance with GAAP minus payments for capital expenditures. We believe free cash flow is an important measure of the recurring cash generated by our operations that may be available to repay debt obligations, repurchase our stock, invest in future growth through new business development activities, or make acquisitions.\n\nOrganic: Organic is defined as operating results excluding the effect of recent acquisitions and dispositions (which include businesses held for sale), and nonrecurring gain/loss associated with cost-based and equity-method investments that have occurred over the past year. An acquisition is included as organic at the beginning of the calendar quarter that occurs subsequent to the one-year anniversary of the acquisition date. Once an acquisition is included in its current-period organic base, its comparable prior-year-period operating results are also included to calculate organic growth. A disposition (which includes a business held for sale) is excluded from organic at the beginning of the calendar quarter in which the disposition occurs (or when a business meets the held-for-sale criteria under U.S. GAAP). Once a disposition is excluded from its current-period organic base, its comparable prior-year-period operating results are also excluded to calculate organic growth. We believe the organic presentation enables investors to assess the growth of the business without the impact of recent acquisitions for which there is no prior-year comparison and the impact of recent dispositions, for which results are removed from all prior periods presented to allow for comparability.\n\nOrganic Constant Currency (OCC) Growth Rate: Our operating results, such as, but not limited to, revenue and adjusted EBITDA, reported in U.S. dollars are affected by foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations because the underlying foreign currencies in which we transact changes in value over time compared with the U.S. dollar. Accordingly, we present certain constant currency financial information to assess how we performed excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. We calculate constant currency by translating comparable prior-year-period results at the currency exchange rates used in the current period. We believe organic constant currency is a useful and meaningful measure to enhance investors' understanding of the continuing operating performance of our business and to facilitate the comparison of period-to-period performance because it excludes the impact of foreign exchange rate movements, acquisitions, and dispositions.\n\nSee page 10 for a reconciliation of consolidated adjusted EBITDA and a results summary and a reconciliation of adjusted EBITDA. See page 11 for a reconciliation of adjusted EBITDA margin, a reconciliation of adjusted EBITDA expenses, and a reconciliation of diluted adjusted EPS. See page 12 for a reconciliation of net cash provided by operating activities to free cash flow.\n\nWe are not able to provide a reconciliation of projected Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA margin, and Diluted Adjusted EPS to the most directly comparable expected GAAP results because of the unreasonable effort and high unpredictability of estimating certain items that are excluded from non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA margin, and Diluted Adjusted EPS, including, for example, tax consequences, acquisition-related costs, gain/loss from dispositions and other non-recurring expenses, the effect of which may be significant.\n\nAttached Financial Statements\n\nPlease refer to the full Form 10-Q filing for the complete financial statements and related notes.\n\nVERISK ANALYTICS, INC.\n\nCONDENSED CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS (UNAUDITED)\n\nAs of June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023\n\nVERISK ANALYTICS, INC.\n\nCONDENSED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS (UNAUDITED)\n\nFor the Three and Six Months Ended June 30, 2024 and 2023\n\nVERISK ANALYTICS, INC.\n\nCONDENSED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF CASH FLOWS (UNAUDITED)\n\nFor the Three and Six Months Ended June 30, 2024 and 2023\n\nConsolidated EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Organic Adjusted EBITDA Reconciliation from Continuing Operations\n\n(in millions)\n\nNote: EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA, and organic adjusted EBITDA are non-GAAP measures.

As we raise our full-year guidance a third time, we expect our Adjusted EPS to grow approximately 120% compared to 2023, driven mainly by our ability to capitalize on the robust market demand and ensuring our guests are vacationing better and experiencing more across our brands,\" remarked Harry Sommer, president and chief executive officer of Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd.\n\n\"The momentum we are garnering from strong yield growth, disciplined cost management and the initiatives that comprise our Charting the Course strategy further bolsters our confidence in achieving our previously announced 2026 financial and sustainability targets,\" continued Sommer.\n\nBusiness, Operations and Booking Environment Update\n\nThe Company continues to experience strong consumer demand as the majority of new bookings are pivoting to 2025 sailings. As a result, the Company remains at the upper range of its optimal booked position on a 12-month forward basis. Occupancy was 105.9% for the second quarter of 2024, slightly above guidance. Full year 2024 Occupancy is expected to average 105.2%, slightly above prior guidance.\n\nIn addition, top line growth in the second quarter was also strong. Gross margin per Capacity Day was approximately $124 in the quarter, up 7% versus 2023 on an as reported and Constant Currency basis. Net Yield growth was up approximately 6.3% versus 2023 on an as reported and Constant Currency basis, above guidance by 200 basis points due to strong close-in demand and onboard revenue performance. The Company's advance ticket sales balance, including the long-term portion, ended the second quarter of 2024 at an all-time record high of $3.9 billion, approximately 11% higher than the same period of 2023.\n\nThe Company demonstrated continued progress on its ongoing margin enhancement initiatives to maximize revenue opportunities and right size its cost base. Gross Cruise Costs per Capacity Day was approximately $315 in the second quarter, which was flat versus last year. Adjusted Net Cruise Costs excluding Fuel per Capacity Day in the second quarter of 2024 was approximately $163 on an as reported and Constant Currency basis and was essentially flat year-over-year excluding the expected ~$9 impact from increased Dry-dock days and related costs and better than guidance of $165, as cost savings measures fully offset an increase in variable compensation due to strong performance of the business.\n\nFor the full year 2024, the Company increased its Net Yield guidance by 100 basis points from prior guidance to growth of approximately 8.2% from approximately 7.2% on a Constant Currency basis compared to 2023. The increase in guidance is driven by strong demand across all three brands and itineraries.\n\nFull year Adjusted Net Cruise Cost Excluding Fuel per Capacity Day guidance remained unchanged and is expected to be approximately $159, increasing approximately 3.5% in Constant Currency, which includes an approximate 300 basis point impact from Dry-dock days and related costs in the year. Excluding this impact, Adjusted Net Cruise Cost Excluding Fuel per Capacity Day would be essentially flat year-over-year.\n\nAdjusted Operational EBITDA Margin for the full year 2024 is expected to increase to 34.5% and full year 2024 Adjusted EBITDA guidance increased by $50 million to $2.35 billion. Adjusted EPS guidance was increased by $0.11, or 8%, to approximately $1.53 from approximately $1.42.\n\nLiquidity and Financial Position\n\nThe Company is committed to prioritizing efforts to optimize its balance sheet and reduce leverage. As of June 30, 2024, the Company had total debt of $13.4 billion and Net Debt of $12.8 billion. Net Leverage improved by approximately 1.5 turns compared to December 31, 2023, ending the second quarter of 2024 at 5.9x and achieving our year-end goal 6 months early. The Company announced at its Investor Day that it plans to reduce its Net Leverage to the mid 4's by 2026.\n\nDuring the quarter, as expected, substantially all the holders of the 6% 2024 Exchangeable Notes exchanged their 2024 Exchangeable Notes for shares with any remaining unexchanged notes being repaid in cash at maturity.\n\nAt quarter-end, liquidity was $2.7 billion. This consists of approximately $594.1 million of cash and cash equivalents, $1.2 billion of availability under our undrawn Revolving Loan Facility, a $650 million undrawn backstop commitment, and other commitments.\n\n\"We enter the second half of 2024 with strong momentum, exceeding our guidance metrics in each quarter of 2024 on the back of strong execution. We continue to see robust demand heading into the back half of the year and are committed to improving efficiencies, reducing costs, and restoring our margins in a strategic and disciplined manner. Given our strong progress to date and current demand expectations, we are raising our 2024 full-year guidance for a third time this year for key metrics resulting in expected Adjusted EPS growth of 120% versus 2023, while keeping our cost guidance for the year unchanged at flat to prior year,\" said Mark A. Kempa, executive vice president and chief financial officer of Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd.\n\nKempa continued, \"Additionally, we made significant advances in reducing Net Leverage and de-risking our balance sheet during the first half of 2024. We have already accomplished our year-end goal of reducing Net Leverage by a full turn and a half versus year-end 2023, ending the quarter at 5.9x. We remain confident that our strong liquidity position, ongoing cash generation, and favorable growth prospects will enable us to continue to de-risk our balance sheet further bolstering our path to achieving the 2026 Charting the Course financial targets laid out at our recent Investor Day.\"\n\nSecond Quarter 2024 Results\n\nGAAP net income was $163.4 million or EPS of $0.35 compared to $86.1 million or EPS of $0.20 in the prior year. The Company reported Adjusted Net Income of $203.7 million or Adjusted EPS of $0.40 in the second quarter of 2024. This compares to Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted EPS of $137.0 million and $0.30, respectively, in the second quarter of 2023. Adjusted EBITDA in the second quarter was approximately $587.7 million, better than guidance of $555 million, and increased 14% compared to 2023, driven primarily by solid revenue performance and Adjusted Net Cruise Cost Excluding Fuel that was essentially flat year-over-year excluding the impact of Dry-docks.\n\nGross Cruise Costs per Capacity Day was approximately $315 in the quarter. Adjusted Net Cruise Costs excluding Fuel per Capacity Day was approximately $163 on an as reported and Constant Currency basis, which includes approximately $9 related to Dry-docks, and would have been essentially flat year-over-year without these Dry-dock impacts, reflecting the benefits from the Company's ongoing margin enhancement initiative.\n\nThe Company reported fuel expense of $175 million in the quarter. Fuel price per metric ton, net of hedges, increased slightly to $719 from $715 in 2023. Fuel consumption of 243,000 metric tons was slightly better than projections.\n\nInterest expense, net was $178.5 million in 2024 compared to $177.7 million in 2023.\n\nOther income (expense), net was an income of $1.9 million in 2024 compared to an expense of ($8.0) million in 2023. The income and expense primarily relate to net gains and losses on foreign currency.\n\nOutlook and Guidance\n\nIn addition to announcing the results for the second quarter 2024, the Company also provided guidance for the third quarter and full year 2024, along with accompanying sensitivities. The Company does not provide certain estimated future results on a GAAP basis because the Company is unable to predict, with reasonable certainty, the future movement of foreign exchange rates or the future impact of certain gains and charges. These items are uncertain and will depend on several factors, including industry conditions, and could be material to the Company's results computed in accordance with GAAP. The Company has not provided reconciliations between the Company's 2024 guidance and the most directly comparable GAAP measures because it would be too difficult to prepare a reliable U.S. GAAP quantitative reconciliation without unreasonable effort.\n\n______________________\n\n(1) Q3 2024 does not include a significant impact related to Dry-dock days and related costs. Full Year 2024 includes an approximate 300 basis point, or approximately $5, impact of increased Dry-dock days and related costs. Excluding this impact, the Adjusted Net Cruise Cost Excluding Fuel per Capacity Day would be essentially flat year-over-year, amounting to $155 in 2024 as reported and in Constant Currency.\n\n(2) Based on guidance and using diluted weighted-average shares outstanding of approximately 515 million for the third quarter of 2024 and 515 million for full year 2024. Adjusted EPS for the third quarter 2024 assumes all three of the Company's outstanding exchangeable notes are dilutive and therefore are included in diluted weighted-average shares outstanding and full year 2024 assumes that all four of the Company's exchangeable notes are fully dilutive and therefore excludes approximately $15 million and $63 million of interest expense, respectively, associated with the Company's exchangeable notes.\n\n(3) Q3 2024 assumes all three of the Company's exchangeable notes are dilutive and therefore are included in diluted weighted-average shares outstanding and full year 2024 assumes all four of the Company's exchangeable notes are dilutive and therefore are included in diluted weighted-average shares outstanding.\n\n(4) Based on the Company's June 30, 2024 outstanding variable rate debt balance, a one percentage point increase in annual SOFR interest rates would increase the Company's annual interest expense by approximately $6 million excluding the effects of capitalization of interest.\n\n(5) Q3 2023 Adjusted Net Cruise Costs excluding Fuel was $151 and included $2 of non-recurring benefits. Excluding this impact, the year-over-year growth would be approximately 1.9% on an as reported basis and 2.0% on a constant currency basis.\n\nThe following reflects the foreign currency exchange rates the Company used in its third quarter and full year 2024 guidance.\n\nFuel\n\nThe following reflects the Company's expectations regarding fuel consumption and pricing, along with accompanying sensitivities.\n\n_____________________\n\n(1) Fuel consumption for the full year 2024 is expected to be split approximately evenly between heavy fuel oil and marine gas oil.\n\n(2) Fuel prices are based on forward curves as of 7/10/2024.\n\nAs of June 30, 2024, the Company had hedged approximately 53% and 39% of its total projected metric tons of fuel consumption for the remainder of 2024 and 2025, respectively. The following table provides amounts hedged and price per metric ton of heavy fuel oil (\"HFO\") and marine gas oil (\"MGO\").\n\n________________\n\n(1) Hedged derivatives include accounting hedges as well as economic hedges.\n\nCapital Expenditures\n\nNon-newbuild capital expenditures for the second quarter of 2024 were $167 million. Anticipated non-newbuild capital expenditures for full year 2024 are expected to be approximately $575 million including approximately $141 million in the third quarter.\n\nNewbuild-related capital expenditures, net of export credit financing, are expected to be approximately $0.3 billion, $0.6 billion and $0.8 billion for the full years ending December 31, 2024, 2025 and 2026, respectively. Net newbuild-related capital expenditures for the second quarter of 2024 were approximately $60 million and are expected to be approximately $119 million for the third quarter of 2024.\n\nThe Company has scheduled a conference call for Wednesday, July 31, 2024 at 10:00 a.m. Eastern Time to discuss second quarter results and provide a business update. A link to the live webcast along with a slide presentation can be found on the Company's Investor Relations website at https://www.nclhltd.com/investors. A replay of the conference call will also be available on the website for 30 days after the call.\n\nAbout Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd.\n\nNorwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd.

See \"Terminology\" for the definitions of these and other non-GAAP financial measures. Our management believes the presentation of Adjusted ROIC provides a useful performance metric to both management and investors for evaluating our effective use of capital and has used it as a performance measure for our incentive compensation. We utilize Adjusted Gross Margin, Net Yield, and Net Per Diem to manage our business on a day-to-day basis because they reflect revenue earned net of certain direct variable costs. We utilize Adjusted Operational EBITDA Margin to assess operating performance. We also utilize Net Cruise Cost and Adjusted Net Cruise Cost Excluding Fuel to manage our business on a day-to-day basis. In measuring our ability to control costs in a manner that positively impacts net income (loss), we believe changes in Adjusted Gross Margin, Adjusted Operational EBITDA Margin, Net Yield, Net Cruise Cost and Adjusted Net Cruise Cost Excluding Fuel to be the most relevant indicators of our performance.\n\nAs our business includes the sourcing of passengers and deployment of vessels outside of the U.S., a portion of our revenue and expenses are denominated in foreign currencies, particularly British pound, Canadian dollar, Euro and Australian dollar which are subject to fluctuations in currency exchange rates versus our reporting currency, the U.S. dollar. In order to monitor results excluding these fluctuations, we calculate certain non-GAAP measures on a Constant Currency basis, whereby current period revenue and expenses denominated in foreign currencies are converted to U.S. dollars using currency exchange rates of the comparable period. We believe that presenting these non-GAAP measures on both a reported and Constant Currency basis is useful in providing a more comprehensive view of trends in our business.\n\nWe believe that Adjusted EBITDA is appropriate as a supplemental financial measure as it is used by management to assess operating performance. We also believe that Adjusted EBITDA is a useful measure in determining our performance as it reflects certain operating drivers of our business, such as sales growth, operating costs, marketing, general and administrative expense and other operating income and expense. In addition, management uses Adjusted EBITDA as a performance measure for our incentive compensation. Adjusted EBITDA is not a defined term under GAAP nor is it intended to be a measure of liquidity or cash flows from operations or a measure comparable to net income (loss), as it does not take into account certain requirements such as capital expenditures and related depreciation, principal and interest payments and tax payments and it includes other supplemental adjustments.\n\nIn addition, Adjusted Net Income (Loss) and Adjusted EPS are non-GAAP financial measures that exclude certain amounts and are used to supplement GAAP net income (loss) and EPS. We use Adjusted Net Income (Loss) and Adjusted EPS as key performance measures of our earnings performance. We believe that both management and investors benefit from referring to these non-GAAP financial measures in assessing our performance and when planning, forecasting and analyzing future periods. These non-GAAP financial measures also facilitate management's internal comparison to our historical performance. In addition, management uses Adjusted EPS as a performance measure for our incentive compensation. The amounts excluded in the presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures may vary from period to period; accordingly, our presentation of Adjusted Net Income (Loss) and Adjusted EPS may not be indicative of future adjustments or results.\n\nNet Leverage and Net Debt are performance measures that we believe provide management and investors a more complete understanding of our leverage position and borrowing capacity after factoring in cash and cash equivalents.\n\nYou are encouraged to evaluate each adjustment used in calculating our non-GAAP financial measures and the reasons we consider our non-GAAP financial measures appropriate for supplemental analysis. In evaluating our non-GAAP financial measures, you should be aware that in the future we may incur expenses similar to the adjustments in our presentation. Our non-GAAP financial measures have limitations as analytical tools, and you should not consider these measures in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. Our presentation of our non-GAAP financial measures should not be construed as an inference that our future results will be unaffected by unusual or non-recurring items. Our non-GAAP financial measures may not be comparable to other companies. Please see a historical reconciliation of these measures to the most comparable GAAP measure presented in our consolidated financial statements below.\n\nCautionary Statement Concerning Forward-Looking Statements\n\nSome of the statements, estimates or projections contained in this release are \"forward-looking statements\" within the meaning of the U.S. federal securities laws intended to qualify for the safe harbor from liability established by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. All statements other than statements of historical facts contained, or incorporated by reference, in this release, including, without limitation, our expectations regarding our future financial position, including our liquidity requirements and future capital expenditures, plans, prospects, actions taken or strategies being considered with respect to our liquidity position, including with respect to refinancing, amending the terms of, or extending the maturity of our indebtedness, our ability to comply with covenants under our debt agreements, expectations regarding our exchangeable notes, valuation and appraisals of our assets, expected fleet additions and cancellations, including expected timing thereof, our expectations regarding the impact of macroeconomic conditions and recent global events, and expectations relating to our sustainability program and decarbonization efforts may be forward-looking statements. Many, but not all, of these statements can be found by looking for words like \"expect,\" \"anticipate,\" \"goal,\" \"project,\" \"plan,\" \"believe,\" \"seek,\" \"will,\" \"may,\" \"forecast,\" \"estimate,\" \"intend,\" \"future\" and similar words. Forward-looking statements do not guarantee future performance and may involve risks, uncertainties and other factors which could cause our actual results, performance or achievements to differ materially from the future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied in those forward-looking statements. Examples of these risks, uncertainties and other factors include, but are not limited to the impact of: adverse general economic factors, such as fluctuating or increasing levels of interest rates, inflation, unemployment, underemployment and the volatility of fuel prices, declines in the securities and real estate markets, and perceptions of these conditions that decrease the level of disposable income of consumers or consumer confidence; implementing precautions in coordination with regulators and global public health authorities to protect the health, safety and security of guests, crew and the communities we visit and to comply with related regulatory restrictions; our indebtedness and restrictions in the agreements governing our indebtedness that require us to maintain minimum levels of liquidity and be in compliance with maintenance covenants and otherwise limit our flexibility in operating our business, including the significant portion of assets that are collateral under these agreements; our ability to work with lenders and others or otherwise pursue options to defer, renegotiate, refinance or restructure our existing debt profile, near-term debt amortization, newbuild related payments and other obligations and to work with credit card processors to satisfy current or potential future demands for collateral on cash advanced from customers relating to future cruises; our need for additional financing or financing to optimize our balance sheet, which may not be available on favorable terms, or at all, and our outstanding exchangeable notes and any future financing which may be dilutive to existing shareholders; the unavailability of ports of call; future increases in the price of, or major changes, disruptions or reduction in, commercial airline services; changes involving the tax and environmental regulatory regimes in which we operate, including new regulations aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions; the accuracy of any appraisals of our assets; our success in controlling operating expenses and capital expenditures; trends in, or changes to, future bookings and our ability to take future reservations and receive deposits related thereto; adverse events impacting the security of travel, or customer perceptions of the security of travel, such as terrorist acts, armed conflict, such as Russia's invasion of Ukraine or the Israel-Hamas war, or threats thereof, acts of piracy, and other international events; public health crises, including the COVID-19 pandemic, and their effect on the ability or desire of people to travel (including on cruises); adverse incidents involving cruise ships; our ability to maintain and strengthen our brand; breaches in data security or other disturbances to our information technology systems and other networks or our actual or perceived failure to comply with requirements regarding data privacy and protection; changes in fuel prices and the type of fuel we are permitted to use and/or other cruise operating costs; mechanical malfunctions and repairs, delays in our shipbuilding program, maintenance and refurbishments and the consolidation of qualified shipyard facilities; the risks and increased costs associated with operating internationally; our inability to recruit or retain qualified personnel or the loss of key personnel or employee relations issues; impacts related to climate change and our ability to achieve our climate-related or other sustainability goals; our inability to obtain adequate insurance coverage; pending or threatened litigation, investigations and enforcement actions; volatility and disruptions in the global credit and financial markets, which may adversely affect our ability to borrow and could increase our counterparty credit risks, including those under our credit facilities, derivatives, contingent obligations, insurance contracts and new ship progress payment guarantees; any further impairment of our trademarks, trade names or goodwill; our reliance on third parties to provide hotel management services for certain ships and certain other services; fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates; our expansion into new markets and investments in new markets and land-based destination projects; overcapacity in key markets or globally; and other factors set forth under \"Risk Factors\" in our most recently filed Annual Report on Form 10-K and subsequent filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The above examples are not exhaustive and new risks emerge from time to time. There may be additional risks that we consider immaterial or which are unknown. Such forward-looking statements are based on our current beliefs, assumptions, expectations, estimates and projections regarding our present and future business strategies and the environment in which we expect to operate in the future. These forward-looking statements speak only as of the date made. We expressly disclaim any obligation or undertaking to release publicly any updates or revisions to any forward-looking statement to reflect any change in our expectations with regard thereto or any change of events, conditions or circumstances on which any such statement was based, except as required by law.\n\n___________________\n\n(1) Non-cash deferred compensation expenses related to the

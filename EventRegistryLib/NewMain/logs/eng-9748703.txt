Sheila Jackson Lee of Texas, who helped lead federal efforts to protect women from domestic violence and recognize Juneteenth as a national holiday, has died. She was 74.\n\nLillie Conley, her chief of staff, confirmed that Jackson Lee, who had pancreatic cancer, died in Houston Friday night with her family around her.\n\nThe Democrat had represented her Houston-based district and the nation's fourth-largest city since 1995. She had previously had breast cancer and announced the pancreatic cancer diagnosis on June 2.\n\n\"The road ahead will not be easy, but I stand in faith that God will strengthen me,\" Jackson Lee said in a statement then.\n\nJackson Lee was \"a towering figure in our politics,\" President Joe Biden said in a statement Saturday. \"Always fearless, she spoke truth to power and represented the power of the people of her district in Houston with dignity and grace.\"\n\nBiden said Jackson Lee's spirit was unbreakable.\n\n\"I had the honor of working with her during her nearly 30 years in Congress,\" Biden said. \"No matter the issue -- from delivering racial justice to building an economy for working people -- she was unrelenting in her leadership.\"\n\nBishop James Dixon, a longtime friend in Houston who visited Jackson Lee earlier this week, said he will remember her as a fighter.\n\n\"She was just a rare, rare jewel of a person who relentlessly gave everything she had to make sure others had what they needed.

The few times she faced a challenger, she never carried less than two-thirds of the vote. Jackson Lee considered leaving Congress in 2023 in a bid to become Houston's first female Black mayor but was defeated in a runoff. She then easily won the Democratic nomination for the 2024 general election.\n\nDuring the mayoral campaign, Jackson Lee expressed regret and said \"everyone deserves to be treated with dignity and respect\" following the release of an unverified audio recording purported to be of the lawmaker berating staff members.\n\nIn 2019, Jackson Lee stepped down from two leadership positions on the House Judiciary Committee and Congressional Black Caucus Foundation, the fundraising of the Congressional Black Caucus, following a lawsuit from a former employee who said her sexual assault complaint was mishandled.\n\nIn a statement, Jackson Lee's family said she had been a beloved wife, sister, mother and grandmother known as Bebe.\n\n\"She will be dearly missed, but her legacy will continue to inspire all who believe in freedom, justice, and democracy,\" the statement said. \"God bless you Congresswoman and God bless the United States of America.\"\n\nAssociated Press writer Lou Kesten

She then easily won the Democratic nomination for the 2024 general election.\n\nDuring the mayoral campaign, Jackson Lee expressed regret and said \"everyone deserves to be treated with dignity and respect\" following the release of an unverified audio recording purported to be of the lawmaker berating staff members.\n\nIn 2019, Jackson Lee stepped down from two leadership positions on the House Judiciary Committee and Congressional Black Caucus Foundation, the fundraising of the Congressional Black Caucus, following a lawsuit from a former employee who said her sexual assault complaint was mishandled.\n\nIn a statement, Jackson Lee's family said she had been a beloved wife, sister, mother and grandmother known as Bebe.\n\n\"She will be dearly missed, but her legacy will continue to inspire all who believe in freedom, justice, and democracy,\" the statement said. \"God bless you Congresswoman and God bless the United States of America.\"\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writer Lou

She led the first rewrite of the Violence Against Women Act in nearly a decade, which included protections for Native American, transgender and immigrant women.\n\nJackson Lee was also among the lead lawmakers behind the effort in 2021 to have Juneteenth recognized as the first new federal holiday since Martin Luther King, Jr. Day was established in 1986. The holiday marks the day in 1865 that the last enslaved African Americans in Galveston, Texas, finally learned of their freedom.\n\nA native of Queens, New York, Jackson Lee graduated from Yale and earned her law degree at the University of Virginia. She was a judge in Houston before she was elected to Houston City Council in 1989, then ran for Congress in 1994. She was an advocate for gay rights and an early opponent of the Iraq War in 2003.\n\nIn March, she beat Amanda Edwards in the Democratic primary. The Houston lawmaker was on three Congressional committees. She was a senior member of the House Committee on the Judiciary, Homeland Security and the Budget Committee.\n\nFuneral arrangements are pending.\n\nRep.

That was Sheila,\" he said.\n\nFormer House Speaker Nancy Pelosi of California cited Jackson Lee's \"relentless determination\" in getting Juneteenth declared a national holiday.\n\n\"As a powerful voice in the Congress for our Constitution and human rights, she fought tirelessly to advance fairness, equity and justice for all,\" Pelosi said.\n\nRepublican Texas Gov. Greg Abbott said he and his wife Cecilia will always remember Jackson Lee, calling her a \"tireless advocate for the people of Houston.\"\n\n\"Her legacy of public service and dedication to Texas will live on,\" he said.\n\nFormer Houston Mayor Sylvester Turner issued this statement after learning of Jackson Lee's death:\n\n\"I am deeply saddened by the death of my dear friend and colleague, Congresswoman Sheila Jackson Lee. From City Hall to the Halls of Congress, Sheila Jackson Lee has served her constituents well. She has written and passed key legislation and has stood on the floor of the United States House of Representatives speaking passionately for the interests of her district and the country she loved. She has worked with and advised Presidents of our great country, met with global leaders, and has been embraced by world renowned artists. But her work on the ground, in some of the poorest and under-resourced communities; the channeling of billions of federal dollars back to her district; her presence at someone's bedside, giving words of comfort to families who lost loved ones; her appearances at places of worship and events showcasing the global diversity of our City; and her uncanny ability to be everywhere, working every day for those who needed a champion, made her truly exceptional.\n\n\"When she was elected to the United States House of Representatives she stood in the shadow of Barbara Jordan, Mickey Leland and Craig Washington. Without question, she rose to the occasion and served with great distinction. Even if you disagreed with her politics, you had to respect her work ethic. We can honestly say Sheila Jackson Lee left it all on the field. Rest in peace my sister. Thank you for all you gave us. And, thank you to her family for sharing her with us. We will not forget her sacrifice or yours. Sheila - to God be the glory for the good you have done. It was truly a job well done!\"\n\nRep. Wesley Hunt released this statement on Jackson Lee's death:\n\n\"It is with profound sadness that I acknowledge the passing of Congresswoman Sheila Jackson Lee, a devoted leader, a proud-fellow Houstonian, and someone who I was proud to call a friend.\n\n\"Although we had our political disagreements, there were many moments with her, both public and private, that showed me that bipartisanship and service to country first can still bring members of Congress together.\n\n\"In these divided times, Congresswoman Lee and I were able to partner on several legislative initiatives for the city of the Houston. Her steadfast commitment to serving the people of Houston and her tireless work have left an indelible mark on our community and our nation.", "source": {"uri": "wkyc.com", "dataType": "news",

Sheila Jackson Lee of Texas, who helped lead federal efforts to protect women from domestic violence and recognize Juneteenth as a national holiday, has died. She was 74.\n\nLillie Conley, her chief of staff, confirmed that Jackson Lee, who had pancreatic cancer, died in Houston Friday night with her family around her.\n\nThe Democrat had represented her Houston-based district and the nation's fourth-largest city since 1995. She had previously had breast cancer and announced the pancreatic cancer diagnosis on June 2.\n\n\"The road ahead will not be easy, but I stand in faith that God will strengthen me,\" Jackson Lee said in a statement then.\n\nJackson Lee was \"a towering figure in our politics,\" President Joe Biden said in a statement Saturday. \"Always fearless, she spoke truth to power and represented the power of the people of her district in Houston with dignity and grace.\"\n\nBiden said Jackson Lee's spirit was unbreakable.\n\n\"I had the honor of working with her during her nearly 30 years in Congress,\" Biden said. \"No matter the issue -- from delivering racial justice to building an economy for working people -- she was unrelenting in her leadership.\"\n\nBishop James Dixon, a longtime friend in Houston who visited Jackson Lee earlier this week, said he will remember her as a fighter.\n\n\"She was just a rare, rare jewel of a person who relentlessly gave everything she had to make sure others had what they needed. That was Sheila,\" he said.\n\nJackson Lee had just been elected to the Houston district once represented by Barbara Jordan, the first Black woman elected to Congress from a Southern state since Reconstruction, when she was immediately placed on the high-profile House Judiciary Committee in 1995.\n\n\"They just saw me, I guess through my profile, through Barbara Jordan's work,\" Jackson Lee told the Houston Chronicle in 2022. \"I thought it was an honor because they assumed I was going to be the person they needed.\"\n\nJackson Lee quickly established herself as fierce advocate for women and minorities, and a leader for House Democrats on many social justice issues, from policing reform to reparations for descendants of enslaved people. She led the first rewrite of the Violence Against Women Act in nearly a decade, which included protections for Native American, transgender and immigrant women.\n\nJackson Lee was also among the lead lawmakers behind the effort in 2021 to have Juneteenth recognized as the first new federal holiday since Martin Luther King, Jr. Day was established in 1986. The holiday marks the day in 1865 that the last enslaved African Americans in Galveston, Texas, finally learned of their freedom.\n\nA native of Queens, New York, Jackson Lee graduated from Yale and earned her law degree at the University of Virginia. She was a judge in Houston before she was elected to Houston City Council in 1989, then ran for Congress in 1994. She was an advocate for gay rights and an early opponent of the Iraq War in 2003.\n\nTop congressional Democrats reacted quickly to the news Friday night, praising her commitment and work ethic.\n\nRep. James Clyburn of South Carolina called her \"a tenacious advocate for civil rights and a tireless fighter, improving the lives of her constituents.\"\n\nRep. Jamie Raskin of Maryland said he had never known a harder-working lawmaker than Jackson Lee, saying she \"studied every bill and every amendment with exactitude and then told Texas and America exactly where she stood.\"\n\nFormer House Speaker Nancy Pelosi of California cited Jackson Lee's \"relentless determination\" in getting Juneteenth declared a national holiday.\n\n\"As a powerful voice in the Congress for our Constitution and human rights, she fought tirelessly to advance fairness, equity and justice for all,\" Pelosi said.\n\nRepublican Texas Gov. Greg Abbott said he and his wife Cecilia will always remember Jackson Lee, calling her a \"tireless advocate for the people of Houston.\"\n\n\"Her legacy of public service and dedication to Texas will live on,\" he said.\n\nJackson Lee routinely won reelection to Congress with ease. The few times she faced a challenger, she never carried less than two-thirds of the vote. Jackson Lee considered leaving Congress in 2023 in a bid to become Houston's first female Black mayor but was defeated in a runoff. She then easily won the Democratic nomination for the 2024 general election.\n\nDuring the mayoral campaign, Jackson Lee expressed regret and said \"everyone deserves to be treated with dignity and respect\" following the release of an unverified audio recording purported to be of the lawmaker berating staff members.\n\nIn 2019, Jackson Lee stepped down from two leadership positions on the House Judiciary Committee and Congressional Black Caucus Foundation, the fundraising of the Congressional Black Caucus, following a lawsuit from a former employee who said her sexual assault complaint was mishandled.\n\nIn a statement, Jackson Lee's family said she had been a beloved wife, sister, mother and grandmother known as Bebe.\n\n\"She will be dearly missed, but her legacy will continue to inspire all who believe in freedom, justice, and democracy,\" the statement said. \"God bless you Congresswoman and God bless the United States of America.\"\n\nAssociated Press writer Lou Kesten

She was 74.\n\nLillie Conley, her chief of staff, confirmed that Jackson Lee, who had pancreatic cancer, died in Houston Friday night with her family around her.\n\nThe Democrat had represented her Houston-based district and the nation's fourth-largest city since 1995. She had previously had breast cancer and announced the pancreatic cancer diagnosis on June 2.\n\n\"The road ahead will not be easy, but I stand in faith that God will strengthen me,\" Jackson Lee said in a statement then.\n\nBishop James Dixon, a longtime friend in Houston who visited Jackson Lee earlier this week, said he will remember her as a fighter.\n\n\"She was just a rare, rare jewel of a person who relentlessly gave everything she had to make sure others had what they needed. That was Sheila,\" he said.\n\nJackson Lee had just been elected to the Houston district once represented by Barbara Jordan, the first Black woman elected to Congress from a Southern state since Reconstruction, when she was immediately placed on the high-profile House Judiciary Committee in 1995.\n\nJudge Ketanji Brown Jackson (right) is greeted by U.S. Rep.

The holiday marks the day in 1865 that the last enslaved African Americans in Galveston, Texas, finally learned of their freedom.\n\nA native of Queens, New York, Jackson Lee graduated from Yale and earned her law degree at the University of Virginia. She was a judge in Houston before she was elected to Houston City Council in 1989, then ran for Congress in 1994. She was an advocate for gay rights and an early opponent of the Iraq War in 2003.\n\nTop congressional Democrats reacted quickly to the news Friday night, praising her commitment and work ethic.\n\nRep.

Judiciary Committee and Congressional Black Caucus Foundation, the fundraising of the Congressional Black Caucus, following a lawsuit from a former employee who said her sexual assault complaint was

She served on the Houston City Council from 1989 to 1994 and was elected to the United States House of Representatives in 1995.\n\nIn March, she beat Amanda Edwards in the Democratic primary. The Houston lawmaker was on three Congressional committees. She was a senior member of the House Committee on the Judiciary, Homeland Security and the Budget Committee.\n\nFuneral arrangements are pending.\n\nRep. Al Green spoke to KHOU 11 anchors Len Cannon and Mia Gradney after learning of Jackson Lee's passing:\n\nBishop James Dixon, a longtime friend in Houston who visited Jackson Lee earlier this week, said he will remember her as a fighter.\n\n\"She was just a rare, rare jewel of a person who relentlessly gave everything she had to make sure others had what they needed.

From City Hall to the Halls of Congress, Sheila Jackson Lee has served her constituents well. She has written and passed key legislation and has stood on the floor of the United States House of Representatives speaking passionately for the interests of her district and the country she loved. She has worked with and advised Presidents of our great country, met with global leaders, and has been embraced by world renowned artists. But her work on the ground, in some of the poorest and under-resourced communities; the channeling of billions of federal dollars back to her district; her presence at someone's bedside, giving words of comfort to families who lost loved ones; her appearances at places of worship and events showcasing the global diversity of our City; and her uncanny ability to be everywhere, working every day for those who needed a champion, made her truly exceptional.\n\n\"When she was elected to the United States House of Representatives she stood in the shadow of Barbara Jordan, Mickey Leland and Craig Washington. Without question, she rose to the occasion and served with great distinction. Even if you disagreed with her politics, you had to respect her work ethic. We can honestly say Sheila Jackson Lee left it all on the field. Rest in peace my sister. Thank you for all you gave us. And, thank you to her family for sharing her with us. We will not forget her sacrifice or yours. Sheila - to God be the glory for the good you have done. It was truly a job well done!\"\n\nRep. Wesley Hunt released this statement on Jackson Lee's death:\n\n\"It is with profound sadness that I acknowledge the passing of Congresswoman Sheila Jackson Lee, a devoted leader, a proud-fellow Houstonian, and someone who I was proud to call a friend.\n\n\"Although we had our political disagreements, there were many moments with her, both public and private, that showed me that bipartisanship and service to country first can still bring members of Congress together.\n\n\"In these divided times, Congresswoman Lee and I were able to partner on several legislative initiatives for the city of the Houston. Her steadfast commitment to serving the people of Houston and her tireless work have left an indelible mark on our community and our nation.", "source": {"uri": "whas11.com", "dataType": "news",

Sheila Jackson Lee of Texas, who had pancreatic cancer, has died", "body": "U.S. Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee, center, D-Texas, speaks during an immigration rally April 10, 2006, in Guadalupe Plaza in Houston, Texas. Donna Carson/Associated Press\n\nLongtime U.S. Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee of Texas, who helped lead federal efforts to protect women from domestic violence and recognize Juneteenth as a national holiday, has died. She was 74.\n\nLillie Conley, her chief of staff, confirmed that Jackson Lee, who had pancreatic cancer, died in Houston Friday night with her family around her.\n\nThe Democrat had represented her Houston-based district and the nation's fourth-largest city since 1995. She had previously had breast cancer and announced the pancreatic cancer diagnosis on June 2.\n\n\"The road ahead will not be easy, but I stand in faith that God will strengthen me,\" Jackson Lee said in a statement then.\n\nBishop James Dixon, a longtime friend in Houston who visited Jackson Lee earlier this week, said he will remember her as a fighter.\n\n\"She was just a rare, rare jewel of a person who relentlessly gave everything she had to make sure others had what they needed. That was Sheila,\" he said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJackson Lee had just been elected to the Houston district once represented by Barbara Jordan, the first Black woman elected to Congress from a Southern state since Reconstruction, when she was immediately placed on the high-profile House Judiciary Committee in 1995.\n\n\"They just saw me, I guess through my profile, through Barbara Jordan's work,\" Jackson Lee told the Houston Chronicle in 2022. \"I thought it was an honor because they assumed I was going to be the person they needed.\"\n\nJackson Lee quickly established herself as fierce advocate for women and minorities, and a leader for House Democrats on many social justice issues, from policing reform to reparations for descendants of enslaved people. She led the first rewrite of the Violence Against Women Act in nearly a decade, which included protections for Native American, transgender and immigrant women.\n\nJackson Lee was also among the lead lawmakers behind the effort in 2021 to have Juneteenth recognized as the first new federal holiday since Martin Luther King, Jr. Day was established in 1986. The holiday marks the day in 1865 that the last enslaved African Americans in Galveston, Texas, finally learned of their freedom.\n\nA native of Queens, New York, Jackson Lee graduated from Yale and earned her law degree at the University of Virginia. She was a judge in Houston before she was elected to Houston City Council in 1989, then ran for Congress in 1994. She was an advocate for gay rights and an early opponent of the Iraq War in 2003.\n\nTop congressional Democrats reacted quickly to the news Friday night, praising her commitment and work ethic.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRep. James Clyburn of South Carolina called her \"a tenacious advocate for civil rights and a tireless fighter, improving the lives of her constituents.\"\n\nRep. Jamie Raskin of Maryland said he had never known a harder-working lawmaker than Jackson Lee, saying she \"studied every bill and every amendment with exactitude and then told Texas and America exactly where she stood.\"\n\nRep. Shelia Jackson Lee, D-Texas, speaks during a House Judiciary Committee meeting, Dec. 13, 2019, on Capitol Hill in Washington. Patrick Semansky/Associated Press\n\nFormer House Speaker Nancy Pelosi of California cited Jackson Lee's \"relentless determination\" in getting Juneteenth declared a national holiday.\n\n\"As a powerful voice in the Congress for our Constitution and human rights, she fought tirelessly to advance fairness, equity and justice for all,\" Pelosi said.\n\nRepublican Texas Gov. Greg Abbott said he and his wife Cecilia will always remember Jackson Lee, calling her a \"tireless advocate for the people of Houston.\"\n\n\"Her legacy of public service and dedication to Texas will live on,\" he said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJackson Lee routinely won reelection to Congress with ease. The few times she faced a challenger, she never carried less than two-thirds of the vote. Jackson Lee considered leaving Congress in 2023 in a bid to become Houston's first female Black mayor but was defeated in a runoff. She then easily won the Democratic nomination for the 2024 general election.\n\nDuring the mayoral campaign, Jackson Lee expressed regret and said \"everyone deserves to be treated with dignity and respect\" following the release of an unverified audio recording purported to be of the lawmaker berating staff members.\n\nIn 2019, Jackson Lee stepped down from two leadership positions on the House Judiciary Committee and Congressional Black Caucus Foundation, the fundraising of the Congressional Black Caucus, following a lawsuit from a former employee who said her sexual assault complaint was mishandled.\n\nIn a statement, Jackson Lee's family said she had been a beloved wife, sister, mother and grandmother known as Bebe.\n\n\"She will be dearly missed, but her legacy will continue to inspire all who believe in freedom, justice, and democracy,\" the statement said. \"God bless you Congresswoman and God bless the United States of America.\"\n\nCopy the Story Link\n\nSend

Sheila Jackson Lee of Texas has died at age 74", "body": "Rep. Shelia Jackson Lee, D-Texas, speaks during a House Judiciary Committee meeting on Dec. 13, 2019 on Capitol Hill in Washington, D.C. Patrick Semansky/AP Pool hide caption\n\nLongtime U.S. Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee of Texas, who helped lead federal efforts to protect women from domestic violence and recognize Juneteenth as a national holiday, has died. She was 74.\n\nLillie Conley, her chief of staff, confirmed that Jackson Lee, who had pancreatic cancer, died in Houston Friday night with her family around her.\n\nThe Democrat had represented her Houston-based district and the nation's fourth-largest city since 1995. She had previously had breast cancer and announced the pancreatic cancer diagnosis on June 2.\n\n\"The road ahead will not be easy, but I stand in faith that God will strengthen me,\" Jackson Lee said in a statement then.\n\nBishop James Dixon, a longtime friend in Houston who visited Jackson Lee earlier this week, said he will remember her as a fighter.\n\n\"She was just a rare, rare jewel of a person who relentlessly gave everything she had to make sure others had what they needed. That was Sheila,\" he said.\n\nJackson Lee had just been elected to the Houston district once represented by Barbara Jordan, the first Black woman elected to Congress from a Southern state since Reconstruction, when she was immediately placed on the high-profile House Judiciary Committee in 1995.\n\n\"They just saw me, I guess through my profile, through Barbara Jordan's work,\" Jackson Lee told the Houston Chronicle in 2022. \"I thought it was an honor because they assumed I was going to be the person they needed.\"\n\nJackson Lee quickly established herself as fierce advocate for women and minorities, and a leader for House Democrats on many social justice issues, from policing reform to reparations for descendants of enslaved people. She led the first rewrite of the Violence Against Women Act in nearly a decade, which included protections for Native American, transgender and immigrant women.\n\nJackson Lee was also among the lead lawmakers behind the effort in 2021 to have Juneteenth recognized as the first new federal holiday since Martin Luther King, Jr. Day was established in 1986. The holiday marks the day in 1865 that the last enslaved African Americans in Galveston, Texas, finally learned of their freedom.\n\nA native of Queens, New York, Jackson Lee graduated from Yale and earned her law degree at the University of Virginia. She was a judge in Houston before she was elected to Houston City Council in 1989, then ran for Congress in 1994. She was an advocate for gay rights and an early opponent of the Iraq War in 2003.\n\nTop congressional Democrats reacted quickly to the news Friday night, praising her commitment and work ethic.\n\nRep. James Clyburn of South Carolina called her \"a tenacious advocate for civil rights and a tireless fighter, improving the lives of her constituents.\"\n\nRep. Jamie Raskin of Maryland said he had never known a harder-working lawmaker than Jackson Lee, saying she \"studied every bill and every amendment with exactitude and then told Texas and America exactly where she stood.\"\n\nFormer House Speaker Nancy Pelosi of California cited Jackson Lee's \"relentless determination\" in getting Juneteenth declared a national holiday.\n\n\"As a powerful voice in the Congress for our Constitution and human rights, she fought tirelessly to advance fairness, equity and justice for all,\" Pelosi said.\n\nRepublican Texas Gov. Greg Abbott said he and his wife Cecilia will always remember Jackson Lee, calling her a \"tireless advocate for the people of Houston.\"\n\n\"Her legacy of public service and dedication to Texas will live on,\" he said.\n\nJackson Lee routinely won reelection to Congress with ease. The few times she faced a challenger, she never carried less than two-thirds of the vote. Jackson Lee considered leaving Congress in 2023 in a bid to become Houston's first female Black mayor but was defeated in a runoff. She then easily won the Democratic nomination for the 2024 general election.\n\nDuring the mayoral campaign, Jackson Lee expressed regret and said \"everyone deserves to be treated with dignity and respect\" following the release of an unverified audio recording purported to be of the lawmaker berating staff members.\n\nIn 2019, Jackson Lee stepped down from two leadership positions on the House Judiciary Committee and Congressional Black Caucus Foundation, the fundraising of the Congressional Black Caucus, following a lawsuit from a former employee who said her sexual assault complaint was mishandled.\n\nIn a statement, Jackson Lee's family said she had been a beloved wife, sister, mother and grandmother known as Bebe.\n\n\"She will be dearly missed, but her legacy will continue to inspire all who believe in freedom, justice, and democracy,\" the statement said. \"God bless you Congresswoman and God bless the United States of America.\"", "source": {"uri": "npr.org", "dataType":

Sheila Jackson Lee Dead at 74, 6 Weeks After Revealing Pancreatic Cancer Diagnosis", "body": "The Texas Democrat, who represented Houston in Congress for three decades, warned that \"the road ahead will not be easy\" as she disclosed her cancer diagnosis in June 2024\n\nTexas Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee, who previously revealed her pancreatic cancer diagnosis, has died, her family announced on Friday, July 19. She was 74.\n\n\"Today, with incredible grief for our loss yet deep gratitude for the life she shared with us, we announce the passing of United States Representative Sheila Jackson Lee of the 18th Congressional District of Texas,\" the statement began.\n\nSaluting Jackson Lee as \"a fierce champion for the people,\" who was \"affectionately and simply known as 'Congresswoman' by her constituents,\" her loved ones noted that she served for over three decades.\n\n\"A local, national, and international humanitarian, she was acknowledged worldwide for her courageous fights for racial justice, criminal justice, and human rights, with a special emphasis on women on children.\"\n\nRelated: Congresswoman Sheila Jackson Lee Reveals Pancreatic Cancer Diagnosis: 'The Road Ahead Will Not Be Easy'\n\nThroughout her time in office, Jackson Lee garnered \"legislative victories\" that \"impacted millions,\" from solidifying Juneteenth as a Federal Holiday to her work with the Violence Against Women Act, her family continued.\n\nStill, she was also a staple and matriarch in her family unit as a wife, sister mother and grandmother, known as Bebe.\n\n\"She will be dearly missed, but her legacy will continue to inspire all who believe in freedom, justice, and democracy. God bless you Congresswoman and God bless the United States of America.\n\nJackson Lee, who represented the 18th Congressional District of Texas since 1995, announced her cancer diagnosis in a statement on June 2, 2024. She warned that she would be \"occasionally absent from Congress\" but would continue to fight for her constituents.\n\n\"I am committed to working with our Congressional Leadership, including Leader Hakeem Jeffries and the Speaker of House, to serve this nation and be present for votes on legislation that is critical for the prosperity and security of the American people,\" she said. \"By God's grace, I will be back at full strength soon.\"\n\nJackson Lee survived breast cancer more than a decade earlier, announcing in 2012 that she had fully recovered following a year of treatment.\n\nJackson Lee was born in Queens, New York City, on Jan. 12, 1950, and lived there through high school. She studied political science at Yale University before earning her J.D. from the University of Virginia School of Law in 1975.\n\nIn the late '70s, Jackson Lee aided the U.S. House Select Committee on Assassinations, serving as staff counsel to the task force that investigated Martin Luther King Jr.'s murder. She and her husband then relocated to Houston, where he'd accepted a teaching job.\n\nIn Texas, Jackson Lee proved eager to get involved. She was appointed to a municipal judgeship in 1987, then elected to the Houston City Council in 1989 as one of the first Black and female at-Large members.\n\nShe soon set her sights on Congress, handily winning the 1994 Democratic primary against four-time incumbent Rep. Craig Washington and gliding to victory in the general election.\n\nThrough her decades in Congress, Jackson Lee was instrumental in making Juneteenth a national holiday and pushing for legislation related to police misconduct, wage discrimination on the basis of sex, and accommodations for pregnant workers among other initiatives.\n\nJackson Lee ran for mayor of Houston in 2023, though her campaign was plagued by scandal after unverified audio leaked where Jackson Lee was allegedly heard berating her staff with profanity. Jackson Lee issued a statement and apologized, saying, \"I know that I am not perfect.\"\n\nThough she advanced to a runoff in the general election, she lost the race in a landslide to prominent state Sen. John Whitmire. She filed for reelection to the House two days later.\n\nNever miss a story -- sign up for PEOPLE's free daily newsletter to stay up-to-date on the best of what PEOPLE has to offer.\n\nDuring Jackson Lee's 2024 congressional campaign, President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris commended her career in a joint endorsement.\n\n\"We've witnessed her devotion to her constituents, inspiring grit, and invaluable experience deliver an unmatched record of success,\" they wrote. \"She has been a strong ally for hard working American families -- in Houston and across the country.\"\n\nJackson Lee is survived by her husband, Elwyn Lee, and their two children.", "source": {"uri": "ca.news.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Sign up to stay connected.\n\nLongtime U.S. Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee of Texas, who helped lead federal efforts to protect women from domestic violence and recognize Juneteenth as a national holiday, has died. She was 74.\n\nLillie Conley, her chief of staff, confirmed that Jackson Lee, who had pancreatic cancer, died in Houston Friday night with her family around her.\n\nThe Democrat had represented her Houston-based district and the nation's fourth-largest city since 1995. She had previously had breast cancer and announced the pancreatic cancer diagnosis on June 2.\n\n\"The road ahead will not be easy, but I stand in faith that God will strengthen me,\" Jackson Lee said in a statement then.\n\nBishop James Dixon, a longtime friend in Houston who visited Jackson Lee earlier this week, said he will remember her as a fighter.\n\n\"She was just a rare, rare jewel of a person who relentlessly gave everything she had to make sure others had what they needed. That was Sheila,\" he said.\n\nJackson Lee had just been elected to the Houston district once represented by Barbara Jordan, the first Black woman elected to Congress from a Southern state since Reconstruction, when she was immediately placed on the high-profile House Judiciary Committee in 1995.\n\n\"They just saw me, I guess through my profile, through Barbara Jordan's work,\" Jackson Lee told the Houston Chronicle in 2022. \"I thought it was an honor because they assumed I was going to be the person they needed.\"\n\nJackson Lee quickly established herself as a fierce advocate for women and minorities, and a leader for House Democrats on many social justice issues, from policing reform to reparations for descendants of enslaved people. She led the first rewrite of the Violence Against Women Act in nearly a decade, which included protections for Native American, transgender and immigrant women.\n\nJackson Lee was also among the lead lawmakers behind the effort in 2021 to have Juneteenth recognized as the first new federal holiday since Martin Luther King, Jr. Day was established in 1986. The holiday marks the day in 1865 that the last enslaved African Americans in Galveston, Texas, finally learned of their freedom.\n\nA native of Queens, New York, Jackson Lee graduated from Yale and earned her law degree at the University of Virginia. She was a judge in Houston before she was elected to Houston City Council in 1989, then ran for Congress in 1994. She was an advocate for gay rights and an early opponent of the Iraq War in 2003.\n\nTop congressional Democrats reacted quickly to the news Friday night, praising her commitment and work ethic.\n\nRep. James Clyburn of South Carolina called her \"a tenacious advocate for civil rights and a tireless fighter, improving the lives of her constituents.\"\n\nRep. Jamie Raskin of Maryland said he had never known a harder-working lawmaker than Jackson Lee, saying she \"studied every bill and every amendment with exactitude and then told Texas and America exactly where she stood.\"\n\nFormer House Speaker Nancy Pelosi of California cited Jackson Lee's \"relentless determination\" in getting Juneteenth declared a national holiday.\n\n\"As a powerful voice in the Congress for our Constitution and human rights, she fought tirelessly to advance fairness, equity and justice for all,\" Pelosi said.\n\nRepublican Texas Gov. Greg Abbott said he and his wife Cecilia will always remember Jackson Lee, calling her a \"tireless advocate for the people of Houston.\"\n\n\"Her legacy of public service and dedication to Texas will live on,\" he said.\n\nJackson Lee routinely won reelection to Congress with ease. The few times she faced a challenger, she never carried less than two-thirds of the vote. Jackson Lee considered leaving Congress in 2023 in a bid to become Houston's first female Black mayor but was defeated in a runoff. She then easily won the Democratic nomination for the 2024 general election.\n\nDuring the mayoral campaign, Jackson Lee expressed regret and said \"everyone deserves to be treated with dignity and respect\" following the release of an unverified audio recording purported to be of the lawmaker berating staff members.\n\nIn 2019, Jackson Lee stepped down from two leadership positions on the House Judiciary Committee and Congressional Black Caucus Foundation, the fundraising of the Congressional Black Caucus, following a lawsuit from a former employee who said her sexual assault complaint was mishandled.\n\nIn a statement, Jackson Lee's family said she had been a beloved wife, sister, mother and grandmother known as Bebe.\n\n\"She will be dearly missed, but her legacy will continue to inspire all who believe in freedom, justice, and democracy,\" the statement said. \"God bless you Congresswoman and God bless the United States of America.\"\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writer Lou

Sheila Jackson Lee, who previously revealed her pancreatic cancer diagnosis, has died, her family announced on Friday, July 19. She was 74.\n\n\"Today, with incredible grief for our loss yet deep gratitude for the life she shared with us, we announce the passing of United States Representative Sheila Jackson Lee of the 18th Congressional District of Texas,\" the statement began.\n\nSaluting Jackson Lee as \"a fierce champion for the people,\" who was \"affectionately and simply known as 'Congresswoman' by her constituents,\" her loved ones noted that she served for over three decades.\n\n\"A local, national, and international humanitarian, she was acknowledged worldwide for her courageous fights for racial justice, criminal justice, and human rights, with a special emphasis on women on children.\"\n\nThroughout her time in office, Jackson Lee garnered \"legislative victories\" that \"impacted millions,\" from solidifying Juneteenth as a Federal Holiday to her work with the Violence Against Women Act, her family continued.\n\nStill, she was also a staple and matriarch in her family unit as a wife, sister mother and grandmother, known as Bebe.\n\n\"She will be dearly missed, but her legacy will continue to inspire all who believe in freedom, justice, and democracy. God bless you Congresswoman and God bless the United States of America.\n\nFuneral arrangements are currently pending.\n\nJackson Lee, who represented the 18th Congressional District of Texas since 1995, announced her cancer diagnosis in a statement on June 2, 2024. She warned that she would be \"occasionally absent from Congress\" but would continue to fight for her constituents.\n\n\"I am committed to working with our Congressional Leadership, including Leader Hakeem Jeffries and the Speaker of House, to serve this nation and be present for votes on legislation that is critical for the prosperity and security of the American people,\" she said. \"By God's grace, I will be back at full strength soon.\"\n\nJackson Lee survived breast cancer more than a decade earlier, announcing in 2012 that she had fully recovered following a year of treatment.\n\nJackson Lee was born in Queens, New York City, on Jan. 12, 1950, and lived there through high school. She studied political science at Yale University before earning her J.D. from the University of Virginia School of Law in 1975.\n\nIn the late '70s, Jackson Lee aided the U.S. House Select Committee on Assassinations, serving as staff counsel to the task force that investigated Martin Luther King Jr.'s murder. She and her husband then relocated to Houston, where he'd accepted a teaching job.\n\nIn Texas, Jackson Lee proved eager to get involved. She was appointed to a municipal judgeship in 1987, then elected to the Houston City Council in 1989 as one of the first Black and female at-Large members.\n\nShe soon set her sights on Congress, handily winning the 1994 Democratic primary against four-time incumbent Rep. Craig Washington and gliding to victory in the general election.\n\nThrough her decades in Congress, Jackson Lee was instrumental in making Juneteenth a national holiday and pushing for legislation related to police misconduct, wage discrimination on the basis of sex, and accommodations for pregnant workers among other initiatives.\n\nJackson Lee ran for mayor of Houston in 2023, though her campaign was plagued by scandal after unverified audio leaked where Jackson Lee was allegedly heard berating her staff with profanity. Jackson Lee issued a statement and apologized, saying, \"I know that I am not perfect.\"\n\nThough she advanced to a runoff in the general election, she lost the race in a landslide to prominent state Sen. John Whitmire. She filed for reelection to the House two days later.\n\nNever miss a story -- sign up for PEOPLE's free daily newsletter to stay up-to-date on the best of what PEOPLE has to offer.\n\nDuring Jackson Lee's 2024 congressional campaign, President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris commended her career in a joint endorsement.\n\n\"We've witnessed her devotion to her constituents, inspiring grit, and invaluable experience deliver an unmatched record of success,\" they wrote. \"She has been a strong ally for hard working American families -- in Houston and across the country.\"\n\nJackson Lee is survived by her husband, Elwyn Lee, and their two children.", "source": {"uri": "people.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "PEOPLE.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Sheila Jackson Lee of Texas, who helped lead federal efforts to protect women from domestic violence and recognize Juneteenth as a national holiday, has died. She was 74.\n\nLillie Conley, her chief of staff, confirmed that Jackson Lee, who had pancreatic cancer, died in Houston Friday night with her family around her.\n\nThe Democrat had represented her Houston-based district and the nation's fourth-largest city since 1995. She had previously had breast cancer and announced the pancreatic cancer diagnosis on June 2.\n\n\"The road ahead will not be easy, but I stand in faith that God will strengthen me,\" Jackson Lee said in a statement then.\n\nBishop James Dixon, a longtime friend in Houston who visited Jackson Lee earlier this week, said he will remember her as a fighter.\n\n\"She was just a rare, rare jewel of a person who relentlessly gave everything she had to make sure others had what they needed. That was Sheila,\" he said.\n\nJackson Lee had just been elected to the Houston district once represented by Barbara Jordan, the first Black woman elected to Congress from a Southern state since Reconstruction, when she was immediately placed on the high-profile House Judiciary Committee in 1995.\n\n\"They just saw me, I guess through my profile, through Barbara Jordan's work,\" Jackson Lee told the Houston Chronicle in 2022. \"I thought it was an honor because they assumed I was going to be the person they needed.\"\n\nJackson Lee quickly established herself as fierce advocate for women and minorities, and a leader for House Democrats on many social justice issues, from policing reform to reparations for descendants of enslaved people. She led the first rewrite of the Violence Against Women Act in nearly a decade, which included protections for Native American, transgender and immigrant women.\n\nJackson Lee was also among the lead lawmakers behind the effort in 2021 to have Juneteenth recognized as the first new federal holiday since Martin Luther King, Jr. Day was established in 1986. The holiday marks the day in 1865 that the last enslaved African Americans in Galveston, Texas, finally learned of their freedom.\n\nA native of Queens, New York, Jackson Lee graduated from Yale and earned her law degree at the University of Virginia. She was a judge in Houston before she was elected to Houston City Council in 1989, then ran for Congress in 1994. She was an advocate for gay rights and an early opponent of the Iraq War in 2003.\n\nTop congressional Democrats reacted quickly to the news Friday night, praising her commitment and work ethic.\n\nRep. James Clyburn of South Carolina called her \"a tenacious advocate for civil rights and a tireless fighter, improving the lives of her constituents.\"\n\nRep. Jamie Raskin of Maryland said he had never known a harder-working lawmaker than Jackson Lee, saying she \"studied every bill and every amendment with exactitude and then told Texas and America exactly where she stood.\"\n\nFormer House Speaker Nancy Pelosi of California cited Jackson Lee's \"relentless determination\" in getting Juneteenth declared a national holiday.\n\n\"As a powerful voice in the Congress for our Constitution and human rights, she fought tirelessly to advance fairness, equity and justice for all,\" Pelosi said.\n\nRepublican Texas Gov. Greg Abbott said he and his wife Cecilia will always remember Jackson Lee, calling her a \"tireless advocate for the people of Houston.\"\n\n\"Her legacy of public service and dedication to Texas will live on,\" he said.\n\nJackson Lee routinely won reelection to Congress with ease. The few times she faced a challenger, she never carried less than two-thirds of the vote. Jackson Lee considered leaving Congress in 2023 in a bid to become Houston's first female Black mayor but was defeated in a runoff. She then easily won the Democratic nomination for the 2024 general election.\n\nDuring the mayoral campaign, Jackson Lee expressed regret and said \"everyone deserves to be treated with dignity and respect\" following the release of an unverified audio recording purported to be of the lawmaker berating staff members.\n\nIn 2019, Jackson Lee stepped down from two leadership positions on the House Judiciary Committee and Congressional Black Caucus Foundation, the fundraising of the Congressional Black Caucus, following a lawsuit from a former employee who said her sexual assault complaint was mishandled.\n\nIn a statement, Jackson Lee's family said she had been a beloved wife, sister, mother and grandmother known as Bebe.\n\n\"She will be dearly missed, but her legacy will continue to inspire all who believe in freedom, justice, and democracy,\" the statement said. \"God bless you Congresswoman and God bless the United States of America.\"\n\nAssociated Press writer Lou Kesten

She served on the Houston City Council from 1989 to 1994 and was elected to the United States House of Representatives in 1995.\n\nIn March, she beat Amanda Edwards in the Democratic primary.

From City Hall to the Halls of Congress, Sheila Jackson Lee has served her constituents well.

Without question, she rose to the occasion and served with great distinction. Even if you disagreed with her politics, you had to respect her work ethic. We can honestly say Sheila Jackson Lee left it all on the field. Rest in peace my sister. Thank you for all you gave us. And, thank you to her family for sharing her with us. We will not forget her sacrifice or yours. Sheila - to God be the glory for the good you have done. It was truly a job well done!\"\n\nRep. Wesley Hunt released this statement on Jackson Lee's death:\n\n\"It is with profound sadness that I acknowledge the passing of Congresswoman Sheila Jackson Lee, a devoted leader, a proud-fellow Houstonian, and someone who I was proud to call a friend.\n\n\"Although we had our political disagreements, there were many moments with her, both public and private, that showed me that bipartisanship and service to country first can still bring members of Congress together.\n\n\"In these divided times, Congresswoman Lee and I were able to partner on several legislative initiatives for the city of the Houston. Her steadfast commitment to serving the people of Houston and her tireless work have left an indelible mark on our community and our nation.", "source": {"uri": "firstcoastnews.com", "dataType":

Jackson Lee of Texas announced last month she had pancreatic cancer and was undergoing treatment. She was 74.\n\n\"The road ahead will not be easy, but I stand in faith that God will strengthen me,\" Jackson Lee, the chief deputy whip in the House of Representatives, said in announcing the diagnosis. Her family said in a statement that she was a local, national and international humanitarian, who fought for racial and criminal justice. \"A fierce champion of the people, she was affectionately and simply known as 'Congresswoman' by her constituents in recognition of her near-ubiquitous presence and service to their daily lives for more than 30 years.\"\n\nPresident Joe Biden, a fellow Democrat, said: \"Always fearless, she spoke truth to power and represented the power of the people of her district in Houston with dignity and grace.\" The 15-term representative, a graduate of Yale College and the University of Virginia Law School, promoted legislation addressing social justice, economic inequality and public health.\n\nJackson Lee, who represented parts of Houston, introduced legislation in the House to make \"Juneteenth\" a federal holiday commemorating the end of the legal enslavement of Black Americans. She was a vocal proponent of police reform in the face of congressional roadblocks after the 2020 police killing of George Floyd, a Black man whose death sparked nationwide protests.\n\nJackson Lee also led legislation in 2022 that re-authorized the Violence Against Women Act, which had expired in 2019. Fellow Democrat Brendan Boyle, ranking member of the House Budget Committee on which she served, called her \"a fierce advocate for the people of Houston and for racial and economic justice everywhere.\"\n\n\"The Congresswoman will be truly missed by all of us who served alongside her,\" he said in a statement. Jackson Lee also served on the U.S. House Judiciary and Homeland Security committees.\n\nJasmine Crockett, like Jackson Lee an African American representative from Texas but in her first term, posted on X: \"I'm at a loss for words so I'll just say rest easy, my friend, Congresswoman Sheila Jackson Lee.\" There were also tributes for Jackson Lee from some politicians at the other end of the political spectrum.\n\n\"While we rarely agreed on policy, I always enjoyed our spirited debates about law and policy, and I counted her as a friend,\" U.S. House of Representatives Speaker Mike Johnson, a Republican who served with her on the judiciary committee for seven years, said in a statement. Governor Greg Abbott, a conservative Republican, posted on X that his wife \"Cecilia and I will forever remember Congresswoman Sheila Jackson Lee,\" adding that \"her legacy of public service and dedication to Texas will live on.\"\n\nU.S. Senator Ted Cruz posted: \"I'm deeply saddened by the passing of my friend & colleague Sheila Jackson Lee. She was a tireless advocate for Houston.\" Jackson Lee considered leaving Congress in 2023 in a bid to become Houston's first female Black mayor, but was defeated in a run-off.\n\n(This story has not

Shelia Jackson Lee, D-Texas, speaks during a House Judiciary Committee meeting, Dec. 13, 2019, on Capitol Hill in Washington. Longtime U.S. Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee, who helped lead federal efforts to protect women from domestic violence and recognize Juneteenth as a national holiday, has died Friday, July 19, 2024, after battling pancreatic cancer, according to her chief of staff.\n\nBy Jim Vertuno, Associated Press\n\nFriday, July 19, 2024 | 9:26 p.m.\n\nLongtime U.S. Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee of Texas, who helped lead federal efforts to protect women from domestic violence and recognize Juneteenth as a national holiday, has died. She was 74.\n\nLillie Conley, her chief of staff, confirmed Friday night that Jackson Lee, who had pancreatic cancer, had died.\n\nThe Democrat had represented her Houston-based district and the nation's fourth-largest city since 1995. She had previously had breast cancer and announced the pancreatic cancer diagnosis on June 2.\n\n\"The road ahead will not be easy, but I stand in faith that God will strengthen me,\" Jackson Lee said in a statement then.\n\nJackson Lee had just been elected to the Houston district once represented by Barbara Jordan, the first Black woman elected to Congress from a Southern state since Reconstruction, when she was immediately placed on the high-profile House Judiciary Committee in 1995.\n\n\"They just saw me, I guess through my profile, through Barbara Jordan's work,\" Jackson Lee told the Houston Chronicle in 2022. \"I thought it was an honor because they assumed I was going to be the person they needed.\"\n\nJackson Lee quickly established herself as fierce advocate for women and minorities, and a leader for House Democrats on many social justice issues, from policing reform to reparations for descendants of enslaved people. She led the first rewrite of the Violence Against Women Act in nearly a decade, which included protections for Native American, transgender and immigrant women.\n\nJackson Lee was also among the lead lawmakers behind the effort in 2021 to have Juneteenth recognized as the first new federal holiday since Martin Luther King, Jr. Day was established in 1986. The holiday marks the day in 1865 that the last enslaved African Americans in Galveston, Texas, finally learned of their freedom.\n\nA native of Queens, New York, Jackson Lee graduated from Yale and earned her law degree at the University of Virginia. She was a judge in Houston before she was elected to Houston City Council in 1989, then ran for Congress in 1994. She was an advocate for gay rights and an early opponent of the Iraq War in 2003.\n\nJackson Lee routinely won reelection to Congress with ease. The few times she faced a challenger, she never carried less than two-thirds of the vote. Jackson Lee considered leaving Congress in 2023 in a bid to become Houston's first female Black mayor but was defeated in a runoff. She then easily won the Democratic nomination for the 2024 general election.\n\nDuring the mayoral campaign, Jackson Lee expressed regret and said \"everyone deserves to be treated with dignity and respect\" following the release of an unverified audio recording purported to be of the lawmaker berating staff members.\n\nIn 2019, Jackson Lee stepped down from two leadership positions on the House Judiciary Committee and Congressional Black Caucus Foundation, the fundraising of the Congressional Black Caucus, following a lawsuit from a former employee who said her sexual assault complaint was mishandled.", "source": {"uri": "lasvegassun.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Las Vegas Sun"}, "authors": [{"uri": "associated_press@lasvegassun.com", "name": "Associated Press", "type": "author",

Sheila Jackson Lee dies at age 74", "body": "Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee, a Houston Democrat who had served in Congress since 1995, has died.\n\nHer family announced her death on Friday evening: \"With incredible grief for our loss yet deep gratitude for the life she shared with us, we announce the passing of United States Representative Sheila Jackson Lee of the 18th Congressional District of Texas.\" Jackson Lee's death was confirmed by Lillie Conley, her chief of staff.\n\nJackson Lee was known as a strong advocate for women and minorities, serving in the same Texas district once represented by Barbara Jordan, the first African American woman elected to Congress from the South since the Reconstruction era of the 19th century,\n\nA vocal presence in the Congressional Black Caucus, Jackson Lee was known for her efforts to combat domestic violence through an expansion of the Violence Against Woman Act and also to have Juneteenth recognized as federal holiday, which occurred in 2021.\n\nThe holiday marks the day in 1865 that the last enslaved African Americans in Galveston, Texas, finally learned of their freedom.\n\nIn 2019, following in the footsteps of the late Rep. John Conyers (D-Mich.), she offered a proposal to study the idea of reparations for descendants of former slaves.\n\n\"We want to be responsive to all Americans and we know how diverse this country has become,\" Jackson Lee said in an interview at the time. \"We have consistently, as Democrats, wanted to say to the American people that we are for the people.\"\n\nThe proposal, however, did not advance.\n\nIn its obituary, the Texas Tribune noted how hard she had fought for Houston: \"She often used her trademark chutzpah to fight for federal funds to be sent to Houston. In 2009, she secured $1 billion for the city's light system after cornering then-Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood ahead of then-President Barack Obama's first joint address to Congress. She could reliably be found in the aisle ahead of the State of the Union address, among the few members to directly meet with the president on his way to the dais.\"\n\nTransportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg wrote on X: \"She was an extraordinary advocate for her district and her values, and her impact and achievements will be long remembered.\"\n\nFellow lawmakers in Texas saluted her legacy Friday night.\n\nRep. Colin Allred (D-Texas) wrote on X: \"Congresswoman Sheila Jackson Lee was a fierce advocate for Houston and her constituents. No one worked harder for her community and if Houston needed something, she got it done.\"\n\nAllred also said her death was a blow to the city of Houston, a remark echoed by Rep. Wesley Hunt (R-Texas) in a statement Friday night.\n\n\"It is with profound sadness that I acknowledge the passing of Congresswoman Sheila Jackson Lee, a devoted leader, a proud-fellow Houstonian, and someone who I was proud to call a friend,\" Hunt said.\n\nHe added: \"Although we had our political disagreements, there were many moments with her, both public and private, that showed me that bipartisanship and service to country first can still bring members of Congress together.\"\n\nSen. Ted Cruz also noted her advocacy for her home city. He wrote on X: \"I will always cherish our friendship & the laughs we shared throughout the years.\"\n\nA native of Queens, New York, who was born on Jan. 12, 1950, Jackson Lee graduated from Yale and earned her law degree at the University of Virginia.\n\nShe was a judge in Houston before she was elected to Houston City Council in 1989, then ran for Congress in 1994. She was an advocate for gay rights and an early opponent of the Iraq War in 2003.\n\nJackson Lee routinely won reelection to Congress with ease. The few times she faced a challenger, she never carried less than two-thirds of the vote. But last year, she ran for mayor of Houston only to be defeated by Democratic state Sen. John Whitmire in a runoff in December.\n\nAt her election night party in December, Jackson Lee thanked her supporters, congratulated Whitmire and said she was committed to working with him. \"It's sweeter to be saying what a sweet victory it is. It's equally as sweet to acknowledge we put up a good fight,\" Jackson Lee said.\n\nAlso, in 2019, Jackson Lee stepped down from two leadership positions on the House Judiciary Committee and Congressional Black Caucus Foundation, the fundraising of the Congressional Black Caucus, following a lawsuit from a former employee who said her sexual assault complaint was mishandled.\n\nIn June, Jackson Lee, who was seeking another term in Congress, announced that she has been diagnosed with pancreatic cancer and was undergoing treatment.\n\nThe 74-year-old said in a statement at the time that as a member of Congress, she has been honored to be a leader in the fight for justice and equality and will approach this more personal fight with faith and courage.\"\n\n\"I am confident that my doctors have developed the best possible plan to target my specific disease,\" Jackson Lee said. \"The road ahead will not be easy, but I stand in faith that God will strengthen me.\"", "source":

Sheila Jackson Lee, Who Had Pancreatic Cancer, Dead At 74", "body": "The Texas Democrat helped lead federal efforts to protect women from domestic violence and recognize Juneteenth as a national holiday.\n\nLongtime U.S. Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee of Texas, who helped lead federal efforts to protect women from domestic violence and recognize Juneteenth as a national holiday, has died. She was 74.\n\nLillie Conley, her chief of staff, confirmed Friday night that Jackson Lee, who had pancreatic cancer, had died.\n\nThe Democrat had represented her Houston-based district and the nation's fourth-largest city since 1995. She had previously had breast cancer and announced the pancreatic cancer diagnosis on June 2.\n\n\"The road ahead will not be easy, but I stand in faith that God will strengthen me,\" Jackson Lee said in a statement then.\n\nJackson Lee had just been elected to the Houston district once represented by Barbara Jordan, the first Black woman elected to Congress from a Southern state since Reconstruction, when she was immediately placed on the high-profile House Judiciary Committee in 1995.\n\n\"They just saw me, I guess through my profile, through Barbara Jordan's work,\" Jackson Lee told the Houston Chronicle in 2022. \"I thought it was an honor because they assumed I was going to be the person they needed.\"\n\nJackson Lee quickly established herself as fierce advocate for women and minorities, and a leader for House Democrats on many social justice issues, from policing reform to reparations for descendants of enslaved people. She led the first rewrite of the Violence Against Women Act in nearly a decade, which included protections for Native American, transgender and immigrant women.\n\nJackson Lee was also among the lead lawmakers behind the effort in 2021 to have Juneteenth recognized as the first new federal holiday since Martin Luther King, Jr. Day was established in 1986. The holiday marks the day in 1865 that the last enslaved African Americans in Galveston, Texas, finally learned of their freedom.\n\nA native of Queens, New York, Jackson Lee graduated from Yale and earned her law degree at the University of Virginia. She was a judge in Houston before she was elected to Houston City Council in 1989, then ran for Congress in 1994. She was an advocate for gay rights and an early opponent of the Iraq War in 2003.\n\nJackson Lee routinely won reelection to Congress with ease. The few times she faced a challenger, she never carried less than two-thirds of the vote. Jackson Lee considered leaving Congress in 2023 in a bid to become Houston's first female Black mayor but was defeated in a runoff. She then easily won the Democratic nomination for the 2024 general election.\n\nDuring the mayoral campaign, Jackson Lee expressed regret and said \"everyone deserves to be treated with dignity and respect\" following the release of an unverified audio recording purported to be of the lawmaker berating staff members.\n\nIn 2019, Jackson Lee stepped down from two leadership positions on the House Judiciary Committee and Congressional Black Caucus Foundation, the fundraising of the Congressional Black Caucus, following a lawsuit from a former employee who said her sexual assault complaint was mishandled.", "source": {"uri": "huffpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "HuffPost"}, "authors": [{"uri": "associated_press@huffpost.com", "name": "Associated Press", "type": "author", "isAgency":

After spending five years on the Houston city council, Jackson Lee ran for the district's House of Representative seat in 1994, winning easily. She officially began representing the district in January 1995, and remained in that position until her death Friday.\n\nThe family's statement continued, \"Her legislative victories impacted millions, from establishing the Juneteenth Federal Holiday to reauthorizing the Violence Against Women Act. However, she impacted us most as our beloved wife, sister, mother, and Bebe (grandmother). She will be dearly missed, but her legacy will continue to inspire all who believe in freedom, justice, and democracy. God bless you Congresswoman and God bless the United States of America.\"\n\nBill and Hillary Clinton said in a statement Saturday following Jackson Lee's death that she was \"a fearless fight for the people of Houston, one of country's most effective leaders, and a wonderful friend to Hillary and me. Throughout her nearly 30 years in Congress, she was an unwavering champion for women and children, a staunch advocate for sensible gun reform, a relentless defender of the Constitution and the cause of justice, an important leader with the Congressional Black Caucus, and so much more.\"\n\nSpeaker of the House Nancy Pelosi added of her \"dear friend\" in a statement, \"Congresswoman Jackson Lee achieved a remarkable legislative record in the Congress for Houston and for our country. As a powerful voice in the Congress for our Constitution and human rights, she fought tirelessly to advance fairness, equity and justice for all. In a testament to her relentless determination, Congresswoman Jackson Lee was the author and lead sponsor of legislation that established Juneteenth as the first new federal holiday in 38 years.

Sheila Jackson Lee of Texas has died of pancreatic cancer at 74", "body": "Longtime U.S. Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee of Texas, who helped lead federal efforts to protect women from domestic violence and recognize Juneteenth as a national holiday, has died at 74.\n\nLillie Conley, her chief of staff, said Jackson Lee, who had pancreatic cancer, died in Houston Friday night with her family around her.\n\nThe Democrat had represented her Houston-based district and the nation's fourth-largest city since 1995.\n\nShe previously had breast cancer and announced the pancreatic cancer diagnosis on June 2.\n\n\"She was just a rare, rare jewel of a person who relentlessly gave everything she had to make sure others had what they needed,\" said Bishop James Dixon, a longtime friend in Houston who visited her in recent days. \"That was Sheila.\"\n\nJackson Lee had just been elected to the Houston district once represented by Barbara Jordan, the first Black woman elected to Congress from a Southern state since Reconstruction, when she was immediately placed on the high-profile House Judiciary Committee in 1995.\n\n\"They just saw me, I guess through my profile, through Barbara Jordan's work,\" Jackson Lee told the Houston Chronicle in 2022. \"I thought it was an honor because they assumed I was going to be the person they needed.\"\n\nJackson Lee quickly established herself as an advocate for women and minorities and a leader for House Democrats on social justice issues that included policing reform and reparations for descendants of enslaved people. She led the first rewrite of the Violence Against Women Act in nearly a decade, which included protections for Native American, transgender and immigrant women.\n\nJackson Lee was among the lead lawmakers behind the effort in 2021 to recognize Juneteenth as the first new federal holiday since Martin Luther King, Jr. Day was established in 1986. The holiday marks the day in 1865 that the last enslaved African Americans in Galveston, Texas, finally learned of their freedom.\n\nA native of Queens, New York, Jackson Lee graduated from Yale and got a law degree from the University of Virginia. She was a judge in Houston before being elected to the Houston City Council in 1989, then ran for Congress in 1994.\n\nShe was an advocate for gay rights and an early opponent of the Iraq War in 2003.\n\nU.S. Rep. James Clyburn, D-South Carolina, called her \"a tenacious advocate for civil rights and a tireless fighter, improving the lives of her constituents.\"\n\nU.S. Rep. Jamie Raskin, D-Maryland, said she \"studied every bill and every amendment with exactitude and then told Texas and America exactly where she stood.\"\n\nFormer House Speaker Nancy Pelosi of California cited Jackson Lee's \"relentless determination\" in getting Juneteenth declared a national holiday.\n\n\"As a powerful voice in the Congress for our Constitution and human rights, she fought tirelessly to advance fairness, equity and justice for all,\" Pelosi said.\n\nRepublican Texas Gov. Greg Abbott called her a \"tireless advocate for the people of Houston.\"\n\nJackson Lee routinely won reelection to Congress with ease. The few times she faced a challenger, she never carried less than two-thirds of the vote. Jackson Lee considered leaving Congress in 2023 in a bid to become Houston's first female Black mayor but was defeated in a runoff.\n\nShe then easily won the Democratic nomination for the 2024 general election.\n\nDuring the mayoral campaign, Jackson Lee expressed regret and said \"everyone deserves to be treated with dignity and respect\" following the release of an unverified audio recording purported to be of her berating staff members.\n\nIn 2019, Jackson Lee stepped down from two leadership positions on the House Judiciary Committee and Congressional Black Caucus Foundation, the fundraising arm of the Congressional Black Caucus, after a lawsuit from a former employee who said her sexual assault complaint was mishandled.\n\n\"She will be dearly missed, but her legacy will continue to inspire all who believe in freedom, justice, and democracy,\" a written statement from her family said.", "source": {"uri": "chicago.suntimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Chicago

She was the lead sponsor of the Juneteenth National Independence Day Act, instrumental in the passage of the Sentencing Reform Act of 2015, and a driving force behind the George Floyd Law Enforcement Trust and Integrity Act.\n\nThe Texas Democrat also played a pivotal role in reauthorizing the Violence Against Women Act, which President Joe Biden signed in 2022.\n\nBorn in Queens, New York, Jackson Lee graduated from Yale University and the University of Virginia Law School. She started her career as a lawyer in private practice and as staff counsel for the House Select Committee on Assassinations. She went on to serve in Houston's government as a City Council member and municipal judge before her election to Congress. During her tenure, she sat on the Judiciary, Homeland Security, and Budget committees.\n\nIn 2023, Jackson Lee ran for mayor of Houston but lost in a runoff to state Sen. John Whitmire. She was subsequently reelected to her House seat.\n\nFuneral arrangements for the congresswoman are pending, according to her family. \"She will be dearly missed, but her legacy will continue to inspire all who believe in freedom, justice, and democracy,\" their statement concluded. \"God bless you, Congresswoman, and God bless the United States of America.\"\n\nCongresswoman Sheila Jackson

Sheila Jackson Lee of Texas, who helped lead federal efforts to protect women from domestic violence and recognize Juneteenth as a national holiday, has died. She was 74.\n\nLillie Conley, her chief of staff, confirmed that Jackson Lee, who had pancreatic cancer, died in Houston Friday night with her family around her.\n\nThe Democrat had represented her Houston-based district and the nation's fourth-largest city since 1995. She had previously had breast cancer and announced the pancreatic cancer diagnosis on June 2.\n\n\"The road ahead will not be easy, but I stand in faith that God will strengthen me,\" Jackson Lee said in a statement then.\n\nBishop James Dixon, a longtime friend in Houston who visited Jackson Lee earlier this week, said he will remember her as a fighter.\n\nPeople are also reading...

That was Sheila,\" he said.\n\nJackson Lee had just been elected to the Houston district once represented by Barbara Jordan, the first Black woman elected to Congress from a Southern state since Reconstruction, when she was immediately placed on the high-profile House Judiciary Committee in 1995.\n\n\"They just saw me, I guess through my profile, through Barbara Jordan's work,\" Jackson Lee told the Houston Chronicle in 2022. \"I thought it was an honor because they assumed I was going to be the person they needed.\"\n\nJackson Lee quickly established herself as fierce advocate for women and minorities, and a leader for House Democrats on many social justice issues, from policing reform to reparations for descendants of enslaved people. She led the first rewrite of the Violence Against Women Act in nearly a decade, which included protections for Native American, transgender and immigrant women.\n\nJackson Lee was also among the lead lawmakers behind the effort in 2021 to have Juneteenth recognized as the first new federal holiday since Martin Luther King, Jr. Day was established in 1986. The holiday marks the day in 1865 that the last enslaved African Americans in Galveston, Texas, finally learned of their freedom.\n\nA native of Queens, New York, Jackson Lee graduated from Yale and earned her law degree at the University of Virginia. She was a judge in Houston before she was elected to Houston City Council in 1989, then ran for Congress in 1994. She was an advocate for gay rights and an early opponent of the Iraq War in 2003.\n\nTop congressional Democrats reacted quickly to the news Friday night, praising her commitment and work ethic.\n\nRep. James Clyburn of South Carolina called her \"a tenacious advocate for civil rights and a tireless fighter, improving the lives of her constituents.\"\n\nRep. Jamie Raskin of Maryland said he had never known a harder-working lawmaker than Jackson Lee, saying she \"studied every bill and every amendment with exactitude and then told Texas and America exactly where she stood.\"\n\nFormer House Speaker Nancy Pelosi of California cited Jackson Lee's \"relentless determination\" in getting Juneteenth declared a national holiday.\n\n\"As a powerful voice in the Congress for our Constitution and human rights, she fought tirelessly to advance fairness, equity and justice for all,\" Pelosi said.\n\nRepublican Texas Gov. Greg Abbott said he and his wife Cecilia will always remember Jackson Lee, calling her a \"tireless advocate for the people of Houston.\"\n\n\"Her legacy of public service and dedication to Texas will live on,\" he said.\n\nJackson Lee routinely won reelection to Congress with ease. The few times she faced a challenger, she never carried less than two-thirds of the vote. Jackson Lee considered leaving Congress in 2023 in a bid to become Houston's first female Black mayor but was defeated in a runoff. She then easily won the Democratic nomination for the 2024 general election.\n\nDuring the mayoral campaign, Jackson Lee expressed regret and said \"everyone deserves to be treated with dignity and respect\" following the release of an unverified audio recording purported to be of the lawmaker berating staff members.\n\nIn 2019, Jackson Lee stepped down from two leadership positions on the House Judiciary Committee and Congressional Black Caucus Foundation, the fundraising of the Congressional Black Caucus, following a lawsuit from a former employee who said her sexual assault complaint was mishandled.\n\nIn a statement, Jackson Lee's family said she had been a beloved wife, sister, mother and grandmother known as Bebe.\n\n\"She will be dearly missed, but her legacy will continue to inspire all who believe in freedom, justice, and democracy,\" the statement said. \"God bless you Congresswoman and God bless the United States of America.\"\n\nAssociated Press writer Lou Kesten contributed to this story from Washington.\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

She was 74. Jackson Lee represented Texas's 18th Congressional District, which includes portions of Houston.\n\nSheila Jackson Lee entered politics after being named to a municipal judge seat in Houston and in 1989, she was elected to the Houston City Council.\n\nJackson Lee was elected to Congress in 1994 after defeating Craig Washington. During her time in the U.S. House of Representatives, Jackson Lee focused on issues of race, social inequality, LGBTQ+ rights and immigration.\n\nNotably on January 3, 2019, Jackson Lee introduced U.S. House Bill 40. The bill was reparations legislation that focuses on truth, racial healing, and transformation.\n\n\"I want to give them the honor that they deserve. And that is to recognize the insurmountable odds that some of them had and how they continue to plant seeds of respect and dignity in their children,\" said Jackson Lee in an interview with the National Newspaper Publishers Association (NNPA). \"Has anyone addressed the question of slavery and its comprehensive impact on Black Americans in this country? This is what H.R. 40 will do.\"\n\nJackson Lee was also on the front lines after every major disaster. She distributed food after Hurricane Ike flooded Houston in 2008 and after Hurricane Harvey dumped fifty inches of rain in 2017. During the COVID-19 outbreak in 2020, Jackson Lee fought for enhanced funding for small, urban and rural hospitals that were fighting to care for afflicted patients.\n\nIn 2023, Jackson Lee was unsuccessful in her effort to become the Mayor of Houston. However in March 2024, she defeated Amanda Edwards in a Democratic primary. Three months later, Jackson Lee announced her diagnosis.\n\n\"My doctors have confirmed my diagnosis of pancreatic cancer,\" she wrote in a statement. \"I am currently undergoing treatment to battle this disease that impacts tens of thousands of Americans every year.\"\n\n\"I am confident that my doctors have developed the best possible plan to target my specific disease,\" she continued. \"The road ahead will not be easy, but I stand in faith that God will strengthen me.\"\n\nJackson Lee was one of the standout members of the Congressional Black Caucus. Caucus chair, U.S. Representative Steven Horsford, D-Nevada, issued the following statement. It reads in part:\n\n\"Representative Jackson Lee was a titan and stalwart member of Congress who served the Houston area and our country honorably for nearly 30 years in the U.S. Congress. From the Houston City Council to the U.S. Congress, Congresswoman Jackson Lee was a fierce advocate for social and economic justice, national and homeland security, energy independence, and children and working families.\n\n\"A former CBC Whip and chair of the Congressional Black Caucus Foundation, Congresswoman Jackson Lee was a devoted and active member of our Caucus who championed many causes including racial equity and improving policing and community safety in America - most recently reintroducing the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act in May 2024.\"\n\nJackson Lee is survived by her husband, Elwyn Lee, and her two children, Jason Lee, a graduate of Harvard University, and Erica Lee, a graduate of Duke University, who is also a Member of the Harris County School Board in Houston. She is also survived by her two grandchildren, Ellison Bennett Carter, and Roy Lee Carter.", "source": {"uri": "theatlantavoice.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Atlanta Voice | Atlanta GA News"}, "authors": [{"uri": "itoro_n_umontuen@theatlantavoice.com", "name": "Itoro N.

Sheila Jackson Lee dies at age 74", "body": "Her family announced her death on Friday evening: \"With incredible grief for our loss yet deep gratitude for the life she shared with us, we announce the passing of United States Representative Sheila Jackson Lee of the 18th Congressional District of Texas.\" Jackson Lee's death was confirmed by Lillie Conley, her chief of staff.\n\nJackson Lee was known as a strong advocate for women and minorities, serving in the same Texas district once represented by Barbara Jordan, the first African American woman elected to Congress from the South since the 19th century,\n\nShe was known for her efforts to combat domestic violence through an expansion of the Violence Against Woman Act and also to have Juneteenth recognized as federal holiday, which occurred in 2021. The holiday marks the day in 1865 that the last enslaved African Americans in Galveston, Texas, finally learned of their freedom.\n\nIn 2019, following in the footsteps of the late Rep. John Conyers (D-Mich.), she offered a proposal to study the idea of reparations for descendants of former slaves.\n\n\"We want to be responsive to all Americans and we know how diverse this country has become,\" Jackson Lee said in an interview at the time. \"We have consistently, as Democrats, wanted to say to the American people that we are for the people.\"\n\nThe proposal, however, did not advance.\n\nIn its obituary, the Texas Tribune noted how hard she had fought for Houston: \"She often used her trademark chutzpah to fight for federal funds to be sent to Houston. In 2009, she secured $1 billion for the city's light system after cornering then-Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood ahead of then-President Barack Obama's first joint address to Congress. She could reliably be found in the aisle ahead of the State of the Union address, among the few members to directly meet with the president on his way to the dais.\"\n\nTransportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg wrote on X: \"She was an extraordinary advocate for her district and her values, and her impact and achievements will be long remembered.\"\n\nFellow lawmakers in Texas saluted her legacy Friday night.\n\nRep. Colin Allred (D-Texas) wrote on X: \"Congresswoman Sheila Jackson Lee was a fierce advocate for Houston and her constituents. No one worked harder for her community and if Houston needed something, she got it done.\"\n\nAllred also said her death was a blow to the city of Houston, a remark echoed by Rep. Wesley Hunt (R-Texas) in a statement Friday night.\n\n\"It is with profound sadness that I acknowledge the passing of Congresswoman Sheila Jackson Lee, a devoted leader, a proud-fellow Houstonian, and someone who I was proud to call a friend,\" Hunt said.\n\nHe added: \"Although we had our political disagreements, there were many moments with her, both public and private, that showed me that bipartisanship and service to country first can still bring members of Congress together.\"\n\nA native of Queens, New York, Jackson Lee graduated from Yale and earned her law degree at the University of Virginia. She was a judge in Houston before she was elected to Houston City Council in 1989, then ran for Congress in 1994. She was an advocate for gay rights and an early opponent of the Iraq War in 2003.\n\nJackson Lee routinely won reelection to Congress with ease. The few times she faced a challenger, she never carried less than two-thirds of the vote. But last year, she ran for mayor of Houston only to be defeated by Democratic state Sen. John Whitmire in a runoff in December.\n\nAt her election night party in December, Jackson Lee thanked her supporters, congratulated Whitmire and said she was committed to working with him. \"It's sweeter to be saying what a sweet victory it is. It's equally as sweet to acknowledge we put up a good fight,\" Jackson Lee said.\n\nAlso, in 2019, Jackson Lee stepped down from two leadership positions on the House Judiciary Committee and Congressional Black Caucus Foundation, the fundraising of the Congressional Black Caucus, following a lawsuit from a former employee who said her sexual assault complaint was mishandled.\n\nIn June, Jackson Lee, who was seeking another term in Congress, announced that she has been diagnosed with pancreatic cancer and was undergoing treatment.\n\nThe 74-year-old said in a statement at the time that as a member of Congress, she has been honored to be a leader in the fight for justice and equality and will approach this more personal fight with faith and courage.\"\n\n\"I am confident that my doctors have developed the best possible plan to target my specific disease,\" Jackson Lee said. \"The road ahead will not be easy, but I stand in faith that God will strengthen me.\"", "source":

She added that \"the road ahead will not be easy\" but had \"faith that God will strengthen me.\"\n\nRep. Sheila Jackson Lee Confirms She Has Pancreatic Cancer\n\nFirst elected to the House in 1994, Jackson would go on to be a serving member of Congress for 30 years.

Adriano Espaillat (D-NY), was on the air with CNN as the news broke, describing her as a \"national hero\" for her work on progressive social and racial issues.\n\nRep. Jasmine Crockett (D-TX) meanwhile said she was at \"a loss for words so I'll just say rest easy,\" in a social media tribute.\n\nFormer mayor of Houston, Sylvester Turner, said he was \"deeply saddened\" at the news while Texas Gov. Greg Abbot (R) wrote, \"She was a proud Texan and a tireless advocate for the people of Houston. Her legacy of public service and dedication to Texas will live on.\"\n\nAlso among the tributes Friday night were Sen.

She had previously had breast cancer and announced the pancreatic cancer diagnosis on June 2.\n\n\"The road ahead will not be easy, but I stand in faith that God will strengthen me,\" Jackson Lee said in a statement then.\n\nJackson Lee had just been elected to the Houston district once represented by Barbara Jordan, the first Black woman elected to Congress from a Southern state since Reconstruction, when she was immediately placed on the high-profile House Judiciary Committee in 1995.\n\n\"They just saw me, I guess through my profile, through Barbara Jordan's work,\" Jackson Lee told the Houston Chronicle in 2022. \"I thought it was an honor because they assumed I was going to be the person they needed.\"\n\nJackson Lee quickly established herself as fierce advocate for women and minorities, and a leader for House Democrats on many social justice issues, from policing reform to reparations for descendants of enslaved people. She led the first rewrite of the Violence Against Women Act in nearly a decade, which included protections for Native American, transgender and immigrant women.\n\nJackson Lee was also among the lead lawmakers behind the effort in 2021 to have Juneteenth recognized as the first new federal holiday since Martin Luther King, Jr. Day was established in 1986. The holiday marks the day in 1865 that the last enslaved African Americans in Galveston, Texas, finally learned of their freedom.\n\nA native of Queens, New York, Jackson Lee graduated from Yale and earned her law degree at the University of Virginia. She was a judge in Houston before she was elected to Houston City Council in 1989, then ran for Congress in 1994. She was an advocate for gay rights and an early opponent of the Iraq War in 2003.\n\nJackson Lee routinely won reelection to Congress with ease. The few times she faced a challenger, she never carried less than two-thirds of the vote. Jackson Lee considered leaving Congress in 2023 in a bid to become Houston's first female Black mayor but was defeated in a runoff. She then easily won the Democratic nomination for the 2024 general election.\n\nDuring the mayoral campaign, Jackson Lee expressed regret and said \"everyone deserves to be treated with dignity and respect\" following the release of an unverified audio recording purported to be of the lawmaker berating staff members.\n\nIn 2019, Jackson Lee stepped down from two leadership positions on the House Judiciary Committee and Congressional Black Caucus Foundation, the fundraising of the Congressional Black Caucus, following a lawsuit from a former employee who said her sexual assault complaint was mishandled.\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2024 The Associated Press.

Sheila Jackson Lee, a mainstay of the Democratic Party's far-left flank since she was first elected to Congress almost 30 years ago, died Friday at the age of 74.\n\nAccording to NBC News, Jackson Lee had been battling pancreatic cancer, but an exact cause of death was not stated. She announced her cancer diagnosis in June and was undergoing treatment.\n\n\"Today, with incredible grief for our loss yet deep gratitude for the life she shared with us, we announce the passing of United States Representative Sheila Jackson Lee of the 18th Congressional District of Texas,\" her family said in a statement.\n\nJackson Lee leaves behind a husband and two adult children, Fox News noted.\n\n\"A local, national, and international humanitarian, she was acknowledged worldwide for her courageous fights for racial justice, criminal justice, and human rights, with a special emphasis on women and children,\" the family's statement said.\n\n\"Her legislative victories impacted millions, from establishing the Juneteenth Federal holiday to reauthorizing the Violence Against Women Act,\" the statement continued.\n\n\"However, she impacted us most as our beloved wife, sister, mother, and Bebe (grandmother).\n\n\"She will be dearly missed, but her legacy will continue to inspire all who believe in freedom, justice and democracy.\"\n\nJackson Lee got her undergraduate degree from Yale and her law degree from the University of Virginia, according to her House biography. She held a position at the University of Houston before becoming an associate municipal judge in Houston.\n\nFrom there, she was elected to an at-large seat on the Houston City Council before defeating incumbent Rep. Craig Washington in a 1994 Democratic primary. Given the deep blue nature of the district, the Democratic nomination was tantamount to election and she never faced serious electoral opposition for her seat.\n\nLee was one of the furthest-left members of the House of Representatives by voting record, according to GovTrack.US.\n\nPersonal (and personnel) issues dogged her throughout her career -- ultimately leading to a surprise landslide defeat in a bid to become Houston's mayor in 2023.\n\nAs early as the late 1990s, rumors began circulating that Jackson Lee was a difficult lawmaker to deal with.\n\nOne of the first reports of Jackson Lee's problematic behavior came from the alternative weekly Houston Press, which described how Lee's former Capitol office executive assistant and events scheduler said her \"abrasive ways not only drove off staff members but irritated Continental Airlines staffers to the point where one suggested she fly on a competitor instead.\"\n\n\"You don't understand. I am a queen, and I demand to be treated like a queen,\" the former staffer alleged Lee said during one rant.\n\nTurnover in Lee's office was frequent and reports were rife that former staffers warned prospective employees not to work with the Texas congresswoman.\n\nFurthermore, in 2002, the conservative Weekly Standard alleged that Jackson Lee had broken House ethics rules regarding certain perks and offered more details of the alleged Continental Airlines confrontation:\n\n\"On a flight home to Houston, Jackson Lee became enraged when flight attendants failed to produce the seafood special she liked,\" the publication reported. \"'Don't you know who I am?' she reportedly thundered. 'I'm Congresswoman Sheila Jackson Lee. Where is my seafood meal? I know it was ordered!'\"\n\nWhile these might seem like minor incidents, they came to a head as Jackson Lee sought to become the mayor of Houston.\n\nEntering the 2023 race as a serious contender, her chances disintegrated in the final few weeks of the race as audio emerged of Jackson Lee verbally berating staffers, leaked to the Texas Tribune, a liberal online news site.\n\nIn one recording, she told a staffer he didn't have a \"f***in' brain\" and declared \"nobody knows a G****mned thing in my office - nothing!\" She referred to another staffer as a \"fat-a** stupid idiot\" and said both were \"f***-ups.\"\n\n\"It's the worst s*** that I could have ever had put together,\" Jackson Lee said. \"Two g****mned big-a** children, f***in' idiots who serve no g****mned purpose.\"\n\nWhile her staff didn't acknowledge the veracity of the recording, Jackson Lee's apology seemed to make it clear it was her on the audio.\n\n\"I want to convey to the people of Houston that I strongly believe that everyone deserves to be treated with dignity and respect, and that includes my own staff,\" Jackson Lee said in a statement, according to an October 2023 report by KTRK-TV in Houston.\n\n\"I know that I am not perfect. I recognize that in my zeal to do everything possible to deliver for my constituents I have in the past fallen short of my own standards and there is no excuse for that.\"\n\nShe would lose handily to John Whitmire in the nonpartisan runoff election, 64.4 percent to 35.6 percent, according to Ballotpedia.\n\nIn addition to the mayoral loss, Jackson Lee faced her first serious primary opposition in many years in this March's Democratic primary for her congressional district, ceding over 37 percent of the vote to challenger Amanda Edwards.\n\nWhitmire, who beat Jackson Lee in the Houston mayoral race, said in a statement that his late rival was \"a dedicated public servant and a champion for her constituents,\" according to The New York Times.\n\nFuneral arrangements are pending, the family's statement said.", "source": {"uri": "westernjournal.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Western Journal"}, "authors": [{"uri": "c_douglas_golden@westernjournal.com", "name": "C.

Judiciary Committee and Congressional Black Caucus Foundation, the fundraising of the Congressional Black Caucus, following a lawsuit from a former employee who said her sexual assault complaint was mishandled.\n\nAdvertisementRelated StoriesView MoreRepublicans criticize Jasmine Crockett for bill that could nix Trump Secret Service detailRussia convicts U.S. journalist Evan Gershkovich of spying

Sheila Jackson Lee Dies At 74", "body": "CLOSE\n\nSource: Earl Gibson III / Getty\n\nRep. Sheila Jackson Lee (D-TX), the beloved Texas congresswoman who has been at the center of U.S.politics for 30 years, died Friday night, KHOU11 reports. She was 74 years old.\n\nJackson Lee's family issued the following statement:\n\n\"With incredible grief for our loss yet deep gratitude for the life she shared with us, we announce the passing of United States Representative Sheila Jackson Lee of the 18th Congressional District of Texas.\n\n\"A local, national, and international humanitarian, she was acknowledged worldwide for her courageous fights for racial justice, criminal justice, and human rights, with a special emphasis on women and children.\n\n\"She will be dearly missed, but her legacy will continue to inspire all who believe in freedom, justice, and democracy. God bless you Congresswoman and God bless the United States of America.\n\nAs NewsOne previously reported, Jackson Lee confirmed her pancreatic cancer diagnosis in June, stating, in part, that she was \"confident\" in her doctors' treatment plan.\n\n\"My adult life has been defined by my faith in God, my love for humanity and my commitment to public service. As a member of Congress, I've been honored to be one of the leaders in the fight for justice and equality for all; especially the disadvantaged and the dispossessed. Today, my fight is more personal, but I will approach it with the same faith and the same courage.\"\n\nJackson Lee served the 18th Congressional District for 30 years, calling it \"one of [her] greatest honors.\"\n\nFormer Houston Mayor Sylvester Turner issued this statement:\n\n\"I am deeply saddened by the death of my dear friend and colleague, Congresswoman Sheila Jackson Lee. From City Hall to the Halls of Congress, Sheila Jackson Lee has served her constituents well. She has written and passed key legislation and has stood on the floor of the United States House of Representatives speaking passionately for the interests of her district and the country she loved. She has worked with and advised Presidents of our great country, met with global leaders, and has been embraced by world renowned artists. But her work on the ground, in some of the poorest and under-resourced communities; the channeling of billions of federal dollars back to her district; her presence at someone's bedside, giving words of comfort to families who lost loved ones; her appearances at places of worship and events showcasing the global diversity of our City; and her uncanny ability to be everywhere, working every day for those who needed a champion, made her truly exceptional.\"\n\nTurner continued:\n\n\"When she was elected to the United States House of Representatives she stood in the shadow of Barbara Jordan, Mickey Leland and Craig Washington. Without question, she rose to the occasion and served with great distinction. Even if you disagreed with her politics, you had to respect her work ethic. We can honestly say Sheila Jackson Lee left it all on the field. Rest in peace my sister. Thank you for all you gave us. And, thank you to her family for sharing her with us. We will not forget her sacrifice or yours. Sheila - to God be the glory for the good you have done. It was truly a job well done!\"\n\nhttps://x.com/sylvesterturner/status/1814499497361224115?s=46&t=kSXIjsOCglfUL0Vib5Dicg\n\nJackson Lee recently reintroduced a sweeping criminal justice reform bill named for George Floyd ahead of the fourth anniversary of his police murder in Minneapolis.\n\n\"Far too many lives have been lost or forever changed due to unacceptable incidents of police brutality throughout our nation,\" Jackson Lee told reporters on May 24 during a press conference announcing the reintroduction of the George Floyd Justice In Policing Act, which has languished in legislative limbo for years because of Senate Republicans' filibustering. \"We cannot allow another American to be deprived of his or her humanity, dignity and constitutional right without taking action.\"\n\n*\n\nThis is a developing story.

She added that \"the road ahead will not be easy\" but had \"faith that God will strengthen me.\"\n\nFirst elected to the House in 1994, Jackson would go on to be a serving member of Congress for 30 years. She was also a member of the Congressional Black Caucus and served on the House Judiciary, Homeland Security and Budget Committees.\n\nIn the statement, her family described her as a \"fierce champion of the people,\" as well as a \"local, national and international humanitarian.\"\n\n\"Her legislative victories impacted millions, from establishing the Juneteenth Federal Holiday to reauthorizing the Violence Against Women Act,\" the family added.\n\nJackson Lee, who represented Texas' 18th District, defeated former Houston City Councilwoman Amanda Edwards in a March primary, one of her tightest races to date.\n\nJackson Lee's Democratic colleague, Rep. Adriano Espaillat (D-NY), was on the air with CNN as the news broke, describing her as a \"national hero\" for her work on progressive social and racial issues.\n\nRep.

Her legacy of public service and dedication to Texas will live on.\"\n\nAlso among the tributes Friday night were Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX), who said Jackson Lee was \"a tireless advocate for Houston.\" He added he \"will always cherish our friendship & the laughs we shared throughout the years.\"\n\nJackson Lee's family finished their statement by adding how \"she impacted us most as our beloved wife, sister, mother, and Bebe (grandmother).\"\n\nFuneral arrangements are pending.

She was 74, according to U.S. media.\n\n\"The road ahead will not be easy, but I stand in faith that God will strengthen me,\" Jackson Lee, the chief deputy whip in the House of Representatives, said in announcing the diagnosis.\n\n\"A fierce champion of the people, she was affectionately and simply known as 'Congresswoman' by her constituents in recognition of her near-ubiquitous presence and service to their daily lives for more than 30 years,\" her family said in the statement.\n\nThe 15-term representative, a graduate of Yale College and the University of Virginia Law School, was active throughout her career in promoting legislation aimed at addressing social justice, economic inequality and public health concerns.\n\nJackson Lee, who represented parts of Houston, introduced legislation in the House to make \"Juneteenth\" a federal holiday commemorating the end of the legal enslavement of Black Americans.\n\nThe holiday marks the day in 1865 when a Union general informed a group of enslaved people in Texas that they had been made free two years earlier by President Abraham Lincoln's Emancipation Proclamation during the Civil War.\n\nJackson Lee was a vocal proponent of police reform in the face of Congressional roadblocks after the 2020 police killing of George Floyd, a Black man whose death sparked nationwide protests.\n\nFellow Democrat Brendan Boyle, ranking member of the House Budget Committee on which she served, called her \"a fierce advocate for the people of Houston and for racial and economic justice everywhere.\" He said in a statement, \"The Congresswoman will be truly missed by all of us who served alongside her.\"\n\nJackson Lee also served on the judiciary and homeland security committees.\n\nShe received tribute from some Texans at the other end of the political spectrum.\n\nGovernor Greg Abbott, a conservative Republican, posted on X that his wife \"Cecilia and I will forever remember Congresswoman Sheila Jackson Lee adding that her legacy of public service and dedication to Texas will live on.\"\n\nU.S. Senator Ted Cruz posted: \"I'm deeply saddened by the passing of my friend &amp; colleague Sheila Jackson Lee. She was a tireless advocate for Houston.\"\n\nShe considered leaving Congress in 2023 in a bid to become Houston's first female Black mayor but was defeated in a runoff.\n\nA false claim was used to ridicule her in a widely shared Facebook post in March 2020 that asserted she had said \"homicide is the leading cause of murder\". Reuters found no evidence she ever made such a statement.

She had previously had breast cancer and announced the pancreatic cancer diagnosis on June 2.\n\nAt the time, Ms Jackson Lee said: \"The road ahead will not be easy, but I stand in faith that God will strengthen me.\"\n\nBishop James Dixon, a friend in Houston who visited Jackson Lee earlier this week, said he will remember her as a fighter.\n\n\"She was just a rare, rare jewel of a person who relentlessly gave everything she had to make sure others had what they needed. That was Sheila,\" he said.\n\nMs Jackson Lee had just been elected to the Houston district once represented by Barbara Jordan, the first black woman elected to congress from a Southern state since Reconstruction, when she was immediately placed on the high-profile house judiciary committee in 1995.\n\n\"They just saw me, I guess through my profile, through Barbara Jordan's work,\" Ms Jackson Lee told the Houston Chronicle in 2022. \"I thought it was an honour because they assumed I was going to be the person they needed.\"\n\nMs Jackson Lee quickly established herself as fierce advocate for women and minorities, and a leader for House Democrats on many social justice issues, from policing reform to reparations for descendants of enslaved people.\n\nShe led the first rewrite of the Violence Against Women Act in nearly a decade, which included protections for Native American, transgender and immigrant women.\n\nMs Jackson Lee was also among the lead legislators behind the effort in 2021 to have Juneteenth recognised as the first new federal holiday since Martin Luther King, Jr Day was established in 1986.\n\nThe holiday marks the day in 1865 (June 19) that the last enslaved African Americans in Galveston, Texas, finally learned of their freedom.\n\nA native of Queens, New York, Jackson Lee graduated from Yale and earned her law degree at the University of Virginia. She was a judge in Houston before she was elected to Houston City Council in 1989, then ran for Congress in 1994. She was an advocate for gay rights and an early opponent of the Iraq War in 2003.\n\nTop congressional Democrats reacted quickly to the news, praising her commitment and work ethic.\n\nJames Clyburn of South Carolina called her \"a tenacious advocate for civil rights and a tireless fighter, improving the lives of her constituents\".\n\nJamie Raskin of Maryland said he had never known a harder-working legislators than Ms Jackson Lee, saying she \"studied every bill and every amendment with exactitude and then told Texas and America exactly where she stood\".\n\nFormer House Speaker Nancy Pelosi of California cited Ms Jackson Lee's \"relentless determination\" in getting Juneteenth declared a national holiday.\n\n\"As a powerful voice in the Congress for our Constitution and human rights, she fought tirelessly to advance fairness, equity and justice for all,\" she said.\n\nRepublican Texas governor Greg Abbott said he and his wife Cecilia will always remember Ms Jackson Lee, calling her a \"tireless advocate for the people of Houston\".\n\nHe said: \"Her legacy of public service and dedication to Texas will live on.\"", "source": {"uri": "breakingnews.ie",

Sheila Jackson Lee's family issued a statement announcing the death of the longtime lawmaker.\n\nKnown by her constituents as simply, \"Congresswoman,\" Jackson Lee served the public for more than 30 years.\n\nLast month, Jackson Lee announced she was fighting pancreatic cancer. In a statement at the time of the announcement, Jackson Lee said she was undergoing treatment to battle the disease \"that impacts tens of thousands of Americans every year.\"\n\nRELATED: 'I stand in faith that God will strengthen me' | US Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee announces pancreatic cancer diagnosis\n\nJackson Lee was born on Jan. 12, 1950, in Queens, New York. She served on the Houston City Council from 1989 to 1994 and was elected to the United States House of Representatives in 1995.\n\nFuneral arrangements are pending.\n\nAfter the announcement of her death, condolences poured in from both sides of the political aisle.\n\nGreen spoke to KHOU 11 anchors Len Cannon and Mia Gradney after learning of Jackson Lee's passing:\n\n\"Words cannot fully express the impact of Congresswoman Sheila Jackson Lee. The word 'tireless' gets thrown around in politics, but there's no one I've ever met with that kind of work ethic who could compare Congresswoman Jackson Lee. Her work didn't only benefit the Houstonians she represented for decades; it helped make our nation better for all Americans. Saying she will be missed is an understatement. My condolences to her family and to all who loved her. Thank you, Congresswoman, for your dedication to our city, county, state and country.\"\n\n\"A leader in our community and nation's Capital for over 30 years, Congresswoman Sheila Jackson Lee was well known for being a fierce champion for the voiceless in our community.\n\n\"Congresswoman Jackson Lee was our fighter for our community, following in the footsteps of Houston political giants, the late Congressman Mickey Leland, Congresswoman Barbara Jordan, and former Congressman Craig Washington. As the people's champion, she used her commanding voice to fight for civil rights, women's rights, affordable and accessible healthcare, immigration reform, racial justice, human rights and equality.\n\n\"Congresswoman Jackson Lee never hesitated to lead the charge on issues important to working-class families, the poor and communities that felt forgotten or overlooked. She was the epitome of what it meant to be a servant leader.\n\n\"Congresswoman Sheila Jackson Lee was my friend, mentor and someone I could always call for guidance. Rest in power, congresswoman.\"\n\n\"My friend, ally, and long-time political partner, Congresswoman Sheila Jackson Lee, passed from this world and into the pantheon of legendary Texas leaders. For nearly 30 years, she tirelessly represented the people of her congressional district.\n\n\"Through crises and disasters - as well as triumphs - Sheila's ceaseless and unwavering dedication to those she represented served as an inspiration and source of strength to me in my career. She exhibited this dedication every day through her deeds, actions and accomplishments. She was a beloved mother, grandmother, and confidante who leaves behind a legacy of single-minded commitment to our community.\n\n\"Holding dear the memory of those who pass before us is the greatest homage we can pay to those we love. And I know Sheila Jackson Lee will dwell fondly in our memories for years to come.\"\n\n\"I am deeply saddened by the death of my dear friend and colleague, Congresswoman Sheila Jackson Lee. From City Hall to the Halls of Congress, Sheila Jackson Lee has served her constituents well. She has written and passed key legislation and has stood on the floor of the United States House of Representatives speaking passionately for the interests of her district and the country she loved. She has worked with and advised Presidents of our great country, met with global leaders, and has been embraced by world renowned artists. But her work on the ground, in some of the poorest and under-resourced communities; the channeling of billions of federal dollars back to her district; her presence at someone's bedside, giving words of comfort to families who lost loved ones; her appearances at places of worship and events showcasing the global diversity of our City; and her uncanny ability to be everywhere, working every day for those who needed a champion, made her truly exceptional.\n\n\"When she was elected to the United States House of Representatives she stood in the shadow of Barbara Jordan, Mickey Leland and Craig Washington. Without question, she rose to the occasion and served with great distinction. Even if you disagreed with her politics, you had to respect her work ethic. We can honestly say Sheila Jackson Lee left it all on the field. Rest in peace my sister. Thank you for all you gave us. And, thank you to her family for sharing her with us. We will not forget her sacrifice or yours. Sheila - to God be the glory for the good you have done. It was truly a job well done!\"\n\n\"It is with profound sadness that I acknowledge the passing of Congresswoman Sheila Jackson Lee, a devoted leader, a proud-fellow Houstonian, and someone who I was proud to call a friend.\n\n\"Although we had our political disagreements, there were many moments with her, both public and private, that showed me that bipartisanship and service to country first can still bring members of Congress together.\n\n\"In these divided times, Congresswoman Lee and I were able to partner on several legislative initiatives for the city of the Houston.

She was 74.\n\n\"Today, with incredible grief for our loss yet deep gratitude for the life she shared with us, we announce the passing of United States Representative Sheila Jackson Lee of the 18th Congressional District of Texas,\" the statement read.\n\nJackson Lee had announced in early June that she had been diagnosed with pancreatic cancer but was continuing to campaign for what would have been her 16 term in office. At the time of her death, she was one of the two longest-serving members of the Texas congressional delegation, along with Austin Congressman Lloyd Doggett.\n\n\"Known for her relentless advocacy, the congresswoman dedicated her life to public service, advancing civil rights, healthcare reform, and disaster recovery,\" said Texas Democratic Party chairman Gilberto Hinojosa in a statement. \"And in the spirit of Sheila Jackson Lee's legacy, we will march forward in our fierce commitment to fighting for justice, equality and opportunity for all.\"\n\nJackson Lee's legislative accomplishments included establishing the Juneteenth federal holiday and reauthorizing the Violence Against Women Act.\n\nFormer Houston Mayor Sylvester Turner also paid tribute to Jackson Lee in a statement, saying, \"her work on the ground, in some of the poorest and under-resourced communities; the channeling of billions of federal dollars back to her district; her presence at someone's bedside, giving words of comfort to families who lost loved ones; her appearances at places of worship and events showcasing the global diversity of our City; and her uncanny ability to be everywhere, working every day for those who needed a champion, made her truly exceptional.\"\n\nJackson Lee, born in Queens, New York, represented Texas' 18 Congressional District longer than anyone since the district was established more than a century ago. She was only the fourth member to hold the seat since the district was redrawn to represent Downtown Houston in 1972 - preceded by Barbara Jordan, Mickey Leland, and Craig Washington.\n\nJackson Lee served Houston in elective office for close to 35 years, first as a Houston City Council member before winning election to the U.S. House in 1994. For much of her tenure in Congress, she faced minimal opposition for reelection. Last year, she made an unsuccessful bid to succeed Turner as Houston's mayor, ultimately losing to John Whitmire in a runoff. She then pivoted to reclaim the Democratic nomination for her congressional seat, beating back a fierce challenge by former Houston City Council Member Amanda Edwards.\n\nJackson Lee is the third member of the Congressional Black Caucus to die of pancreatic cancer in just over four years, following Congressmen John Lewis and Alcee Hastings.", "source": {"uri": "houstonpublicmedia.org",

She was 74.\n\n\"Today, with incredible grief for our loss yet deep gratitude for the life she shared with us, we announce the passing of United States Representative Sheila Jackson Lee of the 18th Congressional District of Texas,\" her family said in a statement Friday.\n\nJackson Lee announced in June that she had been diagnosed with pancreatic cancer. At the time, she acknowledged that \"the road ahead will not be easy\" and said she had \"faith that God will strengthen me.\"\n\nHer family remembered her as \"a fierce champion of the people,\" saying that \"she was affectionately and simply known as 'Congresswoman' by her constituents in recognition of her near-ubiquitous presence and service to their daily lives for more than 30 years.\"\n\nBorn on January 12, 1950, in Queens, New York, Jackson Lee was among the first women to graduate from Yale University and served as a Houston municipal judge and a city councilwoman before she was first elected to represent Texas' 18th Congressional District in 1994, unseating a Democratic incumbent in the primary for the Houston-area seat.\n\nDuring her congressional tenure, Jackson Lee was an outspoken advocate for progressive interests and Black Americans. She was one of the sponsors of legislation to establish Juneteenth as a national holiday, frequently spoke out against police brutality and advocated federal legislation to prosecute police misconduct.\n\nAlthough she was unsuccessful in some of her most ambitious aims, Jackson Lee remained an advocate for racial justice, particularly in the wake of George Floyd's killing at the hands of police in 2020.\n\n\"We will not stop until the nation knows Black lives matter, and reparations are passed as the most significant civil rights legislation of the 21st century,\" Jackson Lee said at a march in Washington in 2020.\n\nAt the time of her death, she was a chief deputy whip for House Democrats and a vice chair of the Congressional Progressive Caucus. She formerly served as whip of the Congressional Black Caucus.\n\n\"Congresswoman Jackson Lee was a patriot and a fighter to the very end. Words cannot express the sense of loss our Caucus feels for our beloved friend. She will be deeply missed by all who knew her,\" Congressional Black Caucus Chairman Steven Horsford and members of the Congressional Black Caucus said in a statement following her death.\n\nJackson Lee's tenure in Congress was not without controversy. Her ties to Enron - her district included the corporation's headquarters and it was a major contributor to her early congressional campaigns, The New York Times reported - were scrutinized in the aftermath of the company's failure in the early 2000s, though she denied taking it easy on the company.\n\nAnd in 2019, she resigned as chairwoman of the nonprofit Congressional Black Caucus Foundation and stepped down from a House Judiciary subcommittee chairmanship after a lawsuit that alleged she fired a staffer who reported sexual assault by a supervisor at the foundation. At the time, Jackson Lee declined to \"discuss specific details about internal personnel matters\" but otherwise denied the allegations, and the lawsuit was ultimately dismissed by a federal judge in February 2020.\n\nLast year, Lee sought the Houston mayorship, earning endorsements from former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, former President Bill Clinton, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and Harris County Judge Lina Hidalgo. She lost in a runoff to Texas state Sen. John Whitmire, a fellow Democrat.\n\nFollowing that loss, Jackson Lee filed to seek a 16th term in Congress, and in March, she won a competitive Democratic primary over former Houston City Council Member Amanda Edwards, a former intern.\n\nHouse Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries said in a statement that House Democrats and the city of Houston \"mourn a giant,\" remembering the congresswoman as \"an accomplished legislator, passionate public servant, loving mentor and wonderful friend to so many of us in the Congressional Black Caucus and House Democratic Caucus family.\"\n\n\"I am grateful for her fearless advocacy, fierce determination, formidable service and legacy of leadership,\" Jeffries said.\n\nCalling her death a \"tremendous loss,\" Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer wrote on X that the congresswoman \"fought so hard throughout her life to make our country a better place for all.\"\n\n\"I have never known a harder-working political leader than Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee, who studied every bill and every amendment with exactitude and then told Texas and America exactly where she stood,\" Maryland Rep. Jamie Raskin said on X.\n\nOn CNN's \"Laura Coates Live,\" fellow Texas Rep. Al Green remembered Jackson Lee as \"someone in Congress that was always, always working to bring about a just resolution to any problem,\" adding that she helped him become a better congressman.\n\nIn Congress, she developed a reputation for grabbing a seat close to the entranceway in the House chamber for the president's annual State of the Union address so she could engage with the commander in chief. It wasn't for the photo opportunities, she insisted to The Huffington Post in 2016, it was also an opportunity to quickly conduct business with presidents.\n\nAs to why she was able to gain regular access to such a prized perch, she said, \"Because of so many good friends, I am welcomed in that seat.\"\n\nFuneral arrangements are pending, according to the family.\n\n\"Her legislative victories impacted millions, from establishing the Juneteenth Federal Holiday to reauthorizing the Violence Against Women Act. However, she impacted us most as our beloved wife, sister, mother, and Bebe (grandmother),\" her family said Friday. \"She will be dearly missed, but her legacy will continue to inspire all who believe in freedom, justice, and democracy.\"\n\nThis story has been updated with additional details.\n\nCNN's Chandelis Duster contributed to this report.", "source": {"uri": "247ureports.com",

Remembering progressive hero who made Juneteenth a federal holiday | World News - Times of India", "body": "Longtime U.S. Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee of Texas, who played a pivotal role in federal efforts to protect women from domestic violence and recognize Juneteenth as a national holiday, passed away at 74. Lillie Conley, her chief of staff, confirmed that Jackson Lee, who had pancreatic cancer, died in Houston with her family by her side on Friday night.\n\nA Democrat, Jackson Lee had represented her Houston-based district and the nation's fourth-largest city since 1995.Despite a previous battle with breast cancer, she announced her pancreatic cancer diagnosis on June 2, remaining steadfast in her faith and commitment to her duties. Bishop James Dixon, a longtime friend, described her as a relentless fighter who gave everything she had for the betterment of others.\n\nJackson Lee's political journey began when she was elected to the Houston district once represented by Barbara Jordan, the first Black woman elected to Congress from a Southern state since Reconstruction. In 1995, she was immediately placed on the high-profile House Judiciary Committee. She quickly became known for her fierce advocacy for women and minorities, leading efforts on social justice issues, from policing reform to reparations for descendants of enslaved people.\n\nShe was instrumental in the first rewrite of the Violence Against Women Act in nearly a decade, which included protections for Native American, transgender, and immigrant women. Additionally, she championed the 2021 effort to recognize Juneteenth as a federal holiday, marking the emancipation of the last enslaved African Americans in Galveston, Texas.\n\nBorn in Queens, New York, Jackson Lee graduated from Yale and earned her law degree at the University of Virginia. Before her congressional career, she served as a judge in Houston and was elected to the Houston City Council in 1989. Throughout her career, she was a vocal advocate for gay rights and an early opponent of the Iraq War in 2003.\n\nTop congressional Democrats praised her commitment and work ethic upon hearing of her passing. Rep. James Clyburn of South Carolina lauded her as a tenacious advocate for civil rights, while Rep. Jamie Raskin of Maryland highlighted her meticulous approach to legislation. Former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi commended her determination in making Juneteenth a national holiday. Republican Texas Gov. Greg Abbott remembered her as a tireless advocate for Houston.\n\nJackson Lee consistently won reelection to Congress with ease, only facing significant challenges a few times. Although she considered running for Houston's mayor in 2023, she was defeated in a runoff but continued her congressional duties by securing the Democratic nomination for the 2024 general election. During her mayoral campaign, she expressed regret over an unverified audio recording of her berating staff members, emphasizing the importance of treating everyone with dignity and respect.\n\nIn 2019, Jackson Lee stepped down from leadership positions on the House Judiciary Committee and the Congressional Black Caucus Foundation following a lawsuit from a former employee. Despite these challenges, her family remembered her as a beloved wife, sister, mother, anandmother known affectionately as Bebe.\n\nSheila Jackson Lee's political career spanned nearly three decades, during which she served as chairwoman of the Judiciary Subcommittee for Crime, Terrorism, and Homeland Security, and held senior positions on the Judiciary, Homeland Security, and Budget committees. Her relentless advocacy for social and economic justice, national and homeland security, energy independence, and children's and working families' rights made her a prominent figure in Congress.\n\nSheila Jackson Lee was born on January 12, 1950, in Queens, New York. Her father, Ezra Jackson, was a cartoonist for Marvel in the 1940s, and her mother, Ivalita Bennett Jackson, was a vocational nurse. Inspired by the assassination of Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., Jackson Lee pursued higher education, transferring from New York University to Yale and later earning a law degree from the University of Virginia. Marriage brought her to Houston, where she worked as a lawyer and judge before entering politics.\n\nJackson Lee's political career began in 1990 with her election to Houston's City Council. In 1994, she was elected to Congress, where she served nearly 30 years. Her ambition and dedication were driven by a desire to provide fair opportunities for women and minorities. Despite her defeat in the Houston mayoral race last year, she remained a respected and influential figure.\n\nIn addition to her husband, Elwyn Cornelius Lee, Sheila Jackson Lee is survived by their two children, Jason Cornelius Bennett and Erica Shelwyn, and grandchildren. Her legacy as a dedicated public servant and champion for her constituents will continue to inspire those who believe in freedom, justice, and democracy.\n\nWith inputs from agencies\n\nAt TOI World Desk, our dedicated team of seasoned journalists and passionate writers tirelessly sifts through the vast tapestry of global events to bring you the latest news and diverse perspectives round the clock.

At the time, she acknowledged that \"the road ahead will not be easy\" and said she had \"faith that God will strengthen me.\"\n\nHer family remembered her as \"a fierce champion of the people,\" saying that \"she was affectionately and simply known as 'Congresswoman' by her constituents in recognition of her near-ubiquitous presence and service to their daily lives for more than 30 years.\"\n\nBorn on January 12, 1950, in Queens, New York, Jackson Lee was among the first women to graduate from Yale University and served as a Houston municipal judge and a city councilwoman before she was first elected to represent Texas' 18th Congressional District in 1994, unseating a Democratic incumbent in the primary for the Houston-area seat.\n\nDuring her congressional tenure, Jackson Lee was an outspoken advocate for progressive interests and Black Americans. She was one of the sponsors of legislation to establish Juneteenth as a national holiday, frequently spoke out against police brutality and advocated federal legislation to prosecute police misconduct.\n\nShe was widely admired among progressives for her opposition to the Iraq War and was a fierce critic of former President Donald Trump. She opposed the tallying of electoral votes certifying Trump as the winner of the 2016 election, citing an unfounded claim about \"massive voter suppression,\" and occasionally used her position on the House Judiciary Committee to excoriate members of Trump's circle.\n\nAlthough she was unsuccessful in some of her most ambitious aims, Jackson Lee remained an advocate for racial justice, particularly in the wake of George Floyd's killing at the hands of police in 2020.\n\n\"We will not stop until the nation knows Black lives matter, and reparations are passed as the most significant civil rights legislation of the 21st century,\" Jackson Lee said at a march in Washington in 2020.\n\nAt the time of her death, she was a chief deputy whip for House Democrats and a vice chair of the Congressional Progressive Caucus. She formerly served as whip of the Congressional Black Caucus.\n\n\"Congresswoman Jackson Lee was a patriot and a fighter to the very end. Words cannot express the sense of loss our Caucus feels for our beloved friend. She will be deeply missed by all who knew her,\" Congressional Black Caucus Chairman Steven Horsford and members of the Congressional Black Caucus said in a statement following her death.\n\nJackson Lee's tenure in Congress was not without controversy. Her ties to Enron - her district included the corporation's headquarters and it was a major contributor to her early congressional campaigns, The New York Times reported - were scrutinized in the aftermath of the company's failure in the early 2000s, though she denied taking it easy on the company.\n\nAnd in 2019, she resigned as chairwoman of the nonprofit Congressional Black Caucus Foundation and stepped down from a House Judiciary subcommittee chairmanship after a lawsuit that alleged she fired a staffer who reported sexual assault by a supervisor at the foundation. At the time, Jackson Lee declined to \"discuss specific details about internal personnel matters\" but otherwise denied the allegations, and the lawsuit was ultimately dismissed by a federal judge in February 2020.\n\nLast year, Lee sought the Houston mayorship, earning endorsements from former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, former President Bill Clinton, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and Harris County Judge Lina Hidalgo. She lost in a runoff to Texas state Sen. John Whitmire, a fellow Democrat.\n\nFollowing that loss, Jackson Lee filed to seek a 16th term in Congress, and in March, she won a competitive Democratic primary over former Houston City Council Member Amanda Edwards, a former intern.\n\nHouse Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries said in a statement that House Democrats and the city of Houston \"mourn a giant,\" remembering the congresswoman as \"an accomplished legislator, passionate public servant, loving mentor and wonderful friend to so many of us in the Congressional Black Caucus and House Democratic Caucus family.\"\n\n\"I am grateful for her fearless advocacy, fierce determination, formidable service and legacy of leadership,\" Jeffries said.\n\nCalling her death a \"tremendous loss,\" Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer wrote on X that the congresswoman \"fought so hard throughout her life to make our country a better place for all.\"\n\n\"I have never known a harder-working political leader than Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee, who studied every bill and every amendment with exactitude and then told Texas and America exactly where she stood,\" Maryland Rep. Jamie Raskin said on X.\n\nIn Congress, she developed a reputation for grabbing a seat close to the entranceway in the House chamber for the president's annual State of the Union address so she could engage with the commander in chief. It wasn't for the photo opportunities, she insisted to The Huffington Post in 2016, it was also an opportunity to quickly conduct business with presidents.\n\nAs to why she was able to gain regular access to such a prized perch, she said, \"Because of so many good friends, I am welcomed in that seat.\"\n\nFuneral arrangements are pending, according to the family.\n\n\"Her legislative victories impacted millions, from establishing the Juneteenth Federal Holiday to reauthorizing the Violence Against Women Act. However, she impacted us most as our beloved wife, sister, mother, and Bebe (grandmother),\" her family said Friday. \"She will be dearly missed, but her legacy will continue to inspire all who believe in freedom, justice, and democracy.\"\n\nThis story has been updated with additional details.\n\nCNN's Chandelis Duster contributed to this report.\n\nThe-CNN-Wire\n\n\u2122 & \u00a9 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

Sheila Jackson Lee of Texas, who helped lead federal efforts to protect women from domestic violence and recognize Juneteenth as a national holiday, has died. She was 74. Lillie Conley, her chief of staff, confirmed that Jackson Lee, who had pancreatic cancer, died in Houston Friday night with her family around her. The Democrat had represented her Houston-based district and the nation's fourth-largest city since 1995. She had previously had breast cancer and announced the pancreatic cancer diagnosis on June 2. \"The road ahead will not be easy, but I stand in faith that God will strengthen me,\" Jackson Lee said in a statement then. Bishop James Dixon, a longtime friend in Houston who visited Jackson Lee earlier this week, said he will remember her as a fighter. \"She was just a rare, rare jewel of a person who relentlessly gave everything she had to make sure others had what they needed. That was Sheila,\" he said. Jackson Lee had just been elected to the Houston district once represented by Barbara Jordan, the first Black woman elected to Congress from a Southern state since Reconstruction, when she was immediately placed on the high-profile House Judiciary Committee in 1995.

Sheila Jackson Lee's family issued a statement announcing the death of the longtime lawmaker.\n\nKnown by her constituents as simply, \"Congresswoman,\" Jackson Lee served the public for more than 30 years.\n\nLast month, Jackson Lee announced she was fighting pancreatic cancer. In a statement at the time of the announcement, Jackson Lee said she was undergoing treatment to battle the disease \"that impacts tens of thousands of Americans every year.\"\n\nRELATED: 'I stand in faith that God will strengthen me' | US Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee announces pancreatic cancer diagnosis\n\nJackson Lee was born on Jan. 12, 1950, in Queens, New York. She served on the Houston City Council from 1989 to 1994 and was elected to the United States House of Representatives in 1995.\n\nFuneral arrangements are pending.\n\nAfter the announcement of her death, condolences poured in from both sides of the political aisle.\n\nGreen spoke to KHOU 11 anchors Len Cannon and Mia Gradney after learning of Jackson Lee's passing:\n\n\"I am deeply saddened by the death of my dear friend and colleague, Congresswoman Sheila Jackson Lee. From City Hall to the Halls of Congress, Sheila Jackson Lee has served her constituents well. She has written and passed key legislation and has stood on the floor of the United States House of Representatives speaking passionately for the interests of her district and the country she loved. She has worked with and advised Presidents of our great country, met with global leaders, and has been embraced by world renowned artists. But her work on the ground, in some of the poorest and under-resourced communities; the channeling of billions of federal dollars back to her district; her presence at someone's bedside, giving words of comfort to families who lost loved ones; her appearances at places of worship and events showcasing the global diversity of our City; and her uncanny ability to be everywhere, working every day for those who needed a champion, made her truly exceptional.\n\n\"When she was elected to the United States House of Representatives she stood in the shadow of Barbara Jordan, Mickey Leland and Craig Washington. Without question, she rose to the occasion and served with great distinction. Even if you disagreed with her politics, you had to respect her work ethic. We can honestly say Sheila Jackson Lee left it all on the field. Rest in peace my sister. Thank you for all you gave us. And, thank you to her family for sharing her with us. We will not forget her sacrifice or yours. Sheila - to God be the glory for the good you have done. It was truly a job well done!\"\n\n\"It is with profound sadness that I acknowledge the passing of Congresswoman Sheila Jackson Lee, a devoted leader, a proud-fellow Houstonian, and someone who I was proud to call a friend.\n\n\"Although we had our political disagreements, there were many moments with her, both public and private, that showed me that bipartisanship and service to country first can still bring members of Congress together.\n\n\"In these divided times, Congresswoman Lee and I were able to partner on several legislative initiatives for the city of the Houston.

At the time, she acknowledged that \"the road ahead will not be easy\" and said she had \"faith that God will strengthen me.\"\n\nHer family remembered her as \"a fierce champion of the people,\" saying that \"she was affectionately and simply known as 'Congresswoman' by her constituents in recognition of her near-ubiquitous presence and service to their daily lives for more than 30 years.\"\n\nBorn on January 12, 1950, in Queens, New York, Jackson Lee was among the first women to graduate from Yale University and served as a Houston municipal judge and a city councilwoman before she was first elected to represent Texas' 18th Congressional District in 1994, unseating a Democratic incumbent in the primary for the Houston-area seat.\n\nDuring her congressional tenure, Jackson Lee was an outspoken advocate for progressive interests and Black Americans. She was one of the sponsors of legislation to establish Juneteenth as a national holiday, frequently spoke out against police brutality and advocated federal legislation to prosecute police misconduct.\n\nShe was widely admired among progressives for her opposition to the Iraq War and was a fierce critic of former President Donald Trump. She opposed the tallying of electoral votes certifying Trump as the winner of the 2016 election, citing an unfounded claim about \"massive voter suppression,\" and occasionally used her position on the House Judiciary Committee to excoriate members of Trump's circle.\n\nAlthough she was unsuccessful in some of her most ambitious aims, Jackson Lee remained an advocate for racial justice, particularly in the wake of George Floyd's killing at the hands of police in 2020.\n\n\"We will not stop until the nation knows Black lives matter, and reparations are passed as the most significant civil rights legislation of the 21st century,\" Jackson Lee said at a march in Washington in 2020.\n\nAt the time of her death, she was a chief deputy whip for House Democrats and a vice chair of the Congressional Progressive Caucus. She formerly served as whip of the Congressional Black Caucus.\n\n\"Congresswoman Jackson Lee was a patriot and a fighter to the very end. Words cannot express the sense of loss our Caucus feels for our beloved friend. She will be deeply missed by all who knew her,\" Congressional Black Caucus Chairman Steven Horsford and members of the Congressional Black Caucus said in a statement following her death.\n\nJackson Lee's tenure in Congress was not without controversy. Her ties to Enron - her district included the corporation's headquarters and it was a major contributor to her early congressional campaigns, The New York Times reported - were scrutinized in the aftermath of the company's failure in the early 2000s, though she denied taking it easy on the company.\n\nAnd in 2019, she resigned as chairwoman of the nonprofit Congressional Black Caucus Foundation and stepped down from a House Judiciary subcommittee chairmanship after a lawsuit that alleged she fired a staffer who reported sexual assault by a supervisor at the foundation. At the time, Jackson Lee declined to \"discuss specific details about internal personnel matters\" but otherwise denied the allegations, and the lawsuit was ultimately dismissed by a federal judge in February 2020.\n\nLast year, Lee sought the Houston mayorship, earning endorsements from former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, former President Bill Clinton, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and Harris County Judge Lina Hidalgo. She lost in a runoff to Texas state Sen. John Whitmire, a fellow Democrat.\n\nFollowing that loss, Jackson Lee filed to seek a 16th term in Congress, and in March, she won a competitive Democratic primary over former Houston City Council Member Amanda Edwards, a former intern.\n\nHouse Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries said in a statement that House Democrats and the city of Houston \"mourn a giant,\" remembering the congresswoman as \"an accomplished legislator, passionate public servant, loving mentor and wonderful friend to so many of us in the Congressional Black Caucus and House Democratic Caucus family.\"\n\n\"I am grateful for her fearless advocacy, fierce determination, formidable service and legacy of leadership,\" Jeffries said.\n\nCalling her death a \"tremendous loss,\" Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer wrote on X that the congresswoman \"fought so hard throughout her life to make our country a better place for all.\"\n\n\"I have never known a harder-working political leader than Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee, who studied every bill and every amendment with exactitude and then told Texas and America exactly where she stood,\" Maryland Rep. Jamie Raskin said on X.\n\nOn CNN's \"Laura Coates Live,\" fellow Texas Rep. Al Green remembered Jackson Lee as \"someone in Congress that was always, always working to bring about a just resolution to any problem,\" adding that she helped him become a better congressman.\n\nIn Congress, she developed a reputation for grabbing a seat close to the entranceway in the House chamber for the president's annual State of the Union address so she could engage with the commander in chief. It wasn't for the photo opportunities, she insisted to The Huffington Post in 2016, it was also an opportunity to quickly conduct business with presidents.\n\nAs to why she was able to gain regular access to such a prized perch, she said, \"Because of so many good friends, I am welcomed in that seat.\"\n\nFuneral arrangements are pending, according to the family.\n\n\"Her legislative victories impacted millions, from establishing the Juneteenth Federal Holiday to reauthorizing the Violence Against Women Act. However, she impacted us most as our beloved wife, sister, mother, and Bebe (grandmother),\" her family said Friday. \"She will be dearly missed, but her legacy will continue to inspire all who believe in freedom, justice, and democracy.\"\n\nThis story has been updated with additional details.\n\nCNN's Chandelis Duster contributed to this report.\n\nThe-CNN-Wire\n\n\u2122 & \u00a9 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

Her family announced her passing on Friday evening.\n\n\"Today, with incredible grief for our loss yet deep gratitude for the life she shared with us, we announce the passing of US Representative Sheila Jackson Lee of the 18th Congressional District of Texas. A fierce champion of the people, she was affectionately and simply known as 'Congresswoman' by her constituents in recognition for her near-ubiquitous presence and service to their daily lives for more than 30 years,\" her family wrote in a statement released on her Twitter account.\n\nGiven Texas's status as a traditionally red state, tributes for Jackson Lee poured in from friends made on both sides of the aisle during her time in Congress - including such polar opposites as Nancy Pelosi, Jamaal Bowman and Ted Cruz.\n\n\"It is with deep sadness that I learned of the passing of my dear friend and colleague Congresswoman Sheila Jackson Lee,\" said former speaker of the House Ms Pelosi.\n\n\"Congresswoman Jackson Lee achieved a remarkable legislative record in the Congress for Houston and for our country. As a powerful voice for our Constitution and human rights, she fought tirelessly to advance fairness, equity and justice for all.\n\n\"All of us in the House Democratic Caucus were blessed to know Congresswoman Sheila Jackson Lee and we will miss her dearly,\" she said.\n\n\"I'm deeply saddened by the passing of my friend and colleague Sheila Jackson Lee. She was a tireless advocate for Houston. I will always cherish our friendship and the laughs we shared throughout the years. Heidi and I offer our prayers and sincerest condolences to her family,\" wrote Mr Cruz.\n\nA proud blue stalwart in a conservative bastion, Jackson Lee's Twitter account was active just hours before her death. Her final statements were a rousing condemnation of Donald Trump's speech to the RNC in Milwaukee on Thursday.\n\n\"I have no idea what Donald Trump was talking about last night,\" read a post dated Thursday evening after Trump's speech wrapped up. \"For more than an hour, he rambled and lied. He is unfit for the Presidency! Now, my friends, is the time to focus on beating him and his Project 2025 monstrosity. Enough is enough!\"\n\nJackson Lee was a graduate of Yale, and went on to earn a law degree from the University of Virginia Law School. During her Yale bachelor's she was classmates with several other future fixtures of US political life, including Dr Ben and wife Candy Carson, as well as Henry Louis Gates.\n\nIn Congress, she was a leader in the Congressional Progressive Caucus and Congressional Black Caucus, as well as chief deputy whip for her party at large.\n\nAs a legislator, she carved out a progressive reputation, even at the cost of being a lone figure on some issues. She was an early opponent of the Iraq war, and championed legislation calling for reparations to Black descendants of enslaved Africans brought to the US as part of the intercontinental slave trade prior to the Civil War.\n\n\"Cecilia and I will forever remember Congresswoman Sheila Jackson Lee,\" Texas governor Greg Abbott, a conservative, wrote on Friday evening. \"She was a proud Texan and a tireless advocate for the people of Houston.

US President Joe Biden signed legislation in 2021 recognizing \"Juneteenth\" as a federal holiday.\n\nThe holiday is a memorial to the day in 1865 when a Union general informed a group of enslaved people in Texas that they had been made free two years earlier by President Abraham Lincoln's Emancipation Proclamation during the Civil War.\n\nJackson Lee revealed last month she had pancreatic cancer and was undergoing treatment. The Democrat was 74 and had also previously recovered from breast cancer.\n\n\"She will be dearly missed, but her legacy will continue to inspire all who believe in freedom, justice, and democracy,\" the family statement concluded.", "source": {"uri": "dw.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Deutsche Welle"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheila_Jackson_Lee", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sheila Jackson Lee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jackson,_Mississippi", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Jackson, Mississippi"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Jackson, Mississippi"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressivism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Progressivism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women's_rights", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Women's rights"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pancreatic_cancer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pancreatic cancer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_people", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Black people"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juneteenth", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Juneteenth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-racism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Anti-racism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_holidays_in_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Federal holidays in the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_rights", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Human rights"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_Americans", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "African Americans"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emancipation_Proclamation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Emancipation Proclamation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Union_(American_Civil_War)", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Union (American Civil War)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slavery_in_the_United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Slavery in the United States"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abraham_Lincoln", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Abraham Lincoln"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slavery", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Slavery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_justice", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Social justice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Civil_War", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "American Civil War"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_inequality", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Economic inequality"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democracy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Democracy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cancer"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Abortion", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Abortion", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/End-of-Life", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/End-of-Life", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Nursing/History", "label": "dmoz/Health/Nursing/History", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 67}], "image": "https://static.dw.com/image/69719157_6.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9748703", "eventUri": "eng-9748703", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.4039215686274509, "wgt": 184, "relevance": 1}

Sheila Jackson Lee, a longtime Democratic congresswoman from Texas who has died, according to a statement from her office. She was 74.\n\n(CNN) -- Sheila Jackson Lee, a longtime Democratic congresswoman from Texas who was an outspoken advocate for Black Americans for decades, has died. She was 74.\n\n\"Today, with incredible grief for our loss yet deep gratitude for the life she shared with us, we announce the passing of United States Representative Sheila Jackson Lee of the 18th Congressional District of Texas,\" her family said in a statement Friday.\n\nJackson Lee announced in June that she had been diagnosed with pancreatic cancer. At the time, she acknowledged that \"the road ahead will not be easy\" and said she had \"faith that God will strengthen me.\"\n\nHer family remembered her as \"a fierce champion of the people,\" saying that \"she was affectionately and simply known as 'Congresswoman' by her constituents in recognition of her near-ubiquitous presence and service to their daily lives for more than 30 years.\"\n\nBorn on January 12, 1950, in Queens, New York, Jackson Lee was among the first women to graduate from Yale University and served as a Houston municipal judge and a city councilwoman before she was first elected to represent Texas' 18th Congressional District in 1994, unseating a Democratic incumbent in the primary for the Houston-area seat.\n\nDuring her congressional tenure, she was an outspoken advocate for progressive interests and Black Americans. She was one of the sponsors of legislation to establish Juneteenth as a national holiday, frequently spoke out against police brutality and advocated federal legislation to prosecute police misconduct.\n\nShe was widely admired among progressives for her opposition to the Iraq War and was a fierce critic of former President Donald Trump. She opposed the tallying of electoral votes certifying Trump as the winner of the 2016 election, citing an unfounded claim about \"massive voter suppression,\" and occasionally used her position on the House Judiciary Committee to excoriate members of Trump's circle.\n\nAlthough she was unsuccessful in some of her most ambitious aims, Jackson Lee remained an advocate for racial justice, particularly in the wake of George Floyd's killing at the hands of police in 2020.\n\n\"We will not stop until the nation knows Black lives matter, and reparations are passed as the most significant civil rights legislation of the 21st century,\" Jackson Lee said at a march in Washington in 2020.\n\nAt the time of her death, she was a chief deputy whip for House Democrats and a vice chair of the Congressional Progressive Caucus. She formerly served as whip of the Congressional Black Caucus.\n\n\"Congresswoman Jackson Lee was a patriot and a fighter to the very end. Words cannot express the sense of loss our Caucus feels for our beloved friend. She will be deeply missed by all who knew her,\" Congressional Black Caucus Chairman Steven Horsford and members of the Congressional Black Caucus said in a statement following her death.\n\nJackson Lee's tenure in Congress was not without controversy. Her ties to Enron - her district included the corporation's headquarters and it was a major contributor to her early congressional campaigns, The New York Times reported - were scrutinized in the aftermath of the company's failure in the early 2000s, though she denied taking it easy on the company.\n\nAnd in 2019, she resigned as chairwoman of the nonprofit Congressional Black Caucus Foundation and stepped down from a House Judiciary subcommittee chairmanship after a lawsuit that alleged she fired a staffer who reported sexual assault by a supervisor at the foundation. At the time, Jackson Lee declined to \"discuss specific details about internal personnel matters\" but otherwise denied the allegations, and the lawsuit was ultimately dismissed by a federal judge in February 2020.\n\nLast year, Lee sought the Houston mayorship, earning endorsements from former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, former President Bill Clinton, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and Harris County Judge Lina Hidalgo. She lost in a runoff to Texas state Sen. John Whitmire, a fellow Democrat.\n\nFollowing that loss, Jackson Lee filed to seek a 16th term in Congress, and in March, she won a competitive Democratic primary over former Houston City Council Member Amanda Edwards, a former intern.\n\nIn Congress, she developed a reputation for grabbing a seat close to the entranceway in the House chamber for the president's annual State of the Union address so she could engage with the commander in chief. It wasn't for the photo opportunities, she insisted to The Huffington Post in 2016 - it was also an opportunity to quickly conduct business with presidents.\n\nAs to why she was able to gain regular access to such a prized perch, she said, \"Because of so many good friends, I am welcomed in that seat.\"\n\nFuneral arrangements are pending, according to the family.\n\n\"Her legislative victories impacted millions, from establishing the Juneteenth Federal Holiday to reauthorizing the Violence Against Women Act. However, she impacted us most as our beloved wife, sister, mother, and Bebe (grandmother),\" her family said Friday. \"She will be dearly missed, but her legacy will continue to inspire all who believe in freedom, justice, and democracy.\"\n\nThis story has been updated with additional details.\n\nCNN's Chandelis Duster contributed to this report.\n\nThe-CNN-Wire\n\n\u2122 & \u00a9 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

Dies Aged 74 after Battling Pancreatic Cancer", "body": "Despite her challenging diagnosis, Jackson Lee was campaigning for a 16th term as Texas' representative.\n\nTexas Representative Sheila Jackson Lee has died at the age of 74, her family announced on Friday, just two months after the veteran lawmaker revealed her cancer diagnosis. The Democratic congresswoman, who represented Texas' 18th District since 1995, announced in June that she was battling pancreatic cancer.\n\nAt that time, Jackson Lee told her constituents that she would likely be \"occasionally absent\" from Congress due to her treatment. The 15-term congresswoman had been a vocal advocate for Black Americans for many years. The exact timing of Jackson Lee's death was not shared by her family immediately. Before making her mark in politics, Jackson Lee grew up in Queens, New York.\n\nLosing a Tough Battle\n\n\"A local, national, and international humanitarian, she was acknowledged worldwide for her courageous fights for racial justice, criminal justice, and human rights, with a special emphasis on women and children,\" a statement from her family said.\n\nJackson Lee was born in Queens, New York. She graduated from Jamaica High School and went on to earn a degree in political science from Yale University in 1972, followed by a JD from the University of Virginia Law School in 1975.\n\nJackson Lee relocated to Houston with her husband, Elwyn Lee, where she made several attempts to secure local judgeships before becoming a municipal judge in the late 1980s.\n\nThe Democrat transitioned into politics when she was sworn in as the representative for the 18th Congressional District in 1994, just a few months after her unsuccessful run for Houston mayor.\n\nShe sought to become the first Black female mayor of the nation's fourth-largest city. Jackson Lee's district encompasses downtown Houston and several of the city's historically Black neighborhoods.\n\nDespite her challenging diagnosis, Jackson Lee was campaigning for a 16th term as Texas' representative.\n\nShowed Concerning Behavior During Her Final Days\n\nJust last month, she revealed that she was receiving treatment for pancreatic cancer, which has a 44 percent survival rate according to the American Cancer Society. Jackson Lee did not disclose how long she had been dealing with the illness or its stage of progression.\n\nOver the past year, the congresswoman exhibited some concerning behavior, such as mistakenly referring to the moon as a \"planet\" made mostly of gases during a talk with high school students in April, and expressing a desire to be \"first in line\" to learn how to live there.\n\nSeveral months earlier, she also instructed her constituents to vote on the incorrect day.\n\nIt is unclear whether these mistakes were connected to her cancer diagnosis.\n\nJackson Lee was known in Washington, DC, for high staff turnover due to her reportedly unusual and demanding behavior toward staffers, earning a reputation as one of the \"meanest\" members of Congress.\n\nShe was also one of the legislators who advocated for making Juneteenth a national holiday.", "source": {"uri": "ibtimes.sg", "dataType": "news", "title": "International Business Times, Singapore Edition"}, "authors": [{"uri": "r_ghosh@ibtimes.sg", "name": "R.

She had previously had breast cancer and announced the pancreatic cancer diagnosis on June 2.\n\n\"The road ahead will not be easy, but I stand in faith that God will strengthen me,\" Jackson Lee said in a statement then.\n\nJackson Lee had just been elected to the Houston district once represented by Barbara Jordan, the first Black woman elected to Congress from a Southern state since Reconstruction, when she was immediately placed on the high-profile House Judiciary Committee in 1995.\n\n\"They just saw me, I guess through my profile, through Barbara Jordan's work,\" Jackson Lee told the Houston Chronicle in 2022. \"I thought it was an honor because they assumed I was going to be the person they needed.\"\n\nJackson Lee quickly established herself as fierce advocate for women and minorities, and a leader for House Democrats on many social justice issues, from policing reform to reparations for descendants of enslaved people. She led the first rewrite of the Violence Against Women Act in nearly a decade, which included protections for Native American, transgender and immigrant women.\n\nJackson Lee was also among the lead lawmakers behind the effort in 2021 to have Juneteenth recognized as the first new federal holiday since Martin Luther King, Jr. Day was established in 1986. The holiday marks the day in 1865 that the last enslaved African Americans in Galveston, Texas, finally learned of their freedom.\n\nA native of Queens, New York, Jackson Lee graduated from Yale and earned her law degree at the University of Virginia. She was a judge in Houston before she was elected to Houston City Council in 1989, then ran for Congress in 1994. She was an advocate for gay rights and an early opponent of the Iraq War in 2003.\n\nJackson Lee routinely won reelection to Congress with ease. The few times she faced a challenger, she never carried less than two-thirds of the vote. Jackson Lee considered leaving Congress in 2023 in a bid to become Houston's first female Black mayor but was defeated in a runoff. She then easily won the Democratic nomination for the 2024 general election.\n\nDuring the mayoral campaign, Jackson Lee expressed regret and said \"everyone deserves to be treated with dignity and

She was 74.\n\n\"Today, with incredible grief for our loss yet deep gratitude for the life she shared with us, we announce the passing of United States Representative Sheila Jackson Lee of the 18th Congressional District of Texas,\" her family said in a statement Friday.\n\nJackson Lee announced in June that she had been diagnosed with pancreatic cancer. At the time, she acknowledged that \"the road ahead will not be easy\" and said she had \"faith that God will strengthen me.\"\n\nHer family remembered her as \"a fierce champion of the people,\" saying that \"she was affectionately and simply known as 'Congresswoman' by her constituents in recognition of her near-ubiquitous presence and service to their daily lives for more than 30 years.\"\n\nBorn on January 12, 1950, in Queens, New York, Jackson Lee was among the first women to graduate from Yale University and served as a Houston municipal judge and a city councilwoman before she was first elected to represent Texas' 18th Congressional District in 1994, unseating a Democratic incumbent in the primary for the Houston-area seat.\n\nDuring her congressional tenure, she was an outspoken advocate for progressive interests and Black Americans. She was one of the sponsors of legislation to establish Juneteenth as a national holiday, frequently spoke out against police brutality and advocated federal legislation to prosecute police misconduct.\n\nShe was widely admired among progressives for her opposition to the Iraq War and was a fierce critic of former President Donald Trump. She opposed the tallying of electoral votes certifying Trump as the winner of the 2016 election, citing an unfounded claim about \"massive voter suppression,\" and occasionally used her position on the House Judiciary Committee to excoriate members of Trump's circle.\n\nAlthough she was unsuccessful in some of her most ambitious aims, Jackson Lee remained an advocate for racial justice, particularly in the wake of George Floyd's killing at the hands of police in 2020.\n\n\"We will not stop until the nation knows Black lives matter, and reparations are passed as the most significant civil rights legislation of the 21st century,\" Jackson Lee said at a march in Washington in 2020.\n\nAt the time of her death, she was a chief deputy whip for House Democrats and a vice chair of the Congressional Progressive Caucus. She formerly served as whip of the Congressional Black Caucus.\n\n\"Congresswoman Jackson Lee was a patriot and a fighter to the very end. Words cannot express the sense of loss our Caucus feels for our beloved friend. She will be deeply missed by all who knew her,\" Congressional Black Caucus Chairman Steven Horsford and members of the Congressional Black Caucus said in a statement following her death.\n\nJackson Lee's tenure in Congress was not without controversy. Her ties to Enron - her district included the corporation's headquarters and it was a major contributor to her early congressional campaigns, The New York Times reported - were scrutinized in the aftermath of the company's failure in the early 2000s, though she denied taking it easy on the company.\n\nAnd in 2019, she resigned as chairwoman of the nonprofit Congressional Black Caucus Foundation and stepped down from a House Judiciary subcommittee chairmanship after a lawsuit that alleged she fired a staffer who reported sexual assault by a supervisor at the foundation. At the time, Jackson Lee declined to \"discuss specific details about internal personnel matters\" but otherwise denied the allegations, and the lawsuit was ultimately dismissed by a federal judge in February 2020.\n\nLast year, Lee sought the Houston mayorship, earning endorsements from former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, former President Bill Clinton, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and Harris County Judge Lina Hidalgo. She lost in a runoff to Texas state Sen. John Whitmire, a fellow Democrat.\n\nFollowing that loss, Jackson Lee filed to seek a 16th term in Congress, and in March, she won a competitive Democratic primary over former Houston City Council Member Amanda Edwards, a former intern.\n\nIn Congress, she developed a reputation for grabbing a seat close to the entranceway in the House chamber for the president's annual State of the Union address so she could engage with the commander in chief. It wasn't for the photo opportunities, she insisted to The Huffington Post in 2016 - it was also an opportunity to quickly conduct business with presidents.\n\nAs to why she was able to gain regular access to such a prized perch, she said, \"Because of so many good friends, I am welcomed in that seat.\"\n\nFuneral arrangements are pending, according to the family.\n\n\"Her legislative victories impacted millions, from establishing the Juneteenth Federal Holiday to reauthorizing the Violence Against Women Act.

Sheila Jackson Lee, Champion for Progressive Causes, Dies at 74", "body": "Representative Sheila Jackson Lee, a Democrat from Texas who was a leading voice for racial justice and progressive causes during the three decades she served in the House, died on Friday. She was 74.\n\nHer death was announced in a statement by her family that did not list a cause. She said in June that she had pancreatic cancer.\n\n\"By God's grace, I will be back at full strength soon,\" she told constituents at the time.\n\nMs. Jackson Lee, a former member of the Houston City Council who was elected to Congress in 1994, was an irrepressible presence from the start, relentlessly lobbying senior members for speaking time and almost always getting her way.\n\nTo critics, she would say that she was just serving her constituents.\n\n\"You have an obligation to make sure that their concerns are heard, are answered,\" she said in a 1999 interview with The New York Times. \"I need to make a difference. I don't have wealth to write a check. But maybe I can be a voice arguing consistently for change.\"\n\nDuring her congressional career, Ms. Jackson Lee served as chairwoman of the Judiciary Subcommittee for Crime, Terrorism and Homeland Security, and as a senior member of the Judiciary, Homeland Security and Budget committees.\n\nShe was the author and lead sponsor of the legislation that in 2021 established Juneteenth, commemorating the end of slavery in the United States, as the first new federal holiday in 38 years.\n\nThe Congressional Black Caucus called Ms. Jackson Lee \"a fierce advocate for social and economic justice, national and homeland security, energy independence, and children and working families\" in a statement released late Friday.\n\nWhat turned out to be one of her final political races was last year, when she lost the Houston mayoral election to John Whitmire, a moderate Democrat and former state senator. Though she entered the race with strong backing from many Democrats and Black voters, Ms. Jackson Lee struggled to establish a message and expand her base of support.\n\nShe won the Democratic primary for her seat in Congress in March, standing for re-election for her 16th term in the House.\n\nSheila Jackson was born on Jan. 12, 1950, in Queens, N.Y., according to the Congressional Directory. Her father, Ezra Jackson, a son of immigrants from Jamaica, worked as a cartoonist who drew comics for Marvel in the 1940s, she said in an interview with The Houston Chronicle last year. Her mother, Ivalita Bennett Jackson, was a vocational nurse, according to her obituary by the Houston Chronicle in 2010.\n\nMs. Jackson Lee did not set out for a political career at first. When she and her brother were growing up in Queens, she planned to become an executive secretary.\n\nBut when she was a student at Jamaica High School, the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. was assassinated, altering her goals. The event led to the creation of grants for Black students at New York University, one of which she received. It also filled her with a new fire, she said in the 1999 interview. If Dr. King had died trying to create opportunities for people like her, shouldn't she reach as high as she could?\n\n\"I am a benefactor of the hills and valleys, the broken bodies and broken hearts, the loss of life of many who have gone on before me,\" Ms. Jackson Lee said.\n\nShe transferred to Yale, where she graduated with a degree in political science in 1972, then earned a law degree in 1975 from the University of Virginia. Marriage led her to Houston, where her husband, Elwyn Cornelius Lee, who survives her, is a senior administrator at the University of Houston. She worked for 12 years as a lawyer there before becoming a judge in 1987.\n\nShe began her political career in 1990, when she joined Houston's City Council. In 1994, she was elected to Congress, beginning a nearly 30-year tenure in the House of Representatives.\n\nShe said in interviews that her political ambition sprang in part from her wish to give women and Black and Hispanic people a fair shot at success.\n\nBy her mayoral race last year, many Houstonians were familiar with Ms. Jackson Lee. She had won endorsements from prominent Democrats, including Hillary Clinton, who traveled to Houston to rally for the candidate, and local leaders, like the departing mayor, Sylvester Turner. Ms. Jackson Lee polled far better with Democrats than Mr. Whitmire before the vote.\n\nMr. Whitmire said in a statement that Ms. Jackson Lee was \"a dedicated public servant and a champion for her constituents,\" adding that he had worked with her recently at the Houston Office of Emergency Management to help Houstonians recover from a storm.\n\nIn addition to her husband, Ms. Jackson Lee is survived by their two children, Jason Cornelius Bennett and Erica Shelwyn, as well as grandchildren.", "source": {"uri": "dnyuz.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "DNyuz"}, "authors": [], "concepts":

Sheila Jackson Lee is dead at 74", "body": "Sign up for The Brief, The Texas Tribune's daily newsletter that keeps readers up to speed on the most essential Texas news.\n\nRecommended Videos\n\nWASHINGTON -- Sheila Jackson Lee, a Houston Democrat who was one of the longest serving members of Texas' Congressional delegation and a longtime advocate for progressive causes, died on Friday amid her battle with pancreatic cancer. She was 74.\n\nJackson Lee began her congressional career as an underdog, defeating four-term U.S. Rep. Craig Washingtonin the 1994 Democratic primary, before establishing herself as a fixture in Congress and Houston with ties to the highest reaches of the Democratic Party.\n\nJackson Lee was a progressive fixture on Capitol Hill for decades. She was an early opponent of the Iraq War and advocate for gay rights. In 2021, Jackson Lee was arrested for engaging in civil disobedience over a federal voting rights bill. By the time of her death, she was a senior member of the House Judiciary, Homeland Security and Budget committees. She never shied from speaking on the House floor or before the cameras on causes she cared about.\n\nShe was also a household name in the 18th Congressional District, which includes Downtown Houston. She was known for her frequent visibility at constituent graduations, funerals and baby showers.\n\nShe often used her trademark chutzpah to fight for federal funds to be sent to Houston. In 2009, she secured $1 billion for the city's light system after cornering then-Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood ahead of then-President Barack Obama's first joint address to Congress. She could reliably be found in the aisle ahead of the State of the Union address, among the few members to directly meet with the president on his way to the dais.\n\n\"Sheila is ... a real combative advocate, in my opinion,\" said U.S. Rep. Frank Pallone, a New Jersey Democrat, in 2017. \"When she believes in an issue or in a person she goes to bat.\"\n\nBut that persistence waned this year as her illness kept her increasingly at home, missing every vote in June and almost all of May, according to the House Clerk.\n\nJackson Lee was operating in full gear only months before. The veteran congresswoman made a pivot last year when she announced a run for Houston mayor.\n\n\"I hope I've been a humble servant for you for 28 years,\" she said at City Cathedral Church, where she announced her bid. \"Sheila Jackson Lee wants to come home to be your Mayor, for the City of Houston.\"\n\nThe move was rumored for months but ended up becoming a messy debacle after a leaked tape last year revealed her berating staff with a string of profanities. Her office was long known for a high turnover rate among staff. Despite an endorsement from outgoing-Mayor Sylvester Turner and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, Jackson Lee lost the race to former-state Sen. John Whitmire, a fellow Democrat.\n\nJackson Lee then faced her first competitive primary in decades, a race against Amanda Edwards, who years ago served as an intern in her office. Jackson Lee was able to tap into decades of strong relationships throughout her party, securing the endorsement of the Democratic establishment going all the way up to President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris. House Democratic leadership and former Presidents Bill Clinton and Barack Obama also endorsed her in the race. She won the primary by over 22 percentage points.\n\nA native of Queens, New York, Jackson Lee graduated from Yale University in 1972, part of one of the first classes of women to graduate from the university, and from the University of Virginia Law School in 1975. She moved to Houston after her husband, fellow Yale alumnus and Houston native Elwyn Lee, got a job with the University of Houston.\n\nShe served on the Houston city council before launching her 1994 campaign for Congress. She and Austin Democratic Rep. Lloyd Doggett were the longest-serving Texans in Congress at the time of her death.\n\nOnce in Congress, Jackson Lee built strong ties with her party's leadership and throughout her caucus. She has campaigned for her friends in far flung districts and in the Capitol for leadership positions. She played a major role in Pallone's bid to be the top Democrat on the influential Energy and Commerce committee and advocated for House Speaker Nancy Pelosi to again take the gavel in 2018 amid a left-wing revolt againsther leadership. Jackson Lee also served as one of 10 deputies to House Minority Whip Katherine Clark.\n\nThere are benefits to her strong relationships. She was the first female Ranking Member of the Judiciary Subcommittee for Crime and Federal Government Surveillance and chaired the subcommittee in the 117th Congress from 2020 to 2022. She was also tapped to speak at the 2016 Democratic National Convention, heralded by the staff of Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton as a uniquely effective surrogate.\n\nJackson Lee stepped into the shoes of the trailblazers who held the 18th Congressional District seat before her - including Barbara Jordan, the first Black woman from a southern state to be elected to the United States House of Representative, and Mickey Leland, a former At-Large Majority Whip.\n\nJackson Lee was not immune from criticism, particularly over her avid hunger for the spotlight and her high staff turnover. Washingtonian Magazine dubbed her among the \"meanest\" members of Congress for her treatment of her staff.\n\nJackson Lee expressed remorse after the audio of her verbally abusing staff leaked last year, saying in a statement at the time that \"in my zeal to do everything possible to deliver for my constituents I have in the past fallen short of my own standards and there is no excuse for that.\"\n\nBut she has also noted that her white, male colleagues often escape the criticisms regarding how they treat staff that have followed her through her career.\n\n\"I'm a woman of a certain era,\" she told the Tribune in 2017. \"I think I've been a victim of discrimination, sexism and even racism, frankly, because I am sure there is a whole array of stories to be told, and I don't go around trying to find out about them ... I don't worry about it. I do the work in this office. I do it quietly and consistently, and I check off the boxes of who's being helped and who's in need.\"\n\nBig news: director and screenwriter Richard Linklater; NPR President and CEO Katherine Maher; U.S. Rep.

Sheila Jackson Lee, a 15-term Democrat from Houston who whose record includes being the chief House sponsor of the 2021 resolution making Juneteenth a federal holiday, died on Friday at the age of 74. A survivor of breast cancer, she revealed in June she had pancreatic cancer.\n\n\"A fierce champion of the people, she was affectionately and simply known as 'Congresswoman' by her constituents in recognition of her near-ubiquitous presence and service to their daily lives for more than 30 years,\" Jackson Lee's family said in a statement released from her office.\n\nA statement from the Congressional Black Caucus, in which she had served as whip and chair of the foundation, called her a \"titan and stalwart member of Congress.\" House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., called Jackson Lee \"an inimitable force for change.\"\n\n\"Congresswoman Jackson Lee was a fierce advocate for social and economic justice, national and homeland security, energy independence, and children and working families,\" Jeffries said. \"She will be deeply missed by all who knew her.\"\n\nHouse Homeland Security ranking member Bennie Thompson, D-Miss., said Jackson Lee fought for resources for first responders, disaster relief and improvements to aviation security, immigration and border security as a member of the committee.\n\n\"Congresswoman Jackson Lee was relentless, and every cause she took on was better because of it,\" Thompson said.\n\nShe was also a member of the Budget and Judiciary panels, serving as top Democrat on Judiciary's crime subcommittee.\n\nJackson Lee was also known as a demanding boss who churned through staff. She swatted away criticisms of her workplace environment as fueled by \"sexism and even racism,\" according to a report by the Texas Tribune in 2017.\n\n\"I'm a tough lady, and I have been in the skin of a woman and an African-American, and I understand the injustices we have to live through,\" she told the Tribune. \"I just take it with a smile because I love the institution, I love the people I get to serve and I have wonderful colleagues that I get the chance to serve with.\"\n\nJackson Lee was raised in the Jamaica section of Queens in New York City. She was 18 when Martin Luther King Jr. was assassinated, and once told the Houston Chronicle that it changed her life.\n\nShe cast aside plans for business college and, using a scholarship bestowed in King's memory, went to New York University. She transferred to Yale as soon as it admitted women undergraduates, and after getting her degree in 1972 did summer work for the Southern Christian Leadership Conference.\n\nAfter completing law school at the University of Virginia in 1975, she worked for a time on the House Select Committee on Assassinations. When her husband landed a teaching job in Houston, the couple relocated there and Jackson Lee worked at a series of law firms.\n\nShe tried to start a political career by seeking local judgeships. After two failed attempts, she was appointed to the municipal bench in 1987; she then lost a bid for Texas District Court judge.\n\nShe finally broke through by winning an at-large seat on the city council. Five years later, she got to Congress by handily winning the Democratic primary against an incumbent, Craig Washington, who was plagued by personal and financial problems. She beat him by 27 percentage points.\n\nJackson Lee ran for mayor of Houston last year, but lost a runoff in December and pivoted back to seek reelection even though a city council member had already raised more than $1 million for the race to succeed her in Congress. Jackson Lee won the March primary with 60 percent of the vote.\n\nHer district is heavily Democratic -- Joe Biden beat Donald Trump by 38 percentage points in 2020, according to Inside Elections. It's not clear, however, how long Jackson Lee's seat will remain vacant. It could be a while.\n\nTexas law requires a special election to fill a U.S. House seat to take place on the next \"uniform election date\" in the state -- in this case, Nov. 5, just like for every other House seat. But the catch may be the vote would take place \"on or after the 36th day\" from when the election \"is ordered.\"\n\nThe statute says nothing on when the governor must \"order\" the election. In addition, assuming some sort of primary process to determine the Democratic nominee, the general election to fill the vacancy could potentially slip to the next uniform election date in May 2025 -- depending on when Texas Gov. Greg Abbott, a Republican, first \"orders\" the special election.\n\nAlternatively, the statute allows the governor to call an \"emergency\" election, which can be held on a non-uniform election date on a Tuesday or Saturday between 36 and 64 days after the election is ordered. But again that's at the discretion of Abbott, whose term isn't up until January 2027, and he hasn't commented except to mourn Jackson Lee's passing.\n\n\"She was a proud Texan and a tireless advocate for the people of Houston,\" Abbott said in a statement. \"Her legacy of public service and dedication to Texas will live on.\"\n\nRepublicans held a 220-213 edge in the House before Jackson Lee's death, with vacancies set to be filled in November in the heavily Democratic 10th District in New Jersey and the heavily Republican 8th District in Wisconsin.\n\nThe Juneteenth holiday recognizes June 19, 1865, as the day Union troops under the command of Maj. Gen. Gordon Granger arrived in Galveston, Texas, to find Black men, women and children still in bondage months after the Confederacy's surrender and more than two years after President Abraham Lincoln issued the Emancipation Proclamation.\n\nIn the years since, Juneteenth grew from a folk jubilee celebrating the de facto end of slavery into a holiday recognized in 47 states and the District of Columbia. But without federal recognition, few Americans got off from work to observe it.\n\nJackson Lee said in 2021 called the holiday \"a wonderful story\" about \"who we are as a nation.\" The law making it a federal holiday was the first enacted since Martin Luther King Jr. Day was added in 1983.", "source": {"uri": "rollcall.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Roll Call"}, "authors": [{"uri":

Sheila Jackson Lee (D-Texas) has passed away at the age of 74 years old, succumbing after a battle with pancreatic cancer.\n\nThe Texas Democrat who last year lost her bid to become the mayor of Houston died on Friday, leaving a hole in the hearts of grieving constituents in the state's 18th congressional district which she has represented for 30 years, over a month after she revealed that she had been diagnosed with the disease.\n\n\"Today, with deep grief for our loss yet deep gratitude for the life she shared with us, we announce the passing of United States Representative Sheila Jackson Lee of the 18th Congressional District of Texas,\" the deceased congresswoman's office announced in a statement.\n\n\"A fierce champion of the people, she was affectionately and simply known as 'Congresswoman' by her constituents in recognition of her near-ubiquitous presence and service to their daily lives for more than 30 years,\" the statement read. \"A local, national, and international humanitarian, she was acknowledged worldwide for her courageous fights for racial justice, criminal justice, and human rights, with a special emphasis on women and children.\"\n\nLee was the driving force behind the establishment of Juneteenth as a federal holiday, an accomplishment that was largely made possible by the \"racial reckoning\" in the aftermath of the death of George Floyd who grew up in Houston. She stood beside President Joe Biden when he signed the bill in June 2021 recognizing the day.\n\n\"Her legislative victories impacted millions, from establishing the Juneteenth Federal Holiday to reauthorizing the Violence Against Women Act. However, she impacted us most as our beloved wife, sister, mother, and Bebe (grandmother). She will be dearly missed, but her legacy will continue to inspire all who believe in freedom, justice, and democracy. God bless you Congresswoman and God bless the United States of America,\" the statement from Lee's office read.\n\nNews of the congresswoman's death brought an outpouring of condolences on X.\n\nA staunch supporter of Biden, Lee was waging the battle against Trump until her last moments with a Friday post to her X account likely written by a staffer emphasizing the importance of the election.\n\nLee recently made news after a recording of her berating staffers in a foul-mouthed manner was made public prior to the Houston mayoral election.\n\n\"I don't want you to do a godd**n thing. I want you to have a f**king brain. I want you to have read it. I want you to say, Congresswoman, with such and such date,\" Lee said in the audio.\n\n\"I want to convey to the people of Houston that I strongly believe that everyone deserves to be treated with dignity and respect, and that includes my own staff. I know that I am not perfect,\" Lee said in a statement apologizing for being caught verbally abusing her underlings as \"f**k ups\" and \"f**king idiots\" in her ugly diatribe.\n\n\"I recognize that in my zeal to do everything possible to deliver for my constituents, I have in the past fallen short of my own standards and there is no excuse for that. I am passionate about serving my constituents. I want the best for all of them,\" she said.\n\n\"Sheila Jackson Lee was an accomplished legislator, passionate public servant, loving mentor and wonderful friend to so many of us in the Congressional Black Caucus and House Democratic Caucus family,\" Democrat House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries said in a statement. \"I am grateful for her fearless advocacy, fierce determination, formidable service and legacy of leadership. Rep. Jackson Lee will be deeply missed by so many in her district and throughout the nation. Our prayers are with her family and loved ones during this difficult time. May she forever rest in power.\"\n\nWe have no tolerance for comments containing violence, racism, profanity, vulgarity, doxing, or discourteous behavior.

Sheila Jackson Lee, D-Texas, who was a leading voice for racial justice and progressive causes during the three decades she served in the House, died Friday. She was 74.\n\nHer death was announced in a statement from her family. She said in June that she had been diagnosed with pancreatic cancer.\n\n\"By God's grace, I will be back at full strength soon,\" she told constituents.\n\nThe Congressional Black Caucus, in a statement released late Friday, called Jackson Lee \"a titan\" and \"a fierce advocate for social and economic justice, national and homeland security, energy independence, and children and working families.\"\n\nJackson Lee, a former member of the Houston City Council who was elected to Congress in 1994, was an irrepressible presence from the start, relentlessly lobbying senior members for speaking time and almost always getting her way.\n\nTo critics, she would say that she was just serving her constituents.\n\n\"You have an obligation to make sure that their concerns are heard, are answered,'' she said in a 1999 interview with The New York Times. \"I need to make a difference. I don't have wealth to write a check. But maybe I can be a voice arguing consistently for change.\"\n\nDuring her congressional career, Jackson Lee was chair of the Judiciary Subcommittee for Crime, Terrorism, and Homeland Security, and as a senior member of the House Committees on the Judiciary, Homeland Security, and Budget.\n\nWhat turned out to her final political race came last year, when she lost the Houston mayoral election to John Whitmire, a moderate Democrat and former state senator.\n\nJackson Lee entered the race with strong backing from many Democrats and Black voters but struggled to establish a message and expand her base of support.\n\nShe did not set out for a political career. When she and her brother were growing up in the New York City borough of Queens, where their mother worked as a nurse and their father as a hospital orderly, she set her sights on becoming an executive secretary.\n\nBut the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr.'s assassination when she was in high school altered her future. It triggered the creation of scholarships for Black students at New York University, one of which she got. And it filled her with a new fire: If King had died trying to create better opportunities for people like her, shouldn't she reach as high as she could?\n\n\"I am a benefactor of the hills and valleys, the broken bodies and broken hearts, the loss of life of many who have gone on before me,\" Jackson Lee said.\n\nShe transferred to Yale, from which she graduated in 1972, then earned a law degree from the University of Virginia. Marriage led her to Houston, where her husband, Elwyn C. Lee, is a senior administrator at the University of Houston.\n\nShe said that her political ambitions sprang in part from her desire to help women and Black and Hispanic people get a fair shot at success. Her seat in Congress, which once belonged to Barbara Jordan, came after four years on Houston's City Council.\n\nBy last year's race for mayor, many Houstonians were familiar with Jackson Lee, and she won endorsements from prominent Democrats, including Hillary Clinton, who came to Houston to rally for the candidate, and local leaders, like the outgoing mayor, Sylvester Turner, and the county judge, Lina Hidalgo. Jackson Lee polled far better with Democrats than Whitmire before the vote.\n\nJackson Lee is survived by her husband and their two children, Jason and Erica.", "source": {"uri": "nytimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New York Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheila_Jackson_Lee", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sheila Jackson Lee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressivism", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Progressivism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jackson,_Mississippi", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jackson, Mississippi"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Jackson, Mississippi"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Houston_City_Council", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Houston City Council"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_House_Committee_on_the_Judiciary", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States House Committee on the Judiciary"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congressional_Black_Caucus", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Congressional Black Caucus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homeland_security", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Homeland security"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Revolution", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "American Revolution"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pancreatic_cancer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pancreatic cancer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lobbying", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lobbying"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Homeland_Security", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of Homeland Security"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boroughs_of_New_York_City", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Boroughs of New York City"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Democrats", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "New Democrats"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California_State_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "California State Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_York_Times", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The New York Times"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queens", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Queens"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Queens"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Houston", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Houston"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Houston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lina_Hidalgo", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lina Hidalgo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Luther_King_Jr.", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Martin Luther King Jr."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Whitmire", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "John Whitmire"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sylvester_Turner", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sylvester Turner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hillary_Clinton", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hillary Clinton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassination_of_John_F._Kennedy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Assassination of John F.

Sheila Jackson Lee, a US representative who was largely known for her ridiculous comments about history, died after a short battle with cancer following taking the Operation Warp Speed CONvid shot.

She was 74.\n\nJackson Lee began her congressional career as an underdog, defeating four-term U.S. Rep. Craig Washington in the 1994 Democratic primary, before establishing herself as a fixture in Congress and Houston with ties to the highest reaches of the Democratic Party.\n\nJackson Lee was a progressive fixture on Capitol Hill for decades. She was an early opponent of the Iraq War and advocate for gay rights. In 2021, Jackson Lee was arrested for engaging in civil disobedience over a federal voting rights bill. By the time of her death, she was a senior member of the House Judiciary, Homeland Security and Budget committees. She never shied from speaking on the House floor or before the cameras on causes she cared about.\n\nJackson Lee's main problem, like most politicians, is that she tried to advance things that were unconstitutional and failed to support bringing justice when it applied to members of her own party.\n\nHowever, just remember that she took the shot, and like so many who were deceived into taking it, she's now dead.

She will be deeply missed by all who knew her.\"\n\nIn 2019, she resigned as chairwoman of the nonprofit Congressional Black Caucus Foundation and stepped down from a House Judiciary subcommittee chairmanship after a lawsuit that alleged she fired a staffer who reported sexual assault by a supervisor at the foundation. A lawsuit was dismissed by a federal judge in February 2020.\n\nThe makeup of the U.S. House is 220 Republicans and 212 Democrats, with three vacancies.\n\nJackson Lee was born on January 12, 1950, in Queens, New York. She earned a Bachelor of Arts degree from Yale University in 1972 and a Juris Doctor from the University of Virginia School of Law in 1975.\n\nShe married tElwynn Lee in 1973 and had two children.

She was 74.\n\nHer death was announced in a statement from her family. She said in June that she had been diagnosed with pancreatic cancer.\n\n\"By God's grace, I will be back at full strength soon,\" she told constituents.\n\nThe Congressional Black Caucus, in a statement released late Friday, called Ms. Jackson Lee \"a titan\" and \"a fierce advocate for social and economic justice, national and homeland security, energy independence, and children and working families.\"\n\nMs. Jackson Lee, a former member of the Houston City Council who was elected to Congress in 1994, was an irrepressible presence from the start, relentlessly lobbying senior members for speaking time and almost always getting her way.\n\nTo critics, she would say that she was just serving her constituents.\n\n\"You have an obligation to make sure that their concerns are heard, are answered,\" she said in a 1999 interview with The New York Times. \"I need to make a difference. I don't have wealth to write a check. But maybe I can be a voice arguing consistently for change.\"\n\nDuring her congressional career, Ms. Jackson Lee was chairwoman of the Judiciary Subcommittee for Crime, Terrorism, and Homeland Security, and as a senior member of the House Committees on the Judiciary, Homeland Security, and Budget.\n\nWhat turned out to her final political race came last year, when she lost the Houston mayoral election to John Whitmire, a moderate Democrat and former state senator.\n\nMs. Jackson Lee entered the race with strong backing from many Democrats and Black voters but struggled to establish a message and expand her base of support.\n\nShe did not set out for a political career. When she and her brother were growing up in Queens, where their mother worked as a nurse and their father as a hospital orderly, she set her sights on becoming an executive secretary.\n\nBut the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.'s assassination when she was in high school altered her future. It triggered the creation of scholarships for Black students at New York University, one of which she got. And it filled her with a new fire: If Dr. King had died trying to create better opportunities for people like her, shouldn't she reach as high as she could?\n\n''I am a benefactor of the hills and valleys, the broken bodies and broken hearts, the loss of life of many who have gone on before me,'' Ms. Jackson Lee said.\n\nShe transferred to Yale, from which she graduated in 1972, then earned a law degree from the University of Virginia. Marriage led her to Houston, where her husband, Elwyn C. Lee, is a senior administrator at the University of Houston.\n\nShe said that her political ambitions sprang in part from her desire to help women and Black and Hispanic people get a fair shot at success. Her seat in Congress, which once belonged to Barbara Jordan, came after four years on Houston's City Council.\n\nBy last year's race for mayor, many Houstonians were familiar with Ms. Jackson Lee, and she won endorsements from prominent Democrats, including Hillary Clinton, who came to Houston to rally for the candidate, and local leaders, like the outgoing mayor, Sylvester Turner, and the county judge, Lina Hidalgo.

Rep. Jackson Lee announced in June that she had pancreatic cancer. She had been treated years earlier for breast cancer.\n\nRep. Jackson Lee, the daughter of a hospital orderly and a night-shift vocational nurse, grew up far from Texas, in the New York City borough of Queens. She received a bachelor's degree from Yale University and a law degree from the University of Virginia before moving with her husband to Texas, where he was from, and where she began her political career as a municipal judge and a member of the Houston City Council.\n\nShe was first elected in 1994 to her Houston-based congressional seat, which was once held by the charismatic African American congresswoman Barbara Jordan. Rep. Jackson Lee quickly established herself as an outspoken advocate for racial and gender equality, voting rights and the revision of the criminal justice system.\n\nShe was a lead sponsor of legislation that in 2021, after decades of lobbying by advocates, recognized as a federal holiday June 19, or Juneteenth, a date that has come to memorialize the end of slavery in the United States.\n\nShe also spearheaded legislation that in 2022 reauthorized the Violence Against Women Act, which was enacted in 1994 but expired in 2019. The original law provided protections for women against domestic violence, sexual assault and stalking. Under Rep. Jackson Lee's leadership, it was expanded, among other ways, to specifically address Native American, transgender and immigrant women.\n\nCritics accused Rep. Jackson Lee of drawing attention to herself, in addition to her causes. She offered dizzying arrays of amendments that had little to no chance of passing and, according to C-SPAN data, was among the members who spent the most time speaking on the House floor, including when the chamber was empty.\n\nAt the annual State of the Union address, she made it her practice to arrive hours in advance to secure an aisle seat from which to be seen on TV interacting with the president as he made his way to and from the podium.\n\nAlso complicating Rep. Jackson's Lee reputation were accounts of her mistreatment of staff members, whom she reportedly required to chauffeur her around Washington, dispatched on personal errands, phoned after midnight and scolded harshly for what she regarded as their shortcomings.\n\nHer office was known for having one of the highest turnover rates on Capitol Hill. In 2023, during an unsuccessful run for mayor of Houston, she expressed regret when a recording emerged of her insulting her campaign staff in a profanity-laced tirade.\n\nRep. Jackson Lee said she attempted to ignore the criticism aimed at her and attributed it, at least in part, to sexism and racism.\n\n\"I have been in the skin of a woman and an African-American, and I understand the injustices we have to live through,\" she told the Texas Tribune in 2017. She added, \"I just take it with a smile because I love the institution\" of Congress.\n\nPoliticians are often labeled, fairly or unfairly, as \"workhorses\" or \"showhorses.\" In many estimations, Rep. Jackson Lee fell squarely in the latter category. Robert Stein, a professor of political science at Rice University in Houston who followed Rep. Jackson Lee's career for decades, said she was a \"showhorse\" -- but not in a negative way.\n\n\"She was a showhorse for the causes she cared about,\" Stein said, also remarking that \"she staked out a career in the Congress that I think suited her and her abilities.\"\n\nIn response to criticism that Rep. Jackson Lee was a publicity-seeking politician who demanded too much of her staff, Stein cited what he described as a double standard for men and women in politics. \"If this was a White male, we would have said he was a great politician,\" he said. \"When she's a Black woman from [Queens] who moves to Houston -- nobody ever gave her a break.\"\n\nAdmirers lauded Rep. Jackson Lee for pushing causes that she believed in even when she was unlikely to see them prevail. Foremost among those causes was the campaign to obtain reparations for African Americans as a means of redressing the enduring consequences of slavery.\n\nIn 2021, Rep. Jackson Lee successfully pushed through the Judiciary Committee H.R. 40, a bill to create a commission on the matter of reparations. That committee vote was as far as the proposal had advanced on Capitol Hill since then-U.S. Rep. John Conyers Jr. (D-Mich.) began advocating reparations more than three decades earlier.\n\n\"We're asking for people to understand the pain, the violence, the brutality, the chattel-ness of what we went through,\" Rep. Jackson Lee said. \"And, of course, we're asking for harmony, reconciliation, reason to come together as Americans.\"\n\nWithin the House, Rep. Jackson Lee served as chief deputy Democratic whip and was a member of the Homeland Security and Budget committees in addition to the Judiciary Committee.\n\nBack in her district, she was known as a consummate politician, always on hand for weddings and funerals.\n\nRep. Jackson Lee took pride in her reputation for showing up, whether at local gatherings or the State of the Union address. It was her job, she said, to represent her constituents as forcefully as she could.\n\nIn 2009, when President Barack Obama made his first address to a joint session of Congress, Rep. Jackson Lee was ready when the transportation secretary, Ray LaHood, appeared in the chamber.\n\n\"As he walked down the aisle, I made the final push for Houston being in the president's budget ... and for Houston being the first city that Secretary LaHood visited, and what were the results? We got in the president's '09 budget ... and he made our city the first city to visit,\" Rep. Jackson Lee told the Texas Tribune. \"I hosted him the entire day.\"\n\nSheila Jackson, one of two children, was born in Queens on Jan. 12, 1950.\n\nHer father had been an artist for Marvel Comics in the 1940s, but he lost his job when White colleagues returned to theirs after serving in World War II, according to the Houston Chronicle. He later worked as a day laborer and as a hospital orderly. Her mother cared for premature babies at a hospital affiliated with the Salvation Army.\n\nRep. Jackson Lee attended New York City public schools as they started to desegregate in the 1950s and '60s. She was bused to predominantly White schools, she recounted, where she overcame discrimination to become involved in student government.\n\nHer junior year, she ran for student council vice president but was elected secretary, a position that she assumed her classmates deemed more appropriate for a female, she told the Chronicle.\n\nShe did not know if she would have the opportunity to attend college until she received a scholarship established at New York University for Black students after the 1968 assassination of the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr.\n\nYears later, reflecting on the tragedy that made it possible to pursue her education, she told the New York Times that she was a beneficiary of the \"hills and valleys, the broken bodies and broken hearts, the loss of life of many who have gone on before me.\"\n\nShe later transferred to Yale, where she studied political science and graduated in 1972, and where she met her future husband, Elwyn Lee, whom she married the next year. She received her law degree from the University of Virginia in 1975.\n\nThe couple resided for three years in Washington, where she worked for the House Select Committee on Assassinations, convened to investigate King's death and the slaying of President John F. Kennedy in 1963.\n\nRep. Jackson Lee and her husband then moved to Houston, where she practiced law and mounted three unsuccessful races for local judgeships. She received an appointment to the municipal bench before winning an at-large seat on the Houston City Council in 1989.\n\nIn 1994, she challenged U.S. Rep. Craig Washington (D), elected in 1989 to fill the seat left vacant when U.S. Rep. Mickey Leland (D) was killed in a plane crash in Ethiopia. Rep. Jackson Lee defeated Washington, 63 percent to 37 percent in the primary, then easily won the general election in her highly Democratic district.\n\nUpon her election to the House, Rep. Jackson Lee was awarded a seat on the Judiciary Committee, which under Republican leadership voted, along party lines, to support the impeachment of President Bill Clinton in 1998. Clinton was accused of lying under oath about his affair with White House intern Monica Lewinsky.\n\nRep. Jackson Lee was one of Clinton's most ardent defenders, remarking that \"I know oppression when I see it\" and denouncing Clinton's impeachment trial in the Senate as \"a sledgehammer to catch a fly.\" He was acquitted in 1999.\n\nIn 2019, Rep. Jackson Lee stepped down as chairman of a Judiciary subcommittee and as chairman of the Congressional Black Caucus Foundation amid accusations that she fired an aide who had also worked for the foundation and who threatened to sue the foundation over an alleged sexual assault by a supervisor.\n\nRep. Jackson Lee denied having retaliated against the woman and was reinstated in 2021 as chairman of the subcommittee on crime, terrorism and homeland security.\n\nIn her 2023 run for Houston mayor, the nation's fourth-largest city, Rep. Jackson Lee had the endorsements of former president Clinton and his wife, Hillary Clinton, but she was soundly defeated in a nonpartisan runoff by a longtime Democratic state senator, John Whitmire, who attracted support from centrist Democrats, Republicans and independents with an emphasis on public safety.\n\nIn the 2024 congressional election, Rep. Jackson Lee defeated a Democratic challenger, former Houston City Council member Amanda Edwards, in the March primary.\n\nA complete list of survivors was not immediately available.\n\nReflecting on the forceful approach she took to work on behalf of her constituents and causes, Rep. Jackson Lee told the Times in 1999 that she needed to \"make a difference.\"\n\n\"I don't have wealth to write a check,\" she said. \"But maybe I can be a voice arguing consistently for change.\"",

She relocated to Houston following her husband's job opportunity there. Before her tenure in Congress, she served on the Houston City Council, making significant contributions to local governance.

While the audio is machine-generated, the article was written by human journalists. For more information on our policies on AI, see our AI policy.\n\nSign up for The Brief, The Texas Tribunes' daily newsletter that keeps readers up to date on the most essential Texas news.\n\nWASHINGTON Sheila Jackson Lee, a Houston Democrat who was one of the longest-serving members of the Texas congressional delegation and a staunch advocate for progressive causes, died Friday after battling pancreatic cancer. She was 74.\n\nJackson Lee began his congressional career as an outsider, defeating four-term U.S. Rep. Craig Washington in the 1994 Democratic primary, before establishing himself as a fixture in Congress and Houston with ties to the highest levels of the Democratic Party.\n\nJackson Lee was a progressive figure on Capitol Hill for decades, leading the way in opposing the Iraq War and championing gay rights. In 2021, Lee was arrested for participating in civil disobedience over a federal voting rights bill. At the time of her death, she was a ranking member of the House Judiciary, Homeland Security, and Budget Committees. She never shied away from speaking out on the House floor or in front of the cameras about causes she cared about.\n\nShe was also well-known in the 18th Congressional District, which includes downtown Houston. She was known for her frequent presence at graduations, funerals and baby showers for constituents.\n\nShe often used her trademark chutzpah to fight for federal funds to be sent to Houston. In 2009, she secured $1 billion for the city's lighting system after cornering then-Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood before then-President Barack Obama's first joint address to Congress. She could always be found in the aisle before the State of the Union address, among the few members to meet directly with the president before he took the podium.\n\n\"Sheila is a true fighting activist, in my opinion,\" U.S. Rep. Frank Pallone, a New Jersey Democrat, said in 2017. \"When she believes in an issue or a person, she fights.\"\n\nBut that persistence has waned this year as her illness has forced her to stay home more and more, missing every vote in June and most of May, according to the House clerk.\n\nJackson Lee was already in great shape just a few months ago. Last year, the veteran congresswoman took a step forward by announcing her candidacy for mayor of Houston.\n\nThe Texas Tribune is committed to transparency and integrity, especially as new technologies flourish.\n\nThat's why we want to hear your thoughts on how we use artificial intelligence in our work.\n\nParticipate in our survey\n\n\"I hope I have been a humble servant to you for 28 years,\" she said at the city's Cathedral Church, where she announced her candidacy. Sheila Jackson Lee wants to come home to be your mayor, for the city of Houston.\n\nThe rumor had been circulating for months, but it eventually fizzled out after a leaked recording last year revealed she had insulted her staff with a series of profanities. Her office had long been known for its high staff turnover. Despite the support of outgoing Mayor Sylvester Turner and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, Lee lost the race to former state Sen. John Whitmire, a fellow Democrat.\n\nLee then faced her first competitive primary in decades, a race against Amanda Edwards, who had been an intern in her office years ago. Lee was able to draw on decades of strong connections within her party, garnering support from the Democratic establishment all the way to President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris. House Democratic leaders and former Presidents Bill Clinton and Barack Obama also endorsed her in the race. She won the primary by more than 22 percentage points.\n\nOriginally from Queens, New York, Jackson Lee graduated from Yale University in 1972, part of one of the university's first graduating classes of women, and from the University of Virginia School of Law in 1975. She moved to Houston after her husband, Elwyn Lee, a Yale alumnus and Houston native, got a job at the University of Houston.\n\nShe served on the Houston City Council before launching her campaign for Congress in 1994. She and Austin Democratic Rep. Lloyd Doggett were the longest-serving Texans in Congress at the time of her death.\n\nOnce in Congress, Lee built strong ties with her party's leaders and across her caucus. She campaigned for her friends in far-flung districts and on Capitol Hill for leadership positions. She played a major role in Pallone's bid to become the top Democrat on the influential Energy and Commerce Committee and advocated for House Speaker Nancy Pelosi to pick up the gavel again in 2018 amid a left-wing revolt against her leadership. Lee also served as one of 10 aides to House Minority Whip Katherine Clark.\n\nHer deep connections come with advantages. She was the first woman to serve on the House Judiciary Subcommittee on Crime and Federal Oversight and chaired the subcommittee in the 117th Congress from 2020 to 2022. She was also selected to speak at the 2016 Democratic National Convention, hailed by Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton's team as a particularly effective spokesperson.\n\nProminent friends and allies paid tribute to her Friday night. \"Through crises and disasters, as well as triumphs, Sheila's relentless and unwavering dedication to those she represented has served as an inspiration and a source of strength throughout my career,\" said Rodney Ellis, a longtime state senator from Houston who is now a Harris County commissioner. \"She demonstrated that dedication every day through her actions, deeds and accomplishments.\"\n\nTurner, the former mayor, praised her as an advocate for Houstonians, saying, \"Her work on the ground in some of the poorest and most under-resourced communities, channeling billions of federal dollars into her district, being at someone's bedside, offering words of comfort to families who have lost loved ones, her appearances at houses of worship and events that showcase our city's global diversity, and her uncanny ability to be everywhere, working every day for those who needed an advocate, made her truly exceptional.\"\n\nJackson Lee took over from trailblazers who held the 18th Congressional District seat before her, including Barbara Jordan, the first black woman from a Southern state to be elected to the U.S. House of Representatives, and Mickey Leland, a former House Majority Whip.\n\nJackson Lee was not immune to criticism, particularly because of her greed for fame and high staff turnover. Washingtonian magazine ranked her among the meanest members of Congress for her treatment of her staff.\n\nJackson Lee expressed remorse after an audio recording leaked last year in which she insulted her staff, saying in a statement at the time that in my zeal to do everything possible to serve my constituents, I have in the past fallen short of my own standards and there is no excuse for that.\n\nBut she also noted that her white, male colleagues often escape criticism for how they treat the staff who followed her throughout her career.\n\n\"I'm a woman of a certain era,\" she told the Tribune in 2017. \"I think I've been the victim of discrimination, sexism, and even racism, frankly, because I'm sure there's a whole series of stories to tell, and I don't seek them out... I don't care. I do the work in this office. I do it quietly and systematically, and I check the boxes of who's being helped and who's in need.\"\n\nBig news: Writer-director Richard Linklater, NPR President and CEO Katherine Maher, U.S. Rep.

She announced in a statement last month that she had been diagnosed with pancreatic cancer and was undergoing treatment.\n\nLee's family said in their statement, which was shared to the congresswoman's account on X, formerly Twitter, that Lee was \"a fierce champion of the people\" and \"was affectionately and simply known as 'Congresswoman' by her constituents in recognition of her near-ubiquitous presence and service to their daily lives for [decades].\"\n\n\"A local, national and international humanitarian, she was acknowledged worldwide for her courageous fights for racial justice, criminal justice, and human rights, with a special emphasis on women and children,\" read the statement from Lee's family.\n\nLee sat as a senior member on three House committees-Judiciary, Homeland Security and Budget-in the 118th U.S. Congress. She was also appointed as the first female ranking member of the Judiciary subcommittee for Crime, Terrorism, and Homeland Security.\n\nLee's Democratic colleague, Texas Representative Adriano Espaillat, was live for an interview with CNN's Abby Phillip when news of Lee's death broke. When asked by Phillip for his \"thoughts\" on the news, Espaillat described Lee as \"a national hero.\"\n\n\"You know, she ran for mayor [of Houston],\" Espaillat recalled. \"I think she was trying to come home. She may have been trying to come home. But she will be forever in our hearts no matter where we are, or at home.\"\n\nTributes quickly poured in from other Texas leaders Friday night. Representative Wesley Hunt, a Republican whose district bordered Lee's from the west, released a statement saying that while he and Lee \"had our political disagreements, there were many moments with her, both public and private, that showed me that bipartisanship and service to country first can still bring members of Congress together.\"\n\n\"In these divided times, Congresswoman Lee and I were able to partner on several legislative initiatives for the city of Houston,\" Hunt added. \"Her steadfast commitment to serving the people of Houston and her tireless work have left an indelible mark on our community and our nation.\"\n\nHarris County Commissioner Rodney Ellis also posted a statement to his X account, writing that Lee was his \"friend, ally, and long-time political partner.\"\n\n\"Through crises and disasters-as well as triumphs-Sheila's ceaseless and unwavering dedication to those she represented served as an inspiration and source of strength to me in my career,\" said Ellis, a Democrat.\n\nTexas Senator Roland Gutierrez said he was \"deeply saddened\" to hear of Lee's passing and shared photos on X of the congresswoman attending a memorial for the victims of the mass shooting at Robb Elementary School in Uvalde, Texas.\n\n\"The congresswoman came to Uvalde just days after the Robb massacre and was a champion for the victims' families, leading the call for a federal hearing on the tragedy,\" Gutierrez wrote along with the photos. \"Thank you, Rep. Lee.\"\n\nTexas Senator Ted Cruz also posted a tribute for Lee to his X account, writing that the congresswoman \"was a tireless advocate for Houston.\"\n\n\"I will always cherish our friendship & the

Craig Washington in the 1994 Democratic primary, before establishing herself as a fixture in Congress and Houston with ties to the highest reaches of the Democratic Party.\n\nJackson Lee was a progressive fixture on Capitol Hill for decades. She was an early opponent of the Iraq War and advocate for gay rights. In 2021, Jackson Lee was arrested for engaging in civil disobedience over a federal voting rights bill. By the time of her death, she was a senior member of the House Judiciary, Homeland Security and Budget committees. She never shied from speaking on the House floor or before the cameras on causes she cared about.\n\nJackson Lee's main problem, like most politicians, is that she tried to advance things that were unconstitutional and failed to support bringing justice when it applied to members of her own party.\n\nHowever, just remember that she took the shot, and like so many who were deceived into taking it, she's now dead.

He saw holes in walls, floors and ceilings, black mold and mildew, leaking sewage pipes and frayed electrical wires.\n\nLee, who retired June 28, worked for six mayors and seven department heads in code enforcement during his 37 1/2 -year career. He helped create the city's ordinance for dilapidated homes and weed abatements.\n\nCommunity Development Manager Allen Stover said Lee \"birthed\" the city's code enforcement division upon his hiring in 1990.\n\nHired by then-Mayor Bill Dukes, Lee started Dec. 27. 1990, at a time when code enforcement was a \"new concept.\" His experience in law enforcement and building construction made him \"a good fit\" for the position, he said.\n\n\"I was hired for a job that did not exist here, or, for that matter, in most places in the country,\" Lee said.\n\nWally Terry was Lee's boss as director of development for about seven years until Terry retired in 2020.\n\n\"The city is losing a lot of institutional knowledge,\" Terry said. \"He's got a little black book that gives him connections throughout the city. David can make one phone call and never leave his desk when I would be running around all over town.\"\n\nTerry said people don't realize how many codified issues the Community Development Department began during Lee's tenure that only Decatur has, in addition to the International Building Code.\n\n\"David has so much care for our community,\" Terry said.\n\nLee said he doesn't know how many houses the city demolished or forced to be torn down during his tenure.\n\nHe estimated he averaged about 10 notices per day. Most notices led to a correction by the homeowner. However, owners often couldn't afford the repairs, refused to comply or didn't respond to a registered letter from the city.\n\n\"When I started, every street corner in Northwest Decatur had a crack dealer with a clenched fist standing on it,\" Lee said.\n\nHe said they tore down houses in almost every neighborhood in the city.\n\n\"They're not all because of age and deterioration,\" Lee said. \"Some were because of fires or storms.\"\n\nThe city budgeted $60,000 in fiscal 2024 for demolitions and, based on an average of 100 per year, budgeted $8,500 for weed abatements.\n\nThe owner must repay the city, or the city places a lien against the property. However, the city often doesn't receive the money for years or there's never a payback.\n\n\"It's amazing now to drive through town and reflect on the changes that this department had to affect,\" Lee said. \"Not just because of the buildings that we caused to be demolished, but because of the positive changes.\"\n\nLee said one of the toughest parts of his job was dealing with the people who were often at the lowest point in their lives.\n\n\"It's not something you ever really want to have to do but it's necessary, for lack of a better term, for the greater good,\" he said. \"We've never torn one down that didn't need to go. We give people every opportunity to do something with their house.\"\n\nHe said he's had to wipe black clouds of fleas off his jeans after leaving a house.\n\nLee said he takes off his clothes in his garage if he's been on an inspection, puts them in a garbage bag and fills the bag with bug spray to make sure he kills the bugs before taking the garments in the house or wearing them again.\n\nLee said his only regret as he goes into retirement is the city never passed rental registration or rental licensing.\n\nThe city has struggled for years with absentee landlords. This creates the most work for Lee and his fellow code enforcement agents because it requires them to go on a private investigator-like search for the homeowner.\n\n\"Requiring people to have local, accessible contact would be a game-changer,\" Lee said.\n\nHe said a lot of the absentee homeowners \"don't want to be found,\" and it seems like \"it's becoming more and more prevalent.\"\n\nLee said the city got close a few times to passing an ordinance, but then something happened to stall the process.\n\nTerry, who worked with Lee and the Planning Commission on the rental issue in 2017, said he shares Lee's regret.\n\n\"It still needs to be done,\" Terry said. \"And (Lee) doesn't have to give up on it. He can now advocate for it as a private citizen.\"\n\nPolice dispatch's NCIC was the only city computer when Lee started his job. This forced him to go across the street daily to the Morgan County Courthouse to do his search for homeowners.\n\n\"About three years in, we were able to get an IBM terminal that was connected to the county system,\" he said. \"They had to bore a hole under the street and run a big cable for it.\"\n\nNow Lee and the city's four code inspectors have become experts in internet property searches.\n\nLee said his best and most successful search was finding a woman who lived in the United Arab Emirates and owned a home in Decatur.\n\nHe said he sent a court notice to UAE, and, through long-distance correspondence, she took care of the Decatur home's issues, signed a rights waiver pleading guilty (allowed at the time by the courts) and paid her fine.\n\nLee said he doesn't ever remember losing a court case.\n\n\"It's not necessarily to my credit,\" he said. \"It's just that if it's not a good case I didn't take it to court.\"\n\nOne of them was the old water tower next to the Gordon Drive overpass.\n\n\"A lot of people didn't want it torn down, but it sprung a leak,\" Lee said.\n\nLee said Stonegate, a crime-ridden housing project off Old Moulton Road, was probably the largest demolition his department conducted during his career.\n\n\"The job was just a lot more involved than many people thought it would be,\" Lee said. \"There was asbestos and lead paint, so we had to do remediation before the demolition could start.\"\n\nBut Lee remains proud of the Stonegate work.\n\n\"People lived there right up to the time we started the demolition,\" Lee said. \"But everybody who lived there wound up in a better place.\"\n\nIn the 1990s, the late Joe Terry owned as many or more rental houses in the city than anyone else. Many were not in good condition, so Joe Terry was often at odds with Lee and the city, and they ended up in court several times.\n\n\"Our unsafe policies and procedures had to undergo a colonoscopy the likes of which I did not even realize was possible,\" Lee said of the Joe Terry court cases.\n\nLee said he will never forget \"orchestrating the demolition\" of 10 Terry-owned houses on a Saturday.\n\nLee said Joe Terry died not long after that day on his attorney's steps. He said he believes Joe Terry \"was on his way to file another suit against us.\"\n\nStover said the efforts of Lee and the rest of their department compare well with their neighbors in Athens, Madison, Huntsville and Hartselle and other cities in the state.\n\n\"Do we have issues? Absolutely,\" Stover said. \"Do have some areas that need some work done? We do. I don't think anybody would say we don't.\n\n\"But I would put our city and the way our city looks against anybody in the state. I think Community Development has been a big part of that, and David deserves part of the credit. The department as a whole has done a magnificent job of keeping it looking like it does,\" he said.\n\nMayor Tab Bowling said he appreciates Lee's contribution to the city's beautification.\n\n\"He tried to keep our city cleaner via code enforcement,\" Bowling said.\n\nStover said Lee joins a long list of experienced employees in the Building, Police and Fire departments who have recently retired or who soon will.\n\n\"We've got folks in Community Development who are capable of replacing David, but we still lose just a wealth of knowledge,\" Stover said.\n\nNow that he is retired, Lee said he has \"years' worth of projects\" around his home. He plans to spend time with his granddaughter, and he will continue restoring a 1972 pickup truck that he bought in high school.", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"},

Three NCAA titles, two Dan Hodge Trophies, a Cadet World title and a pair of Junior World titles had cost him him ACLs and deteriorated his knees to a point where Lee wondered whether he had anything left in the tank.\n\nLee has never been one for excuses. His \"excuses are for wusses\" quote following winning a title with no ACLs in his knees became a tagline for the Hawkeye wrestling program. But even he wondered if it was maybe time to step away.\n\nFollowing that loss in March, Lee finally committed to taking his long-desired trip to Japan as an escape from it all.\n\n\"I just needed to not think about wrestling,\" Lee said during a press conference Thursday.\n\nLee was a longtime admirer of Japanese culture. Not only for its dominant wrestling, but Japanese culture in its entirety. In Japan, he stayed in Tokyo while visiting Kyoto, Osaka and other major towns along the way.\n\n\"I really enjoyed the peacefulness,\" Lee said. \"Just to walk around and have a lot of time to think.\"\n\nWhile he was wanting to avoid wrestling, he still made sure to meet up with an old friend in Takuto Otoguro, an Olympic gold medalist in 2021. The two met and became friends in the 2014 World Championships and stayed in touch throughout their careers.\n\nWhen Lee spoke with Otoguro, Otoguro mentioned how hard it was prepare for another Olympics. Now that he had reached the pinnacle, what comes next was a big question. When Otoguro began training again after some time away, he told Lee he still loved it when they were in Japan, so he would try once again.\n\nWhen Lee returned from his wrestling hiatus, he felt refueled, which is exactly what Iowa coach Tom Brands was hoping for. When Lee floated the idea to him, Brands and the staff \"spurred\" him to take some time to make the heart grow fonder.\n\n\"You're fanning the flames,\" Brands said. \"Making him burn hot inside.\"\n\nLee would then go on to perhaps look the best he has in some time, rolling through Senior Nationals to qualify for the Olympic Trials in December 2023, defeating the United States' best at the Trials and then qualifying the 57-kilogram weight class for the US in Istanbul and going undefeated in that run.\n\nAcross the sea, Lee's friend Otoguro failed to qualify for the Olympics himself, but told Lee he would be seeing him soon, making Lee realize the bigger picture of why it made sense to continue on.\n\n\"He messaged me and told me that he would be on the team in 2028,\" Lee said. \"For me it was like, 'I get it.' Just because you reached that pinnacle, it doesn't mean you're done with your potential.\"\n\nToday's version of Lee is a revival of what Lee was prior to all those knee injuries, before the stunning loss in his senior season. His time away in a country he longed to visit one day helped him realize there was still another level he was capable of reaching if he could find a way.\n\nNow, Lee heads to his mother's home country of Paris. He's been practicing his French with the France wrestling delegation in Colorado to impress his mother and family who all were born and raised in France, all while working on his stellar par terre offense that helped him roll through the qualifying process. In total across Senior Nationals, the Olympic Trials and the Last Chance qualifier, Lee wrestled in 11 matches, outscored his opponents 107-25 with five technical falls and a pin in that time.\n\nUltimately, Brands' prodding of Lee to take some time away paid off big time for all parties, but they are turning toward the next step of this process to try to win gold. A former gold medalist himself in 1996, he's not trying to push Lee to emulate what he did, but rather to exceed what he accomplished in Atlanta 28 years ago.\n\nLee will be looking to Drake Ayala, Pat Lugo and Brandon Sorensen to help as training partners. At this point, current and former Hawkeyes training with the Olympians has become a tradition, like Lee did as a teenager with Daniel Dennis furing his Olympics run in 2016.\n\nFor Ayala, it's a massive opportunity to build upon his successful sophomore campaign when he reached the NCAA finals. Having dealt with injuries of his own the past two seasons, he's getting a shining example of what it will take to reach his pinnacle.\n\n\"He left a little undone as well,\" Brands said. \"This is part of that for him but there's also an unselfish part of that as well. He's the right guy along with Lugo and Sorensen to go with Spencer because of their relationship.\"\n\nNow the \"zero hour\" is upon Lee and the Hawkeye Wrestling Club, a term Brands borrowed from Dan Gable as they prepare to try to get Iowa's sixth gold medal from the Olympics. Brands says he has no need or desire to place pressure on Lee ahead of the Olympics, but Lee's urgency to get out and reach the pinnacle is at an all-time high in his career.\n\n\"You're talking about a guy who's a super high-octane competitor, you're talking about a guy who gets up for the best events that are in front of him and here we are,\" Brands said. \"It's time to perform.\"\n\nEli McKown covers high school sports and wrestling for the Des Moines Register.

In total across senior nationals, the Olympic Trials and the Last Chance qualifier, Lee wrestled in 11 matches, outscored his opponents 107-25 with five technical falls and a pin in that time.\n\nUltimately, Brands' prodding of Lee to take some time away paid off big time for all parties, but they are turning toward the next step of this process to try to win gold. A former gold medalist himself in 1996, he's not trying to push Lee to emulate what he did, but rather to exceed what he accomplished in Atlanta 28 years ago.\n\nTo try and exceed what he did in Paris, along with what prior Hawkeyes have done in Dan Dennis and Thomas Gilman, they'll be looking to Drake Ayala, Pat Lugo and Brandon Sorensen to help as training partners alongside Lee. At this point, current and former Hawkeyes training with the Olympians has become a tradition, like Lee did as a teenager with Dennis furing his Olympic run in 2016.\n\nFor Ayala, it's a massive opportunity to build upon his successful sophomore campaign when he reached the NCAA finals. Having dealt with injuries of his own the past two seasons, he's getting a shining example of what it will take to reach his pinnacle that he can achieve.\n\n\"He left a little undone as well,\" Brands said. \"This is part of that for him but there's also an unselfish part of that as well. He's the right guy along with Lugo and Sorensen to go with Spencer because of their relationship.\"\n\nHowever, now the \"zero hour\" is upon Lee and the Hawkeye Wrestling club, a term Brands borrowed from Dan Gable as they prepare to try and get Iowa's sixth gold medal from the Olympics. Brands says he has no need or desire to place pressure on Lee ahead of the Olympics, but Lee's urgency to get out and reach the pinnalce is at an all-time high in his career.\n\n\"You're talking about a guy who's a super high-octane competitor, you're talking about a guy who gets up for the best events that are in front of him and here we are,\" Brands said. \"It's time to perform.\"\n\nEli McKown covers high school sports and wrestling for the Des Moines Register.

Al Green, D-Texas, Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee, D-Tex., Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., Rep. Joyce Beatty, D-Ohio, Rep. Maxine Waters, D-Calif., Rep. Barbara Lee, D-Calif., and members of the Congressional Black Caucus celebrate the passage of the Juneteenth National Independence Day Act, at the Capitol in Washington, June 17, 2021. Longtime U.S. Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee, who helped lead federal efforts to protect women from domestic violence and recognize Juneteenth as a national holiday, has died Friday, July 19, 2024, after battling pancreatic cancer, according to her chief of staff.\n\nLongtime U.S. Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee of Texas, who helped lead federal efforts to protect women from domestic violence and recognize Juneteenth as a national holiday, has died. She was 74.\n\nLillie Conley, her chief of staff, confirmed that Jackson Lee, who had pancreatic cancer, died in Houston Friday night with her family around her.\n\nThe Democrat had represented her Houston-based district and the nation's fourth-largest city since 1995. She had previously had breast cancer and announced the pancreatic cancer diagnosis on June 2.\n\n\"The road ahead will not be easy, but I stand in faith that God will strengthen me,\" Jackson Lee said in a statement then.\n\nJackson Lee was \"a towering figure in our politics,\" President Joe Biden said in a statement Saturday. \"Always fearless, she spoke truth to power and represented the power of the people of her district in Houston with dignity and grace.\"\n\nBiden said Jackson Lee's spirit was unbreakable.\n\n\"I had the honor of working with her during her nearly 30 years in Congress,\" Biden said. \"No matter the issue -- from delivering racial justice to building an economy for working people -- she was unrelenting in her leadership.\"\n\nBishop James Dixon, a longtime friend in Houston who visited Jackson Lee earlier this week, said he will remember her as a fighter.\n\n\"She was just a rare, rare jewel of a person who relentlessly gave everything she had to make sure others had what they needed. That was Sheila,\" he said.\n\nJackson Lee had just been elected to the Houston district once represented by Barbara Jordan, the first Black woman elected to Congress from a Southern state since Reconstruction, when she was immediately placed on the high-profile House Judiciary Committee in 1995.\n\n\"They just saw me, I guess through my profile, through Barbara Jordan's work,\" Jackson Lee told the Houston Chronicle in 2022. \"I thought it was an honor because they assumed I was going to be the person they needed.\"\n\nJackson Lee quickly established herself as fierce advocate for women and minorities, and a leader for House Democrats on many social justice issues, from policing reform to reparations for descendants of enslaved people. She led the first rewrite of the Violence Against Women Act in nearly a decade, which included protections for Native American, transgender and immigrant women.\n\nJackson Lee was also among the lead lawmakers behind the effort in 2021 to have Juneteenth recognized as the first new federal holiday since Martin Luther King, Jr. Day was established in 1986. The holiday marks the day in 1865 that the last enslaved African Americans in Galveston, Texas, finally learned of their freedom.\n\nA native of Queens, New York, Jackson Lee graduated from Yale and earned her law degree at the University of Virginia. She was a judge in Houston before she was elected to Houston City Council in 1989, then ran for Congress in 1994. She was an advocate for gay rights and an early opponent of the Iraq War in 2003.\n\nTop congressional Democrats reacted quickly to the news Friday night, praising her commitment and work ethic.\n\nRep. James Clyburn of South Carolina called her \"a tenacious advocate for civil rights and a tireless fighter, improving the lives of her constituents.\"\n\nRep. Jamie Raskin of Maryland said he had never known a harder-working lawmaker than Jackson Lee, saying she \"studied every bill and every amendment with exactitude and then told Texas and America exactly where she stood.\"\n\nFormer House Speaker Nancy Pelosi of California cited Jackson Lee's \"relentless determination\" in getting Juneteenth declared a national holiday.\n\n\"As a powerful voice in the Congress for our Constitution and human rights, she fought tirelessly to advance fairness, equity and justice for all,\" Pelosi said.\n\nRepublican Texas Gov. Greg Abbott said he and his wife Cecilia will always remember Jackson Lee, calling her a \"tireless advocate for the people of Houston.\"\n\n\"Her legacy of public service and dedication to Texas will live on,\" he said.\n\nJackson Lee routinely won reelection to Congress with ease. The few times she faced a challenger, she never carried less than two-thirds of the vote. Jackson Lee considered leaving Congress in 2023 in a bid to become Houston's first female Black mayor but was defeated in a runoff. She then easily won the Democratic nomination for the 2024 general election.\n\nDuring the mayoral campaign, Jackson Lee expressed regret and said \"everyone deserves to be treated with dignity and respect\" following the release of an unverified audio recording purported to be of the lawmaker berating staff members.\n\nIn 2019, Jackson Lee stepped down from two leadership positions on the House Judiciary Committee and Congressional Black Caucus Foundation, the fundraising of the Congressional Black Caucus, following a lawsuit from a former employee who said her sexual assault complaint was mishandled.\n\nIn a statement, Jackson Lee's family said she had been a beloved wife, sister, mother and grandmother known as Bebe.\n\n\"She will be dearly missed, but her legacy will continue to inspire all who believe in freedom, justice, and democracy,\" the statement said. \"God bless you Congresswoman and God bless the United States of America.\"\n\nAssociated Press writer Lou Kesten

In June, Jackson Lee announced her diagnosis of pancreatic cancer, yet she showed little indication of letting it interfere with her plans to run for a 16th term this November.\n\nThe fiery congresswoman disclosed her diagnosis in a written statement shortly after winning renomination in a fiercely contested Democratic primary. Known for her unwavering commitment to social justice, she was a fervent advocate for reparations for African Americans and a vocal critic of the twice impeached and 34 times convicted felon and former President Donald Trump. Unlike some of her colleagues, she did not join the calls for President Joe Biden to step aside from the 2024 race.\n\nAs recently as Wednesday, July 19, Jackson Lee continued to champion President Biden's re-election campaign. \"Something that does not get talked about enough: we were able to bring down homicides in Houston with federal investment,\" she wrote on X. \"After President Biden signed the American Rescue Plan, we brought $50 million to the city to take on crime -- and it worked! Local/federal partnership saved lives.\"\n\nShe added, \"This House Democrat believes Joe Biden has served us well and has the best plans for the future. I am laser-focused on beating Donald Trump and delivering for America because that's what matters.\" Jackson Lee also reminded her followers that America saw one of the most significant homicide spikes ever in Trump's last year in office. \"He threw his hands in the air and did not know what to do,\" she asserted. \"Since he left, I am proud that our American Rescue Plan has done the very important work to bring these numbers down! Federal/local partnerships worked.\"\n\nJackson Lee's legislative achievements are significant and wide-ranging. She played a crucial role in the passage of the Violence Against Women Act. She was a senior House Committee member on the Judiciary, Homeland Security, and Budget Committees. She was the first female ranking member of the Judiciary Subcommittee for Crime and Federal Government Surveillance, serving as Chair during the 117th Congress.\n\nAmong her notable legislative efforts were the Sentencing Reform Act, the George Floyd Law Enforcement Trust and Integrity Act, The RAISE Act, The Fair Chance for Youth Act, the Kimberly Vaughan Firearm Safe Storage Act, Kalief's Law, and the American RISING Act. She also introduced the Juvenile Accountability Block Grant Reauthorization and Bullying Prevention and Intervention Act and the Federal Prison Bureau Nonviolent Offender Relief Act.\n\nA staunch supporter of women and children, Jackson Lee championed the Paycheck Fairness Act and the Pregnant Workers Fairness Act. She authored the Triple-Negative Breast Cancer Research and Education Act.\n\nJackson Lee was widely recognized for her effectiveness and influence. Congressional Quarterly named her one of the 50 most effective Members of Congress, and U.S. News and World Report listed her among the ten most influential legislators in the U.S. House of Representatives. She was a founder, member, and chair of the Congressional Pakistan Caucus and the Congressional Children's Caucus. She was chair of the Congressional Black Caucus Energy Braintrust and the Justice Reform Task Force co-chair.\n\nA Yale University alumna, Jackson Lee earned her B.A. in Political Science with honors and later received a J.D. from the University of Virginia Law School. She is survived by her husband, Dr. Elwyn Lee, an administrator at the University of Houston; her two children, Jason Lee, a Harvard University graduate, and Erica Lee, a Duke University graduate and member of the Harris County School Board; and her two grandchildren, twins Ellison Bennett Carter and Roy Lee Carter III.", "source": {"uri": "spokesman-recorder.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Minnesota Spokesman-Recorder"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lee_Jackson_(rugby_league)", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lee Jackson (rugby league)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_impeachment_in_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Federal impeachment in the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Rescue_Plan_Act_of_2021", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "American Rescue Plan Act of 2021"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump_2020_presidential_campaign", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump 2020 presidential campaign"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_Americans", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "African Americans"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheila_Jackson_Lee", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sheila Jackson Lee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Felony", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Felony"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_justice", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Social justice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pancreatic_cancer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pancreatic cancer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homicide", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Homicide"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Violence_Against_Women_Act", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Violence Against Women Act"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_House_Committee_on_the_Judiciary", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States House Committee on the Judiciary"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ranking_member", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ranking member"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Homeland_Security", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of Homeland Security"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Houston", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Houston"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Houston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elwyn_Lee", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Elwyn Lee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pregnant_Workers_Fairness_Act", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pregnant Workers Fairness Act"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/117th_United_States_Congress", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "117th United States Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Floyd", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "George Floyd"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paycheck_Fairness_Act", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Paycheck Fairness Act"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reform_Party_of_the_United_States_of_America", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Reform Party of the United States of America"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congressional_Quarterly", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Congressional Quarterly"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congressional_Black_Caucus", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Congressional Black Caucus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulysses_S._Grant", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ulysses S.

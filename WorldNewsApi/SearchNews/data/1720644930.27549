{"id": 231296182, "title": "Cavaliers News: Former NBA Champion Believes Donovan Mitchell Has 'No Choice' But To Stay", "text": "The Cleveland Cavaliers are expected to have one of the more interesting offseasons around the NBA. They enter the 2024 offseason after a second-round loss to the Boston Celtics and have a ton of roster questions to answer. The team is also in the midst of searching for a new head coach, giving the front office a lot of work to do.However, the most important piece to the puzzle is determining what will happen with star guard Donovan Mitchell. Mitchell is eligible to sign a four-year, $208 million extension with Cleveland this offseason, but there have been rumors that he may elect not to sign. If Mitchell doesn't sign on to stay with Cleveland, the team would have no choice but to trade him to avoid losing him for nothing.Mitchell is under contract with the Cavaliers for next season and then has a player option for 2025-26 that is worth $37 million. The Cavaliers' worst nightmare is that Mitchell would walk away for nothing, so moving him would make sense. There has been some optimism of late that he may stay, especially after the Cavaliers fired former head coach JB Bickerstaff. There were reports that Mitchell wasn't a fan of Bickerstaff, so the team moved on from him to give themselves a better shot at keeping him.Former NBA champion Kendrick Perkins spoke with insider Brandon \"Scoop B\" Robinson and laid out his thoughts on what Mitchell should do this offseason.\"He ain't got no choice. Cleveland made the business decision,\" Perkins said. \"It was either J.B. Bickerstaff or Donovan Mitchell gone. J.B. Bickerstaff is gone. We all knew that Donovan Mitchell wasn't talking to Bickerstaff in the locker room.\"Even if Mitchell does sign the extension, it doesn't mean that he will be in Cleveland long-term. He could always sign for the most amount of money and then ask out later on. We have seen this happen in the NBA before and it is a good way for players to get paid first before heading to their preferred destination.Mitchell is one of the better players in the entire league. If he ultimately is put on the trade block, multiple teams would be lining up to land him. The Cavaliers could get a haul for him on the open market so it could behoove them to move him if he wavers on staying long-term. Cleveland has some massive decisions to make this offseason. It all starts with what Mitchell decides to do for his future.", "summary": "A former NBA champion weighed in on the offseason decision by Cavaliers' Donovan Mitchell.", "url": "https://www.newsweek.com/sports/nba/cavaliers-news-former-nba-champion-believes-donovan-mitchell-has-no-choice-stay-1910055", "image": "https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2406328/donovan-mitchell.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-08 15:08:47", "author": "Matt Levine", "authors": ["Matt Levine"], "language": "en", "catgory": "sports", "source_country": "us", "sentiment": 0.074}

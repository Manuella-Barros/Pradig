men's 5000m athletics event at the 2017 IAAF World Championships at the London Stadium in London on August 12, 2017\n\nBritish athletics legend Mo Farah narrowly failed to complete a fifth successive global double on Saturday when he finished second behind Ethiopian Muktar Edris in a thrilling 5,000 metres world final.\n\nThe 34-year-old, whose winning run in the 5,000m at Olympics and world finals stretched back to 2011, fought desperately to claw back the deficit in the finishing straight but Edris held on to win in 13min 32.79sec.\n\nEdris celebrated by holding his hands up over his head in the 'Mobot' gesture that Farah had invented for his succession of victories.\n\nFarah, a two-time double world champion and two time double Olympic champion, finished in 13:33.22 just failing to repeat his memorable Olympic double on the same track in 2012.\n\nFarah, who had won the 10,000m last Friday to open the championships with a bang, said he couldn't have given it more but added he had proved that it was possible to break up the Ethiopian and Kenya hegemony over the distance races.\n\n\"I gave it my all, 110 percent,\" said Farah.\n\n\"I don't think there was any more I could have done. They (the Ethiopians) run as a team.\n\n\"Never feel like you can't beat the Kenyans and Ethiopians -- anything is possible.\"\n\nFarah -- who immediately went to his family as he has made a habit of doing -- said he had had an extraordinary ride in the past six years.\n\n\"It's been amazing. It's been a long journey but it's been incredible,\" said Farah who was embraced by his fans as he made his way around the stadium on a lap of honour, stopping to sign autographs and pose for 'selfies'.\n\n\"It doesn't quite sink in until you compete here and cross the line -- I had a couple of minutes to myself -- that this is it.\"\n\nAmerican Paul Chelimo added world bronze to his Olympic silver, timing 13.33.30.\n\nEdris said his 'Mobot' gesture was both a symbol of the passing of the champion's baton and a mark of respect for Farah.\n\n\"Mo has many victories but now I have one,\" said the 23-year-old.\n\n\"I am the new champion for Ethiopia. That's why I did the Mobot. I am the next champion.\n\n\"I have won the gold in front of his home crowd. I didn't have much support but we did it. I did the Mobot out of respect as well for him.\"\n\nFarah and his team-mate Andrew Butchart had tried to break up the field with 600 metres to go in a race that had been run at generally a very slow pace.\n\nHowever, Edris and team-mate Yomif Kejelcha seized the initiative as the bell went and Farah struggled to go with them.\n\nHe fell several metres behind them going down the back straight.\n\nEdris led round the final bend with Farah under pressure from Kenyan-born Chelimo as they hit the straight.\n\nEdris gritted his teeth and set sail for home with Farah moving down the inside to try and engineer a remarkable final burst but the gas just wasn't there.\n\n\"I thought it might be possible, but my legs had had it,\" said Farah.\n\n\"I got boxed in early on (in the final charge) -- it doesn't normally happen -- and couldn't get out.\"", "time": "20:45:00"}

AFP\n\nEdris celebrated by holding his hands up over his head in the 'Mobot' gesture that Farah had invented for his succession of victories.\n\nFarah, a two-time double world champion and two-time double Olympic champion, finished in 13:33.22 just failing to repeat his memorable Olympic double on the same track in 2012.\n\nFarah, who had won the 10,000m last Friday to open the championships with a bang, said he couldn't have given it more but added he had proved that it was possible to break up the Ethiopian and Kenya hegemony over the distance races.\n\n\"I gave it my all, 110 percent,\" said Farah.\n\n\"I don't think there was any more I could have done. They (the Ethiopians) run as a team.\n\n\"Never feel like you can't beat the Kenyans and Ethiopians -- anything is possible.\"\n\nFarah -- who immediately went to his family as he has made a habit of doing -- said he had had an extraordinary ride in the past six years.\n\n\"It's been amazing. It's been a long journey but it's been incredible,\" said Farah who was embraced by his fans as he made his way around the stadium on a lap of honour, stopping to sign autographs and pose for 'selfies'.\n\n\"It doesn't quite sink in until you compete here and cross the line -- I had a couple of minutes to myself -- that this is it.\"\n\nAmerican Paul Chelimo added world bronze to his Olympic silver, timing 13.33.30.\n\nEdris said his 'Mobot' gesture was both a symbol of the passing of the champion's baton and a mark of respect for Farah.\n\n\"Mo has many victories but now I have one,\" said the 23-year-old.\n\n\"I am the new champion for Ethiopia. That's why I did the Mobot. I am the next champion.\n\n\"I have won the gold in front of his home crowd. I didn't have much support but we did it. I did the Mobot out of respect as well for him.\"\n\nFarah and his team-mate Andrew Butchart had tried to break up the field with 600 metres to go in a race that had been run at generally a very slow pace.\n\nHowever, Edris and team-mate Yomif Kejelcha seized the initiative as the bell went and Farah struggled to go with them.\n\nHe fell several metres behind them going down the back straight.\n\nEdris led round the final bend with Farah under pressure from Kenyan-born Chelimo as they hit the straight.\n\nEdris gritted his teeth and set sail for home with Farah moving down the inside to try and engineer a remarkable final burst but the gas just wasn't there.\n\n\"I thought it might be possible, but my legs had had it,\" said Farah.\n\n\"I got boxed in early on (in the final charge) -- it doesn't normally happen -- and couldn't get out.\"\n\nPublished Date: Aug 13, 2017 04:04 am | Updated Date: Aug 13, 2017 04:04 am\n\nTags :#000m race#10#5#Andrew butchart#Iaaf world athletics championships 2017#Mo farah#Mobot#Muktar edris#Paul chelimo#Yomif kejelcha", "time": "22:55:00"}

What a way to end my career in London. It's special.\"\n\nFarah has seven medals at the World Championships, six gold and one silver, won between 2011 in Daegu and 2017 in London.\n\nThe 34-year-old is determined to end his track career with a gold medal after watching Usain Bolt take bronze in his final individual race.\n\n\"You've seen it with Usain Bolt, it happens. It would have been nice to see him win but it didn't happen and no-one is going to give it to you - no matter who you are, even Usain Bolt,\" said Farah.\n\n\"I just have to now focus on myself and get ready.

I just have to recover now and get in the zone and switch off, turn off the lights,\" he said.\n\nWhat are the odds of a Farah victory?\n\nVery slim.

"So they caught him in the end, Mo Farah losing his last race on the track inside a packed London Olympic Stadium, beaten into second place after a savagely competitive 5,000 metres final.\n\nThat Farah gave it his all is undeniable: likewise that Muktar Edris of Ethiopia was the better runner on the night, getting in front of Farah on the last lap and simply never surrendering.\n\nIndeed, Farah was only fourth coming into the homestretch and chased down Edris fast with the line approaching; just not fast enough, Edris winning in 13:32.79, slow by championship standards but in tactical execution perfectly impressive.\n\nFarah was less than a second back in 13:33.22, the Kenyan-born America Paul Chelimo winning bronze in 13:33.30. Clearly spent by his effort, Farah fell to the track, buried his head in his hands, hardly believing himself he'd been beaten in a championship race on the track for the first time in six years.\n\n\"Tactically, they worked as a team,\" said Farah. \"With the Kenyan and Ethiopians anything is possible.\n\n\"It's been amazing. It's been a long journey but it's been incredible,\" Farah added. \"It doesn't quite sink in until you compete here and cross the line - I had a couple of minutes to myself - that this is it.\n\n\"To be honest with you it takes so much out of me. It's not an excuse, but it took a lot more out of me than I realised. Tactically, I was trying to cover every move. They had the game plan: one of them was going to sacrifice themselves. That's what they did tonight, and the better man won on the day. I gave it all, I didn't have a single bit left at the end.\"\n\nEdris is certainly no slouch - the fastest in the world this year with his 12:55.23. And so he denied Farah a fifth consecutive distance running double, ending his hopes of adding a second gold in London to go with the 10,000m he won eight days ago: Farah, with six gold medals, is still the single most decorated athlete in British athletics history.\n\nBut no other athlete - not Haile Gebrselassie, not Kenenisa Bekele - has won four gold medals in the 5,000m at the World Championships; nor indeed a fourth medal of any colour. Perhaps this was a step too far into greatness, even for an athlete like Farah.\n\nAs a race it started fast, slowed to the proverbial crawl: Farah first hit the front with seven and a half laps to run, unusual for him, determined to dictate the pace than follow it.\n\nThen came surge after counter surge, Farah riding on the back of each one. Five laps to go, Chelimo went again, then the Australian Patrick Tiernan, briefly opening a 10 metre gap, the tension rising all the time.\n\nInto the last 800m however and they ate Tiernan up, though the truth is Farah never looked entirely comfortable: they hit the bell in 12:40.17, and Farah was chasing all the way down the backstretch, unable to get himself in front when he either wanted to or needed to.\n\nIn a strange way, however, this defeat might well offer some brief respite from the shadow of doping and some of the hard questions that have come with his previously unbreakable displays of championship distance running.\n\nNow aged 34, old though certainly not ancient, Farah had only lost one of his 23 races at 5,000m since moving to Alberto Salazar, still under investigation by the US Anti-Doping Agency into his methods of training at the Nike Oregon Project.\n\nHe hadn't lost a major championship race on the track since the 2011 World Championships in Daegu, South Korea, winning silver in the 10,000m, then came back to win the 5,000m later in the week, before successfully doubling in the 2013 World Championships in Moscow, and again two years ago in Beijing.\n\nOnly tonight he did lose, something about the way he fell to the track afterwards making him look quite human after all. Last Friday night, he produced another bold if not ballsy display in the 10,000m, riding each wave of surge and counter surge with utter fearlessness: he very nearly fell over himself too with 300m to run - yet held his nerve and ultimately devastating kick to win in 26:49.53, the fastest time in the world this year.\n\nThat effort may well have taken more out of him that Farah himself had realised.\n\nEarlier, Sally Pearson produced one of the great comebacks in World Championship history, winning the 100m hurdles five years after the Australian women won Olympic title on this track, and after two years of crippling injuries which threatened her career.\n\nPearson delivered the perfect championship performance too, her 12.59 seconds run from the front and enough to hold off the American Dawn Harper Nelson, with Germany's Pamela Dutkiewicz beating world record holder Kendra Harrison for the bronze.\n\n\"That was bloody hard, it's so incredible, crazy,\" said Pearson, who missed the 2015 World Championships and feared she might have to have her lower arm amputated after she broke it in a traumatic fall at the Rome\n\nFor Farah, there will be no comeback on the track, as he now moves up the marathon looking to extend his gold medal haul. That he finishes with silver on the track clearly wasn't the farewell he had planned.", "time": "21:15:00"}

I did the Mobot out of respect as well for him.\"\n\nFarah and his team-mate Andrew Butchart had tried to break up the field with 600 metres to go in a race that had been run at generally a very slow pace.\n\nHowever, Edris and team-mate Yomif Kejelcha seized the initiative as the bell went and Farah struggled to go with them.\n\nHe fell several metres behind them going down the back straight.\n\nEdris led round the final bend with Farah under pressure from Kenyan-born Chelimo as they hit the straight.\n\nEdris gritted his teeth and set sail for home with Farah moving down the inside to try and engineer a remarkable final burst but the gas just wasn't there.\n\n\"I thought it might be possible, but my legs had had it,\" said Farah.\n\n\"I got boxed in early on (in the final charge) -- it doesn't normally happen -- and couldn't get out.\"", "time": "21:10:00"}

gold medal haul By Mark Crellin\n\nLast Updated: 13/08/17 12:03am\n\nSir Mo Farah missed out on another double gold as the British distance great was beaten into second in the 5,000m at the World Championships.\n\nThe four-time Olympic champion ran a valiant race in his final appearance on the track at a major championship but could not quite catch Ethiopia's Muktar Edris.\n\nFarah, who is planning to turn his attention to road racing, completed the 10,000m/5,000m double at the 2012 and 2016 Olympics, and the 2013 and 2015 worlds.\n\nHe claimed the 10,000m title once again last Friday, only to suffer his first loss in a final for 2,176 days on Saturday night in front of another huge London Stadium crowd.\n\nFarah normally takes charge on the final lap but this time, following a tactical affair, he found himself playing catch-up over the final 400m as Edris and his fellow Ethopian Yomif Kejelcha led the way.\n\nIt looked at one point as if Farah may not even make the podium but he bravely challenged up the inside in the straight and managed to overhaul two of his rivals.\n\nBut Edris kept going strongly and triumphed in 13mins 32.79secs, with Farah second in 13:33:22 and Paul Chelimo of the United States third.\n\nAn emotional Farah collapsed on the track after the race but recovered and accepted his defeat in magnanimous fashion.\n\n\"I thought it might be possible (to win), but my legs had had it,\" he said.\n\n\"I got boxed in early on - it doesn't normally happen - but I got boxed in early and couldn't get out.\n\n\"It's been amazing. It's been a long journey but it's been incredible.\n\n\"To be honest with you, it takes so much out of me. It's not an excuse, but it took a lot more out of me than I realised.\n\n\"Tactically, I was trying to cover every move.\n\n\"They had the game plan, one of them was going to sacrifice themselves. That's what they did tonight, and the better man won on the day.\n\n\"I gave it all, I didn't have a single bit left at the end.\"\n\nFarah is due to retire from the track at the end of the month, after the Diamond League final in Zurich, to focus on the marathon.\n\nHis British team-mate Andrew Butchart finished eighth in 13mins 38.73secs.", "time": "18:34:00"}

Mo Farah's aura of invincibility after six years of unrelenting success was finally cracked in his very last major track race on Saturday as he lost his world 5,000 metres title to Ethiopia's Muktar Edris.\n\nSeeking a fitting end to his matchless long-distance racing career before moving to marathon running, the 34-year-old Briton's bid for a fifth straight global 10,000/5,000m double was scuppered as he had to settle for the silver.\n\nYet even in defeat, Farah demonstrated his champion's spirit as he fought back in the dying metres when it looked as if he would be shut out of the medals completely.\n\nIn a thrilling finale featuring four athletes careering towards the line, Farah snatched back second place behind Edris, who clocked 13 minutes 32.79 seconds after a searing final lap of 52.6 seconds.\n\nREAD: Bolt takes a tumble and can't complete final race at worlds\n\n\"I gave it all but I had nothing left at the end,\" a crestfallen and emotional Farah said.\n\n\"It's been a long journey but it's been incredible. It doesn't quite sink in until you compete here and cross the line - I had a couple of minutes to myself - that this is it.\n\n\"To be honest with you it takes so much out of me. It's not an excuse, but it took a lot more out of me than I realised.\"\n\nIt was a glorious win for 23-year-old Ethiopian Edris, the fastest man in the world this year, who had lost all his five previous meetings with Farah.\n\nYet just like Usain Bolt in the 100 metres the previous weekend, it did look a race too far for the weary Briton.\n\nTo rub in his victory after years of the Ethiopians being tormented by Farah's brilliance, Edris even gave an impression of his rival's famed \"Mobot\" celebration as he crossed the line.\n\n\"I was highly prepared for this race and I knew I was going to beat Mo Farah,\" Edris said.\n\n\"After the 10km he was maybe tired so he did not have enough for the last kick. I was stronger.\n\n\"I didn't have much support but we did it. I did the Mobot out of respect as well for him.\"\n\nBehind Edris, Farah dug deep to battle back from fourth to second when space opened up on the inside over the last few metres to take silver in 13:33.22.\n\nLATE BURST\n\nKenyan-born American Paul Chelimo claimed bronze in 13:33.30 while Farah's late burst also consigned another Ethiopian Yomif Kejelcha to fourth place in 13:33.51.\n\nIt was a poignant sight after so many Farah celebrations down the years to see him lying on his back, exhausted and forlorn with his arm draped across his face, but his rivals were not about to let the moment pass without celebrating him.\n\nEdris hauled Farah to his feet as his other rivals all wanted to give him a hug of consolation.\n\nIt was the great man's first defeat in a major championship race since the 2011 world 10,000 metres final when he also won silver - and, once again, it took dazzling speed to beat him over the last lap.\n\nFor once, Farah had been found wanting tactically in the denouement, failing to cover Kejelcha and Edris as they opened up a three-metre lead down the back straight.\n\nStretching out desperately to hold on but maybe feeling the exertions of his 10,000 metres title win eight days earlier when he was spiked and suffered a knee injury, Farah was also overtaken by Chelimo.\n\nDown the home straight all looked lost for Farah as he appeared blocked in until Kejelcha drifted out from the inside lane trying to block Chelimo, which allowed the Briton the chance to battle through on the inside.\n\n\"Tactically, I was trying to cover every move,\" said Farah, after being consoled by his wife and four children at trackside.\n\n\"They had the game plan: one of them was going to sacrifice themselves. That's what they did tonight, and the better man won on the day.\n\n\"My legs had it on the home straight.

Mo Farah's aura of invincibility after six years of unrelenting success was finally cracked in his very last major track race on Saturday as he lost his world 5,000 metres title to Ethiopia's Muktar Edris.\n\nSeeking a fitting end to his matchless long-distance racing career before moving to marathon running, the 34-year-old Briton's bid for a fifth straight global 10,000/5,000m double was scuppered as he had to settle for the silver.\n\nYet even in defeat, Farah demonstrated his champion's spirit as he fought back in the dying metres when it looked as if he would be shut out of the medals completely.\n\nIn a thrilling finale featuring four athletes careering towards the line, Farah snatched back second place behind Edris, who clocked 13 minutes 32.79 seconds after a searing final lap of 52.6 seconds.\n\n\"I gave it all but I had nothing left at the end,\" a crestfallen and emotional Farah said.\n\n\"It's been a long journey but it's been incredible.

10,000m gold for the third consecutive World Championships\n\nSir Mo Farah vowed he will be ready for the 5,000 metres final despite admitting he is feeling the pain.\n\nThe 34-year-old finished second in his heat on Wednesday in 13 minutes 30.18 seconds and is now eyeing Saturday's final.\n\nFarah has already won the 10,000m, securing Great Britain's only medal of the World Championships so far.\n\nFarah shrugged off a knee injury and a cut leg, having been spiked in his 10,000m triumph, and will be fit to race again ahead of his planned track retirement later this month.\n\n\"I'm going to do it. You'll see me at the start line. I just have to recover,\" he said.\n\n\"I'm cold, it was miserable out there but it's job done. I had to get back into some kind of running again.

The knee's alright, the body is a bit tired - that's all.\n\nSir Mo Farah on his 'toughest' race after world 10,000m gold\n\n\"The doctors and the team have been great for me. In fact I went home to stay in Teddington, that's where my family are, and I was like, 'Nah, I need to get back in the hotel'.

Phillip, APUsain Bolt can't believe it after tumbling to the track. Photo: Tim Ireland, APMo Farah is applauded as he leaves the track with his son. Photo: David J. Phillip, AP\n\nLONDON - Usain Bolt's final appearance on the track ended in agony on Saturday as he pulled up injured running the final leg of the World Championships 4x100 metres relay as Britain beat the United States for a shock gold medal.\n\nBolt, who had to settle for bronze in the individual 100 metres, had been hoping to sign off from the sport by leading Jamaica to a fifth successive relay gold, but they were already struggling in third when he collected the baton.\n\nAs he tried to gain ground, Bolt pulled up and fell to the floor with what looked like a hamstring injury.\n\nThe United States, with individual gold and silver medallists Justin Gatlin and Christian Coleman running the second and fourth legs, had been expected to push the Jamaicans all the way.\n\nInstead, a brilliantly executed race by Chijindu Ujah, Adam Gemili, Danny Talbot and Nethaneel Mitchell-Blake gave Britain gold in 37.47 seconds, the best time in the world this year.\n\nThe US took silver in 37.52 with Japan third in 38.04.\n\nEarlier, Mo Farah's aura of invincibility after six years of unrelenting success was finally cracked in his very last major track race on Saturday as he lost his world 5 000m title to Ethiopia's Muktar Edris.\n\nSeeking a fitting end to his matchless long-distance racing career before moving to marathon running, the 34-year-old Briton's bid for a fifth straight global 10 000m-5 000m double was scuppered as he had to settle for the silver.\n\nYet even in defeat, Farah demonstrated his champion's spirit as he fought back in the dying metres when it looked as if he would be shut out of the medals completely.\n\nIn a thrilling finale featuring four athletes careering towards the line, Farah snatched back second place behind Edris, who clocked 13 minutes 32.79 seconds (13:32.79) after a searing final lap of 52.6 seconds.\n\n\"I gave it all but I had nothing left at the end,\" a crestfallen and emotional Farah said.\n\n\"It's been a long journey, but it's been incredible. It doesn't quite sink in until you compete here and cross the line - I had a couple of minutes to myself - that this is it.\n\n\"To be honest with you, it takes so much out of me. It's not an excuse, but it took a lot more out of me than I realised.\"\n\nIt was a glorious win for 23-year-old Ethiopian Edris, the fastest man in the world this year, who had lost all his five previous meetings with Farah.\n\nYet just like Usain Bolt in the 100 metres the previous weekend, it did look a race too far for the weary Briton.\n\nTo rub in his victory after years of the Ethiopians being tormented by Farah's brilliance, Edris even gave an impression of his rival's famed \"Mobot\" celebration as he crossed the line.\n\n\"I was highly prepared for this race and I knew I was going to beat Mo Farah,\" Edris said. \"After the 10km, he was maybe tired, so he did not have enough for the last kick. I was stronger.\n\n\"I didn't have much support, but we did it. I did the Mobot out of respect as well for him.\"\n\nBehind Edris, Farah dug deep to battle back from fourth to second when space opened up on the inside over the last few metres to take silver in 13:33.22.\n\nKenyan-born American Paul Chelimo claimed bronze in 13:33.30, while Farah's late burst also consigned another Ethiopian, Yomif Kejelcha, to fourth place in 13:33.51.\n\nIt was a poignant sight after so many Farah celebrations down the years to see him lying on his back, exhausted and forlorn with his arm draped across his face, but his rivals were not about to let the moment pass without celebrating him.\n\nEdris hauled Farah to his feet as his other rivals all wanted to give him a hug of consolation.\n\nIt was the great man's first defeat in a major championship race since the 2011 world 10 000m final when he also won silver - and, once again, it took dazzling speed to beat him over the last lap.\n\n\"Tactically, I was trying to cover every move,\" said Farah, after being consoled by his wife and four children at trackside.\n\n\"They had the game plan - one of them was going to sacrifice themselves. That's what they did tonight, and the better man won on the day.\n\n\"My legs had it on the home straight. I got boxed-in early on - it doesn't normally happen - and couldn't get out.\"\n\nReuters", "time": "21:50:00"}

It doesn't quite sink in until you compete here and cross the line - I had a couple of minutes to myself - that this is it.\n\n\"To be honest with you it takes so much out of me. It's not an excuse, but it took a lot more out of me than I realised.\"\n\nIt was a glorious win for 23-year-old Ethiopian Edris, the fastest man in the world this year, who had lost all his five previous meetings with Farah.\n\nYet just like Usain Bolt in the 100 metres the previous weekend, it did look a race too far for the weary Briton.\n\nTo rub in his victory after years of the Ethiopians being tormented by Farah's brilliance, Edris even gave an impression of his rival's famed \"Mobot\" celebration as he crossed the line.\n\n\"I was highly prepared for this race and I knew I was going to beat Mo Farah,\" Edris said.\n\n\"After the 10km he was maybe tired so he did not have enough for the last kick. I was stronger.\n\n\"I didn't have much support but we did it. I did the Mobot out of respect as well for him.\"\n\nBehind Edris, Farah dug deep to battle back from fourth to second when space opened up on the inside over the last few metres to take silver in 13:33.22.\n\nKenyan-born American Paul Chelimo claimed bronze in 13:33.30 while Farah's late burst also consigned another Ethiopian Yomif Kejelcha to fourth place in 13:33.51.\n\nIt was a poignant sight after so many Farah celebrations down the years to see him lying on his back, exhausted and forlorn with his arm draped across his face, but his rivals were not about to let the moment pass without celebrating him.\n\nEdris hauled Farah to his feet as his other rivals all wanted to give him a hug of consolation.\n\nIt was the great man's first defeat in a major championship race since the 2011 world 10 000 metres final when he also won silver - and, once again, it took dazzling speed to beat him over the last lap.

the perfect end for Sir Mo Farah but in some ways the world championship silver medal which he claimed in the men's 5,000m final last night was a fitting end to the major track career of Britain's greatest ever athlete.\n\nNot what he or the expectant capacity London Stadium crowd wanted but a race which illustrated the character of the man as much as any of his long list of golden triumphs.\n\nThe previous Friday's 10,000m epic had clearly taken its toll, that much was clear in Wednesday's 5,000m heat. \"They are coming for me,\" said the 34-year-old then.\n\n\"They\" have been trying for years but, finally, right at the end, they got their man.\n\nAs a compelling 12-and-a-half laps came to the boil it was Farah chasing, not trying to fend off and kick as is so often the case. As the 23-year-old Ethiopian Muktar Edris held his lead and the track began to run out despite the desperate exhortations from the stands, some may have thrown in the towel.\n\nBut Farah remained a fighter and a racer to the end. If it wasn't to be gold then it damn well wasn't going to be anything less than silver. He dug in and just chested out Olympic silver medallist Paul Chelimo on the line.\n\nScotland's Andrew Butchart finished eighth.\n\n\"It's been a long journey but it's been incredible. It didn't really hit home until I crossed the line and I had a couple of minutes to myself and realised this is it,\" said an emotional Farah before he took one last lap of honour around this track, which was the launchpad to his impending legendary status at London 2012.\n\n\"To be honest with you it takes so much out of me. It's not an excuse, but it took a lot more out of me than I realised. Tactically, I was trying to cover every move. They had the game plan: one of them was going to sacrifice themselves. That's what they did tonight, and the better man won on the day. I gave it all, I didn't have a single bit left at the end.\"\n\nIt has been said that the Africans had to work together to beat Farah and, while there was a bit of teamwork from the Ethiopians, it wasn't a major factor in the outcome. Simply, it was a race too far for the man with an astonishing ten major global golds to his name and the younger man Edris prevailed.\n\nIn the end, it was an unlikely break from Australia's Patrick Tiernan, who finished 11th, which stretched things out after it looked like Farah, briefly in tandem with team-mate Butchart, had a lid on things.\n\nJust as Farah had clawed back the Aussie, Edris took the opportunity to go and, despite the valiance you would expect, the Briton just didn't have enough this time.\n\nNew champion Edris performed Farah's famous \"Mobot\" celebration as he crossed the line in triumph.\n\n\"I was highly prepared for this race and I knew I was going to beat Mo Farah,\" said the Ethiopian. \"After the 10km he was maybe tired so he did not have enough for the last kick. I was stronger.\n\n\"Mo has many victories but now I have one. I am the new champion for Ethiopia.\n\n\"That's why I did the Mobot. I am the next champion.\"\n\nFor Butchart it was a slip back from the sixth he achieved at the Rio Olympics but the 25-year-old from Dunblane was philosophical.\n\n\"You end up watching it on the big screen because they are so fast. I was kind of cheering on Mo in my head then I got caught on the line,\" said the Scot.\n\n\"I was spent. I just wasn't there to react for the last part of it. I wanted to place higher but I'm happy enough.\n\n\"I left it hard for myself but I'm on par with these guys - I'm meant to be in these races, so it's not like I'm expected to come last. I'm expected to do well.\"", "time": "21:08:00"}

final in seven years with the feeling of saying goodbye to the athletics track, with the 34-year-old now set to switch his attentions to marathon running.\n\nSaturday's silver medal added to his incredible collection that sees him stand out as Great Britain's most successful athlete, having won four Olympic gold medals and six World Championship golds along with two silvers.\n\nHowever, his

"http://www.espn.com/athletics/story/_/id/20315455", "body": "LONDON STADIUM -- Even Mo Farah could not buck the trend.\n\nThis will be the World Championships that will be remembered for swiping aside fairy-tale endings, throwing any sporting romanticism into the abyss and laughing at those who came in hope of one glorious farewell to athletes who have transcended track and field.\n\nUsain Bolt was the first to taste the bitter pill of defeat, losing the 100-meter final to arch-rival Justin Gatlin in what was supposed to be the swansong for the king of sprinting.\n\nBut then came Mo Farah in the 5,000 metres, back on the track where he made his name, in front of the crowd who adore him, where he won a gold medal on the opening night of these championships and in a discipline he has left his own indelible, remarkable stamp on. Surely he would be the one to be granted a golden farewell, but Muktar Edris of Ethiopia, the fastest man in the world this year over this distance, had other plans. In a thrilling sprint finish, he finished 0.43 seconds ahead of the man who seemed to be unbeatable.\n\nAt the start of the race, Farah was cheered to the rafters, but there was a stony focus in those normally gleeful eyes as he acknowledged the support. It looked to be a typical Farah performance where he ran at his own tempo, ignoring the marauding Patrick Tiernan when the Australian broke away with too far to go, and then went to the front.\n\nHe vied with Yomif Kejelcha until kicking in the final 300 metres, but this time it was not going to end with him left on his own, crossing the line, arms spread wide. Instead it was Edris who got there first, and Farah fell to the ground, curled up and panting heavily, as the cheers still continued to ring around this stadium he knows so well.\n\nIt was a moment where eventually the emotion got to him; carrying the weight of British sport on your shoulders must be exhausting. But as he rose from a position so near to where he collapsed in celebration five years ago, the smile returned, a little more weary than usual.\n\n\"I gave 110%, there was nothing more I could have done,\" Farah said. Those in the stadium were still proud of their hero, recognising what he has done for British sport and the legacy he leaves behind. A montage of his greatest moments played on the stadium's screens as Edris began his lap of honour.\n\nThis 5,000-meter silver medal now sits alongside his world championship golds from Daegu, Moscow and Beijing and his two Olympic triumphs in London and Rio over the distance. And then there are his three 10,000 world titles and two Olympic golds in the longest track event. It has been some ride as he now turns attention to the marathon, but this has been a turbulent, testing week for Farah.\n\nHe is the man at the front of the promotion for the championships, alongside his friend Usain Bolt. But there has been little room for sentiment, glorious goodbyes do not come easy. Bolt's best could only get him bronze in the 100 meters, Farah got kicked around the track en route to his 10,000 gold.\n\nFarah was hurting after that, and then came the 5,000 heats in dismal conditions, under an angry London sky. Afterwards he limped towards the mixed zone, shivering. A towel was hastily put around his torso, and then a hoodie draped over his shoulders. He talked of the cautionary tale from his great friend Bolt. The teeth were chattering; he looked mortal.\n\nAs Bolt also found out, the supposed also-rans have not bought into the romanticism here in London. Last Saturday in the 10,000 they seemed to team up, in a Tour de France manner, to try and rattle Farah; the tactic drew blood, but Farah's focus was unwavering. The last time he had lost in a major race was back in 2011. He learned from it, the 5,000 title followed and then came his spell of long distance dominance, which was eventually broken before he could walk away.\n\nHe has his detractors -- those who will point to his close ties with Alberto Salazar, who is under investigation from the United States Anti-Doping Agency, and how he featured in a leaked Fancy Bears report -- but as you sat in the London Stadium, Farah was hope personified for this audience, each captivated by his every stride, leading to involuntary applause, cheering, jumping while wearing clothing probably bought for the last royal wedding.\n\nBut those golden evenings are now memories. A line has now been drawn under that part of his career, the marathon follows in as competitive a field as the men's category has seen in recent memory. He will have to adjust his running style to cope with the longer distance, but even at the age of 34, you expect it will just be something he manages.\n\nWhile Farah will head on, he leaves a gaping void in British track and field sport. Alongside the now retired Jessica Ennis-Hill and Greg Rutherford, he was the last part of that Super Saturday triumvirate. They offered a hope to British sport, and were as close a thing to a guaranteed big-meet animal they had since double Olympic champion decathlete Daley Thompson. But with Rutherford now struggling from an injury, and Farah and Ennis-Hill now embarking on new challenges, new stars have to take their place.\n\nThe challenge is there for the next generation, but this was still Farah's night. \"Nobody used to think we could beat the Kenyans, the Ethiopians. Anything is possible,\" he said, choking back the emotion. On a warm Saturday evening, the clouds that had sat comfortably over London Stadium all day, parted to leave clear sky as Sir Mo left with a silver, and the hearts of a nation.", "time": "20:47:00"}

He is widely expected to add another Saturday on the track where he made his name back in 2012, when he races for the final time in a track event before focusing on road racing. However, Farah knows full well how tough a task he faces.\n\n\"It ain't easy,\" Farah said. \"We've seen it with Usain Bolt [who finished third in the 100-meter final last Saturday]. It happens. It would have been nice to see him win. I was looking forward to that but it didn't happen.\n\n\"No one's going to give it to you, no matter who you are, even Usain Bolt. He's a human being at the end of the day and I now have to focus on myself and get ready.\"\n\nThere was another cautionary tale for Farah Wednesday as South Africa's track star Wayde van Niekerk squeezed through to the 200 final in the last qualifying spot, just under 24 hours after he won 400 gold having made a concerted effort to preserve his energy by stepping back from chasing the world record. British 200-meter runner Daniel Talbot unwittingly echoed Farah's sentiment about Bolt when he said of Van Niekerk's performance: \"He's only human.\"\n\nFarah had a five-day break between winning the 10,000 and Wednesday's 5,000 heat with much of the focus on putting the British champion back together again after a bruising final last Friday which left him with a bandaged leg.\n\n\"The 10k did take it out of me,\" Farah said. \"I was a little bit beaten up. I'm ok now and glad I've come through tonight.\n\n\"The knee is alright. The body is a bit tired but anything is possible. I have to recover, get in the zone, switch the lights off. The doctors and the team have been great for me, helping me out.\"\n\nFarah will spend the next two days in the team hotel -- he did spend a night with his family in Teddington but returned to the team environment to maintain focus -- and will rest up after a tricky heat that spelled out the task ahead on Saturday.\n\n\"It would mean the world to me [to win],\" Farah said. \"But at the same time I ain't taking anything for granted.\"", "time": "23:22:00"}

Twitter Share this article with Google Plus Share this article with Whatsapp Share this article through email Share this article through sms\n\nMo Farah won silver in the 5,000m final here at the London Stadium on Saturday night to leave the track in disappointment.\n\nEveryone had expected the British distance runner to win gold but he was beaten by Muktar Edris of Ethiopia.\n\nPaul Chelimo of the United States set the early pace with Farah slotting in behind. It was then the turn of Andrew Butchart to head to the front with the two Brits leading the 15 finalists around the track for a lap.\n\nEdris then moved to the front and Seleman Barage had a go but Farah, as he does, was constantly lurking.\n\nPatrick Tiernan of Australia moved out with five laps to go to up the pace but with two laps left he was pulled in.\n\nFarah was there but Edris worked with his compatriots and did enough to hold off to hold off the Briton despite his best efforts.\n\nWorld Athletics Championships: When is Mo Farah running his final race?\n\nThe silver adds to Farah's 10,000m gold medal won here on the opening night of these World Athletics Championships, the only medals won by Great Britain.\n\nAside from Farah these World Championships have been one of near misses. There was Laura Muir fourth in the 1500m, Dina Asher-Smith fourth in the 200m and medal hopes Katarina Johnson-Thompson and Sophie Hitchon leaving empty handed.\n\nThankfully Farah has delivered, albeit not with the double-gold everyone hoped, but where would we be without him? Worryingly, that is now a question that must be asked as the long-distance runner turns his focus to the road.\n\nMo's medals since 2011\n\n2011 World Championships: 5,000m gold, 10,000m silver\n\n2012 Olympics: 5,000m gold, 10,000m gold\n\n2013 World Championships: 5,000m gold, 10,000m gold\n\n2015 World Championships: 5,000m gold, 10,000m gold\n\n2016 Olympics: 5,000m gold, 10,000m gold\n\n2017 World Championships: 5,000m silver, 10,000m gold\n\nHe leaves the track as among the most decorated track athletes of all time, essentially being unbeatable on the track since 2011. In the 5,000m he was untouchable before tonight - winning at the Worlds in 2011, 2013, 2015 and of course at the 2012 and 2016 Olympics.\n\nSpeaking immediately after the race it was obvious that Farah was hugely disappointed but he leaves the track as a true legend.\n\nMORE: Usain Bolt: The numbers, the quotes and the races that made a legend\n\nMORE: Chelsea boss Antonio Conte singles out Alvaro Morata for praise after Burnley defeat", "time": "19:48:00"}

It would have been nice to see him win but it didn't happen and no-one is going to give it to you - no matter who you are, even Usain Bolt.\n\n\"I just have to now focus on myself and get ready.

The 10k did take a lot out of me and I'm a little beaten up but I'm okay, I'm glad I've qualified and will get ready for the final.\"\n\nFarah went home to spend time with his family this week but admitted he could only last a night before he returned to the team hotel.\n\n\"The knee's all right, the body is a bit tired - that's all. I just have to recover now and get in the zone and switch off, turn off the lights,\" he said.\n\n\"The doctors and the team have been great for me.

An honour to watch your last track race #mobot.'\n\nFarah's devastation was palpable as the Stratford stadium was stunned into silence, many of those inside having come to see a final celebration for both he and Bolt.\n\nHe told the BBC: 'The 10,000m took a lot more out of me than I had realised. They had a game plan and that was that one was going to sacrifice themselves, but I gave it my all.\n\n'I didn't have a single thing left to give at the end. I got boxed in and couldn't get out.'\n\nBut this World Athletics Championship has been full of shocks and surprises, and the unpredictable nature of sport only served to underline the extent of his previous achievements.\n\nThe tributes came pouring in for Farah after his farewell race, with Daley Thompson describing him as 'one of the greatest long-distance runners of all time' after the Briton brought his major championship career on the track to a close in London.\n\nAlong the River Thames, Farah was greeted by clear skies as London woke up following an eventful night of athletics\n\nFarah stands in the foreground with Big Ben resplendent in all its glory behind him during the early-morning\n\nBefore clambering above the London Eye, Farah stood next to a wax figure from Madame Tussauds doing his celebration\n\nHis winning run was ended with a silver in the 5,000m London, a fitting setting for his major championship track farewell\n\nFarah was unable to make it the perfect send-off in the World Championships 5,000m final, after the Diamond League final in Zurich later this month, he will focus on the marathon.\n\nDouble Olympic champion Thompson, who won gold in the decathlon at the 1980 and 1984 Games, believes Farah's legacy will live long in the memory for British athletics fans.\n\n'For me, Mo has been a great hero for everybody,' Thompson said on BBC One. 'You can't take anything away from his career, he's been absolutely brilliant.\n\n'It's not the way he would have wanted to go out, but it's not a bad way to go.

championship final where he might actually be better served not by victory but defeat.\n\nNot that Mo Farah will for one second be thinking that way - and yet for all his breathtaking and unbreakable displays of championship distance running, he still can't escape the shadow of doping and some of the hard questions that come with it.\n\nDefeat might well offer some brief respite; victory appears as certain as ever.\n\nAnd should he complete a fifth consecutive distance running double inside the London Olympic Stadium on Saturday night - and there is little to suggest he won't add another 5,000m title to go with the 10,000m he won last Friday - Farah will further extend his status as the single most decorated athlete in British athletics history.\n\nHis enduring popularity within the stadium, and the fact it's his last track race, should certainly reflect that; although outside things are not quite so black and white. Because Farah's popularity outside of that athletic fan base has never reached such adoring heights and is possibly one of the reasons he has yet to win the BBC Sports Personality of the Year.\n\nFarah also finds himself in the slightly uncomfortable position of being Britain's only medal winner of any colour at these World Championships so far, heading into the two final days.\n\nThough largely raised with the British athletics system, Farah was of course born in Somalia, and since 2010 has been living and (mostly) training in the US under American distance running coach Alberto Salazar.\n\nThis is also coming against the backdrop of British Athletics publicly declaring ambitions of winning between six to eight medals at these championships, especially after Britain's so-called legacy of London 2012, where they won 11 medals in track and field.\n\nThat Salazar connection, however, is what continues to open Farah achievements and indeed popularity to question.\n\nUS Anti-Doping Agency continues to investigate Salazar's methods of training at the Nike Oregon Project, which Farah joined towards the end of 2010, just when his form on the global stage appeared to be dipping. It was to be a strictly American project, until towards the end of 2010, Salazar was first approached by Farah.\n\nAnd the numbers are worth repeating: at the start of the 2011 season, just a few months after moving to Oregon, Farah lowered the British 10,000m to 26:46.57, knocking 43 seconds off his pre-Salazar best; Farah promptly followed that with a new British 5,000m record of 12:53.11; and in 2013, he improved his pre-Salazar best over 1,500m by almost six seconds, running another British record of 3:28.81.\n\nThere is also his still not entirely cleared up connection with another man of some disrepute, Jama Aden, the Somalian-born, Ethiopian-based coach who was arrested by Spanish police last summer for possessing an array of performance enhancing drugs.\n\nNow aged 34, old though certainly not ancient, Farah's improvements have unquestionably coincided with his move to Salazar. Farah's decision to avoid all proper media engagements since his 10,000m win last Friday haven't helped either, inviting only a select group of journalists, including Brendan Foster of the BBC, to meet him the following day.\n\nIn 2015 it also emerged he missed two drugs tests, one in 2010 and another in 2011, and Farah has never fully explained those either, beyond claiming he didn't hear the testers ringing his doorbell.\n\nDocuments leaked by the Russian hackers Fancy Bears in July included Farah's name in a list of athletes flagged by the IAAF for suspicious biological passports: \"Likely doping,\" read the notation from a test on Farah dated November 23rd, 2015; a second leaked database, attached to an email dated April 2016, then record Farah's test as \"now flagged as normal\".\n\nYet when the Fancy Bears leaks were put to Farah by members of the British press Farah claimed \"you guys just make something out of nothing\" and that \"I will never fail a drugs test\".\n\nOn the eve of this race, reports also emerged that Kenyan runner Frederick Lemishen Ngoyoni, who last year appeared in a German TV documentary about doping in Kenya, when caught buying EPO, acted as one of Farah's training partners in 2013.\n\nFor now, naturally, he is concentrating on completing his latest distance double - and truth is Farah has only lost one of his 23 races at 5,000m since moving to Salazar (that's when he was sick, at 2013 Pre Classic in Eugene): indeed he hasn't lost a major championship race on the track since the 2011 World Championships in Daegu, South Korea, when he was gunned down in the closing strides of the 10,000m by Ethiopia's Ibrahim Jeilan, after what looked like a slight tactical miscalculation more than anything else.\n\nFarah came back to win the 5,000m later in the week, before successfully doubling in the 2013 World Championships in Moscow, and again two years ago in Beijing.\n\nLast Friday night, he produced another bold if not ballsy display in the 10,000m, allowing each of his rivals to throw whatever they had at him, riding each wave of surge and counter surge with utter fearlessness, until Farah once again hit the finish line first.\n\nHe very nearly fell over himself too with 300m to run - yet held his nerve and ultimately devastating kick to win in 26:49.53, the fastest time in the world this year. Relinquished in the minor places yet again were the best of the rest, Joshua Cheptegei from Uganda winning silver in 26:49.94, Kenya's Paul Tanui third in 26:50. That was his sixth World gold medal, already more than any other British athlete.\n\nFarah goes into Saturday's final only ranked third fastest in the 5,000m, behing Muktar Edris of Ethiopia (12:55.23) and his fellow country man Selemon Barega (12:55.58); Farah's best this season is 13:00.70.\n\nThe third Ethiopan, and World Indoor champion Yomif Kejelcha will also fancy his fancy his chances, as will the American Paul Chelimo, the Olympic silver medallist from Rio.\n\nAll world class athletes, in other words, and yet if Farah once again beats them he won't just be cementing his greatness, but opening himself to yet further scrutiny of it.", "time": "05:58:00"}

"Shares\n\nBritain's Mo Farah pictured after finishing second to take silver in the final of the men's 5000m at the 2017 IAAF World Championships at the London Stadium in London on August 12, 2017 \u00a9 AFP / Kirill KUDRYAVTSEV\n\nLONDON, United Kingdom, Aug 13 - British athletics legend Mo Farah was hailed by the British press on Sunday despite his glorious track career ending with defeat in the 5,000 metres world championships final.\n\nAlthough his silver medal performance was pushed out of the limelight by the drama of the men's 4x100m relay, which saw fellow legend Usain Bolt collapse with cramp on his own swansong as Britain pulled off a remarkable victory, as well as the thrilling opening of the Premier League season, Farah still commanded many column inches.\n\nThe 34-year-old saw his global championship win streak of 10 gold medals dating back to the 5,000m at the 2011 world championships ended as Muktar Edris of Ethiopia held off his desperate charge in the finishing straight.\n\n\"End of the track for Mo\" headlined The Sunday Times, adding that it was a \"shattering defeat in front of an adoring crowd\".\n\nHowever, the paper eulogised about the performance by Farah -- who came to Britain with his mother and two of his brothers from Somalia via a spell with his grandparents in Djibouti aged just eight -- in the stadium where he had memorably achieved his first Olympic double in 2012.\n\n\"If defeat is the making of a true champion, then Mo Farah left the track at the Olympic stadium last night as the greatest champion of all,\" wrote its sports writer.\n\n\"That he failed, beaten finally, for the first time at a major championships since 2011, by Muktar Edris of Ethiopia, stripped nothing from the legend.\"\n\nEthiopia's Muktar Edris runs through the finish line to win ahead of Britain's Mo Farah (R) in second in the final of the men's 5000m at the 2017 IAAF World Championships at the London Stadium in London on August 12, 2017 \u00a9 AFP / Glyn KIRK\n\nThe Sun on Sunday, never one to miss out on an eye-catching pun, perhaps unkindly went with \"Slow Mo\".\n\nHowever, Farah -- who has had a tense relationship with large sections of the British media over the questions raised by his loyalty to controversial United States-based coach Alberto Salazar -- would have been happier with what followed.\n\n\"The 34-year-old is hanging up his spikes to take to the roads in the marathon after a stellar career which has seen him establish himself as one of the all-time greats of the sport,\" purred the Sun correspondent.\n\n\"Yet despite the huge support from the home crowd packed into the London Stadium, Britain's hero was finally knocked off his perch as the king of long-distance running.\"\n\n- 'I was going to take Mo down' -\n\nThe Mail On Sunday headlined their tale of Farah's final bow \"Oh Mo!\"\n\nThey called it a \"disappointing silver\" but pointed to the remarkable career of Britain's most successful ever athlete.\n\nAnd they took aim at America's Kenyan-born bronze medallist Richard Chelimo for making Farah's trademark 'Mobot' gesture and then running his hand across his throat as the 5,000m runners lined up before their race.\n\n\"It is what it is, I just meant that I was going to take Mo down,\" said Chelimo.\n\nThe Observer remarked that those who had come in their thousands with their faces painted with \"Go Mo!\" and banners with \"Run Farah Run\" were to be left disappointed.\n\nIt also commented on how his soon to turn five twin daughters Aisha and Amani had never seen him lose a major final before Saturday.\n\n\"He curled into the foetal position at the finish, beaten in a major final for the first time in six years,\" wrote the correspondent.\n\n\"Silver on this occasion stung like defeat and salt was rubbed into open wounds by his conqueror, Muktar Edris of Ethiopia, performing the iconic Mobot at the finish.\"\n\nShares", "time": "11:19:00"}

glorious track career ending with defeat in the 5,000 metres world championships final.\n\nAlthough his silver medal performance was pushed out of the limelight by the drama of the men's 4x100m relay, which saw fellow legend Usain Bolt collapse with cramp on his own swansong as Britain pulled off a remarkable victory, as well as the thrilling opening of the Premier League season, Farah still commanded many column inches.\n\nThe 34-year-old saw his global championship win streak of 10 gold medals dating back to the 5,000m at the 2011 world championships ended as Muktar Edris of Ethiopia held off his desperate charge in the finishing straight.\n\n\"End of the track for Mo\" headlined The Sunday Times, adding that it was a \"shattering defeat in front of an adoring crowd\".\n\n. #London2017 pic.twitter.com/Gp2VUE45dF\n\n-- Sir Mo Farah (@Mo_Farah) August 13, 2017\n\nHowever, the paper eulogised about the performance by Farah -- who came to Britain with his mother and two of his brothers from Somalia via a spell with his grandparents in Djibouti aged just eight -- in the stadium where he had memorably achieved his first Olympic double in 2012.\n\n\"If defeat is the making of a true champion, then Mo Farah left the track at the Olympic stadium last night as the greatest champion of all,\" wrote its sports writer.\n\n\"That he failed, beaten finally, for the first time at a major championships since 2011, by Muktar Edris of Ethiopia, stripped nothing from the legend.\"\n\nThe Sun on Sunday, never one to miss out on an eye-catching pun, perhaps unkindly went with \"Slow Mo\".\n\nHowever, Farah -- who has had a tense relationship with large sections of the British media over the questions raised by his loyalty to controversial United States-based coach Alberto Salazar -- would have been happier with what followed.\n\n\"The 34-year-old is hanging up his spikes to take to the roads in the marathon after a stellar career which has seen him establish himself as one of the all-time greats of the sport,\" purred the Sun correspondent.\n\n\"Yet despite the huge support from the home crowd packed into the London Stadium, Britain's hero was finally knocked off his perch as the king of long-distance running.\"\n\nThe Mail On Sunday headlined their tale of Farah's final bow \"Oh Mo!\"\n\nThey called it a \"disappointing silver\" but pointed to the remarkable career of Britain's most successful ever athlete.\n\nAnd they took aim at America's Kenyan-born bronze medallist Richard Chelimo for making Farah's trademark 'Mobot' gesture and then running his hand across his throat as the 5,000m runners lined up before their race.\n\n\"It is what it is, I just meant that I was going to take Mo down,\" said Chelimo.\n\nThe Observer remarked that those who had come in their thousands with their faces painted with \"Go Mo!\" and banners with \"Run Farah Run\" were to be left disappointed.\n\nIt also commented on how his soon to turn five twin daughters Aisha and Amani had never seen him lose a major final before Saturday.\n\n\"He curled into the foetal position at the finish, beaten in a major final for the first time in six years,\" wrote the correspondent.\n\n\"Silver on this occasion stung like defeat and salt was rubbed into open wounds by his conqueror, Muktar Edris of Ethiopia, performing the iconic Mobot at the finish.\"\n\nAFP\n\nLike us on Facebook\n\nFollow us on Twitter", "time": "14:21:00"}

It doesn't quite sink in until you compete here and cross the line - I had a couple of minutes to myself - that this is it.\n\n\"To be honest with you it takes so much out of me. It's not an excuse, but it took a lot more out of me than I realized.\"\n\nIt was a glorious win for 23-year-old Ethiopian Edris, the fastest man in the world this year, who had lost all his five previous meetings with Farah.\n\nYet just like Usain Bolt in the 100 meters the previous weekend, it did look a race too far for the weary Briton.\n\nTo rub in his victory after years of the Ethiopians being tormented by Farah's brilliance, Edris even gave an impression of his rival's famed \"Mobot\" celebration as he crossed the line.\n\n\"I was highly prepared for this race and I knew I was going to beat Mo Farah,\" Edris said.\n\n\"After the 10km he was maybe tired so he did not have enough for the last kick. I was stronger.\n\nI didn't have much support but we did it. I did the Mobot out of respect as well for him.\"\n\nBehind Edris, Farah dug deep to battle back from fourth to second when space opened up on the inside over the last few meters to take silver in 13:33.22.", "time": "07:03:00"}

There's a lot more decisions to be made in a shorter race.\n\n'In the 10k you've got 25 laps so you can relax a little bit if you're further back to make that decision and work around.

distrust and suspicion\n\nOne last time, Sir Mo Farah kicked for the line. One last time, he heard the roar of the crowd at the stadium where he played such a big part in making the 2012 Olympics such a magical event. One last time, he tried to leave his rivals in his wake.\n\nBut this has not been a World Championships that respected reputations or indulged dreams. This has been a championships that trod fairy-tale endings into the track. It did it to Usain Bolt a week ago and on Saturday night it did it to Farah as well.\n\nFarah was third at the bell but the crowd still expected his electric kick. It still seemed impossible that after so many triumphs and so many glories that he would be beaten in his last race on the track in a major championships.\n\nBritain's Sir Mo Farah was forced to settle for a silver medal in the 5,000m on Saturday night\n\nThe British athlete was beaten into second by Ethiopia's Muktar Edris at the London Stadium\n\nFarah was trying to win his 11th global gold but was unable to catch Edris on the home straight\n\nBut as the last lap unfolded, something was different. His action was not quite as smooth. It looked as if maybe the exertions of the 10,000m when he won gold in a rough, tough race eight days earlier might be sapping his strength at last.\n\nThe crowd roared and roared and roared down the back straight but it was Muktar Edris and Yomif Kejelcha, the Ethiopian runners, who held the lead. There was one moment, when the trio hurtled round the final bend, when it seemed that Farah might yet conjure one last miracle finish.\n\nBut as he sprinted up the inside, Edris found another gear and accelerated away. It was an astonishing last lap, a breathtaking sight of athletics brilliance, and Farah kept going right to the very end.\n\nEven when he knew the gold that he had so coveted as the perfect goodbye was gone, he forced himself into the silver medal position in his last strides as a track racer and then crashed to the track where he lay in tears until he was pulled to his feet by competitors.\n\nThese World Championships in London have not respected reputations or indulged dreams\n\nUsain Bolt was denied a gold medal in the 100m by American sprinter Justin Gatlin last week\n\nThe stadium rose to him one last time as he jogged on a lap of honour and the big screen played a montage of some of his greatest moments as he prepares for a career in road racing and marathons. Edris paid his own kind of homage by doing the Mobot.\n\nIt is quite a record that Farah leaves behind him and it is worth remembering just how exalted his place is in athletics history. He is the second athlete in modern Olympics history, after Lasse Viren, to defend the 5,000m and 10,000m titles successfully.\n\nHe also completed the 'distance double' at the 2013 and 2015 World Championships and came desperately close to doing it here. He was the second man in history, after Kenenisa Bekele, to win long-distance doubles at successive Olympics and World Championships.\n\nAnd he was the first in history to defend both distance titles in both major global competitions, the 'quadruple-double'. Since he finished second in the 10,000m at the 2011 World Championships, he had an unbroken streak of ten global final wins until on Saturday night.\n\nFarah was given a standing ovation by the London Stadium crowd following the 5,000m\n\nHe is the second athlete to successfully defend the 5,000m and 10,000m Olympic titles\n\nFarah's triumph in the 10,000m last Friday -- the opening night of the competition -- remains Britain's only individual medal at London 2017. He will end his track career in the 5,000m at the Zurich Diamond League on August 24.\n\nTo some, the idea that Farah's legacy should even be a subject of discussion is a source of outrage but others feel a sense of discomfort about the question marks that hang over his career and the fact that he has refused to provide any cogent answers to them.\n\nThe fact remains that his coach, Alberto Salazar, the man who masterminded his transformation from a promising runner to one of the greatest athletes of all time, remains the object of deep distrust and suspicion.\n\nFor almost two years, Salazar has been under investigation by the United States Anti-Doping Agency over allegations concerning his regime at Nike's Oregon Project, the elite American distance-running group he oversees.\n\nThe controversy surrounding Salazar is such that he has not travelled to London for the World Championships so Farah is in the unusual position of being at his last major championships on the track without the guidance of the man who has become his mentor.\n\nThe British athlete's coach Alberto Salazar remains the object of deep distrust and suspicion\n\nSome see the idea that Farah's legacy should be a subject of discussion as a source of outrage\n\nThe allegations against a man Farah has refused to abandon are many and varied and Farah has been caught in the crossfire. His own reputation was also tarnished when it emerged he had missed two random drugs tests in the run up to the London Olympics.\n\nOn one occasion, Farah's excuse was that he did not answer the door to his testers because he could not hear his doorbell. That was met with ridicule but Farah and his advisors have shut down any further discussion about the incident.\n\nIn fact, Farah remained largely off limits to reporters before these championships and even his availability after he won the men's 10,000m eight days ago turned into a farce when reporters who British Athletics worried might ask inconvenient questions were barred from a briefing with him.\n\nThe doubts surrounding Farah are not peculiar to him. Athletics has been so tainted by drugs controversies that no one knows quite what to believe any more. It has become difficult to anoint heroes with certainty. Cynicism and doubt have invaded the sport's magic.\n\nBritish cyclist Bradley Wiggins was enveloped by controversy after the Rio Olympics in 2016\n\n400m king Wayde van Niekerk after which he claimed he wasn't being shown enough respect\n\nThose of us, for instance, who praised Sir Bradley Wiggins to the skies during the Rio Olympics, felt rather more circumspect after the controversies that enveloped him in the months after the Games.\n\nThis month has also seen the release of the brilliant documentary, Icarus, about Russia's state-sponsored doping system, which has underlined how vulnerable athletics still is to cheats and how far behind the testers still are.\n\nAll of this has cast a shadow over these championships. British success, or otherwise, tends to dictate the public mood towards any meeting and even though the crowds have been good, there has been a sense of anti-climax after the rush of golds at the Olympics in Rio.\n\nFor the rest of the world, too, it was an event of strange sights and sounds. Wayde van Niekerk, the man the IAAF desperately wants to become the new Usain Bolt, broke down in tears in an interview because he felt he wasn't being shown enough respect. Given that he had just finished second in the men's 200m and has been shown enough respect to last a lifetime, it was not a particularly promising sign of his ability to shoulder the hopes of the athletics world as Bolt has done for a decade.\n\nThese World Championships will be remembered for drug-cheat Justin Gatlin beating Bolt\n\nBotswana's Isaac Makwala running a 200m race against himself will also be an enduring image\n\nPartly because of that, these championships will not be remembered for Van Niekerk. They will be remembered for Justin Gatlin, a two-time drug cheat, beating Bolt in the men's 100m final, the great Jamaican's final individual race.\n\nThat result was loaded with apocalyptic symbolism and despite the best efforts of some to rehabilitate Gatlin immediately, it felt to many as though the last high-profile bastion of athletics' credibility had been swept away. It seemed rather apt then that another enduring image of these championships should be of the Botswana sprinter, Isaac Makwala, running a 200m race against himself on Wednesday.\n\nMakwala had been barred from running in the men's 400m final against Van Niekerk on Tuesday night after a norovirus outbreak. Makwala insisted he was fit but the authorities would not yield. Van Niekerk duly won the race.\n\nAfter an outcry against the decision, Makwala was then allowed to try to qualify for the semi-finals of the men's 200m but because the heats had already taken place, he had to try to gain the qualifying time by running alone.\n\nMakwala qualified for the semis and finished sixth in the final. Van Niekerk was beaten to silver by Ramil Guliyev, an Azerbaijani who was running for Turkey.", "time": "21:34:00"}

It's been a long journey but it's been incredible,\" said Farah.\n\n\"It doesn't quite sink in until you compete here and cross the line - I had a couple of minutes to myself - that this is it.\n\n\"To be honest with you it takes so much out of me. It's not an excuse, but it took a lot more out of me than I realised. Tactically, I was trying to cover every move.\n\n\"They had the game plan: one of them was going to sacrifice themselves. That's what they did tonight, and the better man won on the day. I gave it my all, I didn't have a single bit left at the end.\"\n\nThe pace for most of the race looked to be reasonably comfortable for Farah, but he was suddenly up against it on the final lap and on entering the home straight, he found himself in fourth place for a brief moment.\n\nAsked whether he thought gold was still possible, he added: \"I thought it might be possible, but my legs had it. I got boxed in early on - it doesn't normally happen - but I got boxed in early and couldn't get out.\"\n\nNew champion Edris celebrated with a 'Mobot' tribute to Farah after dethroning the legend and said: \"I was highly prepared for this race and I knew I was going to beat Mo Farah. After the 10km he was maybe tired so he did not have enough for the last kick. I was stronger.\n\n\"Mo has many victories but now I have one. I am the new champion for Ethiopia. That's why I did the Mobot. I am the next champion.\n\n\"I have won the gold in front of his home crowd. I didn't have much support but we did it. I did the Mobot out of respect as well for him.\"\n\nBronze medalist Paul Chelimo had his own thoughts on the outcome, adding: \"I think the Ethiopians had a plan because I think Kejelcha was out there to push the pace early and try and dampen Mo Farah's kick. Edris was just waiting and waiting to see and sitting by in the last 200m, so in the last 50m I thought 'There is no way I'm coming out without a medal here.'\n\n\"I had to fight and dig deep to get the bronze. To go home with a medal is not bad. I'm happy with performance. There's not much more I can ask for. Mo is leaving, someone else has to take over now. I'm taking over next year - 2019, I am after that gold.\"", "time": "20:56:00"}

career ending with defeat in the 5,000 metres world championships final.\n\nAlthough his silver medal performance was pushed out of the limelight by the drama of the men's 4x100m relay, which saw fellow legend Usain Bolt collapse with cramp on his own swansong as Britain pulled off a remarkable victory, as well as the thrilling opening of the Premier League season, Farah still commanded many column inches.\n\nThe 34-year-old saw his global championship win streak of 10 gold medals dating back to the 5,000m at the 2011 world championships ended as Muktar Edris of Ethiopia held off his desperate charge in the finishing straight.\n\n\"End of the track for Mo\" headlined The Sunday Times, adding that it was a \"shattering defeat in front of an adoring crowd\".\n\nHowever, the paper eulogised about the performance by Farah -- who came to Britain with his mother and two of his brothers from Somalia via a spell with his grandparents in Djibouti aged just eight -- in the stadium where he had memorably achieved his first Olympic double in 2012.\n\n\"If defeat is the making of a true champion, then Mo Farah left the track at the Olympic stadium last night as the greatest champion of all,\" wrote its sports writer.\n\n\"That he failed, beaten finally, for the first time at a major championships since 2011, by Muktar Edris of Ethiopia, stripped nothing from the legend.\"\n\nThe Sun on Sunday, never one to miss out on an eye- catching pun, perhaps unkindly went with \"Slow Mo\".\n\nHowever, Farah -- who has had a tense relationship with large sections of the British media over the questions raised by his loyalty to controversial United States-based coach Alberto Salazar -- would have been happier with what followed.\n\n\"The 34-year-old is hanging up his spikes to take to the roads in the marathon after a stellar career which has seen him establish himself as one of the all-time greats of the sport,\" purred the Sun correspondent.\n\n\"Yet despite the huge support from the home crowd packed into the London Stadium, Britain's hero was finally knocked off his perch as the king of long-distance running.\" - 'I was going to take Mo down' -\n\n=================================\n\nThe Mail On Sunday headlined their tale of Farah's final bow \"Oh Mo!\"\n\nThey called it a \"disappointing silver\" but pointed to the remarkable career of Britain's most successful ever athlete.\n\nAnd they took aim at America's Kenyan-born bronze medallist Richard Chelimo for making Farah's trademark 'Mobot' gesture and then running his hand across his throat as the 5,000m runners lined up before their race.\n\n\"It is what it is, I just meant that I was going to take Mo down,\" said Chelimo.\n\nThe Observer remarked that those who had come in their thousands with their faces painted with \"Go Mo!\" and banners with \"Run Farah Run\" were to be left disappointed.\n\nIt also commented on how his soon to turn five twin daughters Aisha and Amani had never seen him lose a major final before Saturday.\n\n\"He curled into the foetal position at the finish, beaten in a major final for the first time in six years,\" wrote the correspondent.\n\n\"Silver on this occasion stung like defeat and salt was rubbed into open wounds by his conqueror, Muktar Edris of Ethiopia, performing the iconic Mobot at the finish.\"\n\n(This

closing speed was always going to be a threat, the clear winner.\n\n\"I thought it might be possible, but my legs had it,\" Farah said of the closing chase for gold.\n\n\"I got boxed in early on -- it doesn't normally happen -- but I got boxed in early and couldn't get out.\"\n\nEven before then, the race had been taxing, Farah said.\n\n\"It took a lot more out of me than I realized,\" he said. \"Tactically, I was trying to cover every move. They (the Ethiopians) had the game plan: one of them was going to sacrifice themselves.\n\n\"That's what they did tonight, and the better man won on the day. I gave it all, I didn't have a single bit left at the end.\"\n\nA confident Edris said he and the Ethiopians were prepared for Farah this time.\n\n\"I knew I was going to beat Mo Farah,\" the new gold medalist said. \"After the (10,000) he was maybe tired so he did not have enough for the last kick. I was stronger.\"\n\nAfterward Edris did the Mobot, Farah's signature postrace move, to celebrate his win and out of respect for Farah.\n\n\"Mo has many victories but now I have one,\" Edris said. \"I am the new champion for Ethiopia. That's why I did the Mobot. I am the next champion.\"\n\nPortland's Mohammed Ahmed of the Bowerman Track Club was sixth in 13:35.43 for Canada.\n\nIllness prevented Ryan Hill, also of Portland and the Bowerman Track Club, from running the final.\n\nWhile his sickness is not believed to be related to the norovirus outbreak affecting athletes at the championships, doctors advised him not to compete after an examination on Saturday, USA Track & Field said.\n\nThe U.S. women won the 4x100 relay gold in the year's fastest time, 41.82 seconds.\n\nAaliyah Brown, Allyson Felix, Morolake Akinosun and Tori Bowie combined for the women's victory.\n\nUO's Ariana Washington helped set up the win by anchoring the U.S. victory in the morning heats as Bowie rested. Washington will get a gold medal.\n\n\"The aim is gold. we have some great competitors in the back ready to come out here and produce,\" said Washington, her prediction coming true in the final.", "time": "06:47:00"}

Farah says he will take \"nothing for granted\" following Usain Bolt's failure to win the world 100m gold medal as the pair prepare for their final major championship appearances on Saturday.\n\nBriton Farah, 34, will retire from the track this month to concentrate on marathons, while Jamaican legend Bolt's last event will be the 4x100m relay.\n\n\"Those boys are coming for me - they are hungry,\" said Farah, who is aiming to defend his 5,000m title after winning 10,000m gold at the World Championships in London.\n\n\"You could see in the heat, they wanted to prove a point and show me.\"\n\nBolt, the 30-year-old eight-time Olympic champion, finished third in Saturday's 100m final as Justin Gatlin took gold and fellow American Christian Coleman silver.\n\nIt was the first time Bolt had lost a World Championships 100m final he had started, having been disqualified for a false start in Daegu in 2011.\n\nThe 4x100m relay takes place at 21:50 BST on Saturday.\n\nFarah's triumph in the 10,000m last Friday - the opening night of the competition - remains Britain's only medal at London 2017.\n\n\"It would be pretty amazing,\" he said of his bid to win a fourth world 5,000m gold following victories in 2011, 2013 and 2015. The race starts at 20:20 on Saturday.\n\nHe added: \"No-one has ever done it. It would mean the world to me but at the same time I don't take it for granted.\n\n\"You've seen it with Usain Bolt. It would have been nice to see him win but it didn't happen and no-one is going to give it to you, no matter who you are, even Usain Bolt.\"\n\nFarah, a four-time Olympic champion, suffered a knee injury and a cut leg when he was spiked in Saturday's 10,000m final.\n\nHe finished second in Thursday's 5,000m heat in 13 minutes 30.18 seconds, behind Ethiopia's Yomif Kejelcha.\n\n\"The 10k did take a lot out of me and I'm a little beaten up, but I'm OK,\" Farah said.\n\nHe will end his track career in the 5,000m at the Zurich Diamond League on 24 August.", "time": "16:57:00"}

popping up surprises even as Jamaican great Usain Bolt and local hero Mohamed Farah bid farewell to their respective careers amid tears and defeat.\n\nIn the last race of his career, Bolt limped off the track while hosts Britain took the stunning 4x100m victory to the ecstacy of the capacity London Stadium spectators here on Saturday evening, reports Xinhua news agency.\n\nBolt, running the anchor leg, staggered halfway down the straight, dropping the baton before falling facing down. Dreaming of hanging up his running spikes without a defeat in a major championship, the 11-time world champion and eight-time Olympic titlist limped across the finish line.\n\nBolt had only taken a few strides when he appeared to suffer an injury to his left leg and fell to the track in pain. He stayed down for a couple of minutes before standing up and walking to the finish line.\n\nBritain won the gold in 37.47 seconds, the US took silver in 37.52 and Japan was third in 38.04. China, the silver medalist two years ago, finished fourth in 38.34 with second-leg runner Xie Zhenye just coming back from injury.\n\nThe British team of Chijindu Ujah, Adam Gemili, Danny Talbot and Nethaneel Mitchell-Blake broke the European record that had stood since 1999 by 0.26 seconds. That record was established by the British team of Jason Gardener, Darren Campbell, Marlon Devonish and Dwain Chambers as silver medal winners behind the USA at the 1999 IAAF World Championships in Seville, Spain.\n\nBritish anchor runner Nethaneel Michell-Blake dropped to the ground in blissful disbelief as his team beat the American squad consisting of newly crowned 100m world champion Justin Gatlin and runner-up Christian Coleman.\n\nIt brought back memories of the Athens Olympics in 2004, when Mark Lewis-Francis held off Maurice Greene to claim an unlikely Olympic victory over the Americans. The only other global senior championship success for Britain in the men's 4x100m relay was at the 1912 Olympics in Stockholm.\n\nIt was a rollercoaster night for the celebrating home fans when a couple of hours ago their emotion could only be described as disappointed when Farah failed in his quest for a fourth 5,000m world title in his farewell race just like Bolt.\n\nYoung Ethiopian star Muktar Edris has beaten the all-dominating Mohamed Farah of Britain to win the men's 5,000 metre title at the IAAF World Championships here.\n\nEdris, who was crowned world youth champion in 2012, produced a strong charge on the final stretch to register a time of 13 minutes and 32.79 seconds on Saturday evening, Xinhua news agency reported.\n\nThe 23-year-old, who won the first major senior world title of his career, stopped Farah from taking his fourth 5,000m world title.\n\nThe Somali-origin Farah has won Olympic gold in the men's 5,000m twice and has won the men's 10,000m title at this event.\n\nHowever on Saturday night, Farah had to be content with the second place after finishing with a time of 13:33.22. Paul Kipkemoi Chelimo of the US took bronze in 13:33.30. Farah, who was surrounded by Ethiopean runners going into the final stages of the race, produced a desperate final sprint but failed to catch up with the leader.\n\n\"I gave it everything,\" said Farah who initially curled up on the track in defeat and then was pulled up by Edris.\n\nJust like Jamaican great Usain Bolt, Farah finished his career with an unusual feeling of defeat.\n\nThe 34-year-old had won this event in the past three world championships and two Olympic Games, together with three world titles and two Olympic gold medals in 10,000m.\n\nHowever, he remains hero of the country, bagging one gold and one silver in London, which are the only medals the hosts have won by far.\n\nFarah, who had said this would be his last World Championships, will now turn his focus to marathon running.\n\nWhile Farah handed over his long distance crown, the next generation of Ethiopian runners announced their arrival on the world stage.\n\nEdris' fellow Ethiopians 2016 world indoor champion Yomif Kejelcha, 21, and this year's U-18 3,000m winner Selemon Barega were placed fourth and fifth respectively, indicating that the east Africans will continue to be a force to reckon at the international level.\n\nA surprise also took place in the field events as Johannes Vetter of Germany grabbed his first ever medal at a major global competition -- a golden one -- with his first attempt of 89.89 meters to win the men's javelin event even as defending champion Julius Yego and Olympic champion Thomas Rohler failed to deliver.\n\nJakub Vadlejch of Czech Republic finished second in 89.73m ahead of compatriot Petr Frydrych who registered 88.32m.\n\nRohler, from Germany, made a 88.26m throw in his second attempt and finished fourth while defending champion Julius Yego of Kenya was eliminated after the first three rounds.\n\nIn other events, Russia's Maria Lasitskene retained the women's high jump title.\n\nThe 24-year-old, competing as an authorized neutral athlete, cleared 2.03 meters for the gold medal. Ukraine's Yuliia Levchenko took silver in 2.01 and Poland's Kamila Licwinko was third in 1.99.\n\nLasitskene, who missed last year's Rio Olympics because of Russia's suspension, failed at 1.99 twice but regained form thereafter.\n\n\"My two failed attempts at 1.99m woke me up,\" she said.\n\n\"A gold medal here was my main goal for this season but certainly I would like to raise the bar a bit higher. I didn't like any one of my attempts at 2.08m.\"\n\nShe challenged 2.08 three times but failed.\n\n\"It was an unbelievable championships for me. I was focussed from the opening jump until the last attempt. I didn't allow myself to get emotional,\" Levchenko said.\n\n\"At 2.01m it was not my best technical attempt. I thought that such a height would not forgive the mistakes I made.\"\n\nMeanwhile, USA regained the women's 4x100m world crown which they last won at the 2011 World Championships in Daegu as they sailed to victory in 41.82 seconds while hosts Britain gladly bagged a silver in 42.12. Defending champions Jamaica clocked 42.19 for the bronze.\n\nAustralia's Sally Pearson won her second world women's 100 meters hurdles title in six years.\n\nPearson, 30, who won the world title in 2011 and Olympic gold five years ago, clocked 12.59 seconds for the gold. American Dawn Harper Nelson, who won the Olympic gold in Beijing and silver in London behind Pearson, took silver in 12.63 seconds. Germany's Pamela Dutkiewicz finished third in 12.72 seconds.\n\n\"It's been a long journey back from injury but to get this moment and go and celebrate in front of my family is unreal. This is just so incredible to be a world champion again,\" Pearson, also the silver medallist in the Beijing Olympics, said.\n\n\"I love this stadium. I love the people and I'm so happy to have been back here doing the same thing again (winning gold). It's a relief to be world champion.\"\n\nRio Olympic silver medalist Kevin Mayer claimed France's second gold from the men's decathlon with a total of 8,768 points. Germany's Rico Freimuth, bronze winner two years ago in the Beijing worlds, took silver in 8,564 points and his compatriot Kai Kazmirek got the bronze in 8,488.\n\n(This story has not been edited by Business Standard staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)", "time": "11:15:00"}

missing out on a fairytale finale at the World Championships.\n\nThe four-time Olympic champion failed to mount a third defence of his 5,000m title as Ethiopia's Muktar Edris claimed gold in London on Saturday.\n\nFarah, who had already won the 10,000m last week, had not lost a final in 2,176 days.\n\nThe 34-year-old collapsed to the track after the race and covered his face before being hauled to his feet.\n\nHe is due to retire from the track at the end of the month, after the Diamond League final in Zurich, to focus on the marathon, and conceded he was overcome in the London Stadium.\n\nHe said: \"I had tears in my eyes, I've never had that before. It's been an amazing journey. To end it in London, where it all started, I got a bit emotional.\n\n\"I look at my family, what I've done and it gets to you. At the end of the day I'm human and it hasn't all been a smooth ride.\n\n\"If I had it perfect it would have been nice to end in double double but anything is possible. At some point it has to come to an end.\n\n\"I always told myself London is where it started and London was where it was going to stop. I was known as normal Mo and then overnight after London I was 'Mo', I couldn't go anywhere. To finish here is a nice thing.\n\n\"I know myself when I crossed the line there was nothing left of me, nothing. I gave my all. Over the years it has worked and I crossed the line first, but not tonight.\"\n\nFarah won the 10,000m and 5,000m at the 2013 and 2015 World Championships while he also claimed the 5,000m crown in 2011, taking silver in the 10,000m - the last time he was beaten.\n\nHe crossed the line in 13 minutes 33.22 seconds but was defeated after failing to mount a recovery in the last 200m in a frantic sprint finish.\n\nEdris finished in 13mins 32.79secs, with the United States' Paul Chelimo third.\n\nEdris did the 'Mobot' - Farah's trademark celebration - soon after crossing the line but Farah dismissed any suggestions it was a taunt in his own back yard.\n\n\"These guys all respect me and the reason why he did that is they respect me for what I've done for the sport,\" he said.\n\n\"It's no secret to what we do. These guys have seen me year after year and to be able to have that long career and keep coming back.\n\n\"I have to give credit to Edris. The Ethiopians had a game plan and they had to sacrifice one, Yomif Kejelcha, to get a medal so Edris could sit at the back and do as little work as possible and to beat me on the last lap.\"\n\nFarah runs in Birmingham in the Diamond League next Sunday before finishing in Zurich and is now eager to start a new era on the road.\n\nHe said: \"In terms of my chapter of my life I wanted to close here. I've got races in Birmingham and Zurich but it doesn't really matter. In terms of major championships I'm done, that chapter of my life is closed and I want to start a new one and move on to the roads.\n\n\"If you look at the history, it doesn't lie. What I've achieved has been incredible. I know I gave it all, the better man won on the day. It's a matter of staying hungry, motivated and for me to start a new challenge.\n\n\"I've seen a lot of great athletes go to the road and run decent times.\"\n\nBritish team-mate Andrew Butchart finished eighth in 13mins 38.73secs.\n\nMeanwhile, Katarina Johnson-Thompson and Morgan Lake finished fifth and sixth respectively in the women's high jump.\n\nThey both failed to clear 1.97 metres - just one centimetre short of Johnson-Thompson's personal best - having jumped 1.95m and Ashley Bryant came 11th in the decathlon with 8,049 points.\n\nAP", "time": "08:58:00"}

the support in the London Stadium will be deafening. But away from the roars of adoration, his career still invites scrutiny and suspicion\n\nInside the London Stadium they have nothing but love for Mo Farah. On Saturday night Farah will race on the track there for the last time, in the 5,000m final, and whether he wins gold or not, the home fans will cheer every stride he takes. Here - where every roar carries an echo of 2012 - watching Farah run remains a straightforward pleasure, one people will pay a lot of money to experience. It is beyond the stadium walls that everything gets more complicated. Because out there, not everyone is applauding. As Farah winds down his track career, his legacy and reputation have come to look as knotty and complicated as the tangled girders of the Orbit.\n\nIn 2014, the website Letsrun.com ran a \"doping perception poll\". It was designed to show whether their readers perceived athletes to be \"clean\" or \"dirty\". A lot of elite athletes (and their agents) hate Letsrun. It is the place where running junkies go to talk about the sport, and its message boards are filled with anonymous commentators sharing scurrilous accusations and scuttlebutt. They are a cynical lot. But then a lot of athletics fans are, because they have been lied to so many times - by Ben Johnson, Marion Jones, Tim Montgomery and all the other athletes who were caught doping.\n\nFarah was one of the athletes Letsrun asked people to vote on. Of the 5,584 people who did, 56% thought he was \"clean\" and 44% thought he was \"dirty\". Compare that to the polls for the two other great long distance runners of the modern era, Haile Gebrselassie and Kenenisa Bekele. Gebrselassie's split was 73% \"clean\" to 27% \"dirty\" and Bekele's 72% to 28%. Which does not mean Farah is doping, just that a lot of Letsrun's readers think he is. And that is true in Britain too. Letsrun broke the results down by country. Among the 270 British voters, 64% thought Farah was clean, 36% did not.\n\nFarah has never failed a drugs test, a fact he has repeated again and again. The trouble is, a lot of athletes who later admitted to doping used to say that too. Marion Jones passed 160 tests in a row (though she did eventually fail one, in 2006) and used that very argument when she sued Victor Conte for defamation because he said he had seen her take human growth hormone. They settled out of court. The IAAF's anti-doping programme was so flawed for so long that every competitor has been compromised. After Lance Armstrong, a lot of sports fans feel that passing tests is not a defence that passes muster.\n\nThat is not Farah's fault but it is his problem. Because, hard as this is for his many fans to hear, his career invites scrutiny. To understand why, you need to go back a decade, to 2007. That year Farah set a personal best of 13min 7sec. That ranks, now, just within the thousand fastest times ever run. There is no hard rule about when a distance runner reaches his peak but a study of 72 elite 5,000m runners published in 2011 found that the mean average age for the peak performance in that group was 24 years old. Which is the age Farah was when he ran that PB.\n\nAt the world championships in Osaka that year Farah finished sixth in the 5,000m. At the world championships in Berlin in the 2009 he finished seventh. By then he was 26. It is hard for an athlete to make a leap forward at that age but Farah did. In 2010, when he was 27, Farah lowered his PB by 9.6sec and then in 2011, when he was 28, he cut it again by another 4.83sec. He explained the biggest reason for the improvements was that he had spent his winters training in Kenya and Ethiopia. It was also said he had become a lot more disciplined in his training and more dedicated to his career.\n\nBy then Farah had also joined Nike's Oregon Project and started working under Alberto Salazar. \"I believe he can just make that half per cent difference to get close to a medal,\" he explained. Salazar did more than that. He turned Farah from the best distance runner in Britain into the best distance runner in the world. Farah won his first world championship title at Daegu in 2011, in the 5,000m. There was a lot of talk about the biomechanical changes Salazar had made to Farah's technique, especially for his last lap sprints, and the advanced machinery Farah was now using in training: underwater treadmills, cryogenic chambers and the like.\n\nThere was less discussion of Salazar's medical and supplementation programmes. The details of those started to come out only in 2015, when ProPublica and BBC Panorama published a joint investigation in which two whistleblowers accused Salazar of experimenting with doping aids and of giving athletes prescription medicines they did not need. Salazar and the Oregon Project are still under investigation by the Unites States Anti-Doping Agency. An interim report, leaked earlier this year, gave an insight into how Salazar seemed to have been pushing the boundaries of what may be considered ethically permissible.\n\nThen in 2016 another coach Jama Aden was arrested in Spain. Police found the banned performance-enhancing drug EPO in the room of one of his athletes. Farah had worked with Aden when he first started training in Kenya and had also visited his training camp in Spain. Aden was described as an \"unofficial facilitator\", whose only job was to hold a stopwatch while Farah ran laps.\n\n\"He's not a close friend of mine,\" Farah said. But in his autobiography, published in 2014, he had said he and Aden \"had known each other for years\" and there are several photos of the two of them together. The apparent inconsistencies were unsettling.\n\nAs the athletics analyst Ross Tucker argues: \"I've seen people saying that Farah can't escape the association but that his legacy would have been much stronger and healthier were it not for Salazar. However, I don't see how that argument even exists. This is a man who midway through his career was working with one of Great Britain's best coaches, and whose ceiling appeared to be finals of major global championships and European success. Whatever has been achieved to earn the legacy [and by medals, it is the greatest track career ever] is the result of Salazar and the training camps and so forth.\" Tucker, a high performance sports science consultant, is hosting the Inside Lane podcast for Runners World during these championships.\n\nAside from Farah's associations with Salazar and Aden, there are other disturbing details. In 2015 it emerged Farah had missed two drugs tests, one in 2010 and another in 2011, which happened, he explained, because he had not heard the testers ringing his doorbell. Earlier this year Farah's biological passport details were leaked to the press. They showed in 2015 Farah's results had been flagged as \"likely doping\" but that, in April 2016, they had been checked and flagged as \"normal with the last sample\". Farah's spokesperson said that \"any suggestion of misconduct is entirely false and seriously misleading. Mo Farah has been subject to many blood tests during his career and has never failed a single one.\"\n\nIt all adds up to a long list of hard questions. Farah says he is sick of answering them. Which is one reason why he made the curious decision to hire Freuds to help manage his PR. Farah has released a limited range of his blood test results for public scrutiny, he has reiterated he is committed to clean sport and, of course, he has passed every test he has ever taken. Aside from formally separating himself from Salazar, he must wonder what more he can do. Because in the past three years, Farah has come under more scrutiny than any other athlete on the circuit and at the end of it, he is still subject to suspicion. Loud as the sound will be when he runs on Saturday, listen harder, outside the stadium, and it may start to sound just a little thin.", "time": "13:15:00"}

event at the 2017 IAAF World Championships at the London Stadium in London on August 12, 2017. Daniel LEAL-OLIVAS / AFP\n\nMo Farah proved mortal just as Usain Bolt a week ago in his last individual race as the British icon was denied a winning farewell to the track by Ethiopia's Muktar Edris on Saturday in the world championship 5,000-metre race.\n\nThe season-leader Edris proved the strongest on the home stretch as he beat Farah, who was urged on by the British home crowd, but finally fell short as he missed out on a fifth and final big distance double.\n\n\"I gave it everything. It has been an incredible journey,\" said Farah, who was roared on by a home crowd of 56,000 and has six golds and two silvers from the worlds as he moves on to the marathon.\n\nBolt last week had to settle for bronze in his last individual race, the 100m. But he the Jamaican could bow out with a record-extending 12th world title by winning another 4x100m relay gold later in the evening.\n\nAustralia's Sally Pearson meanwhile shook off years of injury problems when she stormed to her second world title in the 100 metres hurdles; and top favourite Mariya Lasitskene clinched back-to-back high jump titles to give the Russians competing as neutral athletes a first London gold.\n\nThe day's other medal events are the women's sprint relay, the men's javelin and the women's 4x100m relay.\n\nFarah's famous kick in the last lap worked last week in the 10,000m but not on Saturday as Edris broke early, held him off on the home stretch and beat Farah by .43 of a second with 13 minutes 32.79 seconds, with American Paul Chelimo taking bronze.\n\nEdris is the first man to beat Farah in six years since compatriot Ibrahim Jeilan finished ahead of Farah in the 10,000m at the 2011 worlds.\n\nFarah won the next 10 global races for doubles at the 2012 and 2016 Olympics, and 2013 and 2015 worlds.\n\nThe 2011 world and 2012 Olympic champion Pearson, 30, shot into the lead midway through the hurdles and never looked back for gold in 12.59 seconds.\n\nDawn Harper Nelson of the United States, the 2008 Olympic champion, got silver in 12.63. German Pamela Dutkiewicz was a surprise bronze medallist in 12.72, two-hundredths ahead of world record holder Kendra Harrison of the US.\n\n\"It's been a long journey back from injury, but to get this moment and go and celebrate in front of my family is unreal. This is just so incredible to be a world champion again,\" said Pearson who had missed the 2015 worlds and 2016 Games for injury reasons.\n\nLasitskene has ruled the high jump lately and apart from one miss over 1.99m cleared all heights on her first attempt, winning with 2.03m and then failing three times on a national record 2.08m.\n\nUkraine's Yuliia Lerchenko got silver with 2.01m and Poland's Kamila Licwinko.\n\nIn the day's only preliminaries, the US dominated the women's and men's 4x400m heats into the finals which conclude the championships as part of 11 medal events Sunday.\n\nIn the others, Kenya's Asbel Kiprop seeks a fourth straight 1,500-metre gold; Ethiopian Almaz Ayana to complete a rare women's distance running double in the 5,000m, and Caster Semenya is the top favourite for a second 800m title a year after Olympic gold.\n\nThe women's discus contender and men's high jump are also on the schedule of the day which starts off with all four race walks on the Mall, including the inaugural women's 50km event.", "time": "22:16:00"}

can't stop popping up surprises even as Jamaican great Usain Bolt and local hero Mohamed Farah bid farewell to their respective careers amid tears and defeat.\n\nIn the last race of his career, Bolt limped off the track while hosts Britain took the stunning 4x100m victory to the ecstacy of the capacity London Stadium spectators here on Saturday evening, reports Xinhua news agency.\n\nBolt, running the anchor leg, staggered halfway down the straight, dropping the baton before falling facing down. Dreaming of hanging up his running spikes without a defeat in a major championship, the 11-time world champion and eight-time Olympic titlist limped across the finish line.\n\nBolt had only taken a few strides when he appeared to suffer an injury to his left leg and fell to the track in pain. He stayed down for a couple of minutes before standing up and walking to the finish line.\n\nBritain won the gold in 37.47 seconds, the US took silver in 37.52 and Japan was third in 38.04. China, the silver medalist two years ago, finished fourth in 38.34 with second-leg runner Xie Zhenye just coming back from injury.\n\nThe British team of Chijindu Ujah, Adam Gemili, Danny Talbot and Nethaneel Mitchell-Blake broke the European record that had stood since 1999 by 0.26 seconds. That record was established by the British team of Jason Gardener, Darren Campbell, Marlon Devonish and Dwain Chambers as silver medal winners behind the USA at the 1999 IAAF World Championships in Seville, Spain.\n\nBritish anchor runner Nethaneel Michell-Blake dropped to the ground in blissful disbelief as his team beat the American squad consisting of newly crowned 100m world champion Justin Gatlin and runner-up Christian Coleman.\n\nIt brought back memories of the Athens Olympics in 2004, when Mark Lewis-Francis held off Maurice Greene to claim an unlikely Olympic victory over the Americans. The only other global senior championship success for Britain in the men's 4x100m relay was at the 1912 Olympics in Stockholm.\n\nIt was a rollercoaster night for the celebrating home fans when a couple of hours ago their emotion could only be described as disappointed when Farah failed in his quest for a fourth 5,000m world title in his farewell race just like Bolt.\n\nYoung Ethiopian star Muktar Edris has beaten the all-dominating Mohamed Farah of Britain to win the men's 5,000 metre title at the IAAF World Championships here.\n\nEdris, who was crowned world youth champion in 2012, produced a strong charge on the final stretch to register a time of 13 minutes and 32.79 seconds on Saturday evening, Xinhua news agency reported.\n\nThe 23-year-old, who won the first major senior world title of his career, stopped Farah from taking his fourth 5,000m world title.\n\nThe Somali-origin Farah has won Olympic gold in the men's 5,000m twice and has won the men's 10,000m title at this event.\n\nHowever on Saturday night, Farah had to be content with the second place after finishing with a time of 13:33.22. Paul Kipkemoi Chelimo of the US took bronze in 13:33.30. Farah, who was surrounded by Ethiopean runners going into the final stages of the race, produced a desperate final sprint but failed to catch up with the leader.\n\n\"I gave it everything,\" said Farah who initially curled up on the track in defeat and then was pulled up by Edris.\n\nJust like Jamaican great Usain Bolt, Farah finished his career with an unusual feeling of defeat.\n\nThe 34-year-old had won this event in the past three world championships and two Olympic Games, together with three world titles and two Olympic gold medals in 10,000m.\n\nHowever, he remains hero of the country, bagging one gold and one silver in London, which are the only medals the hosts have won by far.\n\nFarah, who had said this would be his last World Championships, will now turn his focus to marathon running.\n\nWhile Farah handed over his long distance crown, the next generation of Ethiopian runners announced their arrival on the world stage.\n\nEdris' fellow Ethiopians 2016 world indoor champion Yomif Kejelcha, 21, and this year's U-18 3,000m winner Selemon Barega were placed fourth and fifth respectively, indicating that the east Africans will continue to be a force to reckon at the international level.\n\nA surprise also took place in the field events as Johannes Vetter of Germany grabbed his first ever medal at a major global competition -- a golden one -- with his first attempt of 89.89 meters to win the men's javelin event even as defending champion Julius Yego and Olympic champion Thomas Rohler failed to deliver.\n\nJakub Vadlejch of Czech Republic finished second in 89.73m ahead of compatriot Petr Frydrych who registered 88.32m.\n\nRohler, from Germany, made a 88.26m throw in his second attempt and finished fourth while defending champion Julius Yego of Kenya was eliminated after the first three rounds.\n\nIn other events, Russia's Maria Lasitskene retained the women's high jump title.\n\nThe 24-year-old, competing as an authorized neutral athlete, cleared 2.03 meters for the gold medal. Ukraine's Yuliia Levchenko took silver in 2.01 and Poland's Kamila Licwinko was third in 1.99.\n\nLasitskene, who missed last year's Rio Olympics because of Russia's suspension, failed at 1.99 twice but regained form thereafter.\n\n\"My two failed attempts at 1.99m woke me up,\" she said.\n\n\"A gold medal here was my main goal for this season but certainly I would like to raise the bar a bit higher. I didn't like any one of my attempts at 2.08m.\"\n\nShe challenged 2.08 three times but failed.\n\n\"It was an unbelievable championships for me. I was focussed from the opening jump until the last attempt. I didn't allow myself to get emotional,\" Levchenko said.\n\n\"At 2.01m it was not my best technical attempt. I thought that such a height would not forgive the mistakes I made.\"\n\nMeanwhile, USA regained the women's 4x100m world crown which they last won at the 2011 World Championships in Daegu as they sailed to victory in 41.82 seconds while hosts Britain gladly bagged a silver in 42.12. Defending champions Jamaica clocked 42.19 for the bronze.\n\nAustralia's Sally Pearson won her second world women's 100 meters hurdles title in six years.\n\nPearson, 30, who won the world title in 2011 and Olympic gold five years ago, clocked 12.59 seconds for the gold. American Dawn Harper Nelson, who won the Olympic gold in Beijing and silver in London behind Pearson, took silver in 12.63 seconds. Germany's Pamela Dutkiewicz finished third in 12.72 seconds.\n\n\"It's been a long journey back from injury but to get this moment and go and celebrate in front of my family is unreal. This is just so incredible to be a world champion again,\" Pearson, also the silver medallist in the Beijing Olympics, said.\n\n\"I love this stadium. I love the people and I'm so happy to have been back here doing the same thing again (winning gold). It's a relief to be world champion.\"\n\nRio Olympic silver medalist Kevin Mayer claimed France's second gold from the men's decathlon with a total of 8,768 points. Germany's Rico Freimuth, bronze winner two years ago in the Beijing worlds, took silver in 8,564 points and his compatriot Kai Kazmirek got the bronze in 8,488.\n\n--IANS\n\najb/\n\nSEARCH", "time": "10:56:00"}

"http://www.sport24.co.za/OtherSport/Athletics/International/oh-mo-farah-gets-golden-send-off-20170813", "body": "London - British athletics legend Mo Farah was hailed by the British press on Sunday despite his glorious track career ending with defeat in the 5,000 metres world championships final.\n\nAlthough his silver medal performance was pushed out of the limelight by the drama of the men's 4x100m relay, which saw fellow legend Usain Bolt collapse with cramp on his own swansong as Britain pulled off a remarkable victory, as well as the thrilling opening of the Premier League season, Farah still commanded many column inches.\n\nThe 34-year-old saw his global championship win streak of 10 gold medals dating back to the 5,000m at the 2011 world championships ended as Muktar Edris of Ethiopia held off his desperate charge in the finishing straight.\n\n\"End of the track for Mo\" headlined The Sunday Times, adding that it was a \"shattering defeat in front of an adoring crowd\".\n\nHowever, the paper eulogised about the performance by Farah - who came to Britain with his mother and two of his brothers from Somalia via a spell with his grandparents in Djibouti aged just eight - in the stadium where he had memorably achieved his first Olympic double in 2012.\n\n\"If defeat is the making of a true champion, then Mo Farah left the track at the Olympic stadium last night as the greatest champion of all,\" wrote its sports writer.\n\n\"That he failed, beaten finally, for the first time at a major championships since 2011, by Muktar Edris of Ethiopia, stripped nothing from the legend.\"\n\nThe Sun on Sunday, never one to miss out on an eye-catching pun, perhaps unkindly went with \"Slow Mo\".\n\nHowever, Farah -- who has had a tense relationship with large sections of the British media over the questions raised by his loyalty to controversial United States-based coach Alberto Salazar -- would have been happier with what followed.\n\n\"The 34-year-old is hanging up his spikes to take to the roads in the marathon after a stellar career which has seen him establish himself as one of the all-time greats of the sport,\" purred the Sun correspondent.\n\n\"Yet despite the huge support from the home crowd packed into the London Stadium, Britain's hero was finally knocked off his perch as the king of long-distance running.\"\n\nThe Mail On Sunday headlined their tale of Farah's final bow \"Oh Mo!\"\n\nThey called it a \"disappointing silver\" but pointed to the remarkable career of Britain's most successful ever athlete.\n\nAnd they took aim at America's Kenyan-born bronze medallist Richard Chelimo for making Farah's trademark 'Mobot' gesture and then running his hand across his throat as the 5,000m runners lined up before their race.\n\n\"It is what it is, I just meant that I was going to take Mo down,\" said Chelimo.\n\nThe Observer remarked that those who had come in their thousands with their faces painted with \"Go Mo!\" and banners with \"Run Farah Run\" were to be left disappointed.\n\nIt also commented on how his soon to turn five twin daughters Aisha and Amani had never seen him lose a major final before Saturday.\n\n\"He curled into the foetal position at the finish, beaten in a major final for the first time in six years,\" wrote the correspondent.\n\n\"Silver on this occasion stung like defeat and salt was rubbed into open wounds by his conqueror, Muktar Edris of Ethiopia, performing the iconic Mobot at the finish.\"", "time": "11:44:00"}

stop popping up surprises even as Jamaican great Usain Bolt and local hero Mohamed Farah bid farewell to their respective careers amid tears and defeat.\n\nIn the last race of his career, Bolt limped off the track while hosts Britain took the stunning 4x100m victory to the ecstasy of the capacity London Stadium spectators here on Saturday evening, reports Xinhua news agency.\n\nBolt had only taken a few strides when he appeared to suffer an injury to his left leg around 30 metres into the anchor leg. He dropped the baton before falling face down to the track in pain.\n\nThe 11-time world champion and eight-time Olympic titlist stayed down for a couple of minutes and refused the offer of a wheelchair from medics before standing up and walking to the finish line.\n\nFor all his stellar achievements, it book-ended a professional life in the fast lane that started in similar fashion, when he limped across the line last in the 200m final on his World Championships debut as an injury-prone 18-year-old in Helsinki back in 2005.\n\n\"Everybody was jelly. Everybody was pumped. It just happened (Usain's injury). Usain Bolt's name will always live on,\" Jamaica's first leg runner Omar McLeod said.\n\nBolt had anchored Jamaica to victory in each of the previous six global championship 4x100m finals, stretching back to the 2009 World Championships with an average winning margin of 0.49.\n\nThis time, with 110m hurdles champion Omar McLeod on the lead off leg, Julian Forte on leg two and 2011 world 100m champion Blake on three, they were far from the polished model that scorched to the 2012 Olympic title in a world record time of 36.84 seconds.\n\nBritain won the gold in 37.47 seconds, the US took silver in 37.52 and Japan was third in 38.04. China, the silver medallist two years ago, finished fourth in 38.34 with second-leg runner Xie Zhenye just coming back from injury.\n\nThe British team of Chijindu Ujah, Adam Gemili, Danny Talbot and Nethaneel Mitchell-Blake broke the European record -- that had stood since 1999 -- by 0.26 seconds. That record was established by the British team of Jason Gardener, Darren Campbell, Marlon Devonish and Dwain Chambers as silver medal winners behind the USA at the 1999 IAAF World Championships in Seville, Spain.\n\nBritish anchor runner Michell-Blake dropped to the ground in blissful disbelief as his team beat the American squad consisting of newly crowned 100m world champion Justin Gatlin and runner-up Christian Coleman.\n\nIt brought back memories of the Athens Olympics in 2004, when Mark Lewis-Francis held off Maurice Greene to claim an unlikely Olympic victory over the Americans. The only other global senior championship success for Britain in the men's 4x100m relay was at the 1912 Olympics in Stockholm.\n\nIt was a roller-coaster night for the celebrating home fans when a couple of hours ago their emotion could only be described as disappointed when Farah failed in his quest for a fourth 5,000m world title in his farewell race just like Bolt.\n\nYoung Ethiopian star Muktar Edris has beaten the all-dominating Mohamed Farah of Britain to win the men's 5,000 metre title at the IAAF World Championships here.\n\nEdris, who was crowned world youth champion in 2012, produced a strong charge on the final stretch to register a time of 13 minutes and 32.79 seconds on Saturday evening, Xinhua news agency reported.\n\nThe 23-year-old, who won the first major senior world title of his career, stopped Farah from taking his fourth 5,000m world title.\n\nThe Somali-origin Farah has won Olympic gold in the men's 5,000m twice and has won the men's 10,000m title at this event.\n\nHowever, on Saturday night, Farah had to be content with the second place after finishing with a time of 13:33.22. Paul Kipkemoi Chelimo of the US took bronze in 13:33.30. Farah, who was surrounded by Ethiopian runners going into the final stages of the race, produced a desperate final sprint but failed to catch up with the leader.\n\n\"I gave it everything,\" said Farah who initially curled up on the track in defeat and then was pulled up by Edris.\n\n\"It takes so much out of me. Tactically I was trying to cover every move. They had the game plan; one of them was going to sacrifice themselves... and the better man won on the day,\" he added.\n\nJust like Bolt, Farah finished his career with an unusual feeling of defeat.\n\nThe 34-year-old had won this event in the past three world championships and two Olympic Games, together with three world titles and two Olympic gold medals in 10,000m.\n\nHowever, he remains hero of the country, bagging one gold and one silver in London, which are the only medals the hosts have won by far.\n\nFarah, who had said this would be his last World Championships, will now turn his focus to marathon running.\n\nWhile Farah handed over his long distance crown, the next generation of Ethiopian runners announced their arrival on the world stage.\n\nEdris' fellow Ethiopians 2016 world indoor champion Yomif Kejelcha, 21, and this year's U-18 3,000m winner Selemon Barega were placed fourth and fifth respectively, indicating that the east Africans will continue to be a force to reckon at the international level.\n\nA surprise also took place in the field events as Johannes Vetter of Germany grabbed his first ever medal at a major global competition -- a golden one -- with his first attempt of 89.89 meters to win the men's javelin event even as defending champion Julius Yego and Olympic champion Thomas Rohler failed to deliver.\n\nJakub Vadlejch of Czech Republic finished second in 89.73m ahead of compatriot Petr Frydrych who registered 88.32m.\n\nRohler, from Germany, made a 88.26m throw in his second attempt and finished fourth while defending champion Julius Yego of Kenya was eliminated after the first three rounds.\n\nIn other events, Russia's Maria Lasitskene retained the women's high jump title.\n\nThe 24-year-old, competing as an authorized neutral athlete, cleared 2.03 meters for the gold medal. Ukraine's Yuliia Levchenko took silver in 2.01 and Poland's Kamila Licwinko was third in 1.99.\n\nLasitskene, who missed last year's Rio Olympics because of Russia's suspension, failed at 1.99 twice but regained form thereafter.\n\n\"My two failed attempts at 1.99m woke me up,\" she said.\n\n\"A gold medal here was my main goal for this season but certainly I would like to raise the bar a bit higher. I didn't like any one of my attempts at 2.08m.\"\n\nShe challenged 2.08 three times but failed.\n\n\"It was an unbelievable championships for me. I was focussed from the opening jump until the last attempt. I didn't allow myself to get emotional,\" Levchenko said.\n\n\"At 2.01m it was not my best technical attempt. I thought that such a height would not forgive the mistakes I made.\"\n\nMeanwhile, USA regained the women's 4x100m world crown which they last won at the 2011 World Championships in Daegu as they sailed to victory in 41.82 seconds while hosts Britain gladly bagged a silver in 42.12. Defending champions Jamaica clocked 42.19 for the bronze.\n\nAustralia's Sally Pearson won her second world women's 100 meters hurdles title in six years.\n\nPearson, 30, who won the world title in 2011 and Olympic gold five years ago, clocked 12.59 seconds for the gold. American Dawn Harper Nelson, who won the Olympic gold in Beijing and silver in London behind Pearson, took silver in 12.63 seconds. Germany's Pamela Dutkiewicz finished third in 12.72 seconds.\n\n\"It's been a long journey back from injury but to get this moment and go and celebrate in front of my family is unreal. This is just so incredible to be a world champion again,\" Pearson, also the silver medallist in the Beijing Olympics, said.\n\n\"I love this stadium. I love the people and I'm so happy to have been back here doing the same thing again (winning gold). It's a relief to be world champion.\"\n\nRio Olympic silver medallist Kevin Mayer claimed France's second gold from the men's decathlon with a total of 8,768 points. Germany's Rico Freimuth, bronze winner two years ago in the Beijing worlds, took silver in 8,564 points and his compatriot Kai Kazmirek got the bronze in 8,488.\n\n--IANS\n\najb/dg\n\nSEARCH", "time": "12:20:00"}

Mo!\"\n\nBritish athletics legend Mo Farah was hailed by the British press on Sunday despite his glorious track career ending with defeat in the 5,000 metres world championships final.\n\nAlthough his silver medal performance was pushed out of the limelight by the drama of the men's 4x100m relay, which saw fellow legend Usain Bolt collapse with cramp on his own swansong as Britain pulled off a remarkable victory, as well as the thrilling opening of the Premier League season, Farah still commanded many column inches.\n\nThe 34-year-old saw his global championship win streak of 10 gold medals dating back to the 5,000m at the 2011 world championships ended as Muktar Edris of Ethiopia held off his desperate charge in the finishing straight.\n\n\"End of the track for Mo\" headlined The Sunday Times, adding that it was a \"shattering defeat in front of an adoring crowd\".\n\nHowever, the paper eulogised about the performance by Farah -- who came to Britain with his mother and two of his brothers from Somalia via a spell with his grandparents in Djibouti aged just eight -- in the stadium where he had memorably achieved his first Olympic double in 2012.\n\n\"If defeat is the making of a true champion, then Mo Farah left the track at the Olympic stadium last night as the greatest champion of all,\" wrote its sports writer.\n\n\"That he failed, beaten finally, for the first time at a major championships since 2011, by Muktar Edris of Ethiopia, stripped nothing from the legend.\"\n\nThe Sun on Sunday, never one to miss out on an eye-catching pun, perhaps unkindly went with \"Slow Mo\".\n\nHowever, Farah -- who has had a tense relationship with large sections of the British media over the questions raised by his loyalty to controversial United States-based coach Alberto Salazar -- would have been happier with what followed.\n\n\"The 34-year-old is hanging up his spikes to take to the roads in the marathon after a stellar career which has seen him establish himself as one of the all-time greats of the sport,\" purred the Sun correspondent.\n\n\"Yet despite the huge support from the home crowd packed into the London Stadium, Britain's hero was finally knocked off his perch as the king of long-distance running.\"\n\nThe Mail On Sunday headlined their tale of Farah's final bow \"Oh Mo!\"\n\nThey called it a \"disappointing silver\" but pointed to the remarkable career of Britain's most successful ever athlete.\n\nAnd they took aim at America's Kenyan-born bronze medallist Paul Chelimo for making Farah's trademark 'Mobot' gesture and then running his hand across his throat as the 5,000m runners lined up before their race.\n\n\"It is what it is, I just meant that I was going to take Mo down,\" said Chelimo.\n\nThe Observer remarked that those who had come in their thousands with their faces painted with \"Go Mo!\" and banners with \"Run Farah Run\" were to be left disappointed.\n\nIt also commented on how his soon to turn five twin daughters Aisha and Amani had never seen him lose a major final before Saturday.\n\n\"He curled into the foetal position at the finish, beaten in a major final for the first time in six years,\" wrote the correspondent.\n\n\"Silver on this occasion stung like defeat and salt was rubbed into open wounds by his conqueror, Muktar Edris of Ethiopia, performing the iconic Mobot at the finish.\"", "time":

popping up surprises even as Jamaican great Usain Bolt and local hero Mohamed Farah bid farewell to their respective careers amid tears and defeat.\n\nIn the last race of his career, Bolt limped off the track while hosts Britain took the stunning 4x100m victory to the ecstasy of the capacity London Stadium spectators here on Saturday evening, reports Xinhua news agency.\n\nBolt had only taken a few strides when he appeared to suffer an injury to his left leg around 30 metres into the anchor leg. He dropped the baton before falling face down to the track in pain.\n\nThe 11-time world champion and eight-time Olympic titlist stayed down for a couple of minutes and refused the offer of a wheelchair from medics before standing up and walking to the finish line.\n\nFor all his stellar achievements, it book-ended a professional life in the fast lane that started in similar fashion, when he limped across the line last in the 200m final on his World Championships debut as an injury-prone 18-year-old in Helsinki back in 2005.\n\n\"Everybody was jelly. Everybody was pumped. It just happened (Usain's injury). Usain Bolt's name will always live on,\" Jamaica's first leg runner Omar McLeod said.\n\nBolt had anchored Jamaica to victory in each of the previous six global championship 4x100m finals, stretching back to the 2009 World Championships with an average winning margin of 0.49.\n\nThis time, with 110m hurdles champion Omar McLeod on the lead off leg, Julian Forte on leg two and 2011 world 100m champion Blake on three, they were far from the polished model that scorched to the 2012 Olympic title in a world record time of 36.84 seconds.\n\nBritain won the gold in 37.47 seconds, the US took silver in 37.52 and Japan was third in 38.04. China, the silver medallist two years ago, finished fourth in 38.34 with second-leg runner Xie Zhenye just coming back from injury.\n\nThe British team of Chijindu Ujah, Adam Gemili, Danny Talbot and Nethaneel Mitchell-Blake broke the European record -- that had stood since 1999 -- by 0.26 seconds. That record was established by the British team of Jason Gardener, Darren Campbell, Marlon Devonish and Dwain Chambers as silver medal winners behind the USA at the 1999 IAAF World Championships in Seville, Spain.\n\nBritish anchor runner Michell-Blake dropped to the ground in blissful disbelief as his team beat the American squad consisting of newly crowned 100m world champion Justin Gatlin and runner-up Christian Coleman.\n\nIt brought back memories of the Athens Olympics in 2004, when Mark Lewis-Francis held off Maurice Greene to claim an unlikely Olympic victory over the Americans. The only other global senior championship success for Britain in the men's 4x100m relay was at the 1912 Olympics in Stockholm.\n\nIt was a roller-coaster night for the celebrating home fans when a couple of hours ago their emotion could only be described as disappointed when Farah failed in his quest for a fourth 5,000m world title in his farewell race just like Bolt.\n\nYoung Ethiopian star Muktar Edris has beaten the all-dominating Mohamed Farah of Britain to win the men's 5,000 metre title at the IAAF World Championships here.\n\nEdris, who was crowned world youth champion in 2012, produced a strong charge on the final stretch to register a time of 13 minutes and 32.79 seconds on Saturday evening, Xinhua news agency reported.\n\nThe 23-year-old, who won the first major senior world title of his career, stopped Farah from taking his fourth 5,000m world title.\n\nThe Somali-origin Farah has won Olympic gold in the men's 5,000m twice and has won the men's 10,000m title at this event.\n\nHowever, on Saturday night, Farah had to be content with the second place after finishing with a time of 13:33.22. Paul Kipkemoi Chelimo of the US took bronze in 13:33.30. Farah, who was surrounded by Ethiopian runners going into the final stages of the race, produced a desperate final sprint but failed to catch up with the leader.\n\n\"I gave it everything,\" said Farah who initially curled up on the track in defeat and then was pulled up by Edris.\n\n\"It takes so much out of me. Tactically I was trying to cover every move. They had the game plan; one of them was going to sacrifice themselves... and the better man won on the day,\" he added.\n\nJust like Bolt, Farah finished his career with an unusual feeling of defeat.\n\nThe 34-year-old had won this event in the past three world championships and two Olympic Games, together with three world titles and two Olympic gold medals in 10,000m.\n\nHowever, he remains hero of the country, bagging one gold and one silver in London, which are the only medals the hosts have won by far.\n\nFarah, who had said this would be his last World Championships, will now turn his focus to marathon running.\n\nWhile Farah handed over his long distance crown, the next generation of Ethiopian runners announced their arrival on the world stage.\n\nEdris' fellow Ethiopians 2016 world indoor champion Yomif Kejelcha, 21, and this year's U-18 3,000m winner Selemon Barega were placed fourth and fifth respectively, indicating that the east Africans will continue to be a force to reckon at the international level.\n\nA surprise also took place in the field events as Johannes Vetter of Germany grabbed his first ever medal at a major global competition -- a golden one -- with his first attempt of 89.89 meters to win the men's javelin event even as defending champion Julius Yego and Olympic champion Thomas Rohler failed to deliver.\n\nJakub Vadlejch of Czech Republic finished second in 89.73m ahead of compatriot Petr Frydrych who registered 88.32m.\n\nRohler, from Germany, made a 88.26m throw in his second attempt and finished fourth while defending champion Julius Yego of Kenya was eliminated after the first three rounds.\n\nIn other events, Russia's Maria Lasitskene retained the women's high jump title.\n\nThe 24-year-old, competing as an authorized neutral athlete, cleared 2.03 meters for the gold medal. Ukraine's Yuliia Levchenko took silver in 2.01 and Poland's Kamila Licwinko was third in 1.99.\n\nLasitskene, who missed last year's Rio Olympics because of Russia's suspension, failed at 1.99 twice but regained form thereafter.\n\n\"My two failed attempts at 1.99m woke me up,\" she said.\n\n\"A gold medal here was my main goal for this season but certainly I would like to raise the bar a bit higher. I didn't like any one of my attempts at 2.08m.\"\n\nShe challenged 2.08 three times but failed.\n\n\"It was an unbelievable championships for me. I was focussed from the opening jump until the last attempt. I didn't allow myself to get emotional,\" Levchenko said.\n\n\"At 2.01m it was not my best technical attempt. I thought that such a height would not forgive the mistakes I made.\"\n\nMeanwhile, USA regained the women's 4x100m world crown which they last won at the 2011 World Championships in Daegu as they sailed to victory in 41.82 seconds while hosts Britain gladly bagged a silver in 42.12. Defending champions Jamaica clocked 42.19 for the bronze.\n\nAustralia's Sally Pearson won her second world women's 100 meters hurdles title in six years.\n\nPearson, 30, who won the world title in 2011 and Olympic gold five years ago, clocked 12.59 seconds for the gold. American Dawn Harper Nelson, who won the Olympic gold in Beijing and silver in London behind Pearson, took silver in 12.63 seconds. Germany's Pamela Dutkiewicz finished third in 12.72 seconds.\n\n\"It's been a long journey back from injury but to get this moment and go and celebrate in front of my family is unreal. This is just so incredible to be a world champion again,\" Pearson, also the silver medallist in the Beijing Olympics, said.\n\n\"I love this stadium. I love the people and I'm so happy to have been back here doing the same thing again (winning gold). It's a relief to be world champion.\"\n\nRio Olympic silver medallist Kevin Mayer claimed France's second gold from the men's decathlon with a total of 8,768 points. Germany's Rico Freimuth, bronze winner two years ago in the Beijing worlds, took silver in 8,564 points and his compatriot Kai Kazmirek got the bronze in 8,488.\n\n(This story has not been edited by Business Standard staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)", "time": "12:10:00"}

"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2017/aug/13/mo-farah-10000m-final-edris", "body": "The tank has almost run dry. Mo Farah ended his last major track race with a silver medal in the 5,000m after a desperate lunge in the final few strides propelled him from fourth place to second, coming up just short in his quest for a career-capping win at the World Championships in London last night.\n\nThe 34-year-old, legs pumping as he tried to catch the leader, agony etched across his face, was beaten at a major championships for the first time in six years by Muktar Edris of Ethiopia.\n\nFarah collapsed in disappointment, before picking himself up to jog around the track, composing himself and, occasionally, smiling for selfies and autographs with the thousands of fans in the stadium who had chanted his name and urged him on. Yet he was clearly disappointed not to end on a high.\n\n\"I thought I could get inside at the end, but my legs had had it,\" he said, admitting that the 10,000m win last weekend on 4 August had taken even more out of him than in championships gone by. \"London is my home and it has been fantastic to be here again. The last week or so has been incredible. I've really enjoyed the journey.\"\n\nUsain Bolt's journey also ended on Saturday, albeit in even more agonising fashion as he pulled up on the anchor leg of the men's 4x100m relay. The crowd had little time to take it in as Great Britain's CJ Ujah, Adam Gemili, Danny Talbot and Nethaneel Mitchell-Blake ran a near-perfect race to hold off the fancied US team and take gold in the race, with Japan taking bronze as Bolt collapsed halfway down the home straight.\n\nFarah's final appearance in the London Stadium at a major competition seals one of the most successful careers any British athlete has ever had. Farah has won four Olympic gold medals in the 5,000m and 10,000m in London and Rio, as well as almost every major championship race at those distances since 2010. He has several other awards and was knighted earlier this year. Sir Mo is a heavyweight British icon, all nine stone of him.\n\nHis achievements are underlined by the hardship of his early life. Farah fled Mogadishu as an eight-year-old when civil war hit the Somali capital, coming to live in London with his father, Mukhtar, who was born in the UK.\n\nYet even when he finally hangs up his running spikes -- Farah has two more appearances to make, at Diamond League races in Birmingham and Zurich -- he will face one last challenge: to prove in the court of public opinion that he has never been a drugs cheat. There is no case for the prosecution against Farah himself. The taint comes from association with his coach, Alberto Salazar. The Cuban-born American has been under investigation by the United States anti-doping agency (Usada) for two years since a documentary by BBC's Panorama and ProPublica carried allegations that he had experimented with doping and gave athletes unneeded prescription medicines.\n\nFarah has beaten down questions for so long that he is, unsurprisingly, sick of answering them. He cannot prove his innocence, although even critical voices like Olympic bronze medal-winning heptathlete Kelly Sotherton -- who believes Farah can't be considered a \"legend\" due to his lack of records -- say he has \"full integrity\" and is honest.\n\nPart of the suspicion has come because he flourished relatively late in his career -- although not as late as some middle- and long-distance runners such as Jo Pavey, who became 10,000m European champion at the age of 40, after giving birth to her second child.\n\nFarah's talent was spotted early enough. His PE teacher in west London, Alan Watkinson, guided him away from a possible footballing career on to the running track. The first test was a cross-country championship. \"He literally didn't know what was going on and ran in the wrong direction,\" Watkinson said in 2010. \"He had to follow the other kids around and he still managed to finish second.\"\n\nFarah's promise became major success in 2001, when he won the 5,000m at the European junior athletics championships in Athens at the age of 18. Afterwards, he struggled for but won few honours and in 2008 failed to qualify for the 5,000m final at the Beijing Olympics.\n\nHis resurgence coincided with the build-up to the London Olympics, when British athletes were showered with money to ensure a bumper crop of medals in 2012. He began training with Kenya's best runners, living with them, joining them at high-altitude training camps in Ethiopia and Kenya, and focusing harder on his career. Farah was picked as a winner, and he began to deliver. In 2010, he collected golds at the European championships in his two favourite distances, then set a 5,000m national record. A year later, he became world champion over 5,000m -- the first British man to win the title. The stage was set for the London Games.\n\nMeanwhile his personal life had also settled. In 2010 he married Tania Nell, whom he met as a student, and moved the following year to the US to work with Salazar on his Nike Oregon Project. Their twin daughters were born in the year of the London Games and Farah was one of Britain's heroes, winning gold at the London Stadium in the 5,000m and 10,000m. He didn't stop there. He has won every major championship race since -- 13 in a row, including his dramatic 10,000m win last week.\n\n\"To have achieved what I have achieved has been incredible. I don't think there's enough words to explain the journey,\" he said. \"Yeah, it is emotional but it has been a long career. You guys have seen me since I was a child, running around, going to the English schools. To come this far has been incredible.\"\n\nMO'S MEDAL TRIUMPHS\n\nOlympic Games: Four gold medals - dedicated to his children - in the 5,000m and 10,000m at London 2012 and Rio 2016.\n\nWorld championships: Double gold medals in Moscow 2013 and Beijing 2015. He also won 5,000m gold and 10,000m silver in Daegu in 2011, finishing with 10,000m gold and 5,000m silver in London 2017.\n\nEuropean championships: Double gold medals in Zurich 2014 and Barcelona 2010 in the 10,000m and 5,000m. He also won 5,000m gold in Helsinki in 2012.\n\nOthers: European junior championships, 2001; European junior cross country, 2001; European cross country, 2006; European indoor 3,000m, 2009 and 2011; New York half marathon, 2011; New Orleans half marathon, 2013; Great North Run, 2016.", "time": "23:04:00"}

Usain Bolt didn't get his last 100m world championships gold, and in Britain's Mo Farah's last ever track race before switching focus to road running, the four-time Olympic champion was beaten by Ethiopia's Muktar Edris.\n\nAt the age of just 23, this is a first major achievement at senior level. He won the world junior 5000m title in 2012 and had run the fastest time in the world this year (a 12:55.23 in Lausanne in July).\n\nBut few would have predicted he'd be the one to dethrone the great Farah - beaten for the first time on this London track where he famously doubled up to win 5000m and 10 000m gold at the Olympics five years ago.\n\nSuch was Farah's dominance over the long distance track events, that the 34-year-old has won every outdoor title he's gone for over 5000 and 10 000m since finishing with silver in 2011.\n\nBut Saturday night belonged to Edris as the Ethiopians worked together to make sure the title would be theirs. Farah finished with silver and American Paul Chelimo took bronze.\n\n\"I was highly prepared for this race and I knew I was going to beat Mo Farah,\" said Edris afterwards. \"After the 10km he was maybe tired so he did not have enough for the last kick. I was stronger.\n\n\"Mo has many victories but now I have one. I am the new champion for Ethiopia.\"\n\nFarah was gracious in defeat, saying: \"Tactically, I was trying to cover every move. They had the game plan: one of them was going to sacrifice themselves. That's what they did tonight, and the better man won on the day. I gave it all, I didn't have a single bit left at the end.\n\nBronze medallist Chelimo added: \"I think the Ethiopians had a plan because I think Kejelcha was out there to push the pace early and try and dampen Mo Farah's kick. Edris was just waiting and waiting to see and sitting by in the last 200m, so in the last 50m I thought 'there is no way I'm coming out without a medal here.'\n\n\"I had to fight and dig deep to get the bronze. To go home with a medal is not bad. I'm happy with this performance. It's my second championship and a medal.\n\n\"Mo is leaving, someone else has to take over now. I'm taking over next year and in 2019, I am after that gold,\" added Chelimo.\n\nThese World Championships have certainly thrown up some surprises and Farah's failure to secure a second gold after his 10 000m victory means no athletes, including SA's own Wayde van Niekerk and Caster Semenya, have been successful in their bid for double gold in individual events so far.\n\nEdris' win elevated Ethiopia to fourth on the medal table behind USA, Kenya and Poland, with South Africa currently in fifth place.\n\nThe final day of the World Championships on Sunday will provide South Africa with the chance to add to their record medal haul with Caster Semenya gunning for gold in the 800m final at 9.10pm SA time.\n\nThe only other South African in action will be Lebogang Shange in the 20km walk, which gets under way 3.20pm.", "time": "19:24:00"}

A drenching evening at the Olympic Park, with Stratford wreathed in Stygian gloom and rain provided by the special effects team on 'The Day After Tomorrow', seemed a fitting setting for more British medal prospects to take a bath. All of them, that is, besides Sir Mo Farah, who sploshed through the puddles with his customary poise to lay the platform for an 11th successive global title.\n\nIt defied belief that this was Farah's penultimate appearance at global championships. He looked curiously ageless as he swept through his 5,000 metres heat on Wednesday night, controlling the rhythm of the race, and yet he was on the cusp of bidding this, his beloved stadium, goodbye. The worry is that he is taking the last vestige of British hope at this level with him.\n\nFarah had kindled the home fires with a wonderful statement on the first evening, with his 10,000 metres triumph, but from there a catalogue of British near-misses has reduced those flames to a flicker. With Dame Jessica Ennis-Hill happily retired and pregnant with her second child, and Greg Rutherford injured but most likely with his peak well behind him, Farah is the last member of Super Saturday's golden trinity left standing. On this wettest of Wednesdays, it felt necessary to appreciate his remorseless consistency while we still could.\n\nMo Farah on one of his 'toughest' races after world 10,000m gold 00:58\n\nIn an unfamiliar sight, Farah crossed the line second, behind Ethiopia's Yomif Kejelcha, but he seldom looked troubled. Despite having made a shivering gesture at American Eric Jenkins as he took to the track, the experience of running in the damp chill of an East London evening was second nature. He used to race for Newham & Essex Beagles Athletic Club, after all, so the proposition of 12\u00bd laps here at the borough's gleaming citadel was hardly a hardship.\n\nThere are myriad explanations for British athletes' under-performance at these championships, from an unstructured talent identification system to a lack of competitive exposure, but it paid to listen to Farah for a guide to reaching the summit and staying there. \"I'm a bit tired, but you have just got to recover,\" he said. \"I'm happy to qualify - it's always difficult, coming so soon after the 10,000. Rounds are the hardest part. I had to switch on and go again. But anything is possible. Train hard and win easy, that's what the Kenyans say. I've been given a chance in life. For all the young kids out there, you should believe that you can do it as well.\"\n\nMoment Mo Farah wins 10,000m at IAAF World Championships 00:40\n\nFarah had scuffs and bruises from an attritional 10,000m, in which he was clattered twice by his rivals, but he explained that a night back home with his family in Teddington, where he spent his teenage years, had helped him rejuvenate. This return to the 5,000 marked a study in composure and restraint. The slow pace of the early laps threatened to unsettle him, but he stayed on the fringes of the pack to avoid the potential havoc of passing lapped runners in a bunched field. Mentally, as he is not shy of admitting, he remains tougher than the rest.\n\nHis only disappointment, perhaps, lay in the fate of his training partner, Bashar Abdi. Farah had repeatedly been looking over his shoulder for the Belgian, trying to leave him space, but Abdi was ultimately run out of a qualifying spot by Canada's Justyn Knight. He will be joined in the final by Andy Butchart of Scotland, who came through the second, feisty heat. \"I'm going for a medal - not another fourth place, like the rest of our guys,\" he said, with a mischievous smirk.\n\nThe prize that awaits Farah on Saturday night is a glittering one. Where Usain Bolt fell short of scripting the perfect ending, with his bronze medal behind Justin Gatlin, Farah clutches a chance to retire from the track with a six-year winning streak on this stage intact. Not since the 10,000m in Daegu, in 2011, when he was scuppered by a 52-second last lap from Ibrahim Jeilan, has he been vanquished in his period of working with Alberto Salazar. It is an astounding sequence, and it is not one he trusts will end this weekend, as he closes in on a 'quintuple-double' of distance titles.\n\n\"It isn't easy,\" he said. \"You have seen that with Usain Bolt. It would have been great to see him win, but it doesn't always happen that way. No one is going to give it to you, no matter who you are.

It was not the farewell Farah wanted, but he pointed to his earlier exertions in a dramatic 10,000m final as reason for lacking his usual devastating finish.\"The 10,000m took a lot more out of me than I had realized,\" he told BBC Sport. \"I gave it my all.

You can write what you like. The fact is I've achieved what I have from hard work and dedication. Putting my balls on the line, year after year and delivering for my country.\"\n\nAs the exchanges grew more heated, Farah asked why some journalists kept bringing up his relationship with Salazar, who helped turn him from a very good athlete into a great one after he joined the coach's Nike Oregon Project training group in late 2010. Salazar has been under investigation by the United States Anti-Doping Agency for the past two years but has always vehemently denied any wrongdoing.\n\n\"It's like a broken record, repeating myself,\" said Farah, who gave everything during a thrilling last lap only to finish second to the Ethiopian Muktar Edris on Saturday night. \"If I've crossed the line, if Alberto's crossed the line, why bring it up year after year, making it into headlines? I've achieved what I have achieved - you're trying to destroy it.\"\n\nAs Farah pointed out, while Salazar has been his coach on paper - which includes writing his workouts - the day-to-day training has been facilitated by the British team. \"How many races has he been to this year for me or last year?\" Farah asked. \"He hasn't been to any.\n\n\"I've been pretty much by myself with the guidance of Alberto, as you all know. I was capable of doing the job. It didn't make any difference to me. I know what I wanted to do. I was in a training camp for the British team.\"\n\nFarah also suggested that parts of the media, which has questioned the nature of his relationship with the controversial coach Jama Aden and then reported on the leak of his athlete's biological passport by the Russian hackers Fancy Bears, had an agenda against him.\n\n\"There's nothing else to be said,\" he said. \"Sometimes I find it bizarre how certain people write certain things to suit how they want to sell the story. You guys get to me - you never write the facts. The fact is, over the years, I have achieved a lot through hard work and pain.\"\n\n\"So many times, you guys have been unfair to me,\" he added. \"I know that. But say it how it is. I want you to write the truth about what's out there and educate people out there. But be honest with them. If you say Mo Farah has done something wrong' prove it.\"\n\nFarah refused to say whether he would be coached by Salazar next year when he tackles the formidable challenge of the marathon. But he admitted he was sad to leave the track after so many glittering successes.\n\n\"It has definitely hit me,\" he said. \"I got emotional on Saturday night. All good things in life must come to an end at some point. What goes up must come back down. I wanted to end on a high. But it happens. The better man won on the day. That's part of athletics. Fair credit to the other guys to be able to go. They had three guys in the team - they said 'one of you won't get a medal'. To beat Mo, it's taken them six years to do it but you've got to give it to them.\"\n\nHe also conceded that stepping up to 26.2 miles would not be easy. \"No one is going to give it to me. The roads are a whole new game. I've got to learn it and understand my weakness. It's going to take a while to understand the marathon.\" Farah also insisted that he was open to the idea of helping the next generation of British distance runners. \"It's important that we get into the sport and help others,\" he said. \"Christine Ohuruogu has been helping out with the relay and will continue to leave a legacy behind.\n\n\"It's about not thinking selfishly, not thinking financially. If we love the sport, you try to help others and I believe the knowledge and what I've learned over the years, I can contribute towards the younger kids and make a difference.\n\n\"You see Kyle Langford, Laura Muir, the relay boys - there are a lot of youngsters coming through,\" he added. \"I think we can make a difference.\"", "time": "13:03:00"}

World Championships just can't stop producing surprises, which could hardly be pleasant memories for Jamaican great Usain Bolt and home hero Mohamed Farah who both bid farewell to their careers.\n\nIn his last race of his career, Bolt limped off the track while hosts Britain took a stunning 4x100m victory to the ecstacy of the capacity London Stadium spectators, a never better redemption for a disappointing silver in the men's 5,000m.\n\nBolt, running the anchor leg, staggered halfway down the straight, dropping the baton before falling face down. Dreaming of hanging up his running spikes as \"unbeatable\", the 11-time world champion and 8-time Olympic titlist limped across the finish line.\n\n\"Everybody was jelly. Everybody was pumped. It just happened (Usain's injury). Usain Bolt's name will always live on,\" said Jamaica's first leg Omar McLeod.\n\nThe Chinese team also paid tribute to Bolt who took a bronze in the 100m.\n\n\"I can never imagine such an ending for Bolt. But no matter what ending he had today, he has created so many legends on the track and stays a legend in my heart,\" said Su Bingtian.\n\nBritish anchor runner Nethaneel Michell-Blake also dropped onto the ground, in blissful disbelief as his team took the important victory in a world lead time of 37.47 seconds, beating the American squad, consisting of new 100m winner Justin Gatlin and runner-up Christian Coleman, to second place in 37.52.\n\nJapan took bronze in 38.04. Beijing worlds silver medalists China finished fourth with second-leg runner Xie Zhenye just coming back from injury.\n\n\"We've had a good foundation to build off. After DQs in recent years we knew we had to get the baton round and to finish the night smoothly is a fantastic achievement and we'll enjoy our moment on the podium,\" said Gatlin. The U.S. was disqualified at Beijing 2015 for mishandling of the baton.\n\n\"I trust these guys. Every single one of them puts all the hard work in and they do their business. I mean, the best men won today so credit to GB. They ran a hell of a relay but I think this makes us hungrier. We know what we can do and we'll be ready in 2019,\" he added.\n\nIt was a rollercoaster night for the celebrating home fans when a couple of hours ago their emotion could only be described as disappointed.\n\nFarah failed in his quest for a fourth 5,000m world title in his farewell race just like Bolt as Ethiopian young gun Muktar Edris, 23, seized the glory from the 34-year-old.\n\nThe 2012 world youth champion produced a strong charge on the final stretch as Farah had to struggle out of a siege by three Ethiopians including Yomif Kejelcha, 21, and 17-year-old Selemon Barega, to put on a desperate final sprint but failed to catch up with the leader.\n\n\"I was highly prepared for this race and I knew I was going to beat Mo Farah,\" said Edris.\n\nEdris lifted his first ever major senior world title in 13:32.79, leaving two-time Olympic 5,000 titlist and newly crowned 10,000m winner Farah to second place in 13:33.22. Paul Kipkemoi Chelimo of the United States took bronze in 13:33.30.\n\n\"I gave it everything,\" said Farah who initially curled up on the track in defeat and was pulled up by Edris.\n\n\"It takes so much out of me. Tactically I was trying to cover every move. They had the game plan; one of them was going to sacrifice themselves... and the better man won on the day,\" Farah said.\n\n\"I got boxed in early on - it doesn't normally happen but I got boxed in early and couldn't get out,\" he added.\n\nLike Bolt, Farah would finish his career with an usual feeling of defeat -- he had won this event in the past three world championships and two Olympic Games, together with three world titles and two Olympic gold medals in 10,000m. However, he remains a hero of Britain, bagging one gold and one silver in London.\n\nWhile Farah handed out his long distance crown, the Ethiopians announced their coming.\n\nAlthough missing a podium finish, Kejelcha and this year's U18 3,000m winner Selemon Barega, who placed fourth and fifth respectively, have showed their potential.\n\nSurprises also happened in the field event as Johannes Vetter of Germany grabbed his first ever medal at a major global competition, a gold with his first attempt of 89.89 meters, while defending champion Julius Yego and Olympic champion Thomas Rohler failed to deliver.\n\nJakub Vadlejch of the Czech Republic finished second in 89.73m, ahead of fellow countryman Petr Frydrych on 88.32m.\n\nRohler, from Germany, made a 88.26m throw in his second attempt and finished fourth while Beijing worlds winner Yego was eliminated after the first three rounds.\n\nIn other events, Russia's Maria Lasitskene, competing as an authorized neutral athlete, retained the women's high jump title as the 24-year-old cleared 2.03 meters for the gold medal. Ukraine's Yuliia Levchenko took silver in 2.01 and Poland's Kamila Licwinko was third in 1.99.\n\nLasitskene, who missed last year's Rio Olympics because of Russia's suspension, failed at 1.99 twice but regained form thereafter.\n\n\"My two failed attempts at 1.99m woke me up,\" she said. \"A gold medal here was my main goal for this season but certainly I would like to raise the bar a bit higher. I didn't like any one of my attempts at 2.08m.\" She challenged 2.08 three times but all failed.\n\nRio Olympic champions U.S. team regained the women's 4x100m world crown which they last won at the 2011 Daegu worlds, as they sailed to victory in 41.82 seconds. Britain gladly bagged a silver in 42.12, and defending champions Jamaica clocked 42.19 for the bronze.\n\nIn the women's 100m hurdles, Sally Pearson, who clinched the world title in 2011 and Olympic gold five years ago, clocked 12.59 seconds to win the first gold - and the only medal for Australia at the world championships by far. American Dawn Harper Nelson, who won the Olympic gold in Beijing and silver in London behind Pearson, took silver in 12.63. Germany's Pamela Dutkiewicz finished third in 12.72.\n\n\"It's been a long journey back from injury, but to get this moment and go and celebrate in front of my family is unreal,\" said Pearson, 30. \"This is just so incredible to be a world champion again.\"\n\nRio Olympic silver medalist Kevin Mayer claimed France's second gold from the men's decathlon with a total of 8,768 points. Germany's Rico Freimuth, bronze winner two years ago in the Beijing worlds, took silver in 8,564 points and his compatriot Kai Kazmirek won bronze in 8,488.\n\nCentral delegation visits residents in Inner Mongolia\n\nRescuers continue search in quake-hit Jiuzhaigou\n\nIn pics: magnificent landmarks of BRICS countries\n\nAt least one dead in car crash after violent rally in Virginia, U.S.", "time": "03:20:00"}

Nobody would have thought a British guy would ever beat the Kenyans and Ethiopians.\n\n\"I'm very proud to have achieved what I have achieved. It's been an incredible journey. I hope I can leave a legacy behind for the younger kids and show anything is possible in life if you stick at it.\n\n\"Sometimes, I get emotional because track is where I've made it.

10 successive global titles, including four 5,000m and 10,000m doubles - following his amazing transformation from an also-ran into Britain's most successful track-and-field athlete and an all-time great of distance running.\n\nWhat followed were questions about matters infinitely more in the public interest, and the consequences of them for his legacy, including his ongoing relationship with Alberto Salazar - still under investigation for alleged drugs offences - his links with Jama Aden - arrested last year in connection with a doping inquiry - and evidence he had been given medication that endangered his health.\n\nMo Farah reclaims the 'Mobot' on top of the London Eye 01:24\n\nNot mentioned were his two missed drugs tests before the 2012 Olympics, the failure of a British Athletics doctor to properly record his use of a restricted substance before the 2014 London Marathon, and documents leaked just last month in which he was named as \"likely doping\" before being cleared.\n\nThe 34-year-old, who the media have never accused of cheating, all but branded reports of these facts as fake news, saying: \"It's like a broken record, repeating myself. Why bring it up year after year, making it into headlines? I've achieved what I have achieved - you're trying to destroy it.\"\n\nHe added: \"You can write what you like. The fact is I've achieved what I have from hard work, putting my balls on the line, year after year and delivering for my country.\n\n\"There's nothing else to be said. History doesn't lie. I find it bizarre how certain people write certain things to suit how they want to sell the story.\n\nSir Mo Farah gets emotional after his 5,000m race 01:01\n\n\"Sometimes, you guys get to me - you never write the facts. The fact is, over the years, I have achieved a lot through hard work and pain. If I have crossed the line - 'Mo Farah has done something wrong' - then prove it.\"\n\nFarah was in no doubt how he saw his legacy, one of a Somalian refugee who repaid his adopted homeland with some of the greatest sporting feats in its history.\n\n\"I've done my country and many people proud,\" said Farah, who began his morning by performing his iconic 'Mobot' while perched atop one of the capsules on the London Eye.\n\n\"It makes me proud to be British, to put British distance running on the map.\n\n\"Growing up in Teddington and seeing the Kenyans and Ethiopians winning, I never thought, 'One day, we'll be able to challenge them and beat them at their own game'.\n\n\"I hope I can leave that legacy behind - and get behind younger British kids and see what we can do.\n\n\"It will take 10-15 years to get the next best distance runner in terms of winning medals. But we need to start somewhere.\"\n\nAfter two final farewell races on the track, Farah will switch to the road in a bid to end Britain's long wait for a male marathon champion.\n\n\"I don't like to keep still,\" he said. \"I want to continue on. I like the pain and the challenges of being an athlete. I think I can do something on the road. But I think it will take a few years and few marathons to get it right.\"\n\nRevealing he wanted to be known as Mohamed rather than Mo in future, he added: \"My road name is Mohamed and I just feel like Mo is done. I need to forget about what I've achieved and what I've done.\"\n\nFarah refused to be drawn on whether Salazar, who denies breaking anti-doping rules, would be part of that future, with the American conspicuous by his absence from London 2017.\n\n\"I haven't thought that far ahead,\" Farah said. \"I've a few races left, then I'll take a nice break and see how it goes.\"\n\nHe added: \"Either way, if he was here or not here, day after day, I'd still be putting my balls on the line.\"\n\nWith the questions he clearly did not like out of the way, the conversation switched to Farah's desire to pass on his experience to the next generation. But he could not resist a parting shot at those he accused of being out to get him.\n\n\"Over the years, you guys have done many things to build a person up and bring them back down,\" he said.\n\nBeating his chest, he added: \"The reality is, no matter what you do, I'm going to still keep fighting, keep working, making my country proud.\n\n\"I'm proud to be British and put my GB vest on and do it for my country. You can write what you like but, at the same time, I'm a clean athlete. I sleep well at night, hugging my kids, loving my kids, and showing them what's right. And that's all that counts.\"", "time": "14:00:00"}

"https://www.standard.co.uk/sport/other-sports/why-ultimate-winning-machine-mo-farah-has-become-one-of-the-greats-a3609721.html", "body": "Can we have some more please? It's the question we ask of all great performers in sport. We know you're great but do you think you could try to be a bit greater? It's the right question but it doesn't always get the right answer.\n\nIt's why Usain Bolt lost the other day. He was already as great as any sporting performer in history but what if he could be even greater? So he tried and he lost and lost nothing of his greatness... oh, all right, maybe a little.\n\nHow much greater can Mo Farah be? He won a brutal 10,000metres at the World Championships a few days ago -- tomorrow night he runs in the final of the 5,000m. He won both those events at the last two Olympic Games; only Lasse Viren has done that. He has gone from the Olympic Games to win the same distance double at the next World Championships; only Kenenisa Bekele has done that. Pretty fancy company, then.\n\nIn fact he has done the double at the last two World Championships and is half way to the hat-trick. If he pulls it off, it will be an unprecedented quintuple-double. Pretty fancy numbers.\n\nHow much greater do you want him to be? How much greater is it possible for an athlete to be?\n\nLord Coe said it wasn't enough. He'd like Farah to do another year on the track and devote himself to the pursuit of world records. That would \"close his CV once and for all,\" Coe said.\n\nNice idea, but Farah, now 34, plans devote the next few years to road racing. Coe's words will leave a sting, though, because he wasn't a bad track-runner himself and once set three world records in 41 days -- and also because Farah isn't close to the world record at either of his chosen distances.\n\nBut in distance running, setting world records is an entirely separate discipline to winning gold medals. If you win the Olympic 100m, you're never going to be far off the world record; the tactical 100m final has yet to be run. But if you want to set a world record for the 5k or the 10k, you do it outside the major championships, in a set-piece with pacemakers and a hefty financial incentive.\n\nAttempt a world record at a major championship and you lose. You just set the race up for someone else. You become one of those classic British fourth-place martyrs: heroic front-runners mercilessly picked off in the last 200m. Paula Radcliffe was just such a one, before she converted gloriously to the marathon; so for that matter was Farah, until he took up with his coach Alberto Salazar in 2011.\n\nUnder Salazar, Farah got physically stronger, better able to last a punishing pace with something in reserve and better able to stand the buffets and stumbles that are part of every crowded race. He worked on his finish, eradicating a tendency to overstride as he kicked for home.\n\nIn short, he made himself a perfect machine for winning. Never by much: always by enough, with a surge at 600 metres that brings despair to all but the finest and a kick at 150 that forces the finest to settle for second best. Not a speedster but a racer: a head-to-head man who loves the\n\nbrutalities of chess on the move in spiked footwear and relishes the who-blinks-first intensities of the duel.\n\nThat's where Farah's greatness as a runner operates: not in innocent visions of speed and perfection but down in the dirt, revelling in the struggle, committed to the idea that first is first and second is nowhere.\n\nWe saw every bit of that in the 10,000m last week, which Farah won in his fastest time for six years. The race involved a ferocious attempt to run the finish out of Farah and he responded by repeatedly floating up to the leaders, not to gain a place or two but to tell the leaders: I've got your number -- and you're not fast enough.\n\nBefore the final of the coxless pair at the 1996 Olympic Games, other crews were dreaming of at last beating the dominant pairing of Steve Redgrave and Matthew Pinsent. Before the start, Redgrave growled into Pinsent's ear: \"Let's crush some dreams.\"\n\nThey all dreamed of beating Farah in the 10K, so Farah's tactics were to tell them that he, too, is in the dream-crushing business. And at the finish -- tight, but not all that tight -- Farah was doing what he does best. Finishing a in front of all the others.\n\nSo how great is he? The greatest British runner of all time? You can seek objectivity by counting medals and records but, ultimately, it's one of those personal things. Can you do anything greater than redefine human possibilities, as Roger Bannister did when he ran the first sub-four-minute mile? Or tell a greater story of hope than Kelly\n\nHolmes, coming good at 35 to win the double Coe never managed?\n\nIn the end, such discussions are not about greatness but how you define it. When I was in the Olympic Stadium in London in 2012 and thousands of British people were cheering their guts out for a former Somali refugee named Mohammed -- well, it seemed that sport didn't get a lot greater.\n\nFive years on, much has changed in British life but at least we're still cheering for\n\nSir Mohamed Muktar Jama Farah: as great a British athlete as ever pulled on a pair of spikes.", "time": "12:36:00"}

The 34-year-old finished second in his 5,000 metres heat in 13 minutes 30.18 seconds and is now eyeing Saturday's final ahead of his planned track retirement at the end of the month.\n\nFarah has already won the 10,000m - Great Britain's only medal of the championships so far - to defend the title he won in 2013 and 2015.\n\nAnd a double defence is on the cards after Farah shrugged off a knee injury and a cut leg, having been spiked in his 10,000m triumph.\n\nLast night's heat was run in soaking conditions and Farah is wary of missing out on gold after Usain Bolt, retiring after the championships, only won bronze in the 100m on Saturday.\n\nHe said: \"You've seen it with Usain Bolt, it happens. It would have been nice to see him win but it didn't happen and no-one is going to give it to you, no matter who you are - even Usain Bolt.\n\n\"I just have to now focus on myself and get ready. It would be pretty amazing - no-one has ever done it. It would mean the world to me but at the same time I don't take it for granted.\n\n\"Those boys are coming for me, they are hungry. You could see in the heat, they wanted to prove a point and show me.\n\n\"I'm going to do it. You'll see me at the start line. I just have to recover.\n\n\"I'm cold, it's miserable out there but it's job done. I had to get back into some kind of running again. It's been five days of chilling out and recovering.\n\n\"The 10k did take a lot out of me and I'm a little beaten up but I'm okay.\"\n\nAndy Butchart also reached the 5,000m final while Nethaneel Mitchell-Blake was the only British sprinter to make tonight's 200m final.\n\nHe squeezed in as one of the fastest losers after running 20.19 seconds and coming third in his heat behind Botswana's Isaac Makwala who will go for gold after overcoming illness, quarantine and two races in little more than two hours to qualify for the 200 metres final.\n\nMakwala was controversially not allowed to take his place in the 400m final following illness.", "time": "10:17:00"}

"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2017/aug/11/mo-farah-5000-metres-world-athletics-championships", "body": "Whatever happens when Mo Farah steps on to the track for the final time at a major championships on Saturday night, he will leave it knowing no British athlete has been so staggeringly successful - or had their achievements so forcibly questioned. As he put it to one interrogator last month, when asked again about the continuing United States Anti-Doping Agency investigation into his coach, Alberto Salazar: \"It is getting boring now.\"\n\nWinning, however, is something Farah will never grow weary of. When he surged clear to take 10,000m gold last week it was his 11th consecutive world or Olympic title, going back to 2011. That is a remarkable record - especially when you consider his global dominance began only a few months shy of his 29th birthday.\n\nYet the steady supply of gold medals has never made him complacent. The bookmakers make him the overwhelming favourite for the 5,000m but he sees dangers lurking everywhere, and particularly from the Ethiopian trio of Yomif Kejelcha, Muktar Edris and Selemon Barega, and from Paul Chelimo, the American who ran him close during last year's Olympic final. \"I want to leave on a high but it is going to be tough,\" he said. \"There are a lot more guys in the 5,000m and a lot more decisions to be made in a shorter race.\n\n\"In the 10,000m you've got 25 laps so you can relax a little bit if you're further back. In the 5,000m, if you're not there at a certain point, or if someone's going to do something and you're not there, that's it - it's gone.\"\n\nFarah admitted this last big track race will be emotional but he is careful these days not to reveal too much of himself. The persistent drizzle of accusations about Salazar and his relationship with the controversial Somali coach Jama Aden, as well as the leak of some of his athlete biological passport data by the Russian hackers Fancy Bears, have made him more watchful and less carefree - at least in public.\n\nThose who know him well insist he is still the same athlete who once upon a time jumped off bridges for a bet and occasionally got into mischief. Certainly Farah, who was born in Somalia and moved to Britain when he was eight, has not forgotten how fortunate his journey has been.\n\n\"I think I'm a very lucky person in life,\" he said. \"I have a gift not many people have - to be able to know who I was and where I came from as a youngster. I don't think there's enough words to explain the journey and everything. But you have to appreciate what you have and do the best that I can. That's what I was taught in my early years. To appreciate it.\"\n\nHe had a simple answer when asked what - apart from hard work and luck - had kept him on top. \"To be honest, it is about staying hungry, staying humble, being nice, being normal, being who you are,\" he said. \"No one is going to change me.\"\n\nHis four Olympic gold medals were dedicated to each of his children. This one, he wants for his whole family. \"They are everything to me,\" he said. \"I love my four kids and I love my wife. They've been there through ups and downs throughout my career. If I'm going to close in London I wanted them to be a part of it to celebrate with me. That's what we do - we do everything together.\"\n\nFarah will soon have more time to spend with them. He has only two more races left on the track after London, in Birmingham next Sunday and in Zurich four days later - where he hopes to set a personal best over 5,000m - and then he will leave it all behind to become a pure road racer. According to track and field's rumour mill a one- or two-year deal with the London Marathon is also in the pipeline, although suggestions he will leave Salazar and form a new coaching team with the UK Athletics performance director, Neil Black, and the head of endurance, Barry Fudge, have been dismissed by all parties.\n\nIn the past Farah hinted at the prospect of running in the marathon at the Tokyo Olympics. Yet given his first attempt over 26.2 miles in 2014 was a modest 2:08.21 - over a minute outside Steve Jones's British record - there are some wise heads who would not be shocked by a return to the track in time for the 10,000m at the 2019 world championships.\n\nThat assumes, of course, his body holds up - and that he can still crank out a sub-50sec 400m in training, which is his personal barometer that he is in gold medal shape. Given he will be 36 in 2019, you would assume it would be beyond him. But, as his opponents have learned, Farah has a way of defying expectations.", "time": "21:00:00"}

previously winning gold in the 5,000 and 10,000 metre events in Moscow and Beijing.\n\nFarah, Great Britain's greatest-ever track and field athlete, is the favourite to once again take gold as he steps into the London Stadium in front of a raucous home crowd.\n\nHe took top spot on the podium in the 10,000m earlier in the week and will look to repeat the feat on a night where Usain Bolt also runs of the final time.\n\nHere is all you need to know ahead of the race...\n\nWhen is the race?\n\nFarah is set to hear the starting pistol for the last time at 20:20 BST.\n\nWhere can you watch the race?\n\nThe BBC and Eurosport both have rights to the World Championships in the UK. Although if you can't get in front of a screen, Mirror Sport will bring you all the action LIVE.\n\nIs there a stream?\n\nIf you are watching in the UK, and can't get to a television, the the BBC website will stream the whole evening of action live. Beware though, you need to have a TV license to watch.\n\nQuote corner\n\nFarah said: \"Those boys are coming for me - they are hungry.\n\n\"You could see in the heat, they wanted to prove a point and show me.\n\n\"It would be pretty amazing [to win my fourth World 5,000m title]\n\n\"No-one has ever done it. It would mean the world to me but at the same time I don't take it for granted.\n\n\"You've seen it with Usain Bolt. It would have been nice to see him win but it didn't happen and no-one is going to give it to you, no matter who you are, even Usain Bolt.\"\n\nWhat other events are on?\n\n17:30: Men's Javelin final (Decathlon Group A)\n\n18:55: Men's Javelin final (Decathlon Group B)\n\n19:05: Women's high jump final\n\n20:05: Women;s 100m hurdles final\n\n20:15: Men's Javelin final\n\n20:20: Men's 5,000m final\n\n20:45: Men's 1,500m final (Decathlon)\n\n21:30: Women's 4x100m relay final\n\n21:50: Men's 4x100m relay final\n\nBetting odds\n\nMo Farah 4/9\n\nYomif Kejelcha 6/1\n\nMuktar Edris 13/2\n\nSelemon Barega 15/2\n\nPaul Chelimo 14/1\n\npoll loading Will Mo Farah win the 5,000m title? 0+ VOTES SO FAR YES NO", "time": "14:16:00"}

to the ecstacy of the capacity London Stadium spectators, a never better redemption for the disappointing silver in the men's 5,000m.\n\nBolt, running the anchor leg, staggered halfway down the straight, dropping the baton before falling facing down. Dreaming of hanging up his running spikes as \"unbeatable\", the 11-time world champion and 8-time Olympic titlist limped across the finish line.\n\nBritish anchor runner Nethaneel Michell-Blake also dropped onto the ground, in blissful disbelief as his team took the important victory in world lead time of 37.47 seconds, beating the American squad, consisting of new 100m winner Justin Gatlin and runner-up Christian Coleman to the second place in 37.52. Japan took bronze in 38.04.\n\nBeijing worlds silver medalists China finished fourth with second-leg runner Xie Zhenye just coming back from injury.\n\nIt has been a rollercoaster night for the celebrating home fans when a couple of hours ago their emotion could only be described as disappointed.\n\nFarah failed in his quest for a fourth 5,000m world title in his farewell race just like Bolt as Ethiopian young gun Muktar Edris, 23, seized the glory from the 34-year-old.\n\n2012 world youth champion Edris produced a strong charge on the final stretch as Farah had to struggle out of the surrounding of Edris' fellow countrymen Yomif Kejelcha, 21, and 17-year-old Selemon Barega to put on a desperate final sprint but failed to catch up with the leader.\n\nEdris lifted his first ever major senior world title in 13:32.79, leaving two-time Olympic 5,000 titlist and newly crowned 10,000m winner Farah to the second place in 13:33.22. Paul Kipkemoi Chelimo of the United States took bronze in 13:33.30.\n\n\"I gave it everything,\" said Farah who initially curled up on the track in defeat and then was pulled up by Edris.\n\nLike Bolt, Farah would finish his career with an usual feeling of defeat -- he had won this event in the past three world championships and two Olympic Games, together with three world titles and two Olympic gold medals in 10,000m. However, he remains hero of the country, bagging one gold and one silver in London.\n\nWhile Farah handed out his long distance crown, the Ethiopians announced their coming.\n\nAlthough missing a podium finish, Kejelcha and this year's U18 3,000m winner Selemon Barega, who placed fourth and fifth respectively, have showed their potential.\n\nThe surpris also happened in the field event as Johannes Vetter of Germany grabbed his first ever medal at a major global competition, a golden one with his first attempt of 89.89 meters in javelin while defending champion Julius Yego and Olympic champion Thomas Rohler failed to deliver.\n\nJakub Vadlejch of Czech Republic finished second in 89.73m ahead of fellow countryman Petr Frydrych with 88.32m.\n\nRohler, from Germany, made a 88.26m throw in his second attempt and finished fourth while Beijing worlds winner Yego was eliminated after the first three rounds.\n\nIn other events, Russia's Maria Lasitskene, competing as the authorized neutral athlete, retained the women's high jump title as the 24-year-old cleared 2.03 meters for the gold medal. Ukraine's Yuliia Levchenko took silver in 2.01 and Poland's Kamila Licwinko was third in 1.99.\n\nLasitskene, who missed last year's Rio Olympics because of Russia's suspension, failed at 1.99 twice but regained form thereafter.\n\n\"My two failed attempts at 1.99m woke me up,\" she said. \"A gold medal here was my main goal for this season but certainly I would like to raise the bar a bit higher. I didn't like any one of my attempts at 2.08m.\" She challenged 2.08 three times but all failed.\n\nRio Olympic champions U.S. team regained the women's 4x100m world crown which last won at 2011 Daegu worlds as they sailed to victory in 41.82 seconds while hosts Britain gladly bagged a silver in 42.12. Defending champions Jamaica clocked 42.19 for the bronze.\n\nIn the women's 100m hurdles, Sally Pearson, who clinched the world title in 2011 and Olympic gold five years ago, clocked 12.59 seconds to win the first gold and only medal for Australia at the world championships by far. American Dawn Harper Nelson, who won the Olympic gold in Beijing and silver in London behind Pearson, took silver in 12.63. Germany's Pamela Dutkiewicz finished third in 12.72.\n\n\"It's been a long journey back from injury, but to get this moment and go and celebrate in front of my family is unreal,\" said Pearson, 30. \"This is just so incredible to be a world champion again.\"\n\nRio Olympic silver medalist Kevin Mayer claimed France's second gold from the men's decathlon with a total of 8,768 points. Germany's Rico Freimuth, bronze winner two years ago in the Beijing worlds, took silver in 8,564 points and his compatriot Kai Kazmirek won bronze in 8,488.", "time": "04:03:00"}

You guys have seen me since I was a child, running around, going to the English Schools. To come this far has been incredible.\n\n\"To be honest, what is keeping me on the top, it is about staying hungry, staying humble, being nice, being normal, being who you are. No one is going to change me.\"\n\nHis family joined him on the track after his 10,000m title win last Friday - the scene where he won the 5,000m and 10,000m at London 2012 - and he wants his four children and wife Tania to be part of his send-off.\n\nHe said: \"My family is everything to me. I love my kids and love my wife. They've been there through ups and downs throughout my career. If I'm going to close in London I wanted them to be a part of it to celebrate with me.\n\n\"That's what we do - we do everything together. For me, when I took my kids to the track that was beautiful. Five years ago who would have thought that the twins in mummy's tummy would be on the track?\n\n\"I think I'm a very lucky person in life. I have a gift that not many people have - to be able to know who I was and where I came from as a youngster.\n\n\"To have achieved what I have achieved has been incredible. I don't think there's enough words to explain the journey and everything. But you have to appreciate what you have and do the best that I can. That's what I was taught in my early years. Appreciate it.\"\n\nFarah will run in the Diamond League in Birmingham next Sunday before a final track race at the Diamond League final in Zurich on August 24.\n\nBut he is focused on the World Championships as he prepares to start the countdown to his marathon career.\n\n\"I want to leave on a high because that's the perfect note. But it isn't going to be easy in the 5k. It's going to be tough for me. There are a lot more guys,\" he said.\n\n\"There's a lot more decisions to be made in a shorter race. In the 10k you've got 25 laps so you can relax a little bit if you're further back to make that decision and work around.\n\n\"In the 5k, if you're not there at a certain point, or if someone's going to do something and you're not there, that's it - it's gone.\"", "time": "04:37:00"}

do it one mo' time? He's won every world or Olympic 5,000- and 10,000-meter title since the 5K at the 2011 world championships. Before every title defense, people offer theories about how to beat Farah, and either those tactics aren't tried, or they are, and fail. Farah says this will be his last global title race on the track, so between that and his competing in front of an adoring home crowd, somebody better have something special in store to unseat him.\n\nAny challenge is likely to come from a strong Ethiopian trio. Muktar Edris has the best time in the world this year, but he'll need to do something more than simply run fast to get rid of Farah. Yomif Kejelcha has challenged Farah a few times, and has a great kick, but he too will have to go above and beyond past attempts to win.\n\nThe wild card is Selemon Barega, who is reportedly 17 years old. He's won two world junior titles -- one just last month -- and joined the select sub-13:00 club this summer. In races like the men's 400-meter hurdles and women's 400 at this meet, rapidly improving youngsters have shocked big-name veterans with fearless why-the-heck-not racing. Barega might be bold enough to figure that it's time for Farah, who's twice his age, to make way for the new wave.\n\nAmerican Paul Chelimo won the Olympic silver medal behind Farah last summer. He had a rough qualifying race -- a few shoving incidents as well as a fall -- and might not be as fresh as he'd like. He's gutsy enough to go with any big move to break Farah early, and can also finish well. The other American, Ryan Hill, has a great kick, and will finish highest in a race where others let it come down to the last lap and a half.\n\nRELATED: How to Watch Track & Field\n\nWomen's (4:30 p.m. Eastern) and Men's (4:50 p.m.) 4 x 100-meter relays: If he's true to his word, this race will be Usain Bolt's last in a championship meet. Thanks in part to Bolt's unmatchable anchor legs, Jamaican men have won the last six global titles (four world championships, two Olympics). They also hold the world record.\n\nIn the 20th century, American men dominated this event, but they've struggled in recent years with dropped batons, botched handoffs, and other snafus that have either kept them from medaling in the final or, often, even reaching the final. The U.S. squad got the silver at Worlds four years ago, their only medal in the event since winning in 2007. Guys, just get the baton around the track, okay?\n\nThe U.S. women have done much better at keeping cool under pressure. They have the last two Olympic titles, but were beaten by Jamaica in the last two world championships. A big question for this year's U.S. prospects is the health of 100-meter champ Tori Bowie. She fell hard at the end of that race and withdrew from the 200.\n\nRW IN YOUR INBOX: Have the latest news, advice, and inspiration sent to you every day with our Runner's World Newsletters.\n\nWomen's 100-meter hurdles (3:05 p.m. Eastern): This event was a U.S. sweep at last year's Olympics. The winner there, Brianna Rollins, isn't running here, but world record-holder Kendra Harrison is, so that seems like a fair swap.\n\nAnother U.S. sweep is a tall order, even with four Americans in the final: Besides Harrison, Olympic silver medalist Nia Ali, fast-improving Christina Manning, and the ageless Dawn Harper Nelson, the 2008 Olympic champ, are on hand. The 2012 Olympic champion, Sally Pearson of Australia, is resurgent this year, with the second fastest time behind Harrison. Rushelle Burton of Jamaica, age 20, set her PR this year and is on the upswing.", "time": "12:54:00"}

Up to that point he had never won a senior international medal, but he grabbed silver in the 5,000\u2009metres and made it to the World Championships final a year later.\n\nBack then he was just a cheeky chap having a bit of fun. We are both huge Arsenal fans so we shared some banter over that and, like a lot of endurance runners, he was typically easy-going.\n\nWho would have thought that he'd go from my team-mate winning a first European silver to being on the verge of 11 successive global distance titles? I certainly never expected him to reach the dizzy heights of a four-time Olympic champion and if you asked him honestly, I imagine he would probably have said the same as well.\n\nIt's a shame that he is leaving the track after these World Championships because he has shown that he is still good enough to win medals on the biggest stage.The 5,000m looks like it will be tougher than the 10,000m last week, but it's impossible to predict anything other than a victory, which would be the perfect send-off for him.\n\nMo Farah's career so far - in 60 seconds 01:03\n\nWhen you come to the end of your career, people start assessing what you have achieved and the impact you have had. Will Farah ever truly be regarded as a legend of the sport? I don't think he can be, because he's never broken one of the major world records.\n\nThat is something that has eluded him and it is vital to being deemed a legend. Usain Bolt is undoubtedly a legend because he has broken so many records, in addition to winning gold medals. Farah, on the other hand, is certainly one of the great athletes, but I don't think it is possible to classify him as a legend because he hasn't broken the records that his predecessors set.\n\nFarah's career is always going to be clouded in some level of controversy because of his coach and his training partners. Maybe the general public won't really care about those things and they don't particularly want to know about it - they just want to support their hero.\n\nIt is a shame for Farah, but I do remain unsure of the situation with his coach.\n\nDoing things like not speaking openly before the World Championships doesn't help Farah either. Everyone else did it, so why shouldn't he? British Athletics wanted him to speak, but he - or the PR company that he hires - chose not to.\n\nI don't doubt him because I do think he has integrity.\n\nI haven't really had much contact with him over the past six years since I retired, but the person that I knew before had full integrity and was honest in what he did.\n\nSo I have to believe that is the case now. What is certain is that his success has done a lot for the sport in Britain. He's brought back a sense of excitement that there was in the early 1980s with the likes of Seb Coe and Steve Ovett.\n\nOur long-distance running is starting to rebuild and Mo's presence is bringing more fans to it. I'm sure a lot of them are fans of Farah rather than fans of the sport, but he has brought them to athletics tracks and hopefully they will stay once he has gone.\n\nThere is no doubt he has done our sport proud and I'd like to see him win one more medal for Britain tonight.\n\nIf he does that and doubles our medal tally in London it will be fantastic.", "time": "07:16:00"}

The London World Championships just can't stop popping up surprises which could hardly be pleasant memories for Jamaican great Usain Bolt and home hero Mohamed Farah who both bid farewell to their careers.\n\nIn his last race of his career, Bolt limped off the track while hosts Britain took the stunning 4x100m victory to the ecstacy of the capacity London Stadium spectators, a never better redemption for the disappointing silver in the men's 5,000m.\n\nBolt, running the anchor leg, staggered halfway down the straight, dropping the baton before falling facing down. Dreaming of hanging up his running spikes as \"unbeatable\", the 11-time world champion and 8-time Olympic titlist limped across the finish line.\n\nBritish anchor runner Nethaneel Michell-Blake also dropped onto the ground, in blissful disbelief as his team took the important victory in world lead time of 37.47 seconds, beating the American squad, consisting of new 100m winner Justin Gatlin and runner-up Christian Coleman to the second place in 37.52. Japan took bronze in 38.04.\n\nBeijing worlds silver medalists China finished fourth with second-leg runner Xie Zhenye just coming back from injury.\n\nIt has been a rollercoaster night for the celebrating home fans when a couple of hours ago their emotion could only be described as disappointed.\n\nFarah failed in his quest for a fourth 5,000m world title in his farewell race just like Bolt as Ethiopian young gun Muktar Edris, 23, seized the glory from the 34-year-old.\n\n2012 world youth champion Edris produced a strong charge on the final stretch as Farah had to struggle out of the surrounding of Edris' fellow countrymen Yomif Kejelcha, 21, and 17-year-old Selemon Barega to put on a desperate final sprint but failed to catch up with the leader.\n\nEdris lifted his first ever major senior world title in 13:32.79, leaving two-time Olympic 5,000 titlist and newly crowned 10,000m winner Farah to the second place in 13:33.22. Paul Kipkemoi Chelimo of the United States took bronze in 13:33.30.\n\n\"I gave it everything,\" said Farah who initially curled up on the track in defeat and then was pulled up by Edris.\n\nLike Bolt, Farah would finish his career with an usual feeling of defeat -- he had won this event in the past three world championships and two Olympic Games, together with three world titles and two Olympic gold medals in 10,000m. However, he remains hero of the country, bagging one gold and one silver in London.\n\nWhile Farah handed out his long distance crown, the Ethiopians announced their coming.\n\nAlthough missing a podium finish, Kejelcha and this year's U18 3,000m winner Selemon Barega, who placed fourth and fifth respectively, have showed their potential.\n\nThe surpris also happened in the field event as Johannes Vetter of Germany grabbed his first ever medal at a major global competition, a golden one with his first attempt of 89.89 meters in javelin while defending champion Julius Yego and Olympic champion Thomas Rohler failed to deliver.\n\nJakub Vadlejch of Czech Republic finished second in 89.73m ahead of fellow countryman Petr Frydrych with 88.32m.\n\nRohler, from Germany, made a 88.26m throw in his second attempt and finished fourth while Beijing worlds winner Yego was eliminated after the first three rounds.\n\nIn other events, Russia's Maria Lasitskene, competing as the authorized neutral athlete, retained the women's high jump title as the 24-year-old cleared 2.03 meters for the gold medal. Ukraine's Yuliia Levchenko took silver in 2.01 and Poland's Kamila Licwinko was third in 1.99.\n\nLasitskene, who missed last year's Rio Olympics because of Russia's suspension, failed at 1.99 twice but regained form thereafter.\n\n\"My two failed attempts at 1.99m woke me up,\" she said. \"A gold medal here was my main goal for this season but certainly I would like to raise the bar a bit higher. I didn't like any one of my attempts at 2.08m.\" She challenged 2.08 three times but all failed.\n\nRio Olympic champions U.S. team regained the women's 4x100m world crown which last won at 2011 Daegu worlds as they sailed to victory in 41.82 seconds while hosts Britain gladly bagged a silver in 42.12. Defending champions Jamaica clocked 42.19 for the bronze.\n\nIn the women's 100m hurdles, Sally Pearson, who clinched the world title in 2011 and Olympic gold five years ago, clocked 12.59 seconds to win the first gold and only medal for Australia at the world championships by far. American Dawn Harper Nelson, who won the Olympic gold in Beijing and silver in London behind Pearson, took silver in 12.63. Germany's Pamela Dutkiewicz finished third in 12.72.\n\n\"It's been a long journey back from injury, but to get this moment and go and celebrate in front of my family is unreal,\" said Pearson, 30. \"This is just so incredible to be a world champion again.\"\n\nRio Olympic silver medalist Kevin Mayer claimed France's second gold from the men's decathlon with a total of 8,768 points. Germany's Rico Freimuth, bronze winner two years ago in the Beijing worlds, took silver in 8,564 points and his compatriot Kai Kazmirek won bronze in 8,488.\n\nCentral delegation visits residents in Inner Mongolia\n\nIn pics: magnificent landmarks of BRICS countries\n\nLocal community organizes donation event to aid Jiuzhaigou in Hefei\n\nSilk Road Chinese Ethno Music Festival held in Pula, Croatia", "time": "23:08:00"}

And this morning he waved farewell to track athletics in Britain in the most dramatic of fashion - atop the London Eye.\n\nThe four-time Olympic champion failed to mount a third defence of his 5,000m title as Ethiopia's Muktar Edris claimed gold in London on Saturday. Edris even had the audacity to celebrate with a 'Mobot' inside London Stadium.\n\nFarah, though, reclaimed his iconic pose by climbing to the very top of the London Eye on a bright, crisp morning and producing a 'Mobot' to the whole capital.\n\nFarah, who had already won the 10,000m last week, had not lost a final in 2,176 days.\n\nThe 34-year-old collapsed to the track after the race and covered his face before being hauled to his feet.\n\nHe is due to retire from the track at the end of the month, after the Diamond League final in Zurich, to focus on the marathon, and conceded he was overcome in the London Stadium.\n\nHe said: \"I had tears in my eyes, I've never had that before. It's been an amazing journey. To end it in London, where it all started, I got a bit emotional.\n\n\"I look at my family, what I've done and it gets to you. At the end of the day I'm human and it hasn't all been a smooth ride.\n\n\"If I had it perfect it would have been nice to end in double double but anything is possible. At some point it has to come to an end.\n\n\"I always told myself London is where it started and London was where it was going to stop. I was known as normal Mo and then overnight after London I was 'Mo', I couldn't go anywhere. To finish here is a nice thing.\n\n\"I know myself when I crossed the line there was nothing left of me, nothing. I gave my all. Over the years it has worked and I crossed the line first, but not tonight.\"", "time": "09:14:00"}

despite missing out on a fairytale finale.\n\nThe 34-year-old signed off at the World Championships in London on Saturday with a silver medal in the 5,000 metres, and his next challenge will be road races including marathons.\n\nEthiopia's Muktar Edris denied Farah the dream double after the Great Britain star had already won the 10,000m title last week.\n\nFarah, who has won 10 global titles including an Olympic double at London 2012, will retire from the track following the Diamond League final in Zurich on August 24 and is content with his decision.\n\n\"To continue until 2017, it's been amazing. London is where it all happened. It changed my life and my career,\" said the four-time Olympic champion, who will race at Birmingham's Diamond League meet next weekend.\n\n\"No matter what I do in life, it will never be the same. I will sadly miss that. But it is time to make a move. I want to be able to close that chapter in my life. I've done my country and many people proud. It makes me proud to be British.\n\n\"For many years... growing up in Teddington and seeing the Kenyans and Ethiopians winning I never thought, 'One day, we'll be able to challenge them and beat them at their own game'.\n\n\"You remember Haile Gebrselassie, Paul Tergat, they were winning for many years. Nobody would have thought a British guy would ever beat the Kenyans and Ethiopians.\n\n\"I'm very proud to have achieved what I have achieved. It's been an incredible journey. I hope I can leave a legacy behind for the younger kids and show anything is possible in life if you stick at it.\n\n\"Sometimes, I get emotional because track is where I've made it. I won obviously at London 2012. The following week, when the Olympics had finished, I was known worldwide.\"\n\nFarah insisted he has no intention of returning to the track but admitted he needed a wake-up call about possible retirement at the Great Edinburgh Cross Country in January after finishing seventh.\n\n\"I honestly thought there was a point in my life where, in January, I mentally wasn't ready. I was training at home, just enjoying life and other stuff,\" he said.\n\n\"Edinburgh gave me a wake-up call over 'Do I want to be an athlete and carry on?', because I wasn't ready for that race. I knew it was going to take a block of high extra training.\n\n\"Do I wake up and go, 'I'll give it one more year on the track'? And that's what I did. I gave it everything I could. That's part of me.\n\n\"But now the track is finished. I don't like to keep still. I want to continue on. I like the pain and the challenges of being an athlete.\n\n\"I think can do something on the road. But I think it will take a few years and few marathons to get it right.\"\n\nAP", "time": "14:44:00"}

But roared on and implored on by an expectant crowd it was not to be.\n\nAnd that, quite simply, is sport, fairytale endings, as we've learned so spectacularly in recent days, don't come as standard.\n\nFarah narrowly missed out on a remarkable fifth consecutive major championships distance double in London but don't say he settled for silver. Farah isn't the sort to settle for anything.\n\nIt had been 2176 days since his last defeat on the track in a major championship final. In that time he'd won four Olympic, six world and three European titles. He had secured his place in the pantheon of his sport and the hearts of his nation.\n\nBut in the end time - and his rivals - simply caught up with the greatest track athlete Britain has ever produced.\n\nPerhaps the exertions of his brilliant win in the World Championship 10,000m took their toll as the 34-year old couldn't respond to the late injection of pace from Ethiopia's Muktar Edris - whose tactics were straight out the Farah playbook and who secured the world 5,000m title.\n\nBut while the gold dream faded, Farah didn't. Beaten but not down, he kicked again on the home straight to snatch silver ahead of the USA's Paul Chelimo while team-mate Andrew Butchart finished eighth.\n\nHe will have two more races on the track, in Birmingham and Zurich, before he sets his sights on the road, but his place in history is long secure.\n\n\"I gave it my all, I had nothing left,\" he said.\n\n\"The 10,000m took a lot more out of me than I had realised. They had a game plan and that was that one was going to sacrifice themselves, but I gave it my all.\n\n\"I didn't have a single thing left to give at the end. I got boxed in and couldn't get out.\n\n\"I remember in 2008, being so disappointed and not sure whether to carry on with the sport or not. I had to decide what it took to become a champion and that was to move to the other side of the world. Nothing was guaranteed but I took that chance.\n\n\"I have a few more races on the track and then I will take a short break and then this chapter of my life is closed. It's a very special night. It's been amazing but it's been a long journey. It didn't quite hit home until I took a few moments to myself where I realised this is it.\"\n\nElsewhere, Katarina Johnson-Thompson certainly salvaged some pride - but fell just short of her medal ambition with a fifth place in the women's high jump final.\n\nThe British record holder equalled her season's best with a 1.95 metre effort but couldn't get over 1.97m, which would have been just a centimetre under her personal best from last year's Rio Olympics.\n\nHowever, in a high-quality final, the 24-year old would have needed to jump higher than she ever has before to make the podium.\n\nRussia's Maria Lasitskene, competing as a neutral athlete, defended her title with a clearance of 2.03m while Ukraine's Yuliia Levchenko took silver ahead of Poland's Kamila Licwinko. Johnson-Thompson's British team-mate Morgan Lake finished sixth.\n\n\"It was close but not close enough but when I reflect I've got to be happy with that in my first-ever high jump final,\" she said.\n\n\"I felt pretty fatigued in the warm-up and my legs are pretty tired. It's been a long week but I'm not making excuses. I'm glad I got to bounce back and show that I'm not a quitter, I know I can do a good heptathlon and I'll get there one day and there's always next year.\"", "time": "20:42:00"}

turn five twin daughters Aisha and Amani had never seen him lose a major final before Saturday.\n\n\"He curled into the foetal position at the finish, beaten in a major final for the first time in six years,\" wrote the correspondent.\n\n\"Silver on this occasion stung like defeat and salt was rubbed into open wounds by his conqueror, Muktar Edris of Ethiopia, performing the iconic Mobot at the

Farah's unbeatable air could not stand up to another examination by the world's best distance runners as he was denied one final global triumph in his farewell championship track race on Saturday.\n\nAs the Briton was consoled - and congratulated on a peerless track career - by his competitors following his world 5,000 metres silver in the stadium where his legend was first properly sculpted in 2012, the only question that remained was where he stands in the annals of track distance running.\n\nThere is a powerful argument to say, after 10 straight global championship victories stretching back to the 2011 world 5,000 metres triumph in Daegu, that the 34-year-old is the greatest distance racer we have ever seen on the track.\n\nDespite his defeat on Saturday, his ability, time and again, to fend off every challenge and tactic thrown at him -- from Ethiopian and Kenyan athletes ganging up on him to being spiked and bruised in physical races - and still sprint to victory was unprecedented during an incredible six-year reign.\n\nHis ability to strike for home with that long, loping stride, anywhere from 600 metres to 100 metres out - and then to find yet another gear when it seemed as if he was flat out - marked him as a unique talent.\n\nYet being considered the best racer is very different from being seen as the greatest distance athlete of all-time.\n\nSebastian Coe, the IAAF President and a massive fan of Farah, set the ball rolling when declaring in Friday's Evening Standard newspaper that Haile Gebrselassie was the greatest.\n\n\"When it comes to the debate on the greatest distance runner of all time, I'm tough on this,\" said Coe, who himself is in the shake-up for the title best middle-distance runner of them all.\n\n\"For me, it's not Mo Farah -- and that's not to do a disservice to Mo, who is one of the greats of all time.\n\n\"For me that still has to be Haile Gebrselassie, for the distances that he covered, the titles he won and the world records he broke.\"\n\nIn championship running, Farah won 10 on the trot before Saturday's setback, compared with Gebrselassie's six in a row at 10,000 metres and Kenenisa Bekele's best run of four championship wins in succession at both distances.\n\nYet the two Ethiopian greats also went chasing records to extraordinary effect, Bekele setting a total of three new world marks at 5,000m and 10,000m and Gebrselassie seven at the two events.\n\nFarah has never been down that route, with his capacity for really fast times never examined.\n\nIt remains an extraordinary fact that the most successful championship runner ever at 5,000m with five global titles, is ranked only the 31st-fastest runner of all time, at 12 minutes 53.11 seconds. Bekele holds the world record at 12:37.35.\n\nAt 10,000 metres, in which Farah has also won a record five global golds, he is also still only the 16th-fastest (26:46.57), nearly half a minute down on Bekele's world record of 26:17.53.\n\nBekele, a year older than Farah at 35, won nine global golds, once went unbeaten for eight years at 10,000 metres, won 11 world cross-country titles and now holds the second-fastest marathon time in history (2 hours 3 minutes 3 seconds).\n\nFor the moment, even if Gebrselassie was the great Ethiopian trailblazer, it seems fair to rank Bekele the highest for his all-round achievements on the track, country and roads.\n\nYet Farah, who has run only one marathon, finishing eighth in London in 2014 in a relatively modest 2:08:21, believes he can make a big impact on the roads.\n\nThe most amazing tale in the annals of British athletics may not quite have run its course yet.\n\nAs Farah, who admitted to being tearful after an amotional night, said after his race: \"As I'm getting older, it's getting a bit more challenging and that's the reason I'm going to end on the track and see what I can do on the roads.\n\n\"This is end of in terms of major championships, I'm done. I've closed that chapter of my life. I want to start a new challenge in my life.\" (Editing by Ed Osmond)", "time": "22:39:00"}

I've been given a chance in life.\n\nIn between the drama involving norovirus and Botswana's Isaac Makwala have been a series of unusual races, favorites who didn't come through and unknowns who did.\n\nWhere he came from was war-torn Somalia, arriving in Britain as an eight-year-old who could not speak much English to join his father.\n\nThe 27-year-old clocked 13 minute 35.69 second, almost one second better than his earlier personal best of 13:36.62, in the first round heat number one which earned him a 15th spot in a top class field, featuring defending champion Mo Farah from Great Britain.\n\nSir Mo Farah vowed he will be ready for the 5,000 metres final despite admitting he is feeling the pain.\n\nThen came the move to OR to team up with coach Alberto Salazar and the transformation has been nothing less than spectacular.\n\nDafne Schippers of the Netherlands successfully defended her world title in the 200, winning in 22.05. He could've produced the first 200-400 sweep at the worlds since Michael Johnson did it 22 years ago.\n\nHe now has five European outdoor golds and two European indoor crowns. He will take part in Diamond League races in Birmingham and Zurich, but as far as meaningful exercises, this final in London is it.\n\nHe told the BBC: \"I'm still running heartbroken\". But you have to appreciate what you have and do the best that I can. \"I only stayed one night\".\n\n\"I want to leave on a high because that's the ideal note\".\n\nFarah said: 'It isn't going to be easy in the 5k. His effort was all the more impressive as the race was run under incessant rain which lashed the Olympic Stadium throughout the day, forcing a drop in temperature to below 15 degrees Celsius.", "time": "22:00:00"}

an undisputed legend of the track in terms of titles won, but to many his association with coach Alberto Salazar will forever cast a unwanted pall on his career.\n\nThe 34-year-old Somalia-born champion stuck with Salazar despite serious allegations against him which he strenuously denied and have never been proven, but refuse to go away.\n\nA dejected Mo Farah after finishing second in the Men's 5000m. AP\n\nHowever, the contrast to the universal adoration showered on fellow legend Usain Bolt who also bid farewell to championship racing is stark.\n\nFarah certainly got cheered to the rafters when he won his two Olympic and world gold and silver medals in London and has been ennobled by Queen Elizabeth II in recognition of his achievements.\n\nBut despite the plethora of golds and breaking up the hegemony of the Kenyans and Ethiopians in the events, a real barometer of his popular standing in the United Kingdom is reflected by the BBC Sports Personality of the Year award which is voted on by the public.\n\nOn only one occasion, in 2011, has he reached the top three, something British triathlon great Alistair Brownlee put down to him not being considered British.\n\n\"It's really sad, because for me he is the perfect British story,\" Brownlee told The Guardian last December.\n\n\"It's what we should be about: a person who comes to Britain as a young man, as a refugee, and an ex\u2011schoolteacher (Alan Watkinson) identifies something that he's brilliant at and he represents Britain as the best in the world.\"\n\nFarah shrugs off the constant snubs saying he always gets a great reception from the crowds at the British meetings.\n\nHe rightly points out his voyage from war-torn Somalia to arriving in England, via a spell with his grandparents in Djibouti, with his mother Amran and two of his five siblings (brothers Ahmed and Wahib but not his twin Hassan who was too ill to travel and they would not see each other for 12 years) as an eight-year-old boy and his subsequent success is what will remain with him.\n\n\"Just knowing where I grew up, where I come from, the journey I have taken,\" he told The Sun last year.\n\n'A new world'\n\nFarah, whose mother brought him and his siblings to join their father Muktar who is an IT consultant but divorced soon afterwards leaving for Brighton with Farah's two brothers, for his part found England a beguiling place.\n\n\"I remember walking in, and the doors opened, and there were escalators,\" he told The Big Issue magazine.\n\n\"It was fascinating for me as a child. A new world -- like when I went to Disneyland. And for me, it was where my family was, so it was home.\"\n\nHis mum though was the parent that Farah -- who had to live with his aunt Kinsi when they settled in England -- felt closest to, a similarity he shares with Bolt who also described himself as a 'mummy's boy'.\n\n\"I was always a happy kid, up for laughs, joking around,\" said Farah, who makes a show of running to his wife Tania and their four children -- including twin girls Aisha and Amani -- at the end of finals.\n\n\"And I always had that cheeky smile.\n\n\"If I was causing trouble I could get away with it because of that. I used it on my mum quite a lot. I was a lot closer to my mum than my dad. I'm a mummy's boy really.\"\n\nIf there is a dream to realise as he winds down his career it is to spend more time with Hassan and he described movingly in his biography what it meant when he finally was reunited with him in 2003.\n\n\"It felt like a part of me had been missing the whole time I had been growing up separately from Hassan.\n\n\"At last, the void in my life was gone.\"\n\nThe void he leaves in track distance running is immeasurable.\n\nPublished Date: Aug 13, 2017 02:55 pm | Updated Date: Aug 13, 2017 02:56 pm\n\nTags :#Alberto salazar#Alistair brownlee#Athletics#England#Great britain#Iaaf world championships 2017#London#Mo farah#Usain bolt", "time": "09:58:00"}

"body": "Right at the last, Mo Farah's unbeatable air could not stand up to another examination by the world's best distance runners as he was denied one final global triumph in his farewell championship track race on Saturday.\n\nAs the Briton was consoled -- and congratulated on a peerless track career -- by his competitors following his world 5,000 metres silver in the stadium where his legend was first properly sculpted in 2012, the only question that remained was where he stands in the annals of track distance running.\n\nThere is a powerful argument to say, after 10 straight global championship victories stretching back to the 2011 world 5,000 metres triumph in Daegu, that the 34-year-old is the greatest distance racer we have ever seen on the track.\n\nDespite his defeat on Saturday, his ability, time and again, to fend off every challenge and tactic thrown at him -- from Ethiopian and Kenyan athletes ganging up on him to being spiked and bruised in physical races -- and still sprint to victory was unprecedented during an incredible six-year reign.\n\nHis ability to strike for home with that long, loping stride, anywhere from 600 metres to 100 metres out -- and then to find yet another gear when it seemed as if he was flat out -- marked him as a unique talent.\n\nYet being considered the best racer is very different from being seen as the greatest distance athlete of all-time.\n\nSeb Coe, the president of the IAAF and a massive fan of Farah, set the ball rolling when declaring in Friday's Evening Standard newspaper that Haile Gebrselassie was the greatest.\n\n\"When it comes to the debate on the greatest distance runner of all time, I'm tough on this,\" said Coe, who himself is in the shake-up for the title best middle-distance runner of them all.\n\n\"For me, it's not Mo Farah -- and that's not to do a disservice to Mo, who is one of the greats of all time.\n\n\"For me that still has to be Haile Gebrselassie, for the distances that he covered, the titles he won and the world records he broke.\"\n\nIn championship running, Farah won 10 on the trot before Saturday's setback, compared with Gebrselassie's six in a row at 10,000 metres and Kenenisa Bekele's best run of four championship wins in succession at both distances.\n\nYet the two Ethiopian greats also went chasing records to extraordinary effect, Bekele setting a total of three new world marks at 5,000m and 10,000m and Gebrselassie seven at the two events.\n\nFarah has never been down that route, with his capacity for really fast times never examined.\n\nIt remains an extraordinary fact that the most successful championship runner ever at 5,000m with five global titles, is ranked only the 31st-fastest runner of all time, at 12 minutes 53.11 seconds. Bekele holds the world record at 12:37.35.\n\nAt 10,000 metres, in which Farah has also won a record five global golds, he is also still only the 16th-fastest (26:46.57), nearly half a minute down on Bekele's world record of 26:17.53.\n\nBekele, a year older than Farah at 35, won nine global golds, once went unbeaten for eight years at 10,000 metres, won 11 world cross-country titles and now holds the second-fastest marathon time in history (2 hours 3 minutes 3 seconds).\n\nFor the moment, even if Gebrselassie was the great Ethiopian trailblazer, it seems fair to rank Bekele the highest for his all-round achievements on the track, country and roads.\n\nYet Farah, who has run only one marathon, finishing eighth in London in 2014 in a relatively modest 2:08:21, believes he can make a big impact on the roads.\n\nThe most amazing tale in the annals of British athletics may not quite have run its course yet.\n\n(This article has not been edited by DNA's editorial team and is auto-generated from an agency feed.)", "time": "21:27:00"}

Usain Bolt's final track appearance ended with pain and frustration on Saturday as he pulled up injured running the final leg of the World Championships 4x100 metres relay as Britain stunned the United States to win a shock gold medal.\n\nBolt, who had to settle for bronze in the individual 100 metres, had been hoping to sign off from the sport by leading Jamaica to a fifth successive world relay title but they were struggling in a distant third place when he collected the baton.\n\nJamaica's Usain Bolt grimaces after injuring himself during the men's 4x100m final. AP\n\nMeanwhile, Maria Lasitskene became the first Russian to win a gold medal at the World Championships in London after successfully defending her high jump title on Saturday.\n\nThe 24-year-old, competing as an authorised neutral athlete, stretched her unbeaten streak to 25 competitions by clearing 2.03 metres to triumph in the London Stadium.\n\nAnother athlete who couldn't close out his career on a high was Mo Farah, whose aura of invincibility after six years of unrelenting success was finally cracked in his very last major track race on Saturday as he lost his world 5,000 metres title to Ethiopia's Muktar Edris.\n\nSeeking a fitting end to his matchless long-distance racing career before moving to marathon running, the 34-year-old Briton's bid for a fifth straight global 10,000/5,000m double was scuppered as he had to settle for the silver.\n\nYet even in defeat, Farah demonstrated his champion's spirit as he fought back in the dying metres when it looked as if he would be shut out of the medals completely.\n\nIn a thrilling finale featuring four athletes careering towards the line, Farah snatched back second place behind Edris, who clocked 13 minutes 32.79 seconds after a searing final lap of 52.6 seconds.\n\n\"I gave it all but I had nothing left at the end,\" a crestfallen and emotional Farah said.\n\nIn 4x100 metres women's relay, Tori Bowie anchored the United States to victory in the women's 4x100 metres relay at the World Championships on Saturday.\n\nIt was the sixth time the US have won the event and the gold was a record 15th World Championship medal for Allyson Felix, who ran the second leg.\n\nWe are on top of the world,\" Bowie said. \"I am grateful to be able to run and bring these ladies home to the gold. It has been a mixed week but two gold medals is amazing for me.\"\n\nBowie was shadowed all the way to the line by Briton Daryll Neita who led her team to silver, in 42.12, ahead of 2015 champions Jamaica who were missing their usual anchor runner in Shelly-Ann Fraser-Pryce.\n\nIn men's javelin, Johannes Vetter made up for just missing out on an Olympic medal last year when the he won the javelin at the World Athletics Championships on Saturday as his great rival and Olympic champion Thomas Roehler finished off the podium.\n\nCzech Republic pair Jakub Vadlejch, coached by world record holder Jan Zelezny, and Petr Frydrych threw personal bests of 89.73 and 88.32 metres respectively to take silver and bronze.\n\nVetter's opening throw of 89.89 was enough to win the gold and the 24-year-old was overcome with emotion after clinching the title which was confirmed after Vadlejch's last throw.\n\nHere is the IAAF World Athletics Championships 2017 medal tally after Day 9\n\nRank Country Gold Silver Medal Total 1 United States 9 10 8 27 2 Kenya 3 1 4 8 3 Poland 2 2 3 7 4 Ethiopia 2 2 0 4 4 Great Britain & N.I 2 2 0 4 6 South Africa 2 1 2 5 7 France 2 0 1 3 8 Authorised Neutral Athlete 1 3 0 4 9 Germany 1 2 2 5 10Pr Of China 1 2 1 4 11 Czech Republic 1 1 1 3 12 Bahrain 1 1 0 2 12 Turkey 1 1 0 2 14 Jamaica 1 0 3 4 15 Netherlands 1 0 2 3 16 Venezuela 1 0 1 2 17 Norway 1 0 0 1 17 Belgium 1 0 0 1 17 Greece 1 0 0 1 17 New Zealand 1 0 0 1 17 Australia 1 0 0 1 17 Lithuania 1 0 0 1 23 Cote D'ivoire 0 2 0 2 24 Bahamas 0 1 1 2 24 Hungary 0 1 1 2 26 Ukraine 0 1 0 1 26 Uganda 0 1 0 1 26 Sweden 0 1 0 1 26 Colombia 0 1 0 1 26 Morocco 0 1 0 1 31 Kazakhstan 0 0 1 1 31 Japan 0 0 1 1 31 Tanzania 0 0 1 1 31 Trinidad And Tobago 0 0 1 1 31 Croatia 0 0 1 1 31 Qatar 0 0 1 1 31 Cuba 0 0 1 1 31 Portugal 0 0 1 1\n\nCatch Firstpost's live blog of Day 10 of IAAF World Athletics Championships 207 here\n\nWith inputs from Reuters\n\nPublished Date: Aug 13, 2017 12:35 pm | Updated Date: Aug 13, 2017 12:35 pm\n\nTags :#Britain#Czech republic#Iaaf world championships 2017#Jakub vadlejch#Johannes vetter#London#Maria lasitskene#Mo farah#Muktar edris#Thomas roehler#United states#Usain bolt", "time": "07:24:00"}

Right at the last, Mo Farah's unbeatable air could not stand up to another examination by the world's best distance runners as he was denied one final global triumph in his farewell championship track race on Saturday.\n\nAs the Briton was consoled -- and congratulated on a peerless track career -- by his competitors following his world 5,000 metres silver in the stadium where his legend was first properly sculpted in 2012, the only question that remained was where he stands in the annals of track distance running.\n\nThere is a powerful argument to say, after 10 straight global championship victories stretching back to the 2011 world 5,000 metres triumph in Daegu, that the 34-year-old is the greatest distance racer we have ever seen on the track.\n\nDespite his defeat on Saturday, his ability, time and again, to fend off every challenge and tactic thrown at him -- from Ethiopian and Kenyan athletes ganging up on him to being spiked and bruised in physical races -- and still sprint to victory was unprecedented during an incredible six-year reign.\n\nHis ability to strike for home with that long, loping stride, anywhere from 600 metres to 100 metres out -- and then to find yet another gear when it seemed as if he was flat out -- marked him as a unique talent.\n\nYet being considered the best racer is very different from being seen as the greatest distance athlete of all-time.\n\nSeb Coe, the president of the IAAF and a massive fan of Farah, set the ball rolling when declaring in Friday's Evening Standard newspaper that Haile Gebrselassie was the greatest.\n\n\"When it comes to the debate on the greatest distance runner of all time, I'm tough on this,\" said Coe, who himself is in the shake-up for the title best middle-distance runner of them all.\n\n\"For me, it's not Mo Farah - and that's not to do a disservice to Mo, who is one of the greats of all time.\n\n\"For me that still has to be Haile Gebrselassie, for the distances that he covered, the titles he won and the world records he broke.\"\n\nIn championship running, Farah won 10 on the trot before Saturday's setback, compared with Gebrselassie's six in a row at 10,000 metres and Kenenisa Bekele's best run of four championship wins in succession at both distances.\n\nYet the two Ethiopian greats also went chasing records to extraordinary effect, Bekele setting a total of three new world marks at 5,000m and 10,000m and Gebrselassie seven at the two events.\n\nFarah has never been down that route, with his capacity for really fast times never examined.\n\nIt remains an extraordinary fact that the most successful championship runner ever at 5,000m with five global titles, is ranked only the 31st-fastest runner of all time, at 12 minutes 53.11 seconds. Bekele holds the world record at 12:37.35.\n\nAt 10,000 metres, in which Farah has also won a record five global golds, he is also still only the 16th-fastest (26:46.57), nearly half a minute down on Bekele's world record of 26:17.53.\n\nBekele, a year older than Farah at 35, won nine global golds, once went unbeaten for eight years at 10,000 metres, won 11 world cross-country titles and now holds the second-fastest marathon time in history (2 hours 3 minutes 3 seconds).\n\nFor the moment, even if Gebrselassie was the great Ethiopian trailblazer, it seems fair to rank Bekele the highest for his all-round achievements on the track, country and roads.\n\nYet Farah, who has run only one marathon, finishing eighth in London in 2014 in a relatively modest 2:08:21, believes he can make a big impact on the roads.\n\nThe most amazing tale in the annals of British athletics may not quite have run its course yet.

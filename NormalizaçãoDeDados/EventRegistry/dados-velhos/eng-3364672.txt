Robert B. Neller said Tuesday there is \"no place for racial hatred or extremism in the Marine Corps.\"\n\nThe Military Times and the Guardian reported that former Marine recruiter Dillon Ulysses Hopper is the leader of Vanguard America -- a group which helped organize the \"Unite the Right\" protest in Charlottesville, Virginia, that turned violent over the weekend. The Anti-Defamation League identified Hopper as the leader of Vanguard America, which ADL labels a \"white supremacist\" group, and said Hopper began leading the organization in \"early 2016.\"\n\nAccording to Hopper's service records, he was a member of the Marine Corps from July 10, 2006 until January 30, 2017. If ADL is correct, that would mean he began leading the white nationalist group while still technically in the Marines.\n\nFollowing those reports, Neller told CNN: \"Our core values of honor, courage and commitment frame the way Marines live and act. Bigotry and racial extremism run contrary to these core values.\" The US Marine Corps could not confirm if the service branch had knowledge of Hopper's involvement with the hate group.\n\nCNN was not able to determine whether Hopper participated in the Charlottesville protest, and attempts to reach him have been unsuccessful.\n\nWith his statement, Neller becomes the second member of the Pentagon's Joint Chiefs of Staff to speak out about events in Charlottesville. Last week, Adm. John Richardson, the Chief of Naval Operations, called the events in Charlottesville \"shameful\" and \"unacceptable.\"\n\n\"The Navy will forever stand against intolerance and hatred\" Richardson said in a statement posted on Twitter and Facebook. \"We want our Navy to be the safest possible place -- a team as strong and tough as we can be, saving violence only for our enemies.\"\n\nSecretary of Defense James Mattis also told reporters he was saddened by what he saw in Charlottesville.\n\nHopper was an \"average recruiter\" who \"was kind, attentive, humorous and had friends in the command of all races and sexes,\" his immediate supervisor, Staff Sgt. Kristen Chambasian, said in a statement provided by the Marine Corps. She added that \"Hopper recruited students from high schools in his area of all nationalities and backgrounds,\" saying those recruits \"were screened, interviewed and found basically qualified mentally, morally and physically.\"\n\nMarine Corps recruiting procedures require perspective recruits to go through multiple levels of scrutiny from multiple people. Of those Marines recruited by Hopper, Chambasian said she did \"not personally know of any of them having had any issues with racism\" due to their interactions with him.\n\nShe added: \"I cannot speak to when or what changed in Staff Sgt. Hopper that resulted in his recent and current life choices.\"\n\nA Marine Corps official told CNN the service is attempting to determine if Hopper may have recruited like-minded individuals into the Corps, but has found no evidence of that so far.\n\nParticipation in supremacist or extremist organizations is a violation of Defense Department orders and leads to mandatory dismissal from military service following the first substantiated incident.\n\nHopper served in at least two combat tours in Iraq and Afghanistan and went on to serve as a Marine recruiter from 2011-2014 before leaving the Marines on January 30, with the rank of staff sergeant. During his service in the Marine Corps, Hopper was a recipient of the Marine Corps Good Conduct Medal three times.\n\nA Marine Corps official said Hopper's status is that of a retired Marine, though

Find out what's happening in the world as it unfolds.\n\n(CNN)Following reports that a US Marine who left the service in January leads a white supremacist group called Vanguard America, Marine Corps Commandant Gen. Robert B. Neller said Tuesday there is \"no place for racial hatred or extremism in the Marine Corps.\"\n\nThe Military Times and the Guardian reported that former Marine recruiter Dillon Ulysses Hopper is the leader of Vanguard America -- a group which helped organize the \"Unite the Right\" protest in Charlottesville, Virginia, that turned violent over the weekend. The Anti-Defamation League identified Hopper as the leader of Vanguard America, which ADL labels a \"white supremacist\" group, and said Hopper began leading the organization in \"early 2016.\"According to Hopper's service records, he was a member of the Marine Corps from July 10, 2006 until January 30, 2017. If ADL is correct, that would mean he began leading the white nationalist group while still technically in the Marines.Following those reports, Neller told CNN: \"Our core values of honor, courage and commitment frame the way Marines live and act. Bigotry and racial extremism run contrary to these core values.\" The US Marine Corps could not confirm if the service branch had knowledge of Hopper's involvement with the hate group. CNN was not able to determine whether Hopper participated in the Charlottesville protest, and attempts to reach him have been unsuccessful. Read MoreWith his statement, Neller becomes the second member of the Pentagon's Joint Chiefs of Staff to speak out about events in Charlottesville. Last week, Adm. John Richardson, the Chief of Naval Operations, called the events in Charlottesville \"shameful\" and \"unacceptable.\" \"The Navy will forever stand against intolerance and hatred\" Richardson said in a statement posted on Twitter and Facebook. \"We want our Navy to be the safest possible place -- a team as strong and tough as we can be, saving violence only for our enemies.\"Secretary of Defense James Mattis also told reporters he was saddened by what he saw in Charlottesville.Hopper was an \"average recruiter\" who \"was kind, attentive, humorous and had friends in the command of all races and sexes,\" his immediate supervisor, Staff Sgt. Kristen Chambasian, said in a statement provided by the Marine Corps. She added that \"Hopper recruited students from high schools in his area of all nationalities and backgrounds,\" saying those recruits \"were screened, interviewed and found basically qualified mentally, morally and physically.\"Marine Corps recruiting procedures require perspective recruits to go through multiple levels of scrutiny from multiple people. Of those Marines recruited by Hopper, Chambasian said she did \"not personally know of any of them having had any issues with racism\" due to their interactions with him.She added: \"I cannot speak to when or what changed in Staff Sgt. Hopper that resulted in his recent and current life choices.\"A Marine Corps official told CNN the service is attempting to determine if Hopper may have recruited like-minded individuals into the Corps, but has found no evidence of that so far.Participation in supremacist or extremist organizations is a violation of Defense Department orders and leads to mandatory dismissal from military service following the first substantiated incident.Hopper served in at least two combat tours in Iraq and Afghanistan and went on to serve as a Marine recruiter from 2011-2014 before leaving the Marines on January 30, with the rank of staff sergeant. During his service in the Marine Corps, Hopper was a recipient of the Marine Corps Good Conduct Medal three times. A Marine Corps official said Hopper's status is that of a retired Marine, though he did not serve a full 20 years.", "date": "2017-08-16", "categories": [{"uri":

Col. Adam Levine, the commanding officer of Marine Fighter Attack Training Squadron 501. \"These candidates are exposed to the different components of the Navy and Marine Corps, it is only right they see what the MAG has to offer.\"\n\nAfter Midshipmen finish the academic year, they go through a summer cruise. The summer cruise gives Midshipmen the opportunity to experience different parts of the Navy and Marine Corps to help them gain perspective of life in the two Branches.\n\n\"This summer I was able to go on a submarine cruise and then experience Marine Corps aviation at MAG-31,\" said Midshipman Theo Freidenrich, a first year Midshipman at the USNA. \"It was cool just to see a glimpse of what the Navy and Marine Corps have to offer. I can't wait for my next summer cruise and learn a little more about the two branches and one day commission in either of the two.\"\n\nThe Midshipmen spent a month aboard Marine Corps Air Station Beaufort learning everything about MAG-31. They were able to visit an F/A-18C Hornet aircraft squadron to learn about being a hornet pilot and visited Marine Aviation Logistics Squadron 31 to learn about the maintenance that goes into keeping the hornets in flight. The Midshipmen were also able to visit VMFAT-501 and see the F-35B Lightning II Joint Strike Fighter and witness the short take-of and vertical landing capabilities of the aircraft.\n\nI was proud to showcase the future of Marine Corps aviation to possible future Marine Corps officers,\" said Levine. \"These summer cruises help determine the path the Midshipmen take when they are commissioned. Watching an F-35B display its STOVL capabilities could possibly be the decision making factor for a Midshipman to request a commission in the Marine Corps and even maybe apply for a flight contract. I hope we get more Midshipmen next year so we can show what the aviation side of the Marine Corps is all about and help Midshipmen decide what they want to do after graduation.\"", "date": "2017-08-18", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Marching", "wgt": 100, "id": 154, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Marching"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Transportation_and_Logistics/Maritime", "wgt": 100, "id": 288, "label": "dmoz/Business/Transportation and Logistics/Maritime"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Consumer_Goods_and_Services/Watercraft", "wgt": 100, "id": 452, "label": "dmoz/Business/Consumer Goods and Services/Watercraft"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Vehicles/Watercraft", "wgt": 100, "id": 456, "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Vehicles/Watercraft"}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aircraft", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "302706", "label": {"eng": "Aircraft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Submarine", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "304139", "label": {"eng": "Submarine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Marine_Corps", "type": "org", "score": 5, "id": "304957", "label": {"eng": "United States Marine Corps"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lieutenant", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "305060", "label": {"eng": "Lieutenant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commanding_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "305560", "label": {"eng": "Commanding officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Navy", "type": "org", "score": 4, "id": "310233", "label": {"eng": "United States Navy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lockheed_Martin_F-35_Lightning_II", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "315444", "label": {"eng": "Lockheed Martin F-35 Lightning II"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McDonnell_Douglas_F/A-18_Hornet", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "316740", "label": {"eng": "McDonnell Douglas F/A-18 Hornet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/STOVL", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "id": "326789", "label": {"eng": "STOVL"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Naval_Academy", "type": "org", "score": 4, "id": "340736", "label": {"eng": "United States Naval Academy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adam_Levine", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "378760", "label": {"eng": "222 Records"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint_Strike_Fighter_program", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "383491", "label": {"eng": "Joint Strike Fighter program"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midshipman", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "451270", "label": {"eng": "Midshipman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Marine_Corps_Aviation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "473525", "label": {"eng": "United States Marine Corps Aviation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marine_Corps_Air_Station_Beaufort", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "545417", "label": {"eng": "Marine Corps Air Station Beaufort"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naval_Reserve_Officers_Training_Corps", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "618909", "label": {"eng": "Naval Reserve Officers Training Corps"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VMFAT-501", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "1098315", "label": {"eng": "VMFAT-501"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marine_Aircraft_Group_31", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "1195585", "label": {"eng": "Marine Aircraft Group 31"}}]}

He shined in evaluations but failed in an attempt to join the Special Forces because of an injury, and left the service disillusioned in 1991.\n\nThe tall, rail-thin veteran kept his Army-style haircut, but floated through life rudderless. He found infamy on April 19, 1995, detonating a truck bomb outside the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building in Oklahoma City that killed 168 people and wounded 600 more. He'd grown furious with the U.S. government and democracy in general, writing in a letter to the editor in 1992 that \"AMERICA WAS IN DECLINE,\" according to a Washington Post profile of him published after the bombing.\n\nThat history is salient now as the United States and the military cope anew with white extremism.\n\nWhile racism has been repeatedly rejected by top military officials, the U.S. government has long been concerned about some service members and veterans joining right-wing extremist or white supremacist groups, or acting out their ideologies. A 2009 Homeland Security report cited \"disgruntled military veterans\" as one group to watch, prompting a backlash among some of them and an eventual apology from then-Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano. Nonetheless, the report was not retracted.\n\n[Confederate Memorial in Arlington: Honoring Rebels on nation's sacred ground]\n\nTo be sure, the percentage of veterans who subscribe to extremist views is tiny. But at least three recent veterans have been connected to the race-based melee in Charlottesville -- most prominently James A. Fields Jr., 20, who served briefly in the Army, expressed admiration for Nazis and is charged with second-degree murder in the vehicular death of Heather Heyer.\n\nAnother veteran, Dillon Ulysses Hopper, served in the Marine Corps until January and then emerged as the leader of Vanguard America, a neo-Nazi hate group that marched alongside Fields in Charlottesville (Hopper was not present). Unlike Fields, who washed out of the Army in four months, Hopper was a Marine for more than 10 years, rising to the rank of staff sergeant, deploying to Iraq and Afghanistan and serving as a recruiter for Recruiting Station Charleston, S.C., from 2011 to 2014.\n\nThe third veteran to emerge with connections to Charlottesville is Nathan Damigo, 31, a former Marine corporal who was deployed to Iraq twice and saw combat, according to military records. The website Task & Purpose reported Thursday that he was invited to speak at the rally. The Southern Poverty Law Center has previously identified him as the founder of the white supremacist group Identity Evropa, which he started after being jailed for armed robbery.\n\nReports of Hopper's past as a Marine Corps recruiter surfaced Monday, and the service confirmed it Tuesday. Within hours, the service's top officer, Gen. Robert B. Neller, issued a condemnation of racism and extremism and said it had no place in his service.\n\n\"Our core values of Honor, Courage, and Commitment frame the way Marines live and act,\" Neller said in a statement. \"Bigotry and racial extremism run contrary to these core values.\"\n\nThe statement was seen by some observers as a reaction to President Trump's news conference that afternoon, in which he appeared to equate the actions of white supremacists in Charlottesville with those who opposed them. But in reality, Neller was reacting to the news about Hopper, said Lt. Col. Eric Dent, a spokesman for the general.\n\nNeller was the second service chief to weigh in about Charlottesville, following Navy Adm. John M. Richardson, who condemned the gathering of white supremacists Saturday. Other service chiefs followed -- all looking to make it clear that racism is not welcome in the military.\n\nThe Marine Corps also has sought to reassure people that those who Hopper helped bring into the service have been thoroughly screened. No one recruits alone, and a \"multi-layered, policy-based approach to screening\" is used with several individuals at different levels interviewing prospective Marines, said Lt. Col. John Caldwell, a Marine spokesman.\n\nThe service released a statement from Hopper's former supervisor, Staff Sgt. Kristin Chambasian, in which she said she has stayed in touch with their former recruits and none has shown any indication of harboring racist views.\n\n\"I cannot speak to when or what changed in Sgt. Hopper that resulted in his recent and current life choices, but I can say without a doubt that the Marines recruited by him and everyone else in [Recruiting Station] Charleston are a diverse population of young men and women who passed rigorous and thorough screening, interviewing, and training to earn the title of United States Marine,\" her statement said.\n\nIt's an ugly return to the past for the Pentagon, which took steps to stamp out extremism in the 1990s, especially after the Oklahoma City bombing and the 1995 murder of a black couple near Fort Bragg, N.C. In that case, two soldiers -- Malcolm Wright Jr. and James N. Burmeister -- were found with a Nazi flag and white supremacist pamphlets. They were eventually convicted.\n\nThe military now screens recruits closely for tattoos that show hints of extremist ideology, but that does not catch every potential problem. In one example, the Army this year enlisted Guillaume Cuvelier, 29, who fought alongside Russian-backed separatists in Ukraine and participated in far-right politics in Europe. He was a member of the 25th Infantry Division in Hawaii when The Washington Post published a story about him in May, and he was subsequently discharged from the service.\n\nMeanwhile, the services are still grappling with what to do with the incorporation of Confederate history into military culture. Ten Army bases are named after generals who fought for the South during the Civil War, including Fort Bragg, Fort Hood, Fort Polk and Fort Benning. The Army said two years ago that there was \"no discussion of adjusting the naming policy,\" and did not respond to numerous requests this week for comment about whether that has changed.\n\nIn the Navy, a ship is named the USS Chancellorsville, one of the greatest victories for the Confederacy during the Civil War. A Navy official, speaking on the condition of anonymity in order to discuss internal debate at the Pentagon, said it is unlikely the service will rename the ship. But it is possible that the Navy could change its coat of arms, a logo that includes a wreath commemorating the death of Gen. Thomas \"Stonewall\" Jackson, a Confederate officer who was mortally wounded in the battle.", "date": "2017-08-18", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Niche/Military", "wgt": 100, "id": 163,

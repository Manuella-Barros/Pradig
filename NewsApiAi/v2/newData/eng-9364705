I encourage Maine people and visitors to our state to make an observation plan and order eclipse glasses now so that they are ready to safely witness this extraordinary event.\"\n\nFor those who still need accommodations and plans, check out some of special hotel packages and events happening across the New England states in the path of totality on April 8.\n\nThis will be Maine's first total solar eclipse since 1963, according to the Maine Office of Tourism.\n\nMaine communities in the path of totality include most of Aroostook County, Millinocket, Rangeley, Greenville, Jackman, and Carrabassett Valley. Houlton, the last U.S. town in the path of totality, is bracing for about 40,000 visitors.\n\nRangeley will host a Shadow of the Sun Festival from April 5-8.

The hotel will host a tea time with moon cookies and a three-course moon dinner special at 24 Carrot, the hotel's fine dining restaurant.\n\nTravelers at Hilton Burlington Lake Champlain will party like it's the 1980s during the hotel's Total Eclipse of the Heart bash. The '80s-themed event will include music, cocktails, hors d'oeuvres, and more.\n\nAt Jay Peak Resort in Jay, which is offering lodging packages, the lifts will stop at 2 p.m. and the band Pink Talking Fish will play Pink Floyd's \"The Dark Side of the Moon\" album as the eclipse reaches totality.\n\nThe last time New Hampshire was in the direct path of a solar eclipse was in 1959, and the next won't be until 2079, according to the NH Division of Travel and Tourism Development.\n\nThe Great North Woods of New Hampshire will be in totality, which includes the area of Lancaster north to the Canadian border. However, the entire Granite State will experience about 95% totality.\n\nThe Inn at OxBow Acres in Milan, located on the path of totality, is offering a solar eclipse getaway package that includes eclipse glasses, dinner for two evenings, and a charcuterie board.

It could be anywhere from 30,000 to 100,000 people,\" said Jones.\n\n\"I still think there is a lot of either disbelief in the number of potential people or disconnect from eclipse information in the general population. Unfortunately, this includes many business owners. They either don't know about the eclipse, or they don't understand why this is a really big deal,\" she said.\n\nMany people attending presentations Jones has led in recent months have told her they had no idea the eclipse could make such a big impact on the county.\n\nJones commended the county's efforts to study how other similar-sized counties were impacted by the most recent full eclipse in 2017. While Hancock County witnessed only a partial eclipse, communities in other states within the path of totality saw tens of thousands of visitors show up to witness the rare event.\n\nAccording to NASA, the next total solar eclipse that can be seen from the contiguous United States won't occur for another 20 years -- on Aug. 23, 2044.\n\nJones said the majority of eclipse viewing events this year are being held in Shirley, New Palestine and Greenfield, with the county's largest event held in Greenfield's Depot Street Park, where food, activities and entertainment will be on site from 12-5 p.m.\n\nAs always, county officials are encouraging everyone to \"come early, stay put and leave late\" to minimize traffic congestion before, during and after the event.\n\nFitzgerald said city and county crews will be out in full force that day, ensuring the safety of both residents and guests.\n\n\"Now we're just waiting to see what the weather is going to be like that day. The forecast isn't looking very favorable,\" said Fitzgerald, who said the National Weather Service was predicting cloudy conditions as of Thursday.\n\n\"Right now, they're saying we've had sunny days the past two years on April 8, so the chances we do again this year aren't in our favor,\" he said, \"but hopefully that won't be the case.\"\n\nRegardless, the full eclipse will plunge the entire county into darkness for nearly four minutes that day -- turning day into night -- as the world goes silent except for the chirp of crickets tricked into thinking it's time for their nightly chorus.", "source": {"uri": "greenfieldreporter.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Greenfield Daily Reporter"}, "authors": [{"uri": "shelley_swift@greenfieldreporter.com", "name": "Shelley Swift", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eclipse", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Eclipse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/County_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "County (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hancock_County,_Maine", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hancock County, Maine"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Hancock County, Maine"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_responder", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "First responder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Fitzgerald_(politician)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Joe Fitzgerald (politician)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Municipality", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Municipality"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Homeland_Security", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of Homeland Security"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glass", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Glass"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergency_service", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Emergency service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_America", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "North America"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cook_County,_Illinois", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cook County, Illinois"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Cook County, Illinois"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silent_film", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Silent film"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cricket_(insect)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cricket (insect)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_eclipse", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Solar eclipse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Weather_Service", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "National Weather Service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contiguous_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Contiguous United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASA", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NASA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traffic_congestion", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Traffic congestion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenfield,_Massachusetts", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Greenfield, Massachusetts"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Greenfield, Massachusetts"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Palestine,_Indiana", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "New Palestine, Indiana"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New Palestine, Indiana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Astronomy/Eclipses,_Occultations_and_Transits", "label": "dmoz/Science/Astronomy/Eclipses, Occultations and Transits", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://www.greenfieldreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/132833771_web1_eclipse_9649_CMYK-768x512.jpg", "eventUri": "eng-9364705", "sentiment": 0.2313725490196079, "wgt": 447620527, "relevance": 1}

Beyond noticing the sun's changing shape during the eclipse, there are other observations to make during this rare event.\n\nA partial eclipse begins in Hancock County at 1:51 p.m. Never look directly at the sun during a partial eclipse without proper eye protection. Proper protection includes ISO 12312-2 certified eclipse glasses. I recommend those made by American Paper Optics.\n\nRecord the temperature at 1:50 p.m. A thermometer placed in a location without a shadow is ideal, but a weather app on a device would work too. Record the temperature in 10-minute intervals through totality's end at 3:10 p.m. or beyond. During some eclipses, temperatures have dropped as much as 20 degrees. In the time leading up to totality at 3:06 p.m., also make note of the wind speed and cloud cover changes.\n\nObserve the shadows as the partial eclipse nears and leaves totality. If trees have leafed out, stand near or under one and look at the ground. Take special note of the shadows. Between 2:30-3 p.m. and 3:15-3:45 p.m., they'll be mesmerizing. If the trees don't yet have leaves, loosely interlock your fingers and, with your back to the sun, hold them out and look at the shadows created by the gaps between them. Hold a spaghetti colander and look at the shadows created by it.\n\nWhen the eclipse becomes total at 3:06 p.m., you can look directly at the darkened sun without eye protection until 3:10 p.m. when totality ends. Look for wispy prominences called the corona emerging from the sun's disk. They can only be seen during the totality portion of a solar eclipse.\n\nDuring totality, planets and stars can sometimes be seen in the darkened sky. Look for Venus and Jupiter, the brightest objects. If you have a clear view of the horizon, look for the multicolored hues. These are from the skies outside the path of totality that still receive direct sunlight.\n\nListen carefully to birds and insects. During total eclipses, they may become noisy. If you're with others, observe them. As the sky becomes noticeably dimmer, do people get excited or mellow? When totality arrives, do they scream, cheer or become quiet? Does anyone cry? These emotions and more come out during a total solar eclipse.\n\nI've been asked about the best place locally to watch it. Any place where clouds don't obscure the sun is great. If you have an opportunity to observe it from a tall hill with a clear view of the ground below, you could be in for a treat. From above you may be able to see the shadow of totality moving quickly along the ground from the southwest until it reaches your position. Unfortunately, there aren't many high hills in Hancock County. Nearby public land is the hill atop Flat Fork Creek Park just west of Fortville over the Hamilton County line.\n\nI've saved the worst news for last. Historically speaking, it's cloudy in Hancock County about two-thirds of the time on April 8. If clouds persist that Monday, and you can't leave town to try and see it elsewhere, I still encourage you to go outside and observe. It will still get dark from 3:06 to 3:10 p.m. The temperature may still drop. The birds and insects may behave abnormally. Clouds would dampen the day, but all would not be lost.\n\nHancock County won't see another total eclipse until 2505, and the city of Greenfield doesn't enjoy its next until 3290. Make a viewing plan and get ready for the show of a lifetime.\n\nCharlie Hart lives with his wife and two children in central Indiana and works for a digital marketing firm in Fishers.

What's considerably less clear, however, is how clear the skies will be on the big day, as varying weather forecasts suggest the possibility of cloud cover that would hinder visibility in different regions.\n\nWith the Great North American Total Solar Eclipse happening April 8, regions stretching from Mexico and Texas all the way to Maine in the U.S. and the Ontario, Quebec, and the Maritime provinces in Canada are gearing up for a rare astronomical spectacle. It's obviously still really early, and things could change given the chaotic nature of weather, but long-range forecasters are weighing in, given weather patterns and emerging meteorological trends.\n\nAs this eclipse approaches, AccuWeather has released its initial forecast, 31 days ahead of the April 8 event. The eclipse's path, considered incredibly fortunate due to its stretch across a large portion of the continent, places millions in a prime viewing position. However, weather conditions remain a critical factor for those hoping to see the eclipse (safely, of course).\n\nAccording to AccuWeather senior meteorologist Paul Pastelok, southern Texas, along with areas of the Ohio Valley and Great Lakes, are currently favored for clear weather. Unfortunately, cloud cover is slightly more probable in the Mississippi and Tennessee Valleys, with the northeast facing the highest risk of cloudy conditions. Despite this, Pastelok notes the possibility of clear skies even in these riskier regions.\n\nThe challenge for meteorologists lies in accurately predicting cloud conditions for the brief period of totality, which lasts approximately four minutes. \"There is a good possibility that a cold front will be moving across central and eastern U.S. near this time of the eclipse,\" Pastelok said, and this could significantly influence cloud coverage. Moreover, a slow-moving storm system over the Southeast in April could extend cloud duration, hindering eclipse visibility.\n\nA key factor in AccuWeather's forecast is the gradual weakening of El Ni\u00f1o, known for altering North American weather patterns through warmer water temperatures in the eastern Pacific Ocean. Despite its weakening, El Ni\u00f1o's residual effects could still drive active weather patterns during the eclipse, according to AccuWeather.\n\nComplicating the forecast is the potential for severe weather to begin in early April, bringing a chance of (as of yet) unpredictable thunderstorms in the Plains, Mississippi Valley, and Tennessee Valley. Additionally, while the forecast suggests generally mild temperatures, reducing the likelihood of late-season cold, some chill may persist in the south-central Plains, Midwest, mid-Atlantic, and Northeast, AccuWeather says. This milder climate would make outdoor viewing more comfortable, while folks along the northern regions may still need to bundle up for the early spring conditions.\n\nAgain, this is just an early forecast. As each day and week passes from now to the eclipse, we should get an increasingly clearer picture of the conditions for that day.

However, Arizonans can view a partial eclipse before and after these times, with the partial eclipse ending around 1:02 p.m.\n\nThe 2024 total solar eclipse will start over the South Pacific Ocean and traverse North America, spanning Mexico, the United States and Canada.\n\n\"This eclipse's path of totality goes from the Pacific coast of Mexico through central Texas up through the Midwest and over Niagara Falls and then off the Atlantic coast of Canada,\" said Theodore Kareta, a postdoctoral researcher at Lowell Observatory in Flagstaff.\n\nPhoenix and the rest of Arizona will be able to view a partial eclipse. The state is not in the path of totality.\n\n\"No part of Arizona will be 'great' or much better than another, so my primary advice for people staying in Arizona would be to find a place with clear skies where you can be outside comfortably for a few hours. The further east you can go, the better you'll be closer to the path of totality,\" said Kareta.\n\nPhoenix will experience a partial eclipse, with the moon covering a portion of the sun's disk.\n\n\"The path of totality is where the disk of the sun is completely blocked out, so locations outside of the path, like all of Arizona, will only see the disk of the sun partially blocked,\" said Kareta.\n\nThe duration of the total solar eclipse on April 8, 2024, will vary depending on your location along the path of totality. In general, the duration of totality can range from a few seconds to over four minutes, with the maximum duration occurring near the center of the path.\n\n\"The sun will be completely blocked out, or occulted, for two to four minutes depending on your location, but will be partially blocked out for about two and a half hours total,\" said Kareta.\n\nIn Arizona, the partial eclipse will last for several hours, with the moon gradually covering and then uncovering a portion of the sun.\n\n\"I would encourage people to reach out to their local science centers and observatories to see what educational opportunities they have for the eclipse. It might not be possible for everyone to travel to an ideal viewing location, but children will still get a kick out of seeing the sun partially disappear,\" said Kareta.\n\nTo see the total solar eclipse, you would need to travel to a location within the path of totality.\n\nIn Arizona, your best option to observe the partial eclipse is to be in a location with a clear view of the sky. Consider open areas in the White Mountains such as:\n\nChoosing an open area away from tall buildings or trees will maximize your view. Remember to use proper eye protection, such as eclipse glasses or solar filters, to safely view the eclipse.\n\nHere is the full list of countries and states in the path of totality, according to NASA:\n\nHere are a few cities that will see the total eclipse:\n\nThe 2024 total solar eclipse will last the longest near the center of its path of totality. The precise location where the eclipse will have the longest duration of totality will be in southern Mexico, near the town of Nazas in the state of Durango. In this area, the total eclipse is expected to last approximately 4 minutes and 28 seconds. This duration gradually decreases as you move away from the centerline of the path of totality in any direction.\n\nKareta says the best location to view the eclipse will be Texas.\n\n\"That's just because Texas is the least cloudy on average part of the whole path,\" said Kareta.\n\nThe 2024 solar eclipse is significant due to its path of totality crossing North America, providing accessible viewing opportunities for millions.\n\n\"While a few really impressive eclipses happen every year, most of them are in areas that are hard to reach -- most of the Earth's surface is ocean after all -- so the 2017 and 2024 eclipses are the rare scenario where an eclipse goes straight over the continental United States. It is a rare opportunity to only have to drive a few hours to see the sun go away,\" said Kareta.\n\nYes, it does get dark during a total solar eclipse. When the moon completely covers the sun, it blocks out the sunlight, causing the sky to darken significantly. This darkness can be akin to twilight or even nightfall, depending on the location and duration of totality.\n\nLooking directly at a solar eclipse, or at the sun at any time without proper eye protection, can cause serious and permanent damage to your eyesight.\n\nThe intense solar radiation emitted during an eclipse can harm the sensitive cells in the retina, leading to solar retinopathy, which can result in blurred vision, blind spots or even permanent blindness, according to Prevent Blindness.org.\n\nEven looking at partial eclipse is unsafe without proper eye protection. The human eye does not have pain receptors in the retina and you may not immediately feel discomfort if your eyes are being damaged.\n\nTo safely observe a solar eclipse, you must use specially designed solar filters or eclipse glasses that meet international safety standards. These filters block out harmful ultraviolet, visible and infrared radiation, allowing you to view the eclipse without risking eye damage.\n\nIf you don't have access to eclipse glasses or other suitable eye protection, there are indirect viewing methods you can use to safely observe the eclipse. Here are a few options that NASA recommends:\n\nSolar eclipses don't have a specific direct effect on dogs. However, during an eclipse, the environment may experience changes in lighting and temperature, which could affect some animals' behavior, including dogs, according to the American Kennel Club.\n\nTo ensure your dog's safety and well-being during a solar eclipse, keep it indoors or under close supervision outdoors. It's rare, but a dog's eyes could be damaged if it looked directly at the eclipse.\n\nYes, you can take a picture of a solar eclipse with your phone, but it's crucial to do so safely and with the proper equipment.\n\nBe sure to wear eclipse glasses if you plan to look at the eclipse while photographing it.\n\nHere are some tips NASA recommends to help you take a picture of the eclipse with phone:\n\nNo. Solar eclipses do not occur every five years like clockwork. The frequency of solar eclipses varies and they typically occur about two to five times per year. Their occurrence is subject to celestial mechanics and varies based on the alignment of the Earth, moon and sun.\n\nIt will be a while before Americans will see a total solar eclipse after 2024.\n\n\"Total solar eclipses are not so common. The next one is in August 2026 over the Arctic and west Europe. The next total solar eclipse which an Arizonan might see part of without much traveling isn't until 2044 and it won't be anywhere near as good,\" said Kareta.\n\nHere are some upcoming solar eclipses, according to NASA:\n\nAn annular solar eclipse occurs when the moon passes directly between the Earth and the sun, but the apparent size of the moon is smaller than that of the sun. This results in the sun appearing as a bright ring, or annulus, around the dark silhouette of the moon, according to NASA.\n\nKareta said a solar eclipse occurs when the moon passes between the Earth and the sun, blocking the sun's light and casting a shadow on Earth. This phenomenon only occurs during a new moon phase when the alignment of the sun, moon and Earth is just right.\n\nSolar eclipses can be total, partial or annular, depending on the alignment and distance of the bodies involved.\n\nA lunar eclipse happens when the Earth passes between the sun and the moon, causing the Earth's shadow to fall on the moon's surface. This phenomenon occurs during a full moon phase and can be observed from anywhere on Earth's night side where the moon is visible.\n\n\"In both cases, the sun's light is getting blocked out,\" said Kareta.\n\nDuring the solar eclipse, several planets may be visible depending on their positions relative to the sun and the time of day. But glare from the sun during an eclipse can make it challenging to see other celestial objects nearby.\n\nThe most likely planet to be visible during the 2024 solar eclipse is Venus. Venus is often visible in the daytime sky, especially when it's near its greatest elongation from the sun. Since Venus is the brightest planet in our solar system, it may be visible as a bright point of light near the sun during the eclipse.\n\n\"Jupiter should be visible on the sun's left and Venus below and to the right. Other planets won't be visible or won't be worth the effort. When the sun is completely occulted, you'll have a hard time looking away from the solar corona, the hot, wispy and extended atmosphere of the sun,\" said Kareta.\n\nThe last total solar eclipse visible in the United States was on Aug. 21, 2017.\n\nThe total solar eclipse of April 8, 2024, differs from the one in 2017 because the path of totality for the 2024 eclipse is wider and passes over more densely populated areas, according to NASA.\n\nAnd totality will last longer in 2024, with durations of up to 4 minutes and 28 seconds, compared to a maximum of 2 minutes and 42 seconds in 2017.", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eclipse", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng":

Here's how to prepare for it\n\nIt's time to add another pair of sunglasses to your collection!\n\nHowever, this particular pair isn't for fashion purposes -- rather, it's for protection when viewing the upcoming total solar eclipse that's expected to take place in April 2024.\n\nThink back to the last time a total solar eclipse was visible from the United States in April 2017, when NASA advised onlookers to watch the astronomical phenomenon with specialized eye protection. This year is no different!\n\nThe space agency recommends protective eye gear for those hoping to catch a glimpse of this highly-anticipated event, particularly for the phases before and after totality (which is when the moon completely blocks the sun's bright face).\n\nRelated: Here's What Leap Day Could Mean for You, According to Your Zodiac Sign\n\nEven without an astronomical event that causes people to gaze directly at the sun, doctors advise people wear a good pair of shades in bright weather; that's because, as NASA warns, viewing \"any part\" of the sun \"without a special-purpose solar filter secured over the front of the optics\" will \"instantly cause severe eye injury.\"\n\nIt's important to note, however, that the protective eyewear the agency suggests using to watch the solar eclipse is not the same as regular sunglasses. Plus, they shouldn't be used when viewing through cameras, binoculars or telescopes.\n\nRead on for what you need to know about the NASA-recommended glasses to watch the 2024 solar eclipse, including when and where to buy them.\n\nA solar eclipse happens when the moon passes between the sun and the Earth, according to NASA. The moon enters different phases during an eclipse.\n\nAt just the right moment, a total solar eclipse occurs when the moon passes over the sun and blocks out its bright light completely. Other times a partial solar eclipse takes place, when the moon only covers part of the sun's glow.\n\nA total solar eclipse is quite a spectacle to experience if the astronomical phenomenon is visible from your location on Earth. The April 2024 solar eclipse, which will be visible in the U.S., is expected to take place midday, causing daytime darkness for a few minutes as a result.\n\n\"If you want to experience total darkness during an eclipse, you have to be in the path of totality,\" reports NASA. \"If you don't know what's happening, it can be confusing. Animals can get confused too!\"\n\nRelated: All About October's Solar Eclipse and What It Means For Your Zodiac\n\nThe upcoming solar eclipse is Monday, April 8, 2024. Exact timing depends on where viewers are located in North America, where the phenomenon will pass after it begins over the South Pacific ocean.\n\n\"Weather permitting, the first location in continental North America that will experience totality is Mexico's Pacific coast at around 11:07 a.m. PDT,\" per NASA. Next, it will enter the U.S. in Texas.\n\nThen, it travels through Oklahoma, Arkansas, Missouri, Illinois, Kentucky, Indiana, Ohio, Pennsylvania, New York, Vermont, New Hampshire and Maine, as well as small parts of Michigan and Tennessee. (Those interested in experiencing the complete solar eclipse should look up exactly where in their state is within the path of totality; many well-situated towns are hosting events to celebrate!)\n\nAfter it makes its way over the U.S., the eclipse will enter Canada. It will exit continental North America on the Atlantic coast of Newfoundland, Canada, at 5:16 p.m. NDT.\n\nSolar eclipse glasses are specialized eyewear recommended by NASA to watch the solar eclipse, and are specifically made out of materials that enable safe sun viewing.\n\n\"Solar eclipse glasses use lenses that are made of black polymer, a flexible resin infused with carbon particles,\" according to the Planetary Society's website. \"They are about 100,000 times darker than ordinary sunglasses and block nearly all visible light as well as all infrared and ultraviolet light.\"\n\nEclipse glasses aren't the only form of protective eyewear onlookers are suggested to use. Handheld solar viewers are another option if you can't snag a pair of glasses.\n\nNASA states that it \"does not approve any particular brand of solar viewers.\" (The American Astronomy Society does have a list of reputable vendors on their own site.) However, NASA emphasizes that people hoping to look right at the sun must be wearing a pair, as regular shades \"are not safe for viewing the sun\" during the eclipse.\n\nSolar eclipse glasses and handheld solar viewers are strongly recommended by NASA to watch the phenomenon in its partial phases as a way to prevent eye damage from the sun. There are other ways to watch, though, if you don't want to purchase and wear this gear.\n\nNASA offers an indirect viewing method, which does not involve looking directly at the sun. Using a pinhole projector, for example, is one way onlookers can experience the eclipse.\n\nA pinhole projector has a tiny opening (like a hole punched in an index card) and projects an image of the sun onto a nearby surface. While facing away from the sun, the space agency says that viewers \"can then safely view the projected image.\" (Do not look at the sun through the pinhole!)\n\nThere is also a brief window of totality (when the moon completely covers the sun) when NASA notes the eclipse is viewable \"without proper eye protection.\" The only safe time is when you can \"no longer see any part of the sun through eclipse glasses or a solar viewer.\"\n\nRelated: Fly in the Path of Totality During April's Total Solar Eclipse on This Delta Flight\n\nSo what exactly are you looking for to ensure you are buying the correct type of glasses?\n\n\"Safe solar viewers are thousands of times darker and ought to comply with the ISO 12312-2 international standard,\" according to NASA.\n\nThe space agency links to a resource page with vetted companies that manufacture and sell safe solar viewers and filters for binoculars and telescopes; according to NASA, these sellers have \"demonstrated\" that the products they're selling \"meet the safety requirements\" of the above standard.\n\nThe resource page does not recommend searching for eclipse glasses on Amazon, eBay, Temu or any other online marketplace and buying from whichever vendor offers the lowest price. Before making an online purchase, make sure the seller is \"identified on the [NASA] site.\"\n\nAs for when you should buy your solar eclipse glasses, Forbes suggests purchasing them now. This is because demand for the product will only increase as April 8 draws closer, which will likely increase prices as a result.\n\n\"According to the e-commerce accelerator Pattern, the prices of solar eclipse glasses have increased by 27% online since the last solar eclipse in North America on October 16,\" the outlet reported on March 7 -- and based on supply-and-demand, prices will likely only increase from here.", "source": {"uri": "ca.sports.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo Sports Canada"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

AccuWeather forecast says maybe", "body": "Floridians know the pain of eagerly looking forward to an amazing celestial spectacle -- meteor showers, rocket launches, super moons -- and only seeing clouds or even just a gray, featureless, overcast sky.\n\nNow one of the most amazing sights you can see is coming: a solar eclipse when the moon blots out the sun and leaves the land in eerie darkness. Will anyone in Florida be able to tell?\n\nAccording to AccuWeather's preliminary forecast, it's a qualified maybe. There's a risk of a storm system in April which may affect visibility, and a potential cold front.\n\n\"There is a good possibility that a cold front will be moving across the central and eastern U.S. near the time of the eclipse,\" said AccuWeather Lead Long-Range Forecaster Paul Pastelok in an email.\n\nThe timing and location of that front could mean clear or cloudy skies.\n\nThere's also a risk of a slow-moving storm system over the Southeast next month. \"If one of these systems forms, the duration of cloud cover can be longer with any system, leading to poor viewing,\" Pastelok said.\n\nEl Ni\u00f1o, a pattern of warmer than usual water in the Pacific Ocean that tends to reinforce a more moderate climate, is rapidly fading but still a factor in predicting eclipse weather, Pastelok said. Severe weather and rainstorms tend to ramp up in April as well.\n\nGenerally speaking, AccuWeather and the National Weather Service both predict a higher-than-usual chance for rain in Florida for the next three months.\n\nAccuWeather stresses that we are still a month out and any weather predictions must be taken with a huge grain of salt. Anyone living in Florida knows how quickly the weather can change.\n\nUnless it's completely overcast or raining, you still should be able to some part of the eclipse. Even on a cloudy day, the sun peeks out between the clouds, and while it'll take a few hours from start to finish you only need a clear view of the eclipse for the three or four minutes the moon actually covers the sun.\n\nRemember, Florida won't get to see the total eclipse, we're not in the path of the totality which will move from the coast of Mexico diagonally northeast across continental North America. But everyone in Florida will see a partial eclipse with half to over 3/4 of the sun covered depending on where you are in the state. The closer to the western Panhandle, the more of an eclipse you'll see.\n\nIf it's not too cloudy, of course. But if you miss it, there's a total solar eclipse coming to Florida in 2045.\n\n2024 eclipse in the Sunshine State: Can you see the 2024 solar eclipse in Florida? Here are the best places to watch it\n\nTexas, Oklahoma, Arkansas, Missouri, Illinois, Kentucky, Indiana, Ohio, Pennsylvania, New York, Vermont, New Hampshire and Maine, plus parts of Tennessee and Michigan, are all in the 115-mile-wide path of totality.\n\nTo see the exact path of totality, check out an interactive map created by French eclipse expert Xavier Jubier.\n\nSo far, AccuWeather predicts the best views of the eclipse may be in Southern Texas, areas of the Ohio Valley, and the Great Lakes region. Odds for cloudy weather are higher in the Mississippi and Tennessee valleys, with the Northeast U.S. having the worst odds of clouds on eclipse day.\n\nYES. Do not look directly at the sun under any conditions. The cloud cover may not be enough to shield your eyes from immediate damage, and clouds might open up at any time.\n\nAlways wear ISO 12312-2 international standard eclipse safety glasses to look at an eclipse. Never look at an eclipse through a camera, a phone camera, a telescope or binoculars without rated lens filters on them.\n\nThe American Astronomical Society offers links on its website of vendors selling approved solar eclipse glasses. StarNet Libraries offers free solar glasses for libraries through its Solar Eclipse Activities for Libraries program. The organization sent out 5 million solar-viewing glasses to 10,000 libraries, including several in Florida. Eyeglass company Warby Parker will be handing out free eclipse glasses in April.\n\nThe total eclipse will hit the coast of Mexico on April 8, 2024, around 11:07 a.m. PDT and leave the continental North America at 5:16 NDT. The partial eclipse will begin first as the edge of the moon becomes visible, and then about an hour and 20 minutes later the totality will begin and last for three or four minutes before the sun begins to appear again.\n\nIn Florida, residents should start to see the eclipse beginning around 1:35 p.m. EDT, with the midpoint at 2:55.\n\nCheryl McCloud, USA TODAY NETWORK - Florida, contributed

This year is no different!\n\nThe space agency recommends protective eye gear for those hoping to catch a glimpse of this highly-anticipated event, particularly for the phases before and after totality (which is when the moon completely blocks the sun's bright face).\n\nEven without an astronomical event that causes people to gaze directly at the sun, doctors advise people wear a good pair of shades in bright weather; that's because, as NASA warns, viewing \"any part\" of the sun \"without a special-purpose solar filter secured over the front of the optics\" will \"instantly cause severe eye injury.\"\n\nIt's important to note, however, that the protective eyewear the agency suggests using to watch the solar eclipse is not the same as regular sunglasses. Plus, they shouldn't be used when viewing through cameras, binoculars or telescopes.\n\nRead on for what you need to know about the NASA-recommended glasses to watch the 2024 solar eclipse, including when and where to buy them.\n\nA solar eclipse happens when the moon passes between the sun and the Earth, according to NASA. The moon enters different phases during an eclipse.\n\nAt just the right moment, a total solar eclipse occurs when the moon passes over the sun and blocks out its bright light completely. Other times a partial solar eclipse takes place, when the moon only covers part of the sun's glow.\n\nA total solar eclipse is quite a spectacle to experience if the astronomical phenomenon is visible from your location on Earth. The April 2024 solar eclipse, which will be visible in the U.S., is expected to take place midday, causing daytime darkness for a few minutes as a result.\n\n\"If you want to experience total darkness during an eclipse, you have to be in the path of totality,\" reports NASA. \"If you don't know what's happening, it can be confusing. Animals can get confused too!\"\n\nThe upcoming solar eclipse is Monday, April 8, 2024. Exact timing depends on where viewers are located in North America, where the phenomenon will pass after it begins over the South Pacific ocean.\n\n\"Weather permitting, the first location in continental North America that will experience totality is Mexico's Pacific coast at around 11:07 a.m. PDT,\" per NASA. Next, it will enter the U.S. in Texas.\n\nThen, it travels through Oklahoma, Arkansas, Missouri, Illinois, Kentucky, Indiana, Ohio, Pennsylvania, New York, Vermont, New Hampshire and Maine, as well as small parts of Michigan and Tennessee. (Those interested in experiencing the complete solar eclipse should look up exactly where in their state is within the path of totality; many well-situated towns are hosting events to celebrate!)\n\nAfter it makes its way over the U.S., the eclipse will enter Canada. It will exit continental North America on the Atlantic coast of Newfoundland, Canada, at 5:16 p.m. NDT.\n\nSolar eclipse glasses are specialized eyewear recommended by NASA to watch the solar eclipse, and are specifically made out of materials that enable safe sun viewing.\n\n\"Solar eclipse glasses use lenses that are made of black polymer, a flexible resin infused with carbon particles,\" according to the Planetary Society's website. \"They are about 100,000 times darker than ordinary sunglasses and block nearly all visible light as well as all infrared and ultraviolet light.\"\n\nEclipse glasses aren't the only form of protective eyewear onlookers are suggested to use. Handheld solar viewers are another option if you can't snag a pair of glasses.\n\nNASA states that it \"does not approve any particular brand of solar viewers.\" (The American Astronomy Society does have a list of reputable vendors on their own site.) However, NASA emphasizes that people hoping to look right at the sun must be wearing a pair, as regular shades \"are not safe for viewing the sun\" during the eclipse.\n\nSolar eclipse glasses and handheld solar viewers are strongly recommended by NASA to watch the phenomenon in its partial phases as a way to prevent eye damage from the sun. There are other ways to watch, though, if you don't want to purchase and wear this gear.\n\nNASA offers an indirect viewing method, which does not involve looking directly at the sun. Using a pinhole projector, for example, is one way onlookers can experience the eclipse.\n\nA pinhole projector has a tiny opening (like a hole punched in an index card) and projects an image of the sun onto a nearby surface. While facing away from the sun, the space agency says that viewers \"can then safely view the projected image.\" (Do not look at the sun through the pinhole!)\n\nThere is also a brief window of totality (when the moon completely covers the sun) when NASA notes the eclipse is viewable \"without proper eye protection.\" The only safe time is when you can \"no longer see any part of the sun through eclipse glasses or a solar viewer.\"\n\nSo what exactly are you looking for to ensure you are buying the correct type of glasses?\n\n\"Safe solar viewers are thousands of times darker and ought to comply with the ISO 12312-2 international standard,\" according to NASA.\n\nThe space agency links to a resource page with vetted companies that manufacture and sell safe solar viewers and filters for binoculars and telescopes; according to NASA, these sellers have \"demonstrated\" that the products they're selling \"meet the safety requirements\" of the above standard.\n\nThe resource page does not recommend searching for eclipse glasses on Amazon, eBay, Temu or any other online marketplace and buying from whichever vendor offers the lowest price. Before making an online purchase, make sure the seller is \"identified on the [NASA] site.\"\n\nAs for when you should buy your solar eclipse glasses, Forbes suggests purchasing them now. This is because demand for the product will only increase as April 8 draws closer, which will likely increase prices as a result.\n\n\"According to the e-commerce accelerator Pattern, the prices of

But these celestial events aren't all exactly alike.\n\nWhile April's eclipse has a path similar to the one that occurred on August 21, 2017, albeit moving in the opposite direction and covering more ground, there are quite a few differences between the two that make 2024's occurrence one to anticipate, according to NASA. One key factor that sets this year's event apart is who will be able to see it.\n\nRELATED: Countdown begins for April's total solar eclipse. What to know about watch parties and safe viewing\n\nNASA estimates that 215 million adults across the US saw the 2017 eclipse directly or virtually.\n\n\"This year's total solar eclipse will be at least partially visible to all in the contiguous United States, making it the most accessible eclipse this nation has experienced in this generation,\" said Nicola Fox, associate administrator for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, in a statement.\n\nMore people will be able to see the 2024 eclipse because the path of totality, or locations where people will witness the moon's shadow completely covering the sun, will be wider. The moon's distance from Earth varies as it orbits our planet, and during the 2017 total solar eclipse, the moon was farther away from Earth and caused the area of totality to be narrower, extending from about 62 to 71 miles (100 to 114 kilometers) wide.\n\nBut the moon will be closer to our planet during this year's event, so the path its shadow will follow over North America is expected to stretch about 108 to 122 miles (174 to 196 kilometers) wide.\n\nThe path of the 2024 eclipse also passes over more densely populated areas and major cities than before. Only 12 million people lived within the area of totality for the 2017 eclipse, while nearly 32 million are in the 2024 path, and 150 million people live within 200 miles (322 kilometers) of it.\n\nRELATED: How to protect your eyes during 2024 solar eclipse\n\nPeople outside the path of totality will still be able to see a partial solar eclipse, where the moon only blocks part of the sun's face. A whopping 99% of those living across the US, including parts of Hawaii and Alaska, will be able to glimpse at least a partial solar eclipse without having to travel.\n\nApril's eclipse will also have longer period of totality than 2017 because of the moon's proximity to Earth. Totality is one of the shortest phases of an eclipse, and its duration is dependent on viewing location. Observers closest to the center of the path will experience the longest totality, and the length of that window decreases closer to the path's edge.\n\nIn 2017, skygazers glimpsing the longest totality experienced it for two minutes and 42 seconds near Carbondale, Illinois.\n\nThis year, an area about 25 minutes northwest of Torre\u00f3n, Mexico, will offer the longest totality at four minutes and 28 seconds, but people across Texas and even as far north as Economy, Indiana, will see totality that lasts longer than four minutes. And when the eclipse crosses into Canada, viewers can still expect to see totality for 3 minutes and 21 seconds.\n\nThe longest period of totality in recent history was seven minutes and 8 seconds, and it occurred west of the Philippines on June 20, 1955, according to the Guinness Book of World Records.\n\nWant to know what you'll see during the eclipse? Use our interactive map to determine where you'll be in the path. And don't forget to grab a pair of eclipse glasses to safely watch the event.\n\nWhile the eclipse is a treat for sky-gazers, the event also offers scientists an opportunity to study the sun in unique ways. And April's eclipse will allow scientists a special glimpse of the sun during one of its most active periods, called solar maximum.\n\nThe sun experiences a regular 11-year cycle of waxing and waning activity tied to when the star's magnetic field flips. The 2017 eclipse occurred as the sun neared solar minimum, when the star experiences less activity.\n\nExperts have predicted that solar maximum, the peak of solar magnetic field activity, will occur later this year. Scientists anticipate that exciting features resembling loops, streamers and bright curls will be visible in the sun's hot outer atmosphere, known as the corona, when the moon blocks the star's surface from view during the upcoming eclipse. The corona, which is fainter than the surface of the sun, is easier to see during an eclipse, allowing scientists to study it in greater detail.\n\nRELATED: Delta offers special flight along total solar eclipse path for ultimate viewing experience\n\nIt's also possible that an eruption of material from the sun's surface, called a coronal mass ejection, might be visible during the eclipse.\n\nSeveral experiments will fly aboard NASA's WB-57 high-altitude research aircraft during the eclipse to study the corona with the hopes of capturing new details about its structure across different wavelengths of light.", "source": {"uri": "abc7.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ABC7"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eclipse", "type": "wiki",

It's a completely different experience than a partial eclipse.\n\nOn April 8, the moon will \"totally\" block the sun, leaving the sun's outermost layer, the corona, visible to the naked eye -- like a glowing ring in the sky.\n\nBut there's another factor that makes this eclipse even more special.\n\nLike all solar eclipses, the moon sits between the sun and the Earth, but not all solar eclipses are the same. Unlike the total solar eclipse from August 21, 2017, the moon's shadow from this year's eclipse is larger because the moon is closer to the Earth.\n\nSkywatchers will not only get a glimpse of total darkness but a longer period of darkness as well. Darren Williams, professor of astronomy and astrophysics at Penn State Behrend, said Erie is close to the shadow's maximum length.\n\n\"Just about what it is, what it's going to be. It's going to be 150 miles across and it doesn't really get much larger than that. The length of time that we're under a total solar eclipse is 3 minutes and 40 seconds in Erie on April 8. And the longest you can be is around 4 minutes,\" said Williams.\n\nThe moon's orbit at the time of the eclipse will be near perigee, the point closest to Earth. But what if the moon's orbit is near apogee, the point farthest from Earth?\n\nIn that case, you may get an annular solar eclipse, like the one from this past October.\n\n\"If the moon is further from the Earth and then you line up the Earth, moon and sun, the moon is not going to cover the entire disk of the sun,\" said David Hurd, professor of astronomy at PennWest Edinboro. \"In that path of angularity, you're going to see the disk of the moon, but you're also going to see a ring or an annular around the sun. And that's what makes that an annular eclipse.\"\n\nOf course, safety is a top priority, and specially designed glasses are recommended to view the eclipse.\n\nWith the glasses on, you may also notice that the sun is near solar maximum.\n\n\"What that means for the casual observer is that hopefully, we'll see a lot of sunspot activity since we, hopefully all of us, will be observing the sun safely. Emphasis on safely using approved eclipse shades,\" Hurd added.\n\nMost of the country will, at the very least, view a portion of the eclipse. Major cities like Dallas and Cleveland will get to experience totality.", "source": {"uri": "localsyr.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NewsChannel 9"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_eclipse", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Solar eclipse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moon", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Moon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Earth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stellar_corona", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stellar corona"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronomy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Astronomy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naked_eye", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Naked eye"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erie,_Pennsylvania", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Erie, Pennsylvania"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Erie, Pennsylvania"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apsis", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Apsis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astrophysics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Astrophysics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pennsylvania_State_University", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pennsylvania State University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbit", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Orbit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PennWest_Edinboro", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "PennWest Edinboro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_maximum", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Solar maximum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunspot", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sunspot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glass", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Glass"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cleveland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Cleveland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Astronomy", "label": "dmoz/Science/Astronomy", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Energy/Renewable", "label": "dmoz/Business/Energy/Renewable", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Astronomy/Solar_System", "label": "dmoz/Science/Astronomy/Solar System", "wgt": 26}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Astronomy/Eclipses,_Occultations_and_Transits", "label": "dmoz/Science/Astronomy/Eclipses, Occultations and Transits", "wgt": 66}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Anomalies_and_Alternative_Science/Anomalous_Objects", "label": "dmoz/Science/Anomalies and Alternative Science/Anomalous Objects", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "news/Science", "label": "news/Science", "wgt": 65}], "image": "https://www.localsyr.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/63/2024/02/eclipse_map_2024_1920.png?strip=1&w=640", "eventUri": "eng-9364705", "sentiment": 0.05098039215686279, "wgt": 447617976, "relevance": 1}

(WSYR-TV) -- As we get closer to the total solar eclipse on Monday, April 8, you might be wondering where you can get eclipse glasses.\n\nDuring the solar eclipse, the moon will move across the sun, covering the light and making the sky look dark. Once the sun is covered completely, or under totality, it's okay to look at the sky, but before and after the eclipse, you should wear eclipse glasses to avoid eye damage.\n\nNewsChannel 9 spoke to Dr. James Forde, optometrist at Harbor Eye Associates in Oswego, who said staring at the sun during the solar eclipse without protective eye care can put you at risk for permanent eye damage.\n\n\"Anywhere that the retina was exposed to that level of energy, it can burn it permanently and hurt your rods and cones, which can give you bad central vision, distorted vision, and it can affect your color vision as well,\" said Dr. Forde.\n\nWhen buying eclipse glasses, you'll want to make sure you're buying from a reputable vendor and know how to identify the key markers that prove the glasses are eclipse-proof.\n\nThat's why NewsChannel 9 is making it easier for you and providing you with a list of total solar eclipse-proof glasses that the American Astronomical Society approves.\n\nAmerican Astronomical Society approved Solar eclipse glasses\n\n1. Rainbow Symphony\n\nAre you looking for affordable and stylish eclipse glasses? Rainbow Symphony has lots of options to choose from ranging in price from $7.95 to $19.95.\n\n2. Daystar Eclipse Glasses\n\nDaystar has a lot of different custom eclipse glasses including funny and unique designs and patterns. They also give you the option to buy glasses in bulk if you are hosting an eclipse viewing party or are a business or school that wants to give out glasses to hundreds of people.\n\n3. Thousand Oaks Optical\n\nIf you're looking to buy solar eclipse glasses in bulk, Thousand Oaks Optical is another approved seller of eclipse viewers.\n\n4. American Paper Optics Eclipse Glasses\n\nIf you want eclipse glasses that NASA uses, American Paper Optics is selling several different options for solar eclipse glasses.\n\n5. Celestron\n\nCelestron, a manufacturer of high-quality telescopes, telescope accessories, binoculars and sporting optics, is another good retailer for buying solar eclipse glasses. The company's EclipSmart Safe brand offers eclipse paper glasses, solar power viewers and premium glasses.\n\nHow can I make sure my solar eclipse glasses are safe?\n\nMake sure that wherever you buy, you're looking for glasses that are labeled \"ISO 12312-2\" and have an authentic ISO certification label.\n\nYour solar eclipse glasses should also state the following:\n\nIf you already bought glasses and want to make sure they are safe, the American Astronomical Society has a full list of suppliers of safe solar viewers & filters you can check here.

In fact, the view in New Hampshire, Vermont and Maine will be even better.\n\nYou don't have to be in the path of totality. There will be a little something for everyone in the United States that day.\n\nHowever, if you have the chance, I would HIGHLY recommend a road trip to experience what many describe as a once in a lifetime event.\n\nThe \"path of totality\" in the map below refers to the track across land where the sun will be completely covered by the moon. This is a relatively narrow path, only a little over 100 miles across at any given time. It will travel from Texas through the midwest and finally, pass right through northern New England.\n\nIn order to get underneath this narrow path of totality here in New England, you will need to head north.\n\nIn Maine, the path will stretch from about Rangely to Presque Isle.\n\nIn most of these locations, you will get only a few minutes in totality and the New England window is between 3:25 p.m. and 3:35 p.m.\n\nCan't get the day off? Down here in southern New England, we will experience more than 90% totality.\n\nIn Boston, the partial eclipse will begin at 2:16 p.m. and end at 4:39 p.m. with maximum (about 93%) occurring at 3:29 p.m.\n\nYou might be saying to yourself. - why would I bother driving 3 hours up north when I can get 93% right here in my backyard?\n\nTrust me, it is well worth the drive and effort!\n\nDuring a 93% totality, or even as high as 99% you will notice a crescent sun and a bit of a dimming of the daylight. It's kind of cool and kind of meh.\n\nOne-hundred-percent totality is a completely different and amazing experience! Day turns to night, and you see the amazing solar corona, essentially the darkness of the moon surrounded by a ring of fire.\n\nYou will not be disappointed!\n\nEither way, whether you are planning to travel to the path of totality or checking out a lesser, partial eclipse locally, you will need to get some eclipse glasses to protect your eyes.\n\nMake sure they are approved by the American Astronomical Society. They are pretty cheap, usually only a few bucks online.\n\nOf course, all of this will be for nothing if the weather doesn't cooperate on April 8th.\n\nAnd, as you would expect, New England has the least chance of clear skies of anyone in the country. April certainly isn't one of our sunnier months, especially up north. For this reason, lots of folks have planned vacations to Texas, where your chances are much greater.\n\nIf you miss this opportunity, you are going to have to wait a bit for the next chance, say about 55 years!\n\nThe next time our part of the world will experience a total solar eclipse will be May 1, 2079.\n\nThis one will occur around sunrise and just barely scrape portions of the northeast, including Boston!", "source": {"uri": "cbsnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CBS News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_eclipse", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Solar eclipse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_England", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New England"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New England"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maine", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Maine"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Maine"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_eclipse_of_April_8,_2024", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Solar eclipse of April 8, 2024"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronomy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Astronomy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moon", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Moon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massachusetts", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Massachusetts"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Massachusetts"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vermont", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Vermont"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Vermont"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Hampshire", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New Hampshire"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New Hampshire"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midwestern_United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Midwestern United States"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stellar_corona", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Stellar corona"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Astronomical_Society", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "American Astronomical Society"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crescent", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Crescent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunrise", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sunrise"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Romance", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Romance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Astronomy/Eclipses,_Occultations_and_Transits", "label": "dmoz/Science/Astronomy/Eclipses, Occultations and Transits", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Future/Millennialism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Future/Millennialism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Science", "label": "news/Science", "wgt": 69}], "image": "https://assets1.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2024/03/08/4ec2f6ad-ede7-4fc7-ba2b-4600bcb7718e/thumbnail/1200x630/a4e172c50173fd160f594dc991c8d653/eclipse1-copy.jpg?v=1aa56f6681ae17ea762db96c4c7bc003", "eventUri": "eng-9364705", "sentiment": 0.2470588235294118, "wgt": 447617674, "relevance": 1}

Pennsylvania residents have the opportunity to see the eclipse in it's totality.\n\nThe eclipse will begin over the South Pacific Ocean, with the first location that will experience totality being Mexico's Pacific coast around 11:07 a.m. PDT - weather permitting. The path will then continue on, entering the United States in Texas and travelling through Oklahoma, Arkansas, Missouri, Illinois, Kentucky, Indiana, Ohio, Pennsylvania, New York, Vermont, New Hampshire and Maine.\n\nThe eclipse will then enter Canada in Southern Ontario and continue through Quebec, New Brunswick, Prince Edward Island and Cape Brenton. At 5:16 p.m. NDT, the eclipse will exit continental North America on the Atlantic Coast of Newfoundland, Canada.\n\nWhere to catch the eclipse in Pennsylvania\n\nFor Pennsylvania residents looking to catch a look at the eclipse - you're in luck! The path of totality will cross over the northwestern part of the Commonwealth, touching Erie, Crawford, Warren and Mercer Counties.\n\nFor those counties, the partial eclipse will begin at 2:02 p.m., totality begins at 3:16 p.m., the maximum will be at 3:18 p.m., the totality will end at 3:20 p.m. and the partial will end at 4:30 p.m.\n\nDon't be discouraged though, if you don't live directly in the path of totality, 90% of Pa. lies within the coverage range. This means that, weather permitting, there should be excellent viewing across the state.\n\nHowever, all Pa. state parks and forests are welcoming people to watch the eclipse, even if you aren't in the path of totality.\n\nHow to watch a solar eclipse\n\nWhen watching an eclipse, viewers should first and foremost protect their eyes. Solar eclipse's can be amazing to look out, but without proper eyewear, you can suffer permanent eye damage.\n\nYou can protect your eyes using eclipse glasses or a handheld solar viewer that comply with the ISO 12312-2 international standard. You can view the eclipse directly without proper eye protection only when the moon completely obscures the sun's bright face, in other words, during totality. You'll know it's safe when you can no longer see any part of the sun through the eclipse glasses or a solar viewer.\n\nViewing the eclipse through a camera lens, binoculars or a telescope without specific solar filters will also cause eye injuries.\n\nThose within the path of totality will experience the total eclipse where the sky will darken for a short duration. This will last for a maximum of three minutes and 41 seconds.", "source": {"uri": "wtaj.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "WTAJ - www.wtaj.com"}, "authors": [{"uri": "hayden_thompson@wtaj.com",

If you are traveling to that stretch of totality, there's one thing you should not forget to pack: Certified eclipse glasses.\n\nEclipse glasses will be essential to view the event, and getting the right kind is critical to protect your eyes during a glance at the total solar eclipse. According to the American Astronomical Society (AAS), it's easy to get the right set -- but sometimes just as easy to get duped.\n\nInverse compiled a shortlist of the AAS recommendations to review before you buy a pair, as there could be grave consequences if you don't get the right ones.\n\nYou cannot use sunglasses (even 5 stacked on top of one another), smoked glass, unfiltered telescopes or magnifiers, and polarizing filters to watch the total solar eclipse, according to the American Optometric Association (AOA).\n\nDo not buy from Temu, eBay, or Amazon, the AAS writes. In these digital marketplaces, designed to highlight cheaper offers, you could be accidentally driven to purchasing a less expensive, and fake, product. There are often dupes. Many hit the market when demand is high, like now.\n\nThe eclipse glasses, handheld viewers, or adapted filters must say ISO 12312-2:2015 standard.\n\nISO is the French acronym for the International Organization for Standardization, a nongovernmental organization that sets standards for best practices in activities and manufacturing.\n\nISO awards the 12312-2 certification when eclipse glasses do a few things: They successfully block out harmful ultraviolet, visible, or infrared light from reaching our retinas. This is called transmittance, the ratio of light that makes it through a filter when compared to all the light that strikes us, called incidental light. But just as important, the glasses must do this uniformly. They've also got to be mounted on material with good surface quality.\n\nThe 2015 at the end represents the year the standard was adopted.\n\nTake the name of the product in your cart or your hands and cross-check with a meticulously-curated AAS list, so that you know the eclipse glasses come from a reputable manufacturer or one of their authorized dealers. The same goes for free viewers. If you have received eclipse glasses from an amateur astronomer or a museum, you can cross-check the manufacturer against the AAS list to confirm the eclipse glasses are legit.\n\n\"Unscrupulous vendors can grab the ISO logo off the internet and put it on their products and packaging even if their eclipse glasses or viewers haven't been properly tested. This means that just seeing the ISO logo or a label claiming ISO 12312-2 compliance isn't good enough,\" according to the AAS.\n\nIf the vendor claims to be new and wasn't a tried-and-true supplier during the recent solar eclipses in North America, don't buy. \"Any company worthy of your business should have established itself well before last October's annular solar eclipse across the Americas,\" wrote AAS officials, \"let alone well before this coming April's eclipse!\"\n\nIf you're going to bring a telescope, binoculars, or camera lens, check that you own the right solar filter. The piece must be designed to sit in the front. This ensures all the light that enters the telescope is safe for the eyes.

AccuWeather forecast says maybe", "body": "A total solar eclipse will cross North America in April. This animated map shows the path of totality across parts of Mexico, the U.S. and Canada. (Feb. 29) (AP Animation: Panagiotis Mouzakis and Marshall Ritzel)\n\nFloridians know the pain of eagerly looking forward to an amazing celestial spectacle -- meteor showers, rocket launches, super moons -- and only seeing clouds or even just a gray, featureless, overcast sky.\n\nNow one of the most amazing sights you can see is coming: a solar eclipse when the moon blots out the sun and leaves the land in eerie darkness. Will anyone in Florida be able to tell?\n\nAccording to AccuWeather's preliminary forecast, it's a qualified maybe. There's a risk of a storm system in April which may affect visibility, and a potential cold front.\n\nWill it be cloudy or overcast in Florida during the solar eclipse on April 8? What's the weather forecast?\n\n\"There is a good possibility that a cold front will be moving across the central and eastern U.S. near the time of the eclipse,\" said AccuWeather Lead Long-Range Forecaster Paul Pastelok in an email.\n\nThe timing and location of that front could mean clear or cloudy skies.\n\nThere's also a risk of a slow-moving storm system over the Southeast next month. \"If one of these systems forms, the duration of cloud cover can be longer with any system, leading to poor viewing,\" Pastelok said.\n\nWill El Ni\u00f1o affect the weather during the solar eclipse?\n\nEl Ni\u00f1o, a pattern of warmer than usual water in the Pacific Ocean that tends to reinforce a more moderate climate, is rapidly fading but still a factor in predicting eclipse weather, Pastelok said. Severe weather and rainstorms tend to ramp up in April as well.\n\nGenerally speaking, AccuWeather and the National Weather Service both predict a higher-than-usual chance for rain in Florida for the next three months.\n\nAccuWeather stresses that we are still a month out and any weather predictions must be taken with a huge grain of salt. Anyone living in Florida knows how quickly the weather can change.\n\nIf it's cloudy in Florida, will I be able to see the solar eclipse?\n\nUnless it's completely overcast or raining, you still should be able to some part of the eclipse. Even on a cloudy day, the sun peeks out between the clouds, and while it'll take a few hours from start to finish you only need a clear view of the eclipse for the three or four minutes the moon actually covers the sun.\n\nRemember, Florida won't get to see the total eclipse, we're not in the path of the totality which will move from the coast of Mexico diagonally northeast across continental North America. But everyone in Florida will see a partial eclipse with half to over 3/4 of the sun covered depending on where you are in the state. The closer to the western Panhandle, the more of an eclipse you'll see.\n\nIf it's not too cloudy, of course. But if you miss it, there's a total solar eclipse coming to Florida in 2045.\n\n2024 eclipse in the Sunshine State: Can you see the 2024 solar eclipse in Florida? Here are the best places to watch it\n\nWhich states will see the total solar eclipse?\n\nTexas, Oklahoma, Arkansas, Missouri, Illinois, Kentucky, Indiana, Ohio, Pennsylvania, New York, Vermont, New Hampshire and Maine, plus parts of Tennessee and Michigan, are all in the 115-mile-wide path of totality.\n\nTo see the exact path of totality, check out an interactive map created by French eclipse expert Xavier Jubier.\n\nSo far, AccuWeather predicts the best views of the eclipse may be in Southern Texas, areas of the Ohio Valley, and the Great Lakes region. Odds for cloudy weather are higher in the Mississippi and Tennessee valleys, with the Northeast U.S. having the worst odds of clouds on eclipse day.\n\nDo I need safety eclipse glasses if the sky is cloudy?\n\nYES. Do not look directly at the sun under any conditions. The cloud cover may not be enough to shield your eyes from immediate damage, and clouds might open up at any time.\n\nAlways wear ISO 12312-2 international standard eclipse safety glasses to look at an eclipse. Never look at an eclipse through a camera, a phone camera, a telescope or binoculars without rated lens filters on them.\n\nThe total eclipse will hit the coast of Mexico on April 8, 2024, around 11:07 a.m. PDT and leave the continental North America at 5:16 NDT. The partial eclipse will begin first as the edge of the moon becomes visible, and then about an hour and 20 minutes later the totality will begin and last for three or four minutes before the sun begins to appear again.\n\nIn Florida, residents should start to see the eclipse beginning around 1:35 p.m. EDT, with the midpoint at 2:55.", "source": {"uri": "eu.news-journalonline.com", "dataType":

That means at the height of the eclipse, we will only see just over 70% of the sun covered by the moon.\n\n\"So here in Colorado and in Denver, we will have what's known as a partial solar eclipse,\" said Dr. Yu. \"You might think of it as the moon taking a bite out of the sun.\"\n\nOn April 8, the eclipse will start at 11:28 a.m. here in the Denver metro. It will peak at 12:40 p.m. with about 71% of the sun covered by the moon. It will last two hours and 26 minutes, and will end at 1:54 p.m.\n\nMajor cities like Austin, San Antonio, Dallas in Texas; Indianapolis, Ind., Cleveland, Ohio, and Buffalo, N.Y., are in the direct path of totality.\n\nSome of the areas in the direct path of the solar eclipse will experience totality for upwards of four minutes -- that means the entire sun will be covered by the moon, making the sun corona visible.\n\n\"It's like the blackest hole in the sky that's surrounded by the sun's corona, its outer atmosphere,\" said Dr. Yu. \"So, you have a ghostly wreath of light that surrounds the sun, and then all around you the horizon is sort of like a sunset or sunrise where you see blue sky at the horizon. It fades through the sunlight, sunset colors into the dark of the sky.\"\n\nA total solar eclipse won't be visible in the United States again until 2044. That path of totality in that eclipse will only brush parts of Montana and North Dakota.\n\nIf you're waiting for a total solar eclipse to happen here in Colorado, you'll have to wait 21 years. That's when areas of Colorado south of I-70, will get to experience a total Solar eclipse, with the path of totality going right through our state.

maximum obscurement around 3:15 p.m. That \"maximum obscurement\" will be just shy of 80%, and 78.5% of the sun will be blocked by the moon in the Triangle, meaning you'll need those solar eclipse safety glasses to look at the eclipse without damaging your eyes.\n\nIf you want to drive and see the maximum eclipse, you'll have to drive about eight hours to central Ohio, just northwest of

The point of traveling into the path of totality -- that 115-mile-wide track across Mexico, the U.S. and Canada -- is to see the sun's spectacular white corona for a few minutes while it turns to night all around.\n\nClouds don't ruin everything during a total solar eclipse -- it still gets dark (arguably darker) -- but they are to be avoided if at all possible. The trouble is, that's not easy in early spring in North America. The chance of cloud cover -- not to mention snow and storms -- is higher than anyone wants to talk about. That applies everywhere along the path of totality.\"\n\n\"Nobody has a guarantee on this one -- even along the path with the best climate, you've still got a one-third chance of having some kind of cloud cover,\" said meteorologist Jay Anderson, who presents a climatological analysis of eclipse tracks on Eclipsophile. Anderson's website is consulted by eclipse chasers and tour companies offering trips to see central eclipses many years in advance. But its lessons can only go so far.\n\nWhere to see the 2024 total solar eclipse based on cloud cover forecasts is the number one question from all eclipse chasers -- and has been for months and years. But it's only half the story.\n\nThe old saying \"climate is what you expect, the weather is what you get\" describes the scenario whereby the eclipse chaser carefully studies historical cloud data -- typically satellite maps -- from years gone by in an effort to determine where it's most likely to be clear.\n\nFor April 8, that data suggests that the south and central U.S. are more likely to have a clear sky for the total solar eclipse. In short, that's Texas and Arkansas, but there's not much in it. For example, while Fredricksburg in the Texas Hill Country has a 49% chance of cloud cover on April 8, according to timeanddate, Dallas is 59%, Little Rock 57%, Indianapolis and Cleveland 60% and Buffalo 64%. It's not radically different away from the extremes -- Mazatlan on Mexico's Pacific Coast has a 28% chance of cloud, and in Newfoundland, Canada, it's 78%.\n\nWhat will happen on the day is anyone's guess -- and will be until around April 5 when the three-day forecasts come in. \"Three days ahead of time, you can get a pretty good idea where the decent weather will be,\" said Anderson. \"There's good luck involved.\"\n\nLook at cloud cover on satellite maps for the last 40 years -- as Anderson has -- and it reveals an annoying level of variation from year to year. For example, here's an image from April 8 last year (above), that confounds all expectations -- with clouds over Texas and a clear sky for almost all the rest of the path of totality.\n\nAnderson has studied satellite maps for early April, going back decades. \"There have been some days where the whole track as far north as New York State has been clear and others where everywhere down to the most southerly parts of Texas is clouded over,\" he said. However, the usefulness of these satellite images is limited. For starters, they weren't taken at the specific times that the eclipse will pass across each location. That will take 100 minutes on April 8.\n\nAnother spanner in the works is the fact that an eclipse wasn't going on when any of the satellite images were taken. So it's possible that \"eclipse cooling\" may take place, dissipating any convective cloud. After all, convective clouds are the result of the sun heating the land. Shut down that mechanism, and they're starved.\n\nEclipse cooling, however, can give, but it can also take. If there's a low cloud as the partial phases begin, the cooling can dissipate clouds. However, if there's cloud in the morning that burns off by eclipse time, the cooling brought on by the eclipse can actually cause clouds to return during the eclipse. Mountains and valleys are best avoided.\n\nFor all of its limitations, climatology is all we have, for now. Decisions need to be made and, for many eclipse chasers, they need not to change. If you need to quickly book an expensive hotel and flight to a city in the path of totality right now, it's not a decision that can be easily or affordably undone.\n\nIt's also true that a massive influx of people in the path totality could make roads so congested that the idea of driving around looking for gaps in the clouds is completely unworkable. \"People who really want to see the eclipse should be thinking about their personal circumstances,\" said Anderson.\n\nFor example, those in Texas Hill County -- ground zero for the eclipse -- may struggle to be mobile. \"People say that they're going to look at the weather and drive to where it's clear, but if you're one of 400,000 people doing that, are you really going to be able to move?\" he said. \"You may be better off just working with the climatology and positioning yourself, assuming that you're not really going to be able to move much.\" That could be down to crowds of motorists, but it could also be because you simply cannot abandon friends, relatives and loved ones to go driving around.\n\nThose that do have wheels and clear roads, however, may have the best chance on April 8 of a clear view of the sun's corona during totality. If the climatology of the eclipse track teaches us anything, there will be gaps. \"It's very seldom that everything everywhere was clouded out on historical satellite images,\" said Anderson. \"You may see that the chances of a clear sky for a specific location are slim, but you'll also see that if you had a 100-mile range, you would have been able to see the eclipse on eight out of the last 10 years.\"", "source": {"uri": "forbes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Forbes"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_cover", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label":

Here's why it's worth the watch and how to stay safe - WVUA 23", "body": "The sun is about to pull another disappearing act across North America, turning day into night during a total solar eclipse.\n\nThe peak spectacle on April 8 will last up to 4 minutes, 28 seconds in the path of total darkness -- twice as long as the total solar eclipse that dimmed U.S. skies in 2017.\n\nThis eclipse will take a different and more populated route, entering over Mexico's Pacific coast, dashing up through Texas and Oklahoma, and crisscrossing the Midwest, mid-Atlantic and New England, before exiting over eastern Canada into the Atlantic.\n\nAn estimated 44 million people live inside the 115-mile-wide path of totality stretching from Mazatl\u00e1n, Mexico to Newfoundland; about 32 million of them are in the U.S., guaranteeing jammed roads for the must-see celestial sensation.\n\nThe eclipse will allow many to share in the \"wonder of the universe without going very far,\" said NASA's eclipse program manager Kelly Korreck.\n\nHere's what to know about April's extravaganza and how to prepare:\n\nThe moon will line up perfectly between the Earth and the sun, blotting out the sunlight. It will slice a diagonal line from the southwest to the northeast across North America, briefly plunging communities along the track into darkness.\n\nFifteen U.S. states will get a piece of the action, albeit two of them -- Tennessee and Michigan -- just barely.\n\nAmong the cities smack dab in the action: Dallas; Little Rock, Arkansas; Indianapolis, Cleveland; Buffalo, New York; and Montreal -- making for the continent's biggest eclipse crowd.\n\nDon't fret if you don't have front-row seats. Practically everyone on the continent can catch at least a partial eclipse. The farther from the path of totality, the smaller the moon's bite will be out of the sun. In Seattle and Portland, Oregon, about as far away as you can get in the continental U.S., one-third of the sun will be swallowed.\n\nBy a cosmic stroke of luck, the moon will make the month's closest approach to Earth the day before the total solar eclipse. That puts the moon just 223,000 miles (360,000 kilometers) away on eclipse day.\n\nThe moon will appear slightly bigger in the sky thanks to that proximity, resulting in an especially long period of sun-blocked darkness.\n\nWhat's more, the Earth and moon will be 93 million miles (150 million kilometers) from the sun that day, the average distance.\n\nWhen a closer moon pairs up with a more distant sun, totality can last as long as an astounding 7 1/2 minutes. The last time the world saw more than seven minutes of totality was in 1973 over Africa. That won't happen again until 2150 over the Pacific.\n\nSunglasses won't cut it. Special eclipse glasses are crucial for safely observing the sun as the moon marches across the late morning and afternoon sky, covering more and more and then less and less of our star.\n\nDuring totality when the sun is completely shrouded, it's fine to remove your glasses and look with your naked eyes. But before and after, certified eclipse glasses are essential to avoid eye damage. Just make sure they're not scratched or torn.\n\nCameras, binoculars and telescopes must be outfitted with special solar filters for safe viewing. Bottom line: Never look at an exposed sun without proper protection any day of the year.\n\nTowns up and down the path of totality are throwing star parties. Festivals, races, yoga retreats, drum circles and more will unfold at museums, fairgrounds, parks, stadiums, wineries, breweries and even one of Ohio's oldest drive-in movie theaters and the Indianapolis Motor Speedway.\n\nBesides looking up, you can attend a \"space prom\" in Texas Hill Country, get married at eclipse-themed ceremonies in Tiffin, Ohio, and Russellville, Arkansas, or brush up on moonwalking history at the Armstrong Air and Space Museum in Wapakoneta, Ohio -- Neil Armstrong's hometown.\n\nAs the eclipse unfolds, NASA will launch small rockets with science instruments into the upper atmosphere from Virginia and chase totality's shadow from high-altitude planes. Satellites and the International Space Station crew will attempt to capture the show from space.\n\nThere will be numerous livestreams for those stuck with clouds or outside the path.\n\nFull solar eclipses occur every year or two or three, often in the middle of nowhere like the South Pacific or Antarctic. The next total solar eclipse, in 2026, will grace the northern fringes of Greenland, Iceland and Spain.\n\nNorth America won't experience totality again until 2033, with Alaska getting sole dibs. Then that's it until 2044, when totality will be confined to Western Canada, Montana and North Dakota.\n\nThere won't be another U.S. eclipse, spanning coast to coast, until 2045. That one will stretch from Northern California all the way to Cape Canaveral, Florida.\n\nAside from Carbondale, Illinois, in the crosshairs of both the 2017 and 2024 eclipses, it usually takes 400 years to 1,000 years before totality returns to the same spot, according to NASA's Korreck.\n\n___", "source": {"uri": "wvua23.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "WVUA23"}, "authors": [], "concepts":

In a partial solar eclipse, the moon only partially blocks the sun, so it can be observed an area that is thousands of kilometers wide.\n\nWatching a solar eclipse without proper eye protection can cause vision loss, including blindness, due to burning of the macula, which is part of the retina, the light-sensitive tissue at the back of the eye that enables people to read and recognize faces. Some individuals mistakenly believe that it is safe to view a total eclipse without eye protection during the time when the moon completely blocks the sun. However, totality of the eclipse lasts only about 1 to 3 minutes based on geographic location, and bright sunlight suddenly can appear as the moon continues to move. Even a few seconds of viewing the sun during an eclipse can temporarily or permanently burn the macula. Once retina tissue is destroyed, it cannot regenerate, resulting in permanent central vision loss.\n\nExact times and locations of the upcoming solar eclipse can be found at science.nasa.gov/eclipses/future-eclipses/eclipse-2024/where-when/. Worldwide, 8 total solar eclipses will occur in the next decade.\n\nNever view the sun or a total solar eclipse with the naked eye or by looking through binoculars, telescopes, or a phone camera. Sunglasses alone also are not safe. Make sure to supervise children using solar filters. Some safe ways to view an eclipse include\n\nA list of recommended solar filter vendors can be found at the American Astronomical Society's website.\n\nIndividuals with vision loss after viewing a solar eclipse should promptly visit an ophthalmologist, an eye doctor who can recognize symptoms and signs of solar burns on the retina. The diagnosis might be made on clinical evaluation or with diagnostic tests such as optical coherence tomography, a noninvasive imaging technique that can identify solar damage to the retina. There is no definitive treatment other than observation; sometimes individuals have partial recovery of vision.\n\nPublished Online: March 8, 2024. doi:10.1001/jama.2024.1302\n\nConflict of Interest Disclosures: Dr Ar\u00e9valo reported receipt of personal fees from AbbVie, Genentech, Springer, Elsevier, DORC, EyePoint, Iveric Bio, and Alimera Sciences and grants from Topcon.

Here's why it's worth the watch and how to stay safe - WTOP News", "body": "The sun is about to pull another disappearing act across North America, turning day into night during a total solar...\n\nThe sun is about to pull another disappearing act across North America, turning day into night during a total solar eclipse.\n\nThe peak spectacle on April 8 will last up to 4 minutes, 28 seconds in the path of total darkness -- twice as long as the total solar eclipse that dimmed U.S. skies in 2017.\n\nThis eclipse will take a different and more populated route, entering over Mexico's Pacific coast, dashing up through Texas and Oklahoma, and crisscrossing the Midwest, mid-Atlantic and New England, before exiting over eastern Canada into the Atlantic.\n\nAn estimated 44 million people live inside the 115-mile-wide (185-kilometer-wide) path of totality stretching from Mazatl\u00e1n, Mexico to Newfoundland; about 32 million of them are in the U.S., guaranteeing jammed roads for the must-see celestial sensation.\n\nThe eclipse will allow many to share in the \"wonder of the universe without going very far,\" said NASA's eclipse program manager Kelly Korreck.\n\nHere's what to know about April's extravaganza and how to prepare:\n\nThe moon will line up perfectly between the Earth and the sun, blotting out the sunlight. It will slice a diagonal line from the southwest to the northeast across North America, briefly plunging communities along the track into darkness.\n\nFifteen U.S. states will get a piece of the action, albeit two of them -- Tennessee and Michigan -- just barely.\n\nAmong the cities smack dab in the action: Dallas; Little Rock, Arkansas; Indianapolis, Cleveland; Buffalo, New York; and Montreal -- making for the continent's biggest eclipse crowd.\n\nDon't fret if you don't have front-row seats. Practically everyone on the continent can catch at least a partial eclipse. The farther from the path of totality, the smaller the moon's bite will be out of the sun. In Seattle and Portland, Oregon, about as far away as you can get in the continental U.S., one-third of the sun will be swallowed.\n\nBy a cosmic stroke of luck, the moon will make the month's closest approach to Earth the day before the total solar eclipse. That puts the moon just 223,000 miles (360,000 kilometers) away on eclipse day.\n\nThe moon will appear slightly bigger in the sky thanks to that proximity, resulting in an especially long period of sun-blocked darkness.\n\nWhat's more, the Earth and moon will be 93 million miles (150 million kilometers) from the sun that day, the average distance.\n\nWhen a closer moon pairs up with a more distant sun, totality can last as long as an astounding 7 1/2 minutes. The last time the world saw more than seven minutes of totality was in 1973 over Africa. That won't happen again until 2150 over the Pacific.\n\nSunglasses won't cut it. Special eclipse glasses are crucial for safely observing the sun as the moon marches across the late morning and afternoon sky, covering more and more and then less and less of our star.\n\nDuring totality when the sun is completely shrouded, it's fine to remove your glasses and look with your naked eyes. But before and after, certified eclipse glasses are essential to avoid eye damage. Just make sure they're not scratched or torn.\n\nCameras, binoculars and telescopes must be outfitted with special solar filters for safe viewing. Bottom line: Never look at an exposed sun without proper protection any day of the year.\n\nTowns up and down the path of totality are throwing star parties. Festivals, races, yoga retreats, drum circles and more will unfold at museums, fairgrounds, parks, stadiums, wineries, breweries and even one of Ohio's oldest drive-in movie theaters and the Indianapolis Motor Speedway.\n\nBesides looking up, you can attend a \"space prom\" in Texas Hill Country, get married at eclipse-themed ceremonies in Tiffin, Ohio, and Russellville, Arkansas, or brush up on moonwalking history at the Armstrong Air and Space Museum in Wapakoneta, Ohio -- Neil Armstrong's hometown.\n\nAs the eclipse unfolds, NASA will launch small rockets with science instruments into the upper atmosphere from Virginia and chase totality's shadow from high-altitude planes. Satellites and the International Space Station crew will attempt to capture the show from space.\n\nThere will be numerous livestreams for those stuck with clouds or outside the path.\n\nFull solar eclipses occur every year or two or three, often in the middle of nowhere like the South Pacific or Antarctic. The next total solar eclipse, in 2026, will grace the northern fringes of Greenland, Iceland and Spain.\n\nNorth America won't experience totality again until 2033, with Alaska getting sole dibs. Then that's it until 2044, when totality will be confined to Western Canada, Montana and North Dakota.\n\nThere won't be another U.S. eclipse, spanning coast to coast, until 2045. That one will stretch from Northern California all the way to Cape Canaveral, Florida.\n\nAside from Carbondale, Illinois, in the crosshairs of both the 2017 and 2024 eclipses, it usually takes 400 years to 1,000 years before totality returns to the same spot, according to NASA's Korreck.\n\nThe Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute's Science and Educational Media Group.

It will slice a diagonal line from the southwest to the northeast across North America, briefly plunging communities along the track into darkness.\n\nFifteen U.S. states will get a piece of the action, albeit two of them -- Tennessee and Michigan -- just barely.\n\nAmong the cities smack dab in the action: Dallas; Little Rock, Arkansas; Indianapolis, Cleveland; Buffalo, New York; and Montreal -- making for the continent's biggest eclipse crowd.\n\nDon't fret if you don't have front-row seats. Practically everyone on the continent can catch at least a partial eclipse. The farther from the path of totality, the smaller the moon's bite will be out of the sun. In Seattle and Portland, Oregon, about as far away as you can get in the continental U.S., one-third of the sun will be swallowed.\n\nWhy is totality longer?\n\nBy a cosmic stroke of luck, the moon will make the month's closest approach to Earth the day before the total solar eclipse. That puts the moon just 223,000 miles (360,000 kilometers) away on eclipse day.\n\nThe moon will appear slightly bigger in the sky thanks to that proximity, resulting in an especially long period of sun-blocked darkness.\n\nWhat's more, the Earth and moon will be 93 million miles (150 million kilometers) from the sun that day, the average distance.\n\nWhen a closer moon pairs up with a more distant sun, totality can last as long as an astounding 7 1/2 minutes. The last time the world saw more than seven minutes of totality was in 1973 over Africa. That won't happen again until 2150 over the Pacific.\n\nHow do I safely watch the eclipse?\n\nSunglasses won't cut it. Special eclipse glasses are crucial for safely observing the sun as the moon marches across the late morning and afternoon sky, covering more and more and then less and less of our star.\n\nDuring totality when the sun is completely shrouded, it's fine to remove your glasses and look with your naked eyes. But before and after, certified eclipse glasses are essential to avoid eye damage. Just make sure they're not scratched or torn.\n\nCameras, binoculars and telescopes must be outfitted with special solar filters for safe viewing. Bottom line: Never look at an exposed sun without proper protection any day of the year.\n\nWhere are some eclipse watch parties near me?\n\nTowns up and down the path of totality are throwing star parties. Festivals, races, yoga retreats, drum circles and more will unfold at museums, fairgrounds, parks, stadiums, wineries, breweries and even one of Ohio's oldest drive-in movie theaters and the Indianapolis Motor Speedway.\n\nBesides looking up, you can attend a \"space prom\" in Texas Hill Country, get married at eclipse-themed ceremonies in Tiffin, Ohio, and Russellville, Arkansas, or brush up on moonwalking history at the Armstrong Air and Space Museum in Wapakoneta, Ohio -- Neil Armstrong's hometown.\n\nAs the eclipse unfolds, NASA will launch small rockets with science instruments into the upper atmosphere from Virginia and chase totality's shadow from high-altitude planes. Satellites and the International Space Station crew will attempt to capture the show from space.\n\nThere will be numerous livestreams for those stuck with clouds or outside the path.\n\nWhen is the next total solar eclipse?\n\nFull solar eclipses occur every year or two or three, often in the middle of nowhere like the South Pacific or Antarctic. The next total solar eclipse, in 2026, will grace the northern fringes of Greenland, Iceland and Spain.\n\nNorth America won't experience totality again until 2033, with Alaska getting sole dibs. Then that's it until 2044, when totality will be confined to Western Canada, Montana and North Dakota.\n\nThere won't be another U.S. eclipse, spanning coast to coast, until 2045. That one will stretch from Northern California all the way to Cape Canaveral, Florida.\n\nAside from Carbondale, Illinois, in the crosshairs of both the 2017 and 2024 eclipses, it usually takes 400 years to 1,000 years before totality returns to the same spot, according to NASA's Korreck.", "source": {"uri": "newsday.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Newsday"}, "authors": [], "concepts":

Here's why it's worth the watch and how to stay safe", "body": "I agree to the Terms and Conditions, Cookie and Privacy Policies, and CASL agreement.\n\nThe sun is about to pull another disappearing act across North America, turning day into night during a total solar eclipse.\n\nThe peak spectacle on April 8 will last up to 4 minutes, 28 seconds in the path of total darkness -- twice as long as the total solar eclipse that dimmed U.S. skies in 2017.\n\nThis eclipse will take a different and more populated route, entering over Mexico's Pacific coast, dashing up through Texas and Oklahoma, and crisscrossing the Midwest, mid-Atlantic and New England, before exiting over eastern Canada into the Atlantic.\n\nAn estimated 44 million people live inside the 115-mile-wide (185-kilometer-wide) path of totality stretching from Mazatl\u00e1n, Mexico to Newfoundland; about 32 million of them are in the U.S., guaranteeing jammed roads for the must-see celestial sensation.\n\nThe eclipse will allow many to share in the \"wonder of the universe without going very far,\" said NASA's eclipse program manager Kelly Korreck.\n\nHere's what to know about April's extravaganza and how to prepare:\n\nWhat happens during the total solar eclipse?\n\nThe moon will line up perfectly between the Earth and the sun, blotting out the sunlight. It will slice a diagonal line from the southwest to the northeast across North America, briefly plunging communities along the track into darkness.\n\nFifteen U.S. states will get a piece of the action, albeit two of them -- Tennessee and Michigan -- just barely.\n\nAmong the cities smack dab in the action: Dallas; Little Rock, Arkansas; Indianapolis, Cleveland; Buffalo, New York; and Montreal -- making for the continent's biggest eclipse crowd.\n\nDon't fret if you don't have front-row seats. Practically everyone on the continent can catch at least a partial eclipse. The farther from the path of totality, the smaller the moon's bite will be out of the sun. In Seattle and Portland, Oregon, about as far away as you can get in the continental U.S., one-third of the sun will be swallowed.\n\nWhy is totality longer?\n\nBy a cosmic stroke of luck, the moon will make the month's closest approach to Earth the day before the total solar eclipse. That puts the moon just 223,000 miles (360,000 kilometers) away on eclipse day.\n\nThe moon will appear slightly bigger in the sky thanks to that proximity, resulting in an especially long period of sun-blocked darkness.\n\nWhat's more, the Earth and moon will be 93 million miles (150 million kilometers) from the sun that day, the average distance.\n\nWhen a closer moon pairs up with a more distant sun, totality can last as long as an astounding 7 1/2 minutes. The last time the world saw more than seven minutes of totality was in 1973 over Africa. That won't happen again until 2150 over the Pacific.\n\nHow do I safely watch the eclipse?\n\nSunglasses won't cut it. Special eclipse glasses are crucial for safely observing the sun as the moon marches across the late morning and afternoon sky, covering more and more and then less and less of our star.\n\nDuring totality when the sun is completely shrouded, it's fine to remove your glasses and look with your naked eyes. But before and after, certified eclipse glasses are essential to avoid eye damage. Just make sure they're not scratched or torn.\n\nCameras, binoculars and telescopes must be outfitted with special solar filters for safe viewing. Bottom line: Never look at an exposed sun without proper protection any day of the year.\n\nWhere are some eclipse watch parties near me?\n\nTowns up and down the path of totality are throwing star parties. Festivals, races, yoga retreats, drum circles and more will unfold at museums, fairgrounds, parks, stadiums, wineries, breweries and even one of Ohio's oldest drive-in movie theaters and the Indianapolis Motor Speedway.\n\nBesides looking up, you can attend a \"space prom\" in Texas Hill Country, get married at eclipse-themed ceremonies in Tiffin, Ohio, and Russellville, Arkansas, or brush up on moonwalking history at the Armstrong Air and Space Museum in Wapakoneta, Ohio -- Neil Armstrong's hometown.\n\nAs the eclipse unfolds, NASA will launch small rockets with science instruments into the upper atmosphere from Virginia and chase totality's shadow from high-altitude planes. Satellites and the International Space Station crew will attempt to capture the show from space.\n\nThere will be numerous livestreams for those stuck with clouds or outside the path.\n\nWhen is the next total solar eclipse?\n\nFull solar eclipses occur every year or two or three, often in the middle of nowhere like the South Pacific or Antarctic. The next total solar eclipse, in 2026, will grace the northern fringes of Greenland, Iceland and Spain.\n\nNorth America won't experience totality again until 2033, with Alaska getting sole dibs. Then that's it until 2044, when totality will be confined to Western Canada, Montana and North Dakota.\n\nThere won't be another U.S. eclipse, spanning coast to coast, until 2045. That one will stretch from Northern California all the way to Cape Canaveral, Florida.\n\nAside from Carbondale, Illinois, in the crosshairs of both the 2017 and 2024 eclipses, it usually takes 400 years to 1,000 years before totality returns to the same spot, according to NASA's Korreck.\n\n___\n\nThe Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute's Science and Educational Media Group.

This animated map shows the path of totality across parts of Mexico, the U.S. and Canada. (Feb. 29) (AP Animation: Panagiotis Mouzakis and Marshall Ritzel)\n\nThe 2024 total solar eclipse that'll cross the United States, including a small sliver of southeast Michigan, is exactly one month away. And while things can change (it's Midwest weather, after all), an early cloud forecast for April 8 paints a promising picture for sky gazers in the Great Lakes area.\n\nAs anticipation builds for the rare celestial event, meteorologists are diligently analyzing long-range forecasts to predict optimal viewing conditions along the path of totality, stretching from Maine to Texas, which includes a small area of Monroe County and much of northern Ohio.\n\nApril 8, 2024 weather outlook\n\nRight now, southern Texas and areas of the Ohio Valley and Great Lakes currently have the best chance of clear skies April 8 based on the latest data, according to AccuWeather meteorologist Paul Pastelok.\n\nOf course, clear skies are a must to be able to experience the eclipse at its best.\n\nThe forecasts are not predictions for whether April 8 will be cloudy overall, but rather if it will be cloudy for the four-minute window when the moon completely blocks out the sun.\n\nWhere in Michigan to view the 2024 eclipse\n\nIn Detroit, the eclipse will begin at 1:58 p.m. and reach maximum totality (99%), or coverage, around 3:14 p.m. It will conclude with a final partial eclipse at 4:27 p.m.\n\nWhile Michigan doesn't easily appear to be in the path of totality on the AccuWeather map, a NASA map shows that the path does run through the most southeastern corner of the state.\n\nErie Township will probably the best spot in Michigan to see the total solar eclipse with Eclipse2024.org listing it in the path of totality. Also on the list is Luna Pier, which is further north and closer to the path's edge.\n\nOne of the upsides to the long-range forecast is the temperature outlook for early April.\n\n\"At this point, we do not see any serious late-season cold weather, but it could be chillier across parts of the south-central Plains and Midwest, cooler across the mid-Atlantic and Northeast,\" Pastelok explained.",

Cincinnati Observatory hosting eclipse event closer to home", "body": "CINCINNATI -- Although the April 8 solar eclipse's path of totality lies north of Cincinnati, many who may be looking to enjoy the event closer to home can still watch the show from the Cincinnati Observatory.\n\n\"As we eagerly anticipate the spectacle of the upcoming solar eclipse, we encourage everyone to aim for totality, but we understand that not everyone may have the opportunity to travel,\" said Anna Hehman, executive director of the Cincinnati Observatory.\n\nThe observatory, located in Mount Lookout on Observatory Place, will host family-friendly activities on the day of the eclipse, including crafts, games, sundiial demonstrations and opportunities to watch the eclipse safely. Food trucks will also be on-site, or attendees can bring their own picnic lunch and enjoy the observatory grounds.\n\nThe eclipse will begin around 1:52 p.m., reach its peak at 3:09 p.m. and will end at 4:24 p.m., the observatory said.\n\nWhile the eclipse's spectacle may be more or less contingent on the weather, the observatory's event will not; they'll host attendees rain or shine.\n\n\"As we eagerly anticipate April 8, it's important to remember that our ability to witness the total solar eclipse hinges upon weather conditions,\" said Hehman. \"Cloudy or rainy skies can obscure the sun and prevent observers from seeing anything, so we are hoping for clear skies.\"\n\nThe observatory is also selling eclipse glasses, so those who'd prefer to make the trek north into the path of totality purchase pair before heading out.\n\nThe observatory's event is ticketed and will run $10 for adults, $5 for kids and $5 for observatory members. However, those proceeds go back to the observatory to help fund its mission to provide engaging and educational community programs about astronomy and space science.\n\nThe Cincinnati Observatory was the first public observatory built in the western hemisphere. It originally opened in Mount Adams in 1843 then, a few decades later, moved to Mount Lookout in 1873, and it's been there for the last 150 years.\n\nInside, it also houses the oldest continually-used telescope in the country.\n\nTri-State prepares for total solar eclipse to hit in 2 months More local news: Alexandria considers changes to laws on food trucks PD: Employee stabs person inside Walmart in Pierce Township Clifton Cultural Arts Center set for weekend grand opening", "source": {"uri": "wcpo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "WCPO"}, "authors": [{"uri": "felicia_jordan@wcpo.com", "name": "Felicia Jordan", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_eclipse", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Solar eclipse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observatory", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Observatory"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cincinnati", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cincinnati"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Cincinnati"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cincinnati_Observatory", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Cincinnati Observatory"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_truck", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Food truck"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Lookout,_Cincinnati", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mount Lookout, Cincinnati"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Mount Lookout, Cincinnati"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clifton,_Cincinnati", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Clifton, Cincinnati"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Hemisphere", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Western Hemisphere"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronomy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Astronomy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telescope", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Telescope"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walmart", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Walmart"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glass", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Glass"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Adams,_Cincinnati", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mount Adams, Cincinnati"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Mount Adams, Cincinnati"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexandria", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Alexandria"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Alexandria"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Egypt"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Astronomy", "label": "dmoz/Science/Astronomy", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Astronomy/Amateur", "label": "dmoz/Science/Astronomy/Amateur", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Astronomy/Observatories", "label": "dmoz/Science/Astronomy/Observatories", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Astronomy/Publications", "label": "dmoz/Science/Astronomy/Publications", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 75}], "image": "https://ewscripps.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/df62703/2147483647/strip/true/crop/640x336+0+46/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fmediaassets.wcpo.com%2Fphoto%2F2016%2F09%2F09%2Fsolar-viewing-Cincinnati_observatory_1473430286487_46022916_ver1.0_640_480.JPG", "eventUri": "eng-9364705", "sentiment": 0.3803921568627451, "wgt": 447609997, "relevance": 1}

The Alamo in San Antonio, Texas, for example, will hand out special viewing glasses shaped like the historic building.\n\n\"We encourage everyone to come to the Alamo,\" says Alamo Trust spokesperson Jonathan Huhn, who notes that past astronomical events have drawn thousands to the Alamo's plaza. \"We're hopeful to have another 5,000 people out in front of the shrine of Texas liberty to witness this beautiful celestial event.\"\n\nBut the Alamo is just outside the so-called path of totality -- that's the ribbon of land that stretches through 13 states, from Texas to Maine, that will see a total solar eclipse. During a total eclipse, the sun is completely obscured by the moon.\n\n\"We're not in the 100% area of totality,\" says Huhn, who says he thinks the sun will be around 99.9% obscured. \"It's very, very close.\"\n\nClose but no cigar, according to eclipse experts.\n\n\"I would never tell someone, '99% is close enough.' That's definitely not the case with a solar eclipse,\" says Michelle Nichols, who directs public observing programs at the Adler Planetarium in Chicago.\n\n\"Drive those last few miles to get into the path of totality,\" she urges. \"People go to total eclipses to get the full experience, and 99% will not get you the full experience.\"\n\n\"It's 100% or nothing,\" agrees Fred Espenak, a retired NASA astrophysicist who has experienced 30 total solar eclipses. \"There's such a radical, dramatic difference between a 99% partial and a 100% total. There's no comparison.\"\n\nDuring a total eclipse, the sky darkens suddenly and dramatically. The temperature drops. Stars come out. Beautiful colors appear around the horizon. And the once-familiar sun becomes a black void in the sky surrounded by the glowing corona -- that's the ghostly white ring that is the sun's atmosphere.\n\n\"It seems supernatural,\" says Espenak. \"It is so far beyond the scope of normal, everyday existence that it seems dream-like or hallucinogenic.\"\n\nA partial solar eclipse offers none of that magic, according to Rick Fienberg, the project manager for the American Astronomical Society's solar eclipse task force.\n\n\"Even at 99%, it gets no more dark than on a sort of typical overcast day,\" says Fienberg. \"You can have a 75% or 80% partial solar eclipse, and if you didn't know it was happening, you might not notice because the environment changes so little.\"\n\nThat's because the sun is just so incredibly bright that even a tiny exposed sliver can light up the sky -- or hurt your eyesif you're not wearing protective glasses. Only during the brief total eclipse phase when the sun is completely covered (which varies depending on your exact location but could be around four minutes) is it safe to look up toward the sun without special eye protection.\n\n\"The sun is about a million times brighter than the full moon,\" explains Angela Speck, an astronomer at the University of Texas at San Antonio. So if 99.9% of the sun is obscured, she says, there will still be \"a thousand times more light than the full moon, and so it's still bright.\"\n\nThe last time parts of the United States got to see a total solar eclipse, in 2017, the path of totality went over a lot of rural areas, says Nichols. This time, the path cuts through more urban areas.\n\nThat means while around 32 million people live in the path, many more live a short distance away.\n\nFor them, the difference between seeing a partial eclipse and seeing a total one may mean going across town.\n\n\"If you get right up to the path, but don't go that last, you know, a few hundred yards into it, you're going to have a very, very deep partial eclipse,\" says Fienberg. \"It will definitely get noticeably dark, but not near as dark as it will get at 100%. And you will not see the solar corona.\"\n\nPopular places located just outside the path of totality will have to decide what kind of event to hold that day, if any.\n\nThe San Antonio Zoo is on the side of the city that won't see a total eclipse. Unlike the nearby Alamo, it will focus on having pre-eclipse activities on the day before.\n\n\"We are hosting an Eclipse Prep event on Sunday instead of an event on Monday,\" zoo spokesperson Hope Roth told NPR by email, adding that astronomers will attend and free solar glasses will be available. \"We will encourage guests to visit the zoo, grab their glasses, and have a fun time while preparing for the Eclipse the following day.\"\n\nThe historic Cincinnati Observatory, which frequently holds sky gazing parties, will only see a 99.7% partial eclipse. Staffers there thought hard about whether or not to hold an eclipse celebration.\n\n\"For the longest time leading up to this eclipse, we had been committed to being closed,\" says executive director Anna Hehman, \"because totality, if the skies are clear, is within an hour of us.\"\n\nEventually, they decided to hold an event for those members of their community who, for whatever reason, couldn't travel to the path of totality.\n\n\"While we encourage everyone to head to totality if possible, we love that people want to be at the Cincinnati Observatory for out-of-this-world events like this one. So, if you can't head to totality, please join us,\" the observatory's website says.\n\nAfter all, a partial eclipse is still an interesting celestial event that people have observed since antiquity, even if it's not as dramatic.\n\n\"The buzz about solar eclipses is usually focused on totality, and witnessing a total eclipse is worthy of the hype. But the vast majority of people won't be in the path of totality,\" astronomy educator Shauna Edson, at the National Air and Space Museum, told NPR in an email.\n\nThat's why the museum is holding an eclipse celebration on the National Mall in Washington, D.C., which will see an 89% partial eclipse.\n\n\"This eclipse falls during cherry blossom season, so a lot of people will be visiting DC, and the Museum wanted to provide a space where they could enjoy the eclipse together,\" Edson noted, adding that participants will be able to enjoy the crescent-shaped shadows that form under trees and try out different methods for viewing the partial eclipse.\n\nAfter April 8, the contiguous United States won't see another total solar eclipse for 20 years. And the one that's coming in 2044 will only be visible from the less-populated states of North Dakota, South Dakota and Montana.", "source": {"uri": "kccu.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "KCCU 89.3

Half of Upstate is lucky enough to be in the path of totality -- the magnificent moment when the moon will completely shadow the sun, darkening the afternoon sky to eerie dusk.\n\nExperts are betting on Upstate, particularly Western New York, as one of the best places to catch the skyward show:\n\nNASA astronauts are planning on watching the eclipse at Niagara Falls. National Geographic has named watching the eclipse at the famous falls one of the coolest adventures of 2024. And officials are preparing for up to 1 million tourists to pour into Erie County.\n\nWhat day and time will the eclipse appear in Upstate New York?\n\nThe total solar eclipse will cross North America on Monday, April 8 -- starting in Mexico before moving over the United States and Canada.\n\nIn New York, totality will appear first in Jamestown in Western New York at 3:17 p.m. and last in Plattsburgh in the Adirondacks at 3:25 p.m. Within 13 minutes, it will all be over: Totality will end in Jamestown at 3:20 p.m. and in Plattsburgh at 3:29 p.m.\n\nBut while totality is the main event, it isn't the whole show.\n\nDuring the partial eclipse, which will precede and follow totality, viewers will have a chance to watch the moon gradually cover and uncover the sun.\n\n\"You'll see the moon gradually cross in front of the sun, making it look like larger and larger bites are being taken out of the sun's disk until the eclipse reaches its maximum point,\" according to the Planetary Society.\n\nThe partial eclipse greatly extends the show.\n\nIn Jamestown, the moon's journey will begin at 2:03 p.m. and end at 4:31 p.m. In Plattsburgh, the partial eclipse will start at 2:14 p.m. and finish at 4:37 p.m.\n\nWhich communities are in the path of totality?\n\nThe eclipse will cross over Western New York; parts of the Finger Lakes and Central New York; the North Country; and the Adirondacks -- a path that will stretch about 124 miles wide.\n\nThe communities slated to have a view of the celestial show include Alexandria Bay and Chautauqua; Geneva and Oswego; Sterling and Tupper Lake; Watertown and beyond. (Check out a long list of communities in the path and totality start times here.) That includes three of Upstate's biggest cities: Buffalo, Rochester and Syracuse.\n\nAt 3 minutes and 45 seconds, Buffalo's totality will be the longest. Romulus, in the Finger Lakes, is set to experience just 50 seconds.\n\nWhere should I watch the eclipse? Is there an event near me?\n\nNew York has fully embraced its status as one of the states in the path of the historic eclipse.\n\nCommunities and businesses across Upstate are organizing eclipse-themed events -- ranging from free watch parties in open fields to an all-inclusive package that includes skydiving over a waterfall during the eclipse.\n\nTo help you find the best way to celebrate, we compiled a list of over 80 ways to watch the eclipse across Upstate.\n\nPlan now: Many organizers are requiring registration, even for free events.\n\nWhat kind of glasses do I need to watch the eclipse? When do I need to wear them? When can I take them off?\n\nThis warning is worth repeating: Looking at the sun without solar eclipse glasses during the partial eclipse could permanently hurt your eyes.\n\nExperts urge eclipse watchers to don certified eclipse glasses during the partial eclipse, which will precede and follow totality. Even with the glasses on, NASA warns viewers not to look through a camera, binoculars or a telescope during the partial eclipse: That could melt the glasses' filter and lead to eye damage.\n\nMost importantly: Ensure the glasses you are buying are from a reputable vendor vouched for by the American Academy of Ophthalmology and meet the worldwide standard known as ISO 12312-2.\n\n(Read our full eclipse eye safety primer here.)\n\nWhen the brief moment of totality arrives, you can take off your glasses and safely drink in the moon-covered sight. But as soon as the moon begins to unshadow the sun, glasses must be put back on.\n\nHow is the eclipse going to impact traffic?\n\nA big influx of tourists is set to bring big traffic jams to Upstate New York.\n\n\"Expect heavy traffic before, during, & after the eclipse,\" the state Department of Transportation wrote Monday on Facebook. \"Don't be part of the congestion - get to your viewing spot early and leave late.\"\n\nCharles Fulco, a solar system ambassador for NASA and an avid eclipse chaser, has encouraged travelers to extend their hotel stays for a couple days after the eclipse to avoid getting stuck on impossibly snarled highways.\n\nThere is plenty to see in Upstate New York. Stay for a while!\n\nWhat are our chances of clear skies in Upstate New York on the day of the eclipse?\n\nCould cloudy skies ruin the historic party?\n\nNo place in the path of the eclipse's U.S. path is more likely to have clouds covering the sky than Syracuse. On a typical April 8, the chances of having clear skies are one out of four. (Eek!)\n\nThe chances aren't much better in other Upstate communities. Most cities in the path tend to have overcast or mostly cloudy skies on April 8, data shows.\n\nEven if clouds blot out the eclipse, it will still get dark. And there's always a chance the clouds will part at just the right moment -- giving a glimpse of the last eclipse to visit Upstate for 379 years.", "source": {"uri": "syracuse.com", "dataType":

This rare occurrence will traverse Mexico, the United States, and Canada. Although observers may assume it's harmless to gaze directly at the moon-covered Sun, NASA advises against doing so without specialized eye protection for this unique event.\n\nFortunately, if you reside near a Warby Parker store, you'll have the chance to get complimentary solar eclipse glasses. Alternatively, you can purchase them online, along with other recommended safe viewing glasses.\n\nRelated: NASA 'suggests' these $15 Walmart solar eclipse glasses for Upstate New Yorkers\n\nLooking at any portion of the bright Sun through a camera, binoculars, or telescope without a specialized solar filter affixed to the front of the optics can result in immediate and serious eye injury.\n\nWhile NASA does not approve of any particular brand of eclipse glasses, they do provide a list of brands that are considered safe when used properly. For brands to meet NASA's satisfaction, they must follow the safety requirements of the ISO 12312-2 international standard.\n\nThese glasses are certified by ISO and CE, ensuring they are safe for direct solar observation. They effectively filter out 100% of harmful ultraviolet and infrared rays, along with 99.999% of intense visible light. With these glasses, you can confidently observe a once-in-a-lifetime eclipse without worrying about potential eye damage. Constructed with scratch-resistant polymer material, the glasses boast an optical density of 5 or higher.\n\nOfficial Prevent Blindness Eclipse Eyeglasses - $14.99 (was $32)\n\nThese authorized solar eclipse eyeglasses from Prevent Blindness comply with all safety standards outlined in ISO 12312-2 and effectively shield against 100% of harmful UV and infrared light. Usage instructions are provided inside the cardboard frame, and the lenses ensure complete protection against harmful UV and infrared rays. Additionally, a portion of the proceeds from each sale contributes to supporting Prevent Blindness, a prominent volunteer organization dedicated to promoting eye health, preventing blindness, and preserving sight nationwide.\n\nVisiSolar Solar Eclipse Glasses - $10.01\n\nManufactured in the United States and endorsed by the American Astronomical Society, VisiSolar Glasses prioritize safety, ensuring the most secure and optimal viewing experience.\n\nSolar Eclipse Glasses 10 pack - $15\n\nThese shades, certified by CE and ISO for safe direct sun viewing, are crafted under rigorous safety and quality standards established by the American Astronomical Society.", "source": {"uri": "syracuse.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "syracuse"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_eclipse", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Solar eclipse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glasses", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Glasses"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASA", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "NASA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Organization_for_Standardization", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "International Organization for Standardization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Sun"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical_filter", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Optical filter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Upstate_New_York", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Upstate New York"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walmart", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Walmart"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexico", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mexico"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Mexico"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "\u0a15\u0a48\u0a28\u0a47\u0a21\u0a3e"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "\u0a15\u0a48\u0a28\u0a47\u0a21\u0a3e"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binoculars", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Binoculars"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Optics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infrared", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Infrared"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telescope", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Telescope"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultraviolet", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ultraviolet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Era", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Common Era"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lens", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lens"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absorbance", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Absorbance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Astronomical_Society", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "American Astronomical Society"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eclipse", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Eclipse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Polymer"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Astronomy", "label": "dmoz/Science/Astronomy", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Astronomy/Solar_System", "label": "dmoz/Science/Astronomy/Solar System", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Astronomy/Amateur", "label": "dmoz/Science/Astronomy/Amateur", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Astronomy/Eclipses,_Occultations_and_Transits", "label": "dmoz/Science/Astronomy/Eclipses, Occultations and Transits", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Astronomy/Education", "label": "dmoz/Science/Astronomy/Education", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Science", "label": "news/Science", "wgt": 70}], "image": "https://www.syracuse.com/resizer/Zs3IxQVv1Z5lhmJFZAGfw3K39O0=/1280x0/smart/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/advancelocal/2GL4UYVUH5AS7BLOM55SN64AX4.png", "eventUri": "eng-9364705", "sentiment": 0.4274509803921569, "wgt": 447609240, "relevance": 1}

The superintendent is concerned that without the proper equipment, the eclipse could damage the students' eyes.\n\nAccording to the address the district physician echoed the same concerns that were brought up by Block.\n\nThe Livingston Board of Education approved the decision on Wednesday as the elementary school and high school be let out at noon, and the Mount Pleasant and Heritage middle schools will be dismissed at 12:45.\n\nNew Jersey will not be in the direct path for the best view of the eclipse, but residents can still get a view depending on the weather on April 8.

That's right millions will be coming to the great state and hundreds of thousands will be smack dab in the middle of Central Texas, where I live. Honestly, I can understand the fascination that everyone has with the eclipse and you want to be able to experience this moment with all types of people around the world, but here's the thing, that's not always a good thing even though we want a positive response to the eclipse doesn't mean we will necessarily receive it.\n\nI know you're probably thinking to yourself, this particular event will be so cool and amazing so why wouldn't people want to just have a good time? The reality of it is some individuals are just jerks and jerks make it dangerous for you to walk around comfortably sometimes. I hate to sound like a Debbie downer but the reality of it is hundreds of thousands of people in one space is already overwhelming. What do you think will happen when millions are in the same place? Everyone's not gonna be on their best behavior. I've suggested before that if you already live in the great state of Texas, you need to go ahead and get your water, gas, batteries, and food supplies because something tells me that's going to run out very quickly.\n\nEven if the people who come and visit Texas aren't on their worst behavior, certain things can still be a burden during the eclipse like damage when looking directly at the eclipse, heat strokes happen, especially with so many people in one space at one time, traffic accidents, because of the sudden darkness and even disruption to wildlife happen when an eclipse takes place. I know people are more interested in the actual eclipse itself but please keep in mind that anytime they're sudden darkness during a solar eclipse an individual is disoriented. Stay safe out there, Texas, properly prepared, and hopefully, we can all enjoy the eclipse.", "source": {"uri": "kpel965.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "KPEL 96.5"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eclipse", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Eclipse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smack_(ship)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Smack (ship)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_battery", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Electric battery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_eclipse", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Solar eclipse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stroke", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Stroke"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wildlife", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wildlife"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Astronomy/Eclipses,_Occultations_and_Transits", "label": "dmoz/Science/Astronomy/Eclipses, Occultations and Transits", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://townsquare.media/site/513/files/2024/03/attachment-eclipse-beware.jpg?w=1200&h=0&zc=1&s=0&a=t&q=89", "eventUri": "eng-9364705", "sentiment": 0.3333333333333333, "wgt": 447608572, "relevance": 1}

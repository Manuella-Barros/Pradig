Locked again at an even score in a game that will go to penalties if tied, England kept on the offensive. Phil Fodeen had a near chance at a goal that was stopped at the last possible second from going in.\n\nIn the 22nd minute, Bukayo Saka took a pass on the right side from Foden, dribbling toward and into the box. Meanwhile, Foden ran after giving the ball up to his teammate, sprinting at the post. Foden was able to break past the Netherlands fullback Nathan Ake, while the centerback Virgil van Dijk was more interested in Saka's possession.\n\nSaka passed back to Foden, who corralled the pass and shot it. He got it past the goalkeeper in a mere sliver of space available, only for a crashing Netherlands fullback Denzel Dumfries to stop the ball right on the line.\n\nHere's a video of the exciting sequence:\n\nAnd for good measure, here's where the ball tracking tech says the soccer ball was, and how close it was to being a goal:\n\nWow. It's tough to get much closer than that.\n\nSome other fun notes from the sequence: The fullback Foden dribbled past is his teammate at Manchester City. Virgil van Dijk plays for Liverpool, a rival of Foden's and Manchester City's during club play.

Kane jumped into of Watkins as other players rushed to join them.\n\nSouthgate, who was on the receiving end of cups being thrown at him by England fans earlier in the tournament, did not miss the opportunity to celebrate in style, clinching his fists and punching the air.\n\nThe England players joined their friends and family in the stands after the match, including the decisive goal scorer Watkins.\n\nBBC's Alan Shearer was quick to praise the decision making of Southgate, having previously being criticial earlier in the tournament. He said: \"I was wondering when the changes were going to happen. The changes were right and they were perfect.\n\nWhat a night for Watkins and England.\"\n\nThe ITV pundit's celebrated Watkins' goal, apart from Roy Keane who was less enamoured than Gary Neville and Ian Wright.\n\nKeane was then quick to urge caution ahead of Sunday's final against Spain.\n\n\"I think they [England] deserve huge credit, they keep coming up with all the answers. Obviously Holland done well in the second half trying to suffocate England.\n\n\"When the subs came on they found a way to win. They've had plenty of luck, even the penalty today.\n\n\"They obviously have big personalities there and a desire to keep going, they kept playing their game. Well deserved...\n\n\"I think Spain are brilliant to watch, the way they keep possession and they've got some brilliant young players. When you analyse the game last night against a French team who weren't really at it, the French had some good chances.\n\n\"I'd have Spain as favourites, but sometimes you think things are written in the stars for this England team. When you think of it, they should have been out of it a week or so ago, they've now got momentum and you're talking about the mindset of the players.\"", "source": {"uri": "ca.sports.yahoo.com",

EUROS DAILY. Available wherever you get your podcasts\n\nGary Neville and Ian Wright were unable to contain their excitement as Ollie Watkins booked England's spot in Sunday's Euro 2024 final against Spain.\n\nThe Aston Villa striker was brought on as a late substitute by Gareth Southgate as England struggled to break their 1-1 deadlock with the Netherlands in the second-half.\n\nXavi Simons had opened the scoring Ronald Koeman's side after just seven minutes with a superb strike which proved too much for Jordan Pickford to keep out, but Harry Kane was able to step up and score from the spot after England were handed a somewhat contentious penalty 11 minutes later.\n\nBut still chasing a result in normal time, Southgate rolled the dice and brought on Watkins and Chelsea starlet Cole Palmer.\n\nThe formern Manchester City academy graduate set up Watkins' winner with a pinpoint-accurate pass, which the Villa man duly buried in the bottom corner - prompting wild celebrations from Neville and Wright in the ITV studio.\n\nRoy Keane (background centre) opted not to join in with Ian Wright (foreground) and Gary Neville's (centre) celebrations\n\nThe two former England internationals ran riot in the ITV studio when Ollie Watkins scored\n\nKeane cut a remote figure as Neville and Wright shouted themselves hoarse after the goal\n\nPodcast All episodes PODCAST: Have England been playing with fear as Southgate suggests?

I knew as soon as he got the ball he was going to play me and then you've got to be greedy: touch and finish.\n\n'And when I seen it go in the bottom corner... oh my life.\n\n'I'm lost for words, when you score there's emotions that come through your body but this is just a different feeling it was like slow motion. I didn't want to leave the pitch I just wanted to soak it all in. I don't think I've hit a ball that sweet.'\n\nWatkins also discussed his travails featuring in the England squad in Germany, but failing to get minutes as Southgate kept the faith with his favoured starting XI.\n\nWatkins' immaculately struck effort benefitted from Cole Palmer's pass - which the striker had predicted ahead of their substitutions\n\nThe Aston Villa striker said after the final whistle that he was keen to 'enjoy every minute' of his Euros experience\n\n'I didn't think I would be doing it in a tournament like that,' Watkins admitted. 'I never thought I would be playing in the Euros for England. You can dream but I'm a realist, I take it day by day.\n\n'I've put in a lot of hard work to get to this point. I'm going to enjoy every moment.\n\n'Recently I have obviously got a bit frustrated. I don't like to be on the bench, I have had the best season of my career. A few friends messaged me and said be patient and the amount of people who messaged me tonight saying I would score when I come on was ridiculous.\n\n'Hopefully they can do the same for the final or give me the lottery numbers!'", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Mail Online"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gareth_Southgate", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gareth Southgate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gary_Neville", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gary Neville"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ian_Wright", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ian Wright"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Euro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "England"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "England"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roy_Keane", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Roy Keane"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ITV_(TV_network)", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "ITV (TV network)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ollie_Watkins", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Ollie Watkins"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cole_Palmer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cole Palmer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xavi_Simons", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Xavi Simons"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jordan_Pickford", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jordan Pickford"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Kane", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Harry Kane"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester_City_F.C._EDS_and_Academy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Manchester City F.C.

Savino, whose real first name was Brenda, began performing acrobatics and dance at a theater when she was just a child in Dartford, England, about 20 miles from London, because she was \u201calways hanging upside down.\u201d She was a fixture in theaters by the time she was a preteen. \u201cI appeared in many shows as a young child and at 12 I became a professional,\u201d Savino, who lives in Rockland County, said. \u201cI took an audition and was immediately employed.\u201d She began working with a group of 12 girls on the Isle of Man \u2014 between England and Ireland \u2014 \u201cdoing mostly dancing and acrobatics.\u201d By the time she was 15, she was touring England with a partner. Sometimes, after finishing a Saturday night show the group would travel to its next gig by train. Savino was so small she would sleep on top of the luggage rack. \u201cI adored it up there,\u201d she said. She would eventually perform with singer Petula Clark and English comedians Dudley Moore and Peter Cook, among others. When she was 19, she auditioned for the Windmill Theatre in London, where her first name was changed because the company already had a Brenda. \u201c\u2018Well she looks like Peter Pan,\u2019\u201d one of the adults said of the girl with a blonde, pixie haircut. \u201c\u2018That\u2019s it. She\u2019s Wendy.\u2019\u201d While there, she did a contortionist act with her friend, Sadie, where Savino would coax her body into backbends and splits. But that grew old after a time so they both learned a trapeze act. The expert who taught them told the teens to stick their feet out when they dove down to the trapeze instead of pointing their toes. \u201cThen, when you fall forward your feet catch the ropes on either side and you\u2019re hanging by your feet,\u201d she recalled the acrobat saying. \u201cI threw myself forward and he just puts his arms up, grabs my shoulders, tips me over and I land on my feet.\u201d The teens learned the act and the theatre began sending them to entertain the troops in promotional appearances. \u201cWe were rehearsing and practicing all over, anywhere,\u201d she recalled. She eventually bought a Vespa to get around from show to show, she said, and that led her to entering a race on the Isle of Man. Her reflexes were great from all the dancing, she said, but her fearlessness helped her the most. \u201cI won the race,\u201d she said, explaining that she was crowned Scooter Queen of 1959. At one point, she took a ship to Casablanca in Morocco to perform in the casinos there. The ship fare was free as long as she and her contortionist pal Lizzie performed on board. \u201cOur payment was to appear on a boat that is rocking and you are on a table on top of another girl,\u201d she recalled. \u201cAs I did the back summersault, the boat came up and broke my toe. I had to keep performing.\u201d Along the way, she also worked in the famous Moulin Rouge in Belgium, where she often danced the high-kicking, leg revealing can-can that was popular in French cabarets. She also met the husband who would eventually sweep her off to America. \u201cThe owner came and said there\u2019s an American out front who\u2019d like to meet you,\u201d she said, recalling that she put her foot down, \u201cI\u2019m here to entertain on stage.\u201d When the \u201cthe loud, noisy American\u201d persisted, she finally agreed to meet him. The man was Joseph Savino and she moved to an apartment on Westchester Avenue in the Bronx to be with him in 1963 and waited four years to marry him. Savino later became the boss of the Bronx GOP. Among her first NYC observations: nobody said \u201cplease or thank you,\u201d she recalled. But the city grew on her and she settled in to have two sons in Pelham Manor, where she was known as the cool mom who walked on her hands around the pool and told the kids to get up and try again when they fell off the monkey bars. She never performed on stage again but had a trapeze in the backyard of her Westchester County home. She has no doubt her experience as a gymnist helped her survive being shot in her face, back, arm, chest and right eye, which she lost. \u201cI was very strong,\u201d she said of playing dead in the front seat of her 1976 Jaguar\u2019s bucket seat until she could escape Berkowitz that day. \u201cI knew if I could just hold on I\u2019d be O.K.\u201d", "summary": "The newly-revealed first victim of the Son of Sam\u2019s murderous rampage in NYC 48 years ago credits her survival in the nearly fatal attack to her time growing up in Europe as a trapeze artist.", "url": "https://nypost.com/2024/06/08/us-news/son-of-sams-first-victim-was-a-contortionist-trapeze-artist/", "image": "https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/06/newspress-collage-sdzwpj7g8-1717854789350.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&1717840577&w=1200", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-08 14:07:41", "author": "Tina Moore", "authors": ["Tina Moore"], "language": "en", "source_country": "us", "sentiment": -0.219}

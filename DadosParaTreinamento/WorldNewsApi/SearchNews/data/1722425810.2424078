Who wouldn\u2019t want to go behind the scenes of all the action there? And, with all the best touring acts having performed there, too, it\u2019s like you\u2019ll be breathing the same air as Jimmy Butler and Beyonc\u00e9. Feel the heat! Alex Miranda: [Plays with ball, then throws] \u201cOh, my God!\u201d Up close and very personal. Julian Sanchez: \u201cEveryone is, \u2018I\u2019m not washing my hands! I just touched Jimmy Butler\u2019s locker!\u2019 You know?\u201d [Alex laughs.] At the Kaseya Center in downtown Miami. Julian Sanchez: \u201cThat\u2019s actually our mascot\u2019s locker room.\u201d A new, hour-long, behind-the-scenes, all-access guided tour. Julian Sanchez: \u201cEverybody wants to be that VIP, wants to feel special. We are now opening the doors for everyone to feel that way.\u201d Heat fans, or fans of any major touring artist. Alex Miranda: \u201cMadonna didn\u2019t want to look at the bathroom when she worked out, so she built this, like, beautiful door here.\u201d Now, you can walk the same hallways. And, in this practice court\u2026 Julian Sanchez: \u201cIf anyone wants to check their wingspan, it\u2019s right there.\u201d Even shoot the same shots. Julian Sanchez: \u201cYeah, it\u2019s a free throw right there.\u201d Guest: [Shoots and scores] Man, these guys are good! But not as good as the guys who use this locker room. Julian Sanchez: \u201cThere\u2019s also going to be a locker that\u2019s open to all fans, so you\u2019re going to be able to sit like a player and take a photo.\u201d This area is for PT and that is, um, James Brown. You\u2019ll also get to see the control room. Julian Sanchez: \u201cWe have some of the newest technology in all of sports, so it\u2019s something really great to see, the brains of the entire building.\u201d Tour guides also drop celebrity tea. Julian Sanchez: \u201cThe things that you wouldn\u2019t know unless you worked here for a really long time.\u201d Alex Miranda: \u201cCan you tell me exactly where Beyonc\u00e9 has been?\u201d Jordan: \u201cHa!\u201d Like in the visitors\u2019 locker room. Julian Sanchez: \u201cMost recently, Bad Bunny was here. He turned this into his game room and his barbershop. He had a pool table right here where we were standing, a dominoes table, and in the corner, he set up a barbershop for him and his boys.\u201d Alex Miranda: \u201cEy!\u201d Play basketball star or reporter in the media room. Alex Miranda: \u201cNathan, what do you think about the tour?\u201d Nathan: \u201cIt\u2019s amazing.\u201d Alex Miranda: \u201cAre you going to be a basketball player when you grow up?\u201d Nathan: \u201cYeah.\u201d Alex Miranda: \u201cWho\u2019s your favorite player?\u201d Nathan: \u201cJimmy Butler.\u201d And play bougie in the Bacardi Ocho Lounge, before walking away with at least one souvenir. Julian: Those photos will be available for you to download for free.\u201d Julian Sanchez: For an adult, it\u2019s gonna be $39.99. For a child, it\u2019s $24.99. We have spots all the way through September.\u201d FOR MORE INFO: Kaseya Center All-Access Tour601 Biscayne BlvdMiami, FL 33132universe.com/events/kaseya-center-all-access-tour-tickets-82ZSY4 Copyright 2024 Sunbeam Television Corp.

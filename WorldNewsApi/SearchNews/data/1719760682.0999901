However, Lee Moffat\u2019s 186-day prison sentence meant he got released on the day he received the jail term. This was because Moffat was remanded on February 20 after being caught with the \u201csharply pointed\u201d piece of glass at Paisley Gilmour Street railway station on November 20 last year. The procurator fiscal depute told Paisley Sheriff Court: \u201cAround 2.15pm, police on duty were called to Paisley Gilmour Street railway station due to concerns for the accused. \u201cWhen they arrived, they noted the accused to be under the influence of drugs with diluted pupils. Officers approached the accused and he was detained for a search. \u201cIn the course of the search they recovered a three-inch piece of broken mirror glass in his right jacket pocket. The accused claimed he used that glass for shaving. \u201cThe glass was seized, the accused was arrested and taken to Greenock police station where he was processed and made no reply to caution and charge. \u201cHe then appeared on February 20 at this court in relation to the matter and was remanded in custody.\u201d A photograph of the glass was shown to the court. It was noted Moffat was subject to four separate bail orders at the time of the offence, all previously granted at Greenock Sheriff Court. Moffat also faced a charge which alleged he was in possession of bromazolam, a Class C drug, on the same date. His plea of not guilty to this charge was accepted by the Crown. Defence agent Aidan Gallagher told the court Moffat had spent 93 days on remand for this matter equating to a 186-day prison sentence while Sheriff Eoin McGinty stated: \u201cThe only appropriate sentence is a custodial sentence.\u201d Moffat was given a sentence of 210 days reduced to 186 days, backdated to his remand date.

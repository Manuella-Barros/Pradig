Wembanyama won over several candidates, including Rockets' Amen Thompson.\n\nGiven his slow start to his career, Thompson may not have been a qualified candidate due to injuries and an illness.

Last offseason, in 2023, after three straight rebuilding years during which the team averaged only 20 wins, the Rockets entered the summer with clear needs for a playmaker and a center and a bundle of cash under the salary cap to go spending. But after signing veteran point guard Fred VanVleet, and with the emergence of third-year center Alperen Sengun, the Rockets' starting lineup heading into next year appears to be set.\n\nThe team's biggest hole last season was at backup center. General manager Rafael Stone signed veteran Jock Landale to a four-year, $32 million contract to add depth at the position, but apart from some signs of life towards the end of the year, Landale was largely a disappointment in his debut season for the Rockets. For much of the year, Houston employed veteran forward Jeff Green, signed to a two-year, $16 million contract, as Sengun's backup. Heading into the trade deadline, the team was linked in trades to centers Clint Capela, Robert Williams III, and Daniel Gafford, but ultimately moved to acquire veteran center Steven Adams from the Memphis Grizzlies for the minimal cost of just Victor Oladipo's expiring contract, two 2024 second round picks, and one 2025 second round pick.\n\nWhile Adams was not available to suit up following the trade due to recovering from knee surgery (performed prior to the start of the season), the Rockets secured their backup for next season at a very affordable cost. Adams, 31, is slated to earn $12.6 million next season; he can become an unrestricted free agent in 2025-2026. In theory, he is still young enough to be retained as the team's long term veteran backup, similar to the roles played by Dikembe Mutombo and Nene during previous Rockets eras.\n\nThe roster is at least two deep at every other position; it could possibly even be argued that there are not enough minutes to go around for the Rockets' core prospects. Jalen Green, Jabari Smith Jr., and Dillon Brooks round out the starting lineup next to VanVleet and Sengun and all three are expected to maintain their starting roles in 2024-2025. Sophomores Amen Thompson and Cam Whitmore both had highly promising rookie campaigns and will both need more minutes to continue their development. Thompson spent the bulk of his time last season serving as a wing, particularly after Sengun was lost for the year following a severe ankle injury.\n\nAnd then there is Tari Eason, arguably the team's most productive player, with its highest net rating. Eason missed most of the year due to a lower leg injury. In most situations, he likely would be a starter given his productivity but he is behind Smith, a former third overall pick, on the team's depth chart. Could Eason eventually supplant Brooks at small forward?\n\nWhat this team could use is shooting. The Rockets were just 23rd overall in the league from long distance, connecting at a rate of just 35.2%. That would do more than anything to aid their anemic offense (just 20th overall with an offensive rating of 113.7). The Rockets are armed with the non-taxpayer midlevel exception to go hunting in free agency. One thing is clear: the needs are not as clear as they were last summer.", "source": {"uri": "forbes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Forbes"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steven_Adams", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Steven Adams"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jock_Landale", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Jock Landale"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rafael_Stone", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rafael Stone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alperen_\u015eeng\u00fcn", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Alperen \u015eeng\u00fcn"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fred_VanVleet", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fred VanVleet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salary_cap", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Salary cap"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Houston_Rockets", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Houston Rockets"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_manager", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "General manager"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starting_lineup", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Starting lineup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point_guard", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Point guard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Williams_III", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Robert Williams III"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Gafford", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Daniel Gafford"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clint_Capela", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Clint Capela"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeff_Green_(basketball)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jeff Green (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dikembe_Mutombo", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dikembe Mutombo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball_positions", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Basketball positions"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memphis_Grizzlies", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Memphis Grizzlies"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nen\u00ea", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nen\u00ea"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Houston", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Houston"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Houston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jabari_Smith_Jr.", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jabari Smith Jr."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tari_Eason", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tari Eason"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jalen_Green", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jalen Green"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rookie", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rookie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_agent", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Free agent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dillon_Brooks", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dillon Brooks"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Robotics/Competitions", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Robotics/Competitions", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Models/Rockets", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Models/Rockets", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Airsoft/Teams", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Airsoft/Teams", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Show_Basketball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Show Basketball", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 92}], "image": "https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/65cc12d48b367c87f18fb58f/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=600&width=1200&fit=bounds", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9553203", "eventUri": "eng-9553203", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.06666666666666665, "wgt": 173, "relevance": 1}

The 90s belonged to MJ and his crew, but the Houston Rockets managed to steal two from under their noses. To be fair, Michael Jordan was out of the league for the time that the Rockets and Hakeem Olajuwon took over.\n\nOver the years, Jordan has clarified that if it weren't for baseball, the Bulls would have had 8 trophies. Vernon Maxwell disagrees.\n\nMaxwell, a starter for the Rockets during the early '90s, was someone who even had someone as outlandish as Michael, terming him \"crazy.\". The duo's matchup was often physical, and in a 2015 interview, the Houston guard even declared that he wanted to put his hands on His Airness.\n\n\"I wanted to fight him, really,\" said Vernon to the media present at the Rockets reunion event.\n\nBut during his 20-year exile from Houston, the former Rockets guard seems to have thought about those matchups against Mike a lot. He even thinks the Rockets had the Bulls number during their 90's run. The Rockets did go 9-9 against the Bulls during that time frame, the 10 years that the Bulls dominated the league.\n\n\"Just Google the times we played them. They couldn't beat us. Like we couldn't beat Seattle. If we could get past Seattle, we get the championship. We'd knock Chicago off\", said Maxwell.\n\nUnfortunately for Maxwell, The Rockets and the Bulls would never face off in the playoffs, as the Magic and Shaquille O'Neal defeated the Bulls in the 1995 playoffs, facing off with the Rockets in the finals. That same Magic team with O'Neal would get swept in four games by the Rockets, leaving the fans wanting a possible Rockets-Bulls matchup. It never happened, but if it did, former Rockets players have Maxwell shutting down black Jesus.\n\nThere have been many so-called \"MJ-stoppers\" who graced the league over the 80s and 90s. Among the bunch, a few stood out, like Gary Payton and Vernon Maxwell. The former Houston guard thinks he could have given Jordan a lot of trouble if they had matched up, but Maxwell isn't the only Rocket saying it. Even Robert Horry thinks the same.\n\nIn a sit-down on the popular hoop podcast \"All the Smoke,\" Horry gave out his plan for how a possible Rockets-Bulls matchup in the 1995 Finals would have gone, and he even had a defensive answer for Jordan. Calling Vernon a Jordan-stopper, Hory told his hosts,\n\n\"Vernon Maxwell could have handled Black Jesus.\"\n\nMaxwell even got the moniker \"Mad Max\" for his antics, a nickname even Jordan found to be fitting for the pesky guard. But in reality, the Houston Rockets stood no chance against the Bulls and Jordan in the 90s, even going 2-5 in regular season contests since No. 23's return to the sport in 1995.", "source": {"uri": "thesportsrush.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The SportsRush"}, "authors": [{"uri": "trikansh_kher@thesportsrush.com", "name": "Trikansh Kher", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vernon_Maxwell", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Vernon Maxwell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Bulls", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Chicago Bulls"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Jordan", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Michael Jordan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball_positions", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Basketball positions"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Houston", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Houston"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Houston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hakeem_Olajuwon", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hakeem Olajuwon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Jackson", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Michael Jackson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Houston_Rockets", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Houston Rockets"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baseball", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seattle", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Seattle"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Seattle"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jordan", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jordan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Jordan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shaquille_O'Neal", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Shaquille O'Neal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Horry", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Robert Horry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gary_Payton", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gary Payton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mad_Max", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mad Max"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Military_Science", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Military Science", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Models/Rockets", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Models/Rockets", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Pyrotechnics", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Pyrotechnics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 59}], "image": "https://cdn-wp.thesportsrush.com/2024/05/1d1ee0b8-untitled-design-40.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9553203", "eventUri": "eng-9553203", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1450980392156863, "wgt": 172, "relevance": 1}

However, Dwight Howard holds the honor of being the first.\n\nHoward signed with the Rockets as a free agent during the 2012 offseason following a disappointing year with the Los Angeles Lakers. The Howard-Harden pairing appeared to be ready to take the league by storm.

However, history has shown that teams can still make remarkable comebacks by showing determination and resilience.\n\nThis feat is rare, however. Only five teams have recovered from losing the first two games at home to win a best-of-seven series.\n\nThis is what the defending champion Denver Nuggets are facing after dropping their first two games at home to the Minnesota Timberwolves. Despite having the favorite to win this year's MVP in Nikola Jokic, the Timberwolves Anthony Edwards is looking like the best player in this year's playoffs.\n\nDenver will face a tough challenge against Edwards and the Timberwolves as they try to become the sixth team in history to win after losing the first two games at home. Will Denver make history?\n\nHere's a look at the five teams that have achieved the remarkable feat of winning a series after losing the first two games at home.\n\nThe 1969 Los Angeles Lakers Over The San Francisco Warriors\n\nThe 1968-69 NBA season was a historic year for the league. Bill Russell led his Boston Celtics to their 11th NBA title, cementing himself as the winningest player of all time.\n\nIn the Western Conference, the Los Angeles Lakers won 55 games to lead the conference. In the first round, the Lakers met the San Francisco Warriors, who won 41 games.\n\nAfter losing the first two games in LA, many doubted the Lakers would even win a game in the playoffs despite being considered the favorites in the Western Conference. In Game 3, Jerry West and Wilt Chamberlain led the Lakers to victory.\n\nThe Lakers dominated the Warriors with a 115-98 win, thanks in part to Jerry West's 25 points and 9 assists and Wilt Chamberlain's 22 points and 28 rebounds. The Lakers kept their winning ways in Game 4, defeating the Warriors 103-88. This game belonged to West, who scored 36 points on 12-22 shooting.\n\nWith the series shifting back to Los Angeles, the Lakers looked to take command of the series. That's exactly what happened, as West scored 29 more points to lead LA to a 103-98 victory.\n\nAs the series shifted back to San Francisco, the Lakers were looking to end it and move on. Led by West's 29 points and Chamberlain's 25 rebounds, the Lakers blew out the Warriors 118-78.\n\nThe Los Angeles Lakers made history by becoming the first team in the NBA to lose the first two games of a series at home and come back to win the series. It would take 25 years for another team to achieve this feat.\n\nThe 1994 Houston Rockets Over The Phoenix Suns\n\nThe Houston Rockets were a team of destiny in the 1993-94 season. Michael Jordan was out of the league, and the championship was up for grabs.\n\nHakeem Olajuwon quickly proved he was the best player in the league, winning the league's MVP award. As for his team, the Houston Rockets went 58-24, which was the second-best record in the NBA.\n\nAfter a 3-1 first-round series victory over the Portland Trail Blazers, Houston met last year's Western Conference champions, the Phoenix Suns. The Suns were led by Charles Barkley and won 56 games on the season.\n\nThe Suns strolled into Houston and used their experience of reaching the NBA Finals the year prior to pull out two wins. With their backs against the wall, the Rockets needed Olajuwon to step up, and he did, but he would get some help.\n\nOlajuwon had a dominant Game 3, scoring 26 points while grabbing 15 rebounds and collecting 6 blocks. As mentioned, Olajuwon would get some help and it would be from Vernon Maxwell, who scored 34 points, to help Houston win 118-102 over Phoenix.\n\nIn Game 4, the Suns were led by point guard Kevin Johnson, who scored 38 points and completed a monster slam dunk over Olajuwon.\n\nDespite Johnson's performance, Olajuwon led the Rockets past the Suns. Olajuwon scored 28 points while adding 12 rebounds, 8 assists, and 5 blocks. Houston managed to even up the series at 2-2 with their 107-96 victory in Game 4.\n\nThe Rockets blew out the Suns in Game 5, winning 109-86. Houston looked to complete the epic comeback from 0-2 down in the series, but the Suns had other plans.\n\nThe Suns won Game 6 back in Phoenix, 103-89. The series shifted back to Houston for one last game in the series, and the Rockets looked to etch their name in the record book.\n\nHouston would achieve this with their 104-94 Game 7 victory. Once again, the Rockets were led by Olajuwon, who gave an all-time great performance.\n\nOlajuwon scored 37 points on 18-33 shooting. He added 17 rebounds, 5 assists, and 3 blocks. The Rockets and Olajuwon would eventually go on to win their first NBA championship, and Olajuwon completed one of the greatest individual seasons the league has ever seen.\n\nThe 2005 Dallas Mavericks Over The Houston Rockets\n\nIn the 2004-05 season, the Dallas Mavericks were feeling good heading into the playoffs. This was after they won 58 games and secured the fourth seed.\n\nThe Houston Rockets weren't feeling so bad, either. They won 51 games and earned the fifth seed. More importantly, the Rockets had a superstar duo in Tracy McGrady and Yao Ming.\n\nFor Dallas, they were led by their young superstar Dirk Nowitzki and nine-year veteran Jerry Stackhouse. Most gave the Mavericks the edge in the series, especially since they held the home court.\n\nSo, when Houston defeated Dallas 98-86 in Game 1, followed by a 113-111 victory in Game 2, thanks to a McGrady game-winner, Mavs fans started to worry.\n\nHowever, Dallas made a comeback in Games 3 and 4 and won both matches, evening the series at 2-2. Dirk Nowitzki, who performed poorly in the first two games, scored 28 points in Game 3 and led the Mavericks to a 106-102 win.\n\nIn Game 4, behind Jason Terry's 32 points, the Mavericks won again 97-93. Game 5 saw the series shift back to Dallas, and the Mavs won 103-100. This time, McGrady missed a clutch three at the buzzer, which would have tied the game.\n\nThe Rockets easily won Game 6 101-83 to force a Game 7. It wouldn't matter for the Rockets as the Mavericks dominated at home in the series-deciding game.\n\nThe final score was 116-76 in favor of Dallas. Jason Terry led Dallas with 31 points, as Nowitzki chipped in 14 points and 14 rebounds.\n\nThe Mavericks completed an incredible comeback from a 0-2 series deficit, making this series a fan favorite amongst Dallas fans.\n\nThe 2017 Boston Celtics Over The Chicago Bulls\n\nThe 2016-17 Chicago Bulls boasted a roster that included Dwyane Wade, Jimmy Butler, and Rajon Rondo. Despite this, the Bulls inched their way into the playoffs as the eighth seed, with just 41 wins on the season.\n\nThe Boston Celtics, led by Isaiah Thomas, held the top seed in the East after winning 53 games. So, Boston should have no problem with Chicago, right?\n\nThe Bulls quickly proved this narrative as false. Chicago won Game 1 106-102 behind Butler's 30 points and 111-97 in Game 2, thanks to 11 points and 14 assists from Rondo.\n\nIt was Rondo who was the Bulls' clear MVP. He controlled every aspect of the game and was looking to defeat his former team in the postseason.\n\nThis all changed toward the end of Game 2, when Rondo fractured his thumb. Although the injury would have only kept him out for a couple of weeks, the Bulls would not last that long.\n\nThe Celtics took full advantage of Rondo's absence, led by their star point guard, Isaiah Thomas. The Celtics star, who finished fifth in MVP voting that season, scored 16, 33, 24, and 12 to help his Celtics win four straight and the series.\n\nThe most incredible part of Thomas' performance has to do with how he handled himself all series long. The day before Game 1, Thomas' sister tragically passed away in a car accident.\n\nThomas' play was heartwarming and this can be said of his team, as well. Everyone rallied around their star guard to help the Celtics become just the fourth team to win a series after losing the first two at home.\n\nThe 2021 Los Angeles Clippers Over The Dallas Mavericks\n\nIn the pandemic-impacted season, the Los Angeles Clippers, led by Kawhi Leonard and Paul George, staged an epic comeback against the Dallas Mavericks. The 47-win Clippers hosted the 42-win Dallas Mavericks, who were led by their young phenom, Luka Doncic, in the first round of the 2021 NBA playoffs.\n\nFor once, the Leonard-George duo remained healthy for an entire playoff series, and it showed. After dropping the first two games at home, largely because of Doncic's 31 points in Game 1 and his 39 points in Game 2, the Clippers duo took over.\n\nLeonard scored 36 in Game 3, while George added 29 in the Clippers 118-108 victory. The Clippers blew the Mavs out in Game 3, 106-81, as Leonard scored 29 and George chipped in 20.\n\nThe Mavericks surprisingly won again in Los Angeles, winning 105-100 in Game 5. This was largely thanks to Doncic, who scored 42, while adding 14 assists.\n\nThe Clippers bounced back with yet another road victory for themselves, winning 104-97, setting up a classic Game 7 in Los Angeles. This time, the Clippers would defend their home court.\n\nThe Clippers won 126-111 behind Leonard's 28 and George's 22. It wasn't just the two superstars who helped Los Angeles win Game 7.\n\nThe Clippers had seven players reach double digits in the game and it was much needed. Dallas saw its star, Doncic, drop 46 points in an epic performance. Still, it wasn't enough to stop the Clippers from completing an epic comeback from being down 0-2.\n\nThe Nuggets Have Joined A Terrible List Of Defending Champions\n\nTo make things worse for Denver, only three defending champions, including this year's Nuggets, have fallen into a 0-2 hole after losing the first two games at home. This was the 1984 Philadelphia 76ers and the 2011 Los Angeles Lakers. Both teams lost the series.\n\nThe Denver Nuggets rolled through the playoffs last year and after defeating the Lakers in the first round, most people figured this year would be the same. Denver head coach Michael Malone has been disgusted by the effort from his team in Game 2.\n\n\"I was disappointed with our reaction to the adversity,\" said Malone. \"I haven't seen that in my nine years here. As things got tough, we fell apart and separated. I reminded our guys today. 'Fellas, we're the reigning world champions. Act like it and play like it.'\"\n\nThe Nuggets need to figure out a few key things if they are to get back into the series and win it. For starters, the Nuggets need to figure out how to contain Anthony Edwards. Of course, this is easier said than done. Still, if Denver wants any chance of winning, they need to halt Edwards' impressive playoff run.\n\nThe second thing Denver needs to figure out is how to get past the Timberwolves' stifling defense. Minnesota has played impressive defense both inside and outside, making Jokic work harder than he normally does.\n\nThe next key improvement for the Nuggets is getting Jamal Murray involved. In the first round, Murray was a straight killer. He torched the Lakers, averaging 23.6 Points per game while making two game-winning shots.\n\nAfter the first two games against the Timberwolves, Murray is averaging just 12.5 points per game on 28.1% shooting.

By pooling together these collective memories and experiences, the team hopes to create a lasting tribute to the legacy of the Golden Rockets.\n\nAs the team gears up for what will hopefully be another exciting season on the ice, they invite all alumni and supporters to join them in celebrating the past, present, and future of the Golden Rockets.

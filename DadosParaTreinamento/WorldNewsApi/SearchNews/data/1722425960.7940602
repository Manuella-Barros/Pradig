Drinking liquor in front of their kids and other family members will make men feel ashamed, which will eventually discourage them from drinking, the minister said. The minister for Social Justice and Empowerment was speaking at a de-addiction programme in Bhopal. \u201cIf mothers and sisters want their husbands to stop drinking, first tell them not to drink in the market, ask them to bring it home and drink in front of you. Drinking in front of you will gradually reduce their limit. Slowly, they will be on the verge of quitting. They will feel ashamed to drink in front of their wife and children. Also, tell them that their children will follow their example and start drinking in the future. This is very practical and will help them quit drinking,\" Kushwah said. When contacted, Kushwah clarified, \"What I meant was that a home is like a temple for people. They destroy themselves by drinking outside their homes. Inside their homes, at least because of their wife and children, they won't drink out of shame.\" Drinking in public is a touchy subject in the state as former chief minister Shiraj Singh Chouhan had during his campaign in the assembly elections spoken about how he closed down stalls close to liquor stores where people used to consume liquor. Chouhan had even suggested to close down liquor stores in a locality where more than 50 percent of the women gave their aggreement. His chief opponent at the time, former CM Kamal Nath, had criticised Chouhan over the growing liquor trade in the state. BJP's own leaders have protested against liquor stores - former CM Uma Bharti has in the past vandalised such stores and has been a proponent of prohibition in the state.", "summary": "", "url": "https://indianexpress.com/article/india/ask-them-drink-at-home-mp-ministers-advice-to-women-so-their-husbands-quit-liquor-9421700/", "image": "https://images.indianexpress.com/2024/06/MP-minister-Kushwaha-1cil.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-29 01:54:26", "author": "Anand Mohan J", "authors": ["Anand Mohan J"], "language": "en", "source_country": "in", "sentiment": 0.039}

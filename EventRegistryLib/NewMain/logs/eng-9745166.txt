Tesla accounted for 53.4% of California's battery-electric car market in the first half, down from 64.6% a year ago, the CNCDA report said. Overall Tesla sales in California are down 17% so far this year.\n\n\"Tesla's allure seems to be wearing off, signaling potential trouble for the direct-to-consumer manufacturer,\" the trade group's analysts said.\n\nNew EV models have posed a competitive threat to Tesla, which has a relatively older lineup of cars. Ford Motor Co., Hyundai Motor Co. and Rivian Automotive Inc. are all among companies that have grabbed a bigger slice of California's electric-vehicle market. Overall, battery-powered cars account for about a fifth of auto sales in the state, while California makes up a third of US EV sales.\n\nMusk's standing in California, the largest EV market in the US and a Democratic Party stronghold, has also taken a hit as he's openly criticized the state and embraced Republican political figures, including former President Donald Trump. This week, Musk got into a social media dispute with Governor Gavin Newsom over a decision to move the headquarters of both SpaceX and X to Texas from California.

Despite this, the state is projected to reach a forecasted 1.8 million new vehicle registrations by the year's end.\n\nA key highlight from the report is Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) declining market presence in California. The electric vehicle (EV) giant's registrations have dropped a significant 17% year-to-date (YTD), marking the third consecutive quarter of registration declines for the brand.\n\nWhile Tesla's Model Y remains the top-selling car in the state, the data suggests that Tesla sales may have reached their peak in California.\n\nOn the other hand, traditional automakers like Toyota (NYSE:TM), Hyundai (OTC:HYMTF) (LON:HYUNDAIq), and Ford (NYSE:F) have seen a surge in popularity, particularly in their EV models. Toyota and Hyundai's battery electric vehicle (BEV) registrations rose by 108.1% and 65.7% respectively. Hyundai's Ioniq 5 notably took third place in the top-selling EVs in California YTD, surpassing Tesla's Model X.\n\nDavid Simpson, CNCDA Chairman, expressed his excitement about the evolving auto market, stating, \"With new competitive EV models and the latest ICE options, we're able to meet diverse customers' needs and provide the support they want from their local dealership.\"\n\nToyota continues to dominate the Californian market with 150,964 registrations and a 16.9% market share. California also leads the nation in BEV registrations, with BEVs accounting for 21.4% of sales YTD.\n\nIn the first half of 2024, combined sales of BEVs, plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs), hybrids, and fuel cell vehicles accounted for 38% of the market share in California, while internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles made up the remaining 62%.\n\nDespite Tesla's declining market presence, it remains the second-best selling brand in California with 102,106 registrations YTD. However, the brand's market share has dipped 2.3 points from last year, and Q2 2024 registrations have fallen 24.1% compared to Q2 2023.\n\nThe report also notes regional variations in BEV market share, with Northern California leading at 24.9%, followed by Southern California at 22.1%.\n\nCalifornia Auto Outlook Q2: Tesla's California sales slip 17% YTD, rivals surge\n\nStocks ease as tech sell-off spreads, data boosts dollar", "source": {"uri": "finance.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo!

Or follow us on Google News!\n\nBut the Tesla Model Y is still the #1 best seller in the California auto market -- by far. And that could be concerning.\n\nI don't think it's at all controversial to say that Tesla's success was built from the hands of Californians. Tesla never would have reached the scale it has reached, or even become profitable at all, if it didn't have years of support from Californian buyers, Californian laws (strong incentives for EVs as well as carbon credits Tesla was paid by other automakers to make up for their lack of EV sales), and Californian workers of course. For a long time, Tesla's only car factory was in Fremont, California. First deliveries of new models were in California. Model launches and other events were in California. And there's a strong chance no other market in the world would have watered the seed of Tesla as much as or as well as California did.\n\nRecall that the Toyota Prius used to be the green vehicle of choice of rich and famous Hollywood celebrities, and many others in California. Tesla's vehicles have usurped that position, and much more. You can't even find the Prius in the top 5 of its vehicle class, while the Tesla Model Y is far and away the best selling automobile in California. In fact, it had almost twice as many sales as the #2 Toyota RAV4!\n\nHowever, the tale of the Prius may be a wise one for Tesla to consider, even if the peak of its success was on a much lower level.\n\nCars are status symbols, identity markers, the crown jewels of many families, political statements, and much more. With millions of Tesla Model 3 and Model Y vehicles covering the roads of California, they are no longer \"special,\" eye-grabbing, unique vehicles. Getting a Tesla because its cool may be going out of fashion. On top of the \"mass-market effect,\" Tesla is now strongly linked to the Republican Party and even Donald Trump, via corporate head Elon Musk, the most famous CEO in the world. Approximately 47% of registered voters in California are Democrats, while about 24% are Republicans. Not many independents are fans of Donald Trump, and Democrats mostly see him in ... well, basically the worst light possible. On top of that, at the end of his presidency, he tried to ignore the results of an election, stage a coup, and stimulate an insurrection. Elon Musk shifting over to \"the dark side\" is sure to push away a lot of Democrats, which means a lot of Californians, and it was probably already doing so to a significant degree. It seems that Tesla's 24% drop in sales in Q2 compared to Q2 2023 represents that to some degree. But the thing is: that was before Musk endorsed Trump and said he'd spend hundreds of millions of dollars to help get him elected.\n\nElon Musk seems to think that Tesla vehicles are so much better than other vehicles that people will buy them no matter what he does. However, the EV market has improved by leaps and bounds in recent years. Whereas there used to be no great Tesla alternatives, there are now at least a dozen in the electric vehicle industry. Even if Musk was a saint and did nothing to push away buyers (especially in Tesla's birth state of California), Tesla was going to face the challenge of a maturing market taking more and more of its pie.\n\nIn the 4th quarter of 2023, Tesla sales were down 9.8% in California. In the 1st quarter of this year, they were down 7.8%. In the 2nd quarter, they were down 24.1%. Overall, in the first half of 2024, Tesla sales were down 17% in California.\n\nRecall that Tesla's supposed to be seeing 50% annual growth, on average, through 2030. That was Elon Musk's expectation even last year.\n\nThere are other reasons why Tesla sales could be dropping sharply in California. Below, I'm going to list the big ones that come to mind for me. Let us know in the comments of any others you think of.\n\nOf course, we have to emphasize that Tesla sales are still strong! Tesla sales may have gone from 64.6% of the California EV market to 53.4%, but it's still got more than half of the EV market! The Model Y still got 69,810 registrations in The Golden State in Q2, almost double the 36,160 registrations of the #2 Toyota RAV4.\n\nHowever, circling back to my note at the top about why even the good numbers could be concerning -- the point is that these numbers are a bit too good to be sustainable. Can Tesla really retain more than 50% of the California EV market. That seems highly unlikely. Can Tesla continue to sell so many Model Y (and Model 3) vehicles quarter after quarter? Or is the company just going to find itself facing smaller \"natural limits\" to its sales potential as time moves on? I mean, can we really expect the Model Y to be so far ahead of the pack forever?\n\nI take the California numbers to be a warning. However, we'll see. ...

Tesla's total California sales were down 17 percent year-to-date.\n\nThe CNCDA report suggested a potential erosion of Tesla's brand appeal, saying, \"Tesla's allure seems to be wearing off, signaling potential trouble for the direct-to-consumer manufacturer.\"\n\nSeveral factors are likely contributing to Tesla's California woes. Increased competition from newer EV models is a major challenge.\n\nEstablished automakers like Ford and Hyundai, along with new players like Rivian, are all vying for a larger share of the growing California EV market.\n\nNotably, the battery electric vehicle's (BEV) market share accounted for 21.9 percent of all auto sales in the state, said the report, highlighting the significant market shift towards electric vehicles.\n\n\"In stark contrast, mainstay brands like Toyota, Hyundai, and Ford are on the upswing, with significant gains and excitement around new EV models that Californians seem eager to adopt,\" said the CNCDA in a press release. This year, Toyota's BEV registrations rose 108.1 percent, and Hyundai's BEV registrations rose 65.7 percent.\n\nAdding to Tesla's troubles is the shifting perception of CEO Elon Musk within California, a Democratic stronghold and the nation's largest EV market.\n\nMusk's public criticism of the state and his embrace of Republican figures tarnished his image in some Californians' eyes.\n\nThis week's social media spat with California Governor Gavin Newsom over the relocation of SpaceX and Tesla headquarters has further strained the relations.", "source": {"uri": "thestar.com.my", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Star "}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Electric vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_car", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Electric car"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tesla_Model_Y", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tesla Model Y"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battery_electric_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Battery electric vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_State_Warriors", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Golden State Warriors"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_share", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Market share"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rivian", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rivian"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyundai_Motor_Company", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hyundai Motor Company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ford_Motor_Company", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ford Motor Company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tesla,_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tesla, Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gavin_Newsom", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gavin Newsom"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor_of_California", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Governor of California"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "SpaceX"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elon_Musk", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Elon Musk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toyota", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Toyota"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Automotive", "label": "dmoz/Business/Automotive", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Vehicles", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Vehicles", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Vehicles/Autos", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Vehicles/Autos", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Vehicles/Parts_and_Accessories", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Vehicles/Parts and Accessories", "wgt": 100}], "image": null, "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9745166", "eventUri": "eng-9745166", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-19", "textStart": 13, "textEnd": 20}], "sentiment": 0.1058823529411765, "wgt": 174, "relevance": 1}

The California electric vehicle (EV) market in 2024 is characterized in the report by a mix of challenges and opportunities.\n\nWhile Tesla saw a dip in its market share in the second quarter of this year, it remains a key player in the battery electric vehicle (BEV) segment.\n\nThe report, released on July 18, finds that Tesla has long been a dominant player in the BEV segment while plug-in hybrid EVs (PHEVs) from other manufacturers have begun to take a larger market share.\n\nThe emergence of strong competitors such as Rivian, Hyundai, and Ford indicates a healthy and growing market with increased consumer choice.\n\nIn the first half of 2024, Tesla's new vehicle registrations in California totaled 102,106, down from 123,006 during the same period in 2023, marking a significant decline of 17 percent, according to the report. Despite this decline, Tesla continues to hold a significant portion of the BEV market.\n\nThe Tesla Model Y remained the best-selling BEV with 69,810 registrations year to date through June, followed by the Tesla Model 3 with 21,050 registrations.\n\nHowever, the report also notes that Tesla's market share dipped 2.3 points from last year, and second-quarter 2024 registrations plummeted 24.1 percent compared to second quarter 2023. This marks Tesla's third consecutive quarter with registration declines, which the report questions whether or not is a sign that Tesla has \"peaked\" in California.\n\nThe report highlights the emergence of strong competitors that are making notable gains in the BEV market.\n\nRivian, Hyundai, and Ford have all increased their market presence in the Golden State. Rivian, in particular, has seen a substantial rise in registrations, up by 76.7 percent in the first half of 2024 compared to the same period in 2023.\n\nSimilarly, Hyundai's Ioniq 5 and Ford's Mustang Mach-E are gaining traction among consumers, offering alternatives to Tesla's lineup. The Hyundai Ioniq 5 notably took third place in the top-selling EVs in California with 7,191 registrations.\n\nAs of the first half of 2024, California accounted for 33.0 percent of all BEV registrations in the United States, underscoring its role as the largest and most influential market for electric vehicles, though internal combustion engines (ICEs) still hold the largest market share.\n\nCombined sales of BEVs, PHEVs, hybrids, and fuel cell vehicles accounted for 38 percent of the market share in California, while ICE vehicles accounted for 62 percent.\n\n\"It's an exciting time to be a franchised car dealer in California. With new competitive EV models and the latest ICE options, we're able to meet diverse customers' needs and provide the support they want from their local dealership,\" says David Simpson, CNCDA chairman and owner of Simpson Buick GMC Cadillac of Buena Park, Simpson Chevrolet of Garden Grove, and Simpson Chevrolet of Irvine, each in Southern California. \"Our dealers are trusted community partners, providing Californians with high-quality, reliable vehicles -- whether electric, traditional, or anything in between.\".\n\nSeveral economic factors are working to influence market dynamics, according to the report.\n\nHigher interest rates have led to elevated monthly finance and lease costs, impacting overall vehicle sales. However, falling vehicle transaction prices and rising household incomes are positive trends that may support future market growth.\n\nIn addition, the average age of vehicles in operation has reached an all-time high, encouraging many vehicle owners to consider upgrading to newer models with advanced safety features and alternative powertrains.\n\nCalifornia's franchised new car and truck dealers account for more than 67 percent of combined sales for all alternative powertrain types this year, demonstrating consumer confidence in local dealerships and mainstay brands. This trend is evident in the sales of BEVs by franchised dealerships, which have surged by 27 percent, while direct sellers, such as Tesla and Rivian, saw a 12.3 percent drop.\n\nThe Epoch Times reached out to Tesla for reaction to the report but did not hear back prior to publication.", "source": {"uri": "theepochtimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "www.theepochtimes.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tesla,_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tesla, Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plug-in_hybrid", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Plug-in hybrid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battery_electric_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Battery electric vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Electric vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_share", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Market share"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rivian", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Rivian"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyundai_Motor_Company", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Hyundai Motor Company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ford_Motor_Company", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Ford Motor Company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyundai_Ioniq_5", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hyundai Ioniq 5"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internal_combustion_engine", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Internal combustion engine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ford_Mustang_Mach-E", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ford Mustang Mach-E"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tesla_Model_Y", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tesla Model Y"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tesla_Model_3", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tesla Model 3"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chevrolet", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chevrolet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drivetrain", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Drivetrain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fuel_cell_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fuel cell vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GMC_(automobile)", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "GMC (automobile)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buick", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Buick"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Car_dealership", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Car dealership"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franchising", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Franchising"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cadillac", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cadillac"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hybrid_electric_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hybrid electric vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_California", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Southern California"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irvine,_California", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Irvine, California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Irvine, California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Automotive", "label": "dmoz/Business/Automotive", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Vehicles/Parts_and_Accessories", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Vehicles/Parts and Accessories", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Automotive/Recreational_Vehicles", "label": "dmoz/Business/Automotive/Recreational Vehicles", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Auctions/Autos", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Auctions/Autos", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 77}], "image": "https://img.theepochtimes.com/assets/uploads/2024/05/15/id5650534-GettyImages-1434797485-Tesla-factory-1080x720.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9745166", "eventUri": "eng-9745166", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-18", "textStart": 494, "textEnd": 501}], "sentiment": 0.3176470588235294, "wgt": 171, "relevance": 1}

Despite this, the state is projected to reach a forecasted 1.8 million new vehicle registrations by the year's end.\n\nA key highlight from the report is Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) declining market presence in California. The electric vehicle (EV) giant's registrations have dropped a significant 17% year-to-date (YTD), marking the third consecutive quarter of registration declines for the brand.\n\nWhile Tesla's Model Y remains the top-selling car in the state, the data suggests that Tesla sales may have reached their peak in California.\n\nOn the other hand, traditional automakers like Toyota (NYSE:TM), Hyundai (OTC:HYMTF) (LON:HYUNDAIq), and Ford (NYSE:F) have seen a surge in popularity, particularly in their EV models. Toyota and Hyundai's battery electric vehicle (BEV) registrations rose by 108.1% and 65.7% respectively. Hyundai's Ioniq 5 notably took third place in the top-selling EVs in California YTD, surpassing Tesla's Model X.\n\nDavid Simpson, CNCDA Chairman, expressed his excitement about the evolving auto market, stating, \"With new competitive EV models and the latest ICE options, we're able to meet diverse customers' needs and provide the support they want from their local dealership.\"\n\nToyota continues to dominate the Californian market with 150,964 registrations and a 16.9% market share.

However, the brand's market share has dipped 2.3 points from last year, and Q2 2024 registrations have fallen 24.1% compared to Q2 2023.\n\nThe report also notes regional variations in BEV market share, with Northern California leading at 24.9%, followed by Southern California at 22.1%.", "source": {"uri": "investing.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Investing.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Electric vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tesla,_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Tesla, Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toyota", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Toyota"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyundai_Motor_Company", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hyundai Motor Company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battery_electric_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Battery electric vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyundai_Ioniq_5", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hyundai Ioniq 5"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tesla_Model_Y", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tesla Model Y"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tesla_Model_X", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tesla Model X"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internal_combustion_engine", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Internal combustion engine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ford_Motor_Company", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ford Motor Company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fuel_cell_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fuel cell vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plug-in_hybrid", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Plug-in hybrid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_share", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Market share"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hybrid_electric_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hybrid electric vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_California", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Southern California"}, "location": null}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Vehicles/Autos", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Vehicles/Autos", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Vehicles/Parts_and_Accessories", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Vehicles/Parts and Accessories", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Automotive/Recreational_Vehicles", "label": "dmoz/Business/Automotive/Recreational Vehicles", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Auctions/Autos", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Auctions/Autos", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 66}], "image": "https://i-invdn-com.investing.com/news/Carindustry_800x533_L_1644794888.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9745166", "eventUri": "eng-9745166", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2627450980392156, "wgt": 167, "relevance": 1}

crucial for Tesla's business since the EV share of the state's new car market at 21.4% is nearly three times the U.S. average of 7.5% in 2023.\n\nOf the nearly 381,000 electric vehicles sold in the state that year across all car brands, six out of ten were Tesla cars.\n\nEven when conventional combustion vehicles are included in the mix, the Model 3 was California's best-selling passenger car in 2023, surpassing the Toyota Camry, while the Model Y proved the state's most popular vehicle of any kind.\n\nThe brand even briefly eclipsed Toyota as the number one choice for buyers in the state when Tesla sales nearly hit 69,000 cars in the second quarter of last year.\n\nTo be clear, Tesla still dominates the state's EV market with a 53% market share in the first half of 2024.\n\nYet that also means California is Tesla's market to lose, and Musk does not appear to be doing his company any favors by constantly agitating against left-leaning issues popular among many of his mainly progressive customers.\n\nAfter formally endorsing Trump on Sunday, the entrepreneur then followed up with news on Tuesday he was moving the headquarters of both SpaceX and X Corp to Texas.\n\nHe cited a controversial new state law called AB1955 that prohibits teachers from discussing children's sexual identity with their parents -- for Musk \"the final straw\".\n\nHe had already voiced his displeasure with Sacramento when he moved the headquarters of Tesla three years ago during the pandemic.\n\nThe demanding CEO had repeatedly clashed with county health officials over the operation of his Fremont vehicle factory, the largest in North America, which produced some 560,00 cars last year.\n\nMusk has won over many new conservative converts to his social media business, which rebranded last year to eliminate any association it still had with legacy Twitter.\n\nBut this doesn't help him when it comes to Tesla, since the new cohort he recruited to boost advertising-relevant traffic on his X platform typically takes a very dim view of the environmentally friendly EVs predominantly preferred by voters on the left.", "source": {"uri": "fortune.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

It's Friday, July 19, 2024, and this is The Morning Shift, your daily roundup of the top automotive headlines from around the world, in one place. Here are the important stories you need to know.\n\nFormer President Donald Trump used his Republican National Convention speech to rip President Joe Biden's electric vehicle policies, vowing to take action against them as soon as he gets into office. From Bloomberg:\n\n\"I will end the electric vehicle mandate on day one,\" Trump said in his address at the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee. The move would result in \"saving the US auto industry from complete obliteration, which is happening right now, and saving US customers thousands and thousands of dollars per car,\" he said.\n\nThere's just one issue with Don's promise to end the \"EV mandate.\" There isn't one. The closest thing the Biden administration has to a \"mandate\" is new air pollution limits set by the Environmental Protection Agency. Critics say they would illegally force automakers to sell EVs.\n\nTrump's remarks on EVs came just moments before he criticized what he said was trillions of dollars of wasteful spending \"having to do with the green new scam.\" He said he would instead direct the money to projects like roads, bridges and dams, though it wasn't immediately clear how he would make good on the pledge.\n\nTrump has made no secret his disdain for electric vehicles, claiming they don't work and will benefit China and Mexico while hurting American autoworkers. Biden, in contrast, has made the shift to battery-powered cars one of his top climate and industrial policies and has set a goal of having 50% of all new vehicle sales be electric by 2030.\n\nI know I don't need to tell you guys this since you're smart. But, some of the people Trump is talking to are not and they'll just eat this up.\n\nElectric vehicles were not the only part of the automotive world Trump took aim at at the RNC. He also called for the firing of Shawn Fain, the United Auto Workers union president, whose union has labeled Trump a \"scab.\"\n\nHe made this comment directly after saying China was building auto plants across the southern border in Mexico, and it was planning to sell Mexican-built vehicles in the U.S. From the Detroit News:\n\n\"The United Auto Workers ought to be ashamed for allowing this to happen,\" Trump then said. \"And the leader of the United Auto Workers should be fired immediately. And every single auto worker, union and non-union, should be voting for Donald Trump.\"\n\nThe \"should be fired\" comment wasn't in excerpts of Trump's prepared remarks provided by Trump's campaign to reporters ahead of the speech.\n\nIt's not a shocker, but the UAW endorsed President Joe Biden's reelection campaign back in January after he became the first sitting president to join a picket line.\n\n\"This November, we can stand up and elect someone who wants to stand with us and support our cause. Or we can elect someone who will divide us and fight us every step of the way,\" Fain said at the time. \"That's what this choice is about. The question is, who do we want in that office to give us the best shot of winning, of organizing, of negotiating strong contracts, of uniting the working class and winning our fair share once again, as our union has done so many times in our nation's history.\n\n\"We need to know who's going to sit in the most powerful seat in the world and help us win as a united working class.\"\n\nOn X, the UAW posted that Trump was \"a scab and a billionaire\" and said \"We know which side we're on. Not him.\"\n\nThe bad news continues for Tesla as registrations for its vehicles in California dropped 24 percent in the second quarter. It is the third consecutive quarter that Tesla posted a sales drop in its most important market.\n\nHigh interest rates and stiff competition have hurt demand for electric vehicles as customers go for cheaper hybrids. I also don't think it's too much of a stretch to point to some of CEO Elon Musk's rhetoric and right-wing political ideologies as reasons people in a liberal state like California would be turned off. Just a guess, though! From Reuters:\n\nMusk's embrace of Republicans and outspoken comments have sparked concerns about Tesla's brand, especially in liberal states such as California, which accounts for 10% of the company's global deliveries.\n\nThe world's richest man publicly endorsed former President Donald Trump for the first time in the U.S. presidential race after the assassination attempt on the Republican candidate on Saturday.\n\nTesla's California registration fell to 52,211 vehicles in the second quarter, according to data from the California New Car Dealer Association.\n\nThe battery electric vehicle market slipped only 1.3% during the period. In contrast, sales of hybrid vehicles surged 22% in California.\n\n\"Tesla's allure seems to be wearing off, signaling potential trouble for the direct-to-consumer manufacturer,\" the report said.\n\nFrom January to June, Tesla saw its registrations in California slump 17%, even as distant rivals such as Hyundai Motor, Kia Motors, BMW, Mercedes-Benz, Ford, and Rivian increased sales by double-digit percentage points.\n\nThe electric-vehicle maker's Model Y crossover continues to be the best-selling model in the state, but its market share in the first half of the year fell to 53.4%, from 64.6% in the year-ago period.\n\nThe Tesla CEO has been at war with California for a while now.\n\nThe electric-vehicle maker's Model Y crossover continues to be the best-selling model in the state, but its market share in the first half of the year fell to 53.4%, from 64.6% in the year-ago period.\n\nJesus Christ, this guy sucks, and now he's actively hurting the company he built into an empire.\n\nChrysler is issuing a recall of about 24,000 plug-in hybrid Pacificas worldwide because of a fire risk. It's telling owners to park their vans outside and away from structures until the fix can be performed. Fantastic.

Elon Musk has been steadfast in bashing California and has pledged to move Tesla, SpaceX, and X to Texas. Californians, in turn, are turning their backs on Musk.\n\nTesla sales in California dropped 24.1 % in the second quarter, the brand's third straight quarterly decline in the state. Purchases dipped 7.8% in the first quarter of 2024 and 9.8% in the final quarter of last year. Year-to-date, Tesla sales in California are down 17% compared to last year, according to the latest analysis of new vehicle registrations published by the California New Car Dealers Association (CNCDA). Instead of a Tesla from Musk's $793 billion electric vehicle empire, California car buyers are purchasing battery-electric vehicles (BEVs) from Toyota, Hyundai, and Ford. The analysis found Toyota BEV registrations have soared 108.1% so far this year, while Hyundai and Ford BEV registrations rose 65.7% and 26.4%, respectively.\n\nPlenty of factors are at play in Tesla's sales decline, Brian Maas, president of the CNCDA, told Fortune. The Tesla Model 3 and Model Y are substantially the same vehicles they were five years ago, and buyers interested in those cars might represent a finite share of the market -- and they might already own a Tesla. Without new models to entice customers, buyers look elsewhere for new cars, he said. And while Tesla has dominated the EV market, the past several years have seen competitors creep in and erode the company's share with lower costs, newer cars, and greater variety, he explained. Accordingly, the Hyundai Ioniq 5 is now the third best-selling EV in California this year, wresting control of third place from the Tesla Model X, the CNCDA analysis found.\n\nAnd while the data is based only on registrations in California, branding could work against Musk. About 46.9% of registered voters in California are Democrats, while 23.9% of registered voters are Republicans. According to reputational management firm Caliber, more Republicans trust and like Musk than Democrats. Critically, however, more Democrats are willing to buy Teslas, which could be because Democrats are more likely to prioritize buying an electric vehicle over a gas-powered car, Caliber CEO Shahar Silbershatz told Fortune's Eva Roytburg.\n\nNow, staunchly Blue California has learned about Musk's reported $45 million a month donation to a pro-Trump Super PAC and his endorsement of the former president and Republican Party nominee. This might not bode well for already declining sales, and the Hyundai Ioniq's rising popularity could be the first blush of a blue backlash.\n\n\"When there's a shift in the brand, that's always going to have an impact on consumer behavior,\" said Maas.\n\nTo be sure, Tesla is still the car of choice in California. The top-selling car is the Tesla Model Y in the new-vehicle market of BEVs and plug-in hybrids. The second top-selling BEV and plug-in model is the Model 3. Yet, California has embraced BEVs in droves, while other car buyers haven't been as enthusiastic. According to Experian, California's BEV market share is 21.4%, while the overall U.S. market share of BEVs is 7.5%.\n\nWithout detailed research, it's difficult to connect Musk's political views with buying trends, in Maas' view. It's more likely that Tesla sales are sluggish because the cars haven't been revised or refreshed in years and people invest in durability, features, safety, and affordability -- not a CEO's mindset.\n\n\"Mr. Musk's political views could change tomorrow,\" said Maas. \"That being said, I assume the effect is not zero.\"", "source": {"uri": "fortune.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Fortune"}, "authors": [{"uri": "amanda_gerut@fortune.com", "name": "Amanda Gerut", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tesla,_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tesla, Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battery_electric_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Battery electric vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Electric vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elon_Musk", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Elon Musk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyundai_Motor_Company", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Hyundai Motor Company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toyota", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Toyota"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ford_Motor_Company", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Ford Motor Company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "SpaceX"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyundai_Ioniq_5", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hyundai Ioniq 5"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tesla_Model_Y", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tesla Model Y"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tesla_Model_3", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tesla Model 3"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fortune_(magazine)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fortune (magazine)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tesla_Model_X", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tesla Model X"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experian", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Experian"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plug-in_hybrid", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Plug-in hybrid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_action_committee", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Political action committee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_share", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Market share"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Autos", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Autos", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Classifieds/Automotive", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Classifieds/Automotive", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Vehicles/Autos", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Vehicles/Autos", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Vehicles/Parts_and_Accessories", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Vehicles/Parts and Accessories", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 60}], "image": "https://fortune.com/img-assets/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/GettyImages-2151277359_e6cff3-e1721399830673.jpg?resize=1200,600", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9745166", "eventUri": "eng-9745166", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2313725490196079, "wgt": 161, "relevance": 1}

But as new data shows, its position as kingpin is slipping -- almost certainly in part because the toxic antics of CEO Elon Musk is alienating the car brand's key buyers.\n\nIn California, the largest car market in the country and where the automaker once called home, registration of Tesla vehicles dropped a precipitous 24 percent between April and June -- the third straight quarter that sales have fallen in the state, Reuters reports.\n\nThe figure comes from the latest analysis from the California New Car Dealers Association (CNCDA), which suggested that \"Tesla's allure seems to be wearing off\" with buyers in the state.\n\nZooming out, sales from the first quarter show that Tesla's share of the battery EV market has dropped by 6.4 percent from last year -- a \"significant\" loss, the report found.\n\nFor better or worse, Tesla's allure is inextricable from Musk's, whose popularity was once a boon to the brand. But his eccentric behavior and regressive politics in recent years has done little to win the hearts and minds of California's largely liberal demographic, which is one that Tesla can't afford to lose: the state accounts for 10 percent of Tesla's global deliveries, according to Reuters.\n\nAnd yet, it's no secret that Musk has turned his back on the Golden State, relocating Tesla headquarters from Palo Alto to Austin, Texas, in 2021. All the while, he's relentlessly railed against the state's progressive politics.\n\nMore broadly, Musk has been outspokenly transphobic, frequently makes thinly veiled racist remarks, and rambles incomprehensibly about the \"woke mind virus.\" Now, it's been revealed that he reportedly made a $45 million a month donation to Donald Trump. The fact that he promised earlier this year that he wouldn't donate to either party's presidential candidate epitomizes Musk's rightward fence-sitting that infuriates the very eco-conscious liberals that buy EVs.\n\nSome of the dwindling sales may be down to the increase in compelling EV offerings from competitors, like Ford, Hyundai, and BMW -- all of which saw sales surge by double-digit percentages this year, Reuters noted. And with such a dominant position in the EV market for so long, Tesla may also be running out of buyers to conquer.\n\nBut multiple surveys this year have implicated Musk's behavior as a major culprit for the downturn. As one poll released in April showed, the proportion of Democrats that bought Tesla vehicles dropped by a staggering 60 percent during October and November last year. Nearly 47 percent of California's registered voters are Democrats, while just 24 percent are Republicans.\n\nWhatever the cause -- likely a mix of economic realities and Musk's personal stench -- the numbers don't lie: California Tesla sales are down by over 17 percent compared to last year, and that's gotta sting.", "source": {"uri": "futurism.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Futurism"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tesla,_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tesla, Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Electric vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elon_Musk", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Elon Musk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automotive_industry", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Automotive industry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_battery", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Electric battery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressivism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Progressivism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transphobia", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Transphobia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_State_Warriors", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Golden State Warriors"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberalism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Liberalism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Racism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palo_Alto,_California", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Palo Alto, California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Palo Alto, California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Austin,_Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Austin, Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Austin, Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyundai_Motor_Company", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hyundai Motor Company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BMW", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "BMW"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ford_Motor_Company", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ford Motor Company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reuters", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Reuters"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities/Opposing_Views", "label": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities/Opposing Views", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://wordpress-assets.futurism.com/2024/07/data-elon-musk-alienated-tesla-core-buyers.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9745166", "eventUri": "eng-9745166", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1058823529411765, "wgt": 149, "relevance": 1}

Consumer boycotts work, see Bud Light. Don't mess with American consumers!\n\nTesla sales got crushed in Q2 in California, while non-Tesla EV sales surged. Have Californians finally had it with Musk's barrage of bullshit about California and San Francisco?\n\nNew vehicle sales in Q2 as measured by registrations, released by the California auto dealer association CNCDA today:\n\nMany Californians used to think Musk walked on water, and they were in love with him and proud of him because he was cool and a genius, and a billionaire because he was part of the PayPal mafia, and then because he'd started a company that manufactured lots of cool EVs in California, and they went out and bought his EVs in huge numbers, and made the Model Y the #1 bestseller in California and the #2 bestseller in the US, while no other major automaker was even manufacturing cars in California.\n\nBut over the past few years, the bullshit about California and San Francisco started flying left and right, and maybe people finally have had it? People as in potential Tesla buyers?\n\nThe Tesla Model Y was still by far the #1 bestseller in California, ahead of the Toyota RAV4. But Sales plunged 15% year-over-year to 36,343 vehicles in Q2.\n\nSales of the Tesla Model 3 collapsed by 59% year-over-year, to just 9,888 vehicles in Q2. Some versions of the Model 3 don't qualify for the federal rebates due the China-sourced batteries.\n\nCybertruck sales in Q1 and Q2 combined were 3,048, behind the Rivian R1S (4,837) but ahead of Ford's F-150 Lightning (2,999).\n\nTesla's registrations in California in Q2 2023 accounted for 14.8% of Tesla's global deliveries as reported by Tesla. California sales matter to Tesla. That was before he turned potential buyers off.\n\nIn Q2 2024, Tesla's global deliveries fell by 4.8% year-over-year, including the 24% plunge in California. Without California, Tesla's global deliveries would have dipped by 1.4% YoY.\n\nMusk's bullshit was funny until it whacked Tesla sales.\n\nMusk's bullshit and lies are infamous and funny. Some caused Musk huge amounts of money, such as when he said that he wanted to buy Twitter and half-jokingly made a deal and signed something, and when he said, oh, I was just kidding, Twitter dragged him to court, and he lost and was forced to buy Twitter for a ridiculous $44 billion.\n\nAnother funny one came in 2018, when Musk tweeted, \"Am considering taking Tesla private at $420. Funding secured.\" Which was hilarious because there was no funding secured and no deal; and because 420 is slang for marijuana, which Musk smoked that year during a video interview; and because the SEC then sued him for securities fraud, which Musk in 2018 settled for a $20 million fine and a requirement to have some of his tweets preapproved by a Tesla lawyer. He then appealed the pre-approval requirement but lost in court, and lost on appeal, and then in April 2024, the Supreme Court refused to hear his case, which has never kept him from tweeting whatever, on what is now his own platform.\n\nOur all-time favorite was when he tweeted in October 2021: \"Am thinking of starting new university: Texas Institute of Technology & Science.\" TITS. Another funny one, and deadly one, and ongoing one is Full Self Driving (FSD) that people paid for via subscription but isn't full self-driving, triggering a number of prosecutors to probe if Tesla has committed securities fraud and wire fraud by misleading investors and consumers. These are just a few examples of Musk's bullshit.\n\nAnd in his free time, starting a few years ago, Musk spread lots of similar bullshit about California and San Francisco. Obviously, he can say whatever he wants to, no matter how ridiculous, but consumers are not deaf, and they can boycott a product.\n\nThere are lots of beer brands on the market, you don't have to buy Bud Light, as AB InBev found out, which owns the brand, after consumers began boycotting Bud Light in April 2023 following the Dylan Mulvaney ad, which caused Bud Light market share to plunge from #1 with a share of over 10% at the start of 2023 to #3 now, with its share hitting a new low of 6.5% of total beer dollar-sales in US stores for the four weeks ended July 6, according to the WSJ.\n\nDon't mess with American consumers! That's the Bug Light lesson here.\n\nThere are now lots of EVs on the market, by legacy automakers, and by startups, The Cybertruck is facing competition from the electric pickups by Ford, Rivian, and Chevrolet. Among the major automakers, only FCA (Stellantis) doesn't have any EVs on the market. Even Toyota belatedly has come out with them.\n\nAnd Californians have started to buy these non-Tesla EVs, and their sales have surged, and they're about to overtake Tesla, while Tesla sales have plunged. It was a tough job turning so many Californians off from their love affair with Musk, but Musk has finally succeeded, it seems.\n\nEnjoy reading WOLF STREET and want to support it? You can donate.

After the record results of 2023 -- when it was the most popular EV manufacturer with the best-selling vehicle in the world -- 2024 isn't nearly as robust. The latest data collected by JATO Dynamics for the first half of this year shows Tesla losing ground in both the United States and Europe, where sales fell by 8 percent and 13 percent respectively.\n\nWhile the general public is not entirely enthusiastic about electric cars, overall demand has actually grown in both regions. New, more competitive models introduced on both sides of the Atlantic are attracting more people, despite growing uncertainty about incentives and the future plans of the OEMs that produce these cars.\n\nA sales decline doesn't always mean a loss of market share, but that's not the case with Tesla. In Europe, the brand's volume fell from 185,200 units in the first half of 2023 to 161,300 units for the same period in 2024. However, during that same timeframe, total EV registrations increased by 1.7 percent.\n\nThis means Tesla's market share in the European BEV market fell from 19.8 percent to 17.2 percent this year. Tesla was the carmaker with the second-highest decline in BEV market share in Europe through the first six months of 2024, behind only the Volkswagen Group, which fell from 22 percent to 18.7 percent.\n\nTesla and Volkswagen lost ground to the Geely Group, which was boosted by the solid results of the Volvo EX30, and the BMW Group, which continues to reap success with its latest models. Chinese brands also grew, mainly thanks to BYD.\n\nThe situation in the United States is similar. Tesla's sales volume dropped from 324,900 units in the first half of 2023 to 299,200 units this year. Meanwhile, overall BEV sales increased by 7.6 percent in the same period. As a result, Tesla's share dropped from 59.8 percent in 2023 to 51.2 percent in 2024. The company is still a dominant player in its home market, but it's worth noting that numerous competitors posted strong gains amid Tesla's losses. Hyundai increased 34 percent, while Ford saw a 48 percent increase. Rivian was even better at 77 percent, and Kia managed a 110-percent jump.\n\nThe first reason for Tesla's decline is obvious. Growth can't continue forever, especially when the range is still limited and quite old. The Model 3 received a refresh in 2023 but it dates to 2017. The Model Y is already five years old, and the Model S goes way back to the early 2010s.\n\nAnd the competition is coming on strong. In Europe, Tesla is feeling pressure from premium German brands and the Chinese industry. As mentioned previously, Ford, the Koreans, and Rivian are coming on strong in the US. The company's newest vehicle, the Cybertruck, hasn't really taken off in terms of sales with just 11,300 sold in the US through the first half of 2024.\n\nFinally, the price cuts that worked so well in 2023 aren't so attractive now. As more EVs come to market from other brands, increasing supply and selection effectively reduces demand and prices fall. At this point, Tesla needs more than just big discounts and attractive updates for its cars. It needs fresher products in more segments.", "source": {"uri": "motor1.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Motor1.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tesla,_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tesla, Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_share", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Market share"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Europe"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battery_electric_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Battery electric vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Electric vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JATO_Dynamics", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "JATO Dynamics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_car", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Electric car"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Original_equipment_manufacturer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Original equipment manufacturer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volvo_EX30", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Volvo EX30"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BYD_Auto", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "BYD Auto"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volkswagen_Group", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Volkswagen Group"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geely", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Geely"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BMW", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "BMW"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volkswagen", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Volkswagen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kia", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tesla_Cybertruck", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tesla Cybertruck"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tesla_Model_Y", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tesla Model Y"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rivian", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rivian"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tesla_Model_3", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tesla Model 3"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyundai_Motor_Company", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hyundai Motor Company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tesla_Model_S", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tesla Model S"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ford_Motor_Company", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ford Motor Company"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Vehicles/Parts_and_Accessories", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Vehicles/Parts and Accessories", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Automotive/Marketing_and_Advertising", "label": "dmoz/Business/Automotive/Marketing and Advertising", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Recreation/Models", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Recreation/Models", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Antiques_and_Collectibles/Toys_and_Games", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Antiques and Collectibles/Toys and Games", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 85}], "image": "https://cdn.motor1.com/images/mgl/40Kg0J/s3/motor1-numbers-tesla-sales.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9745166", "eventUri": "eng-9745166", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2627450980392156, "wgt": 135, "relevance": 1}

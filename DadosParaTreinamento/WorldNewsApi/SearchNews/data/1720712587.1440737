{"id": 232066610, "title": "Exclusive: Most Voters Back Labour's 'Great British Energy' Plan - But Don't Think It Will Cut Bills", "text": "Most voters back Labour\u2019s plans for a nationalised energy company - even though they don\u2019t believe it will cut their bills. Polling by the More in Common think-tank, seen by HuffPost UK, shows that nearly two-thirds of the public - 63% - back the party\u2019s flagship \u201cGreat British Energy\u201d policy. Labour has said the new publicly-owned body will reduce bills and boost energy security by making the UK less reliant on foreign imports. However, the poll of 2,055 British adults shows that the 67% believe it will either increase or have no effect on how much they pay for their gas and electricity, with just 33% thinking it will bring them down. Meanwhile, nearly half (45%) think it will lead to higher taxes, compared to 40% who think it will have no effect and 15% who think it will reduce them. Luke Tryl, executive director of More in Common, said: \u201cWhat\u2019s interesting about support for Labour\u2019s flagship GB Energy policy is that it\u2019s not just Labour voters who like it - those voting for other parties also say it\u2019s a good idea. \u201cThis doesn\u2019t seem driven by self-interest as most don\u2019t expect it to decrease bills and many think taxes will go up to pay for it. \u201cYet, to most, GB Energy sounds like something worth doing - whether or not they trust politicians to see it through.\u201d A Labour source told HuffPost UK: \u201cThe popularity of Great British Energy shows that the British people are fed up fourteen years of failed Conservative energy policy, which has seen bills rocket for families our energy supply vulnerable to dictators like Putin. \u201cThe case for Great British Energy is clear - homegrown clean power that the British people own and benefit from, so we can cut bills and make our country energy independent.\u201d", "summary": "<div><img src=\"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/66657e9822000059001a4fa4.jpeg?ops=scalefit_630_noupscale\" alt=\"Ed Miliband, Keir Starmer and Scottish Labour leader Anas Sarwar promoting Great British Energy on the campaign trail.\" data-caption=\"Ed Miliband, Keir Starmer and Scottish Labour leader Anas Sarwar promoting Great British Energy on the campaign trail.\" data-credit-link-back=\"\" data-credit=\"Stefan Rousseau - PA Images via Getty Images\" />Ed Miliband, Keir Starmer and Scottish Labour leader Anas Sarwar promoting Great British Energy on the campaign trail.</div><div class=\"content-list-component text\"><p>Most voters back <a href=\"https://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/news/labour-party/\">Labour\u2019s </a>plans for a nationalised energy company - even though they don\u2019t believe it will cut their bills.</p><p>Polling by the More in Common think-tank, seen by HuffPost UK, shows that nearly two-thirds of the public - 63% - back the party\u2019s flagship \u201cGreat British Energy\u201d policy.</p><p>Labour has said the new publ", "url": "https://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/exclusive-most-voters-back-labours-gb-energy-plan-but-dont-think-it-will-cut-bills_uk_66657e4be4b0d86a07a256bf", "image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/66657e9822000059001a4fa4.jpeg?ops=1778_1000", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-09 15:47:57", "author": "Kevin Schofield", "authors": ["Kevin Schofield"], "language": "en", "catgory": "politics", "source_country": "gb", "sentiment": -0.181}

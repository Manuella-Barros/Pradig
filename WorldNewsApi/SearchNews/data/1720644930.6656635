{"id": 231297862, "title": "Paramount\u2019s Shari Redstone Juggling Skydance, Other Suitors As Deal Saga Continues", "text": "Shares of Paramount Global edged lower Thursday, day three in the red, amid lingering uncertainty around Skydance\u2019s latest offer. With bigger than anticipated sweeteners for Class B shareholders, it was approved by Par\u2019s special board committee and sent on to controlling shareholder Shari Redstone but with no announcement forthcoming. Redstone controls Paramount through family holding company NAI, which owns about 80% of the company\u2019s Class A voting shares. She\u2019s always had the last word and Skydance wasn\u2019t necessarily going to be an immediate slam dunk. But Deadline also hears Redstone continues to explore two other options as well as the Skydance offer that formally landed on her plate over the weekend. More from Deadline One of the two is a bid from an investor group led by Steven Paul. Deadline hears there is one other interested party. Both of those proposals \u2014 they may not be formal offers yet \u2014 would only involve acquiring Redstone\u2019s controlling stake in NAI, no merger. It\u2019s not clear if either is feasible or FCC compliant. Separately, Sony, which is interested in a deal directly for Paramount, continues its due diligence. Meanwhile, the tone and tenor of ongoing negotiations with Skydance aren\u2019t clear but may be strained. The last offer from David Ellison and backers Larry Ellison and RedBird Capital reduced the cash paid to Redstone for her NAI stake in order to put more of it into buying out, in part, Paramount\u2019s minority shareholders. They had threatened to sue if Redstone received a big premium for her shares, while they got nothing for theirs, and then pushed through a dilutive acquisition of Skydance. Paul\u2019s group is said to be offering Redstone more than the $2.25 billion than Skydance did in its last offer, but less than $3 billion, according to Bloomberg. John Paul DeJoria, the billionaire co-founder of Patr\u00f3n tequila and Paul Mitchell hair care products, told the outlet in an interview that he is among Paul\u2019s group of wealthy investors making a run at Paramount. He seemed to have CBS News in mind, saying, \u201cThere is not one news station that\u2019s non-political.\u201d \u2026 \u201cI can promote positive information on their stations. It\u2019s a wonderful thing to be able to be a positive influence on everybody.\u201d Sony continues its examination of Paramount\u2019s books. Last week, on the night of the Bad Boys: Ride or Die premiere \u2014 the same day Ellison revised his offer for Par \u2014 Sony Pictures Entertainment CEO Tony Vinciquerra told Deadline talks were \u201cstill progressing\u201d. Speculation abounds \u2014 that it may just be hard for Redstone to pull the trigger on a sale of the company her father built over decades, or that giving up mogul status is tough to do. She\u2019ll will be showing up at Allen & Co\u2019s annual Sun Valley retreat in July once again alongside Disney CEO Bob Iger, CAA\u2019s Bryan Lourd, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, Meta\u2019s Mark Zuckerberg, Microsoft founder Bill Gates and more. With all this in the background, an awkwardly timed annual meeting Tuesday saw Paramount\u2019s new CEO trio (Brian Robbins, George Cheeks and Chris McCarthy) outline a strategy to go it alone and never mention M&A. Paramount did push a town hall meeting originally skedded for Wed. up by a few weeks hoping to give staff more clarity then than they can now. Awkward moments are piling up. The three-member office of the CEO was announced as former CEO Bob Bakish was pushed out, which was the same day as a quarterly earnings call led by Paramount\u2019s CFO where there was no mention of M&A and no analyst questions were taken, which is highly unusual. As for Skydance, its revised offer tries to address concerns expressed by stockholders other than Redstone. Now she gets less and they get more. Specifically, the numerous holders of the non-voting Class B stock would be offered $15 a share for about half their shares if they want to sell. Class A shareholders would receive $23 a share, although there are relatively few of them besides Redstone with Mario Gabelli the biggest outside owner of voting stock. The deal also calls for Paramount and Skydance to merge with Par acquiring Skydance in an all-cash transaction that dilutes current stockholders (as issuing new shares always does). So Skydance trimmed its own valuation here with the proposed cost of that transaction falling from $5 billion to $4.75 billion. Skydance would also invest significant cash in the company. Investors bid the stock up Monday on news of the unexpectedly sweetened terms for Class B shareholders and assumed a deal was imminent. The stock ended down about 1% today at $11.97 \u2014 off 6.5% from Monday\u2019s close. Deadline hears Redstone is considering holding a so-called \u201cmajority of the minority\u201d vote for all shareholders (besides herself) to gauge their sentiment. An affirmative vote may be the one way she\u2019d be able to fight eventual litigation that investors have warned of. So indemnification is an issue and Redstone might like Ellison to assume legal liabilities. Shareholders may like the deal more more now but would still, most likely, not approve it. It seems that Redstone could be in the clear legally by just selling NAI to someone for a big premium. That\u2019s her right. The lawsuits would come from her merging CBS and Skydance as part of a transaction. A \u201cgo-shop\u201d period is also significant, some say. It would allow Par to consider better bids even after signing a deal. Even when a company has an agreement in place there\u2019s a window when others can still jump in and offer more. Evaluating those if they come is part of a board\u2019s fiduciary duty. One Wall Streeter speculated that\u2019s what Apollo and Sony may be waiting for. \u201cMy guess is the sticking point is that she wants him to assume backstop on any litigation,\u201d this person said. \u201cI am betting her attorneys are saying the only way for her to avoid litigation is to have the shareholder vote.\u201d \u201cAnd if she signs a no-shop clause, she can\u2019t shop the deal and that also opens her up to litigation because she hasn\u2019t tried to get the highest value for shareholders.\u201d Best of Deadline Sign up for Deadline's Newsletter.

It\u2019s no secret that status matters, particularly when flying legacy carriers like American, United and Delta \u2014 but there are upper tier privileges so exclusive, most passengers boarding your typical flight won\u2019t even know they\u2019re available. Porsche ride to your plane? Check. Bottomless champagne? These things \u2014 and more \u2014 can be yours, provided the airline decides you\u2019ve been loyal enough. No more duking it out with your flight mates for room in the overhead locker \u2014 you\u2019ll be first on the plane, naturally. All your flights will be upgraded, any delays or cancellations will be no sweat to work around, thanks to a dedicated phone number where real, life humans are at your beck and call 24 hours a day. Forget what you\u2019ve heard about the typical airline reward programs \u2014 these ultra-elite perks, more associated with celebrities and the extremely wealthy, are invitation-only, but there\u2019s good news: that invitation can be earned by traveling. Lots and lots of traveling. American Airline\u2019s Concierge Key, United\u2019s Global Services and Delta\u2019s shadowy Delta 360 are the most coveted programs \u2014 they\u2019re all relatively secretive about what it takes to get in, and how many people are in the pograms, though it\u2019s estimated that there are just 10,000 members worldwide between them, the Daily Mail reported. What is American Airlines Concierge Key? Believed to be reserved for those who\u2019ve spent $50,000 with the carrier, Concierge Key doesn\u2019t publicize criteria, but influencers and travel planners who all but live on planes are likely candidates. And you\u2019ve got to keep impressing the airline to stay in the club, with membership up for review each year. Benefits include universal lounge access no questions asked, the maximum upgrade available to any ticket before other frequent fliers get access, the earliest boarding slot and 24/7 live support just a phone call away. Tight connections? Someone might very well whisk you across the tarmac in a branded car. Scott Chandler, a rep for American, suggested that to make the grade, customers basically breathe, eat and sleep the airline, spending a ton of money on travel, but also using the airline\u2019s shopping portals and branded credit card.\u201cThey\u2019re basically interacting with American on a daily basis, not just when they\u2019re flying,\u201d Chandler said. What is United Airlines\u2019 Global Services? You\u2019ll still need an invite, but anyone can qualify for one \u2014 provided they\u2019ve flown at least 4 million miles with the carrier. That can take decades, however \u2014 many Global Services members reportedly earn their stripes in other ways, though the specifics aren\u2019t clear, with a very few United employees even understanding the program fully, though it\u2019s also believed that spending $50,000 a year helps out a lot. One thing\u2019s for certain \u2014 if you want to hear people talking positively about a major carrier like United, drop in on an online discussion about Global Services. The perks could make any traveler green with envy \u2014 exclusive check-in areas away from the madding crowds at United hubs like Newark and San Francisco, a reserved Mercedes for cross-tarmac transfers, and a at-beck-and-call, 24/7 phone number and email to help navigate around any issues. Best of all, say members, is the get-them-home policy that will put Global Services passengers on any flight if necessary, United or no \u2014 an experience one lucky elite described to WSJ.com as \u201cmagical, elusive, absolutely incredible.\u201d What is Delta Airlines\u2019 Delta 360? While Delta advertises this program as an \u201cannual, invitation-only membership for our most loyal SkyMiles Members,\u201d don\u2019t go looking for more details. Customers are merely told to look forward to the carrier\u2019s \u201cmost premium suite of benefits and services, exclusive to our top SkyMiles members.\u201d Reportedly, developing a habit of booking lots of pricey, full fare tickets in any class flags you as a potential invitee, as does your position \u2014 how much business can you drive to the airline, for example, in a role in a field like corporate travel. Others have said that spending $100,000 a year on flights alone is necessary to get noticed. Dedicated customer service, unfettered access to Sky Clubs for you and your family, and a Porsche SUV for tarmac transfers are the norm, once you\u2019re in \u2014 though one of the biggest perks is said to be the specially designed 360 club bag tag, known to show up on eBay and sell for hundreds of dollars.", "summary": "Your chariot awaits \u2014\u00a0if you're worthy, that is.", "url": "https://nypost.com/2024/06/08/lifestyle/porsche-ride-to-your-plane-the-secret-ultra-elite-airline-status-thats-nearly-as-good-as-flying-private-and-how-you-can-get-it/", "image": "https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/06/frequent-fliers-across-americas-three-83468385.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-08 15:19:40", "author": "David Landsel", "authors": ["David Landsel"], "language": "en", "source_country": "us", "sentiment": -0.139}

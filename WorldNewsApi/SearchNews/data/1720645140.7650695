Following Jurgen Klopp\u2019s emotional departure at the end of last season, former Feyenoord manager Slot has taken over at Anfield. Slot arrives at Liverpool having won both the Eredivisie and the KNVB Cup with Feyenoord and will be charged with ensuring his new side contend for the Premier League alongside Arsenal and Manchester City. The Dutch manager is already looking for additions to put his own spin on the squad, the 45-year-old may turn to his former side for inspiration. According to The Telegraph, Newcastle winger Minteh, who spent last season on loan at Feyenoord, is one player that Liverpool are interested in this summer. Minteh has yet to play a minute for Newcastle but impressed last season in the Netherlands, notching up 11 goals and six assists in all competitions. While Newcastle hold the 19-year-old in high regard, the club are said to be willing to entertain offers of around \u00a340 million for the winger as they seek to ease concerns over profit and sustainability rules.

Speaking earlier in the season, Newcastle boss Eddie Howe was impressed with Minteh\u2019s displays out on loan. \u2018He\u2019s done really well and he\u2019s attacked the challenge of going on loan to a new league with new teammates, played in the Champions League, prestigious competitions,\u2019 Howe said. \u2018He\u2019s done really, really well this year and I think he can be very proud of his efforts.\u2019 Newcastle are also said to be considering selling Bruno Guimaraes to ease their financial concerns, with the Brazilian recently conceding that his future at the club is in \u2018god\u2019s hands\u2019.

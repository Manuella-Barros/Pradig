The two most awaited events since Hunter\u2019s confirmation. The Tony Awards \u2014 as exciting as multi-wed Lopez telling Ben Affleck to get dressed and get out. Shows now cost more than when Fanny was a girl\u2019s name. Today you can\u2019t get into hits unless you were born there \u2014 or your diaper came with a dowry. And floppolas? Nobody stays in seats anymore unless they passed on during intermission. To get tough tickets, there\u2019s the scalper \u2014 a\u2009k\u2009a scalpel. The attitude is: \u201cReally? She wants I should just hand her tickets to a hit?\u201d Well, what else! For a flop who needs him. Ticket sellers at any SRO play remember their past six turkeys in a row with understudies taking over and coughers filling the orchestra. Seeing you he thinks, \u201cWell, where were you when we needed you?\u201d And always somehow somebody with pleurisy coughs on my neck. Or, within the first 15 minutes, fidgets about wrong seating. I\u2019ve seen performances while an usher\u2019s shining her flashlight at me as they fight. Tickets, please At hits, it\u2019s aggravation about wrong seating. At flops large behinds \u2014 with backpacks \u2014 are always in the proper place. And smokers cough throughout intermission, so they can clear their throats during Act 2. But: It\u2019s June. When all good wives go to the country and all bad husbands go to their girlfriends. There\u2019s summertime theater. Even in places like, maybe, Up Yours, Montana. Just never ask in advance, \u201cIs the place air-conditioned.\u201d I mean, please. Winter it\u2019s just a plain cattle barn and cows rarely need to run summertime to a one-bedroom condo in Delray. Summer stock\u2019s an education. One years-ago season, I had five roles and seven affairs. I wasn\u2019t their best actress \u2014 but I was their happiest. You start as an apprentice \u2014 making scenery, painting flats. So talented I could\u2019ve landed a job immediately \u2014 as a cabinetmaker. Listen, you haven\u2019t lived until you\u2019ve seen \u201cHamlet\u201d on the road in Pittsburgh \u2014 or Tennessee Williams in a tent in Polish. Actresses sometimes hear that a maybe semi-luminary \u2014 like an out-of-work theater critic \u2014 is visiting their summer barn. It\u2019s her chance, she figures. Actually, it\u2019s her figure that\u2019s her chance. She connives to play the lead in their production of \u201cRain.\u201d However, happens this part-time theater critic is hibernating for the summer. He\u2019s locked into Jack Daniel\u2019s, writing his own Broadway show. So her \u201cRain\u201d becomes a drizzle. Hometown tour I mostly accept the country because it\u2019s necessary to go through it to reach the city. It\u2019s birds and bees and bores. Last July, I actually went to a summer theater. The setting was lovely. The acting wasn\u2019t. It\u2019s the only barn I\u2019ve ever been to that smelled worse without livestock. Also, the ing\u00e9nue looked older than the history of New England. But, nobody else has Broadway. I can bitch because I love NYC and those who live life upon the wicked stage. I love saying hello to Herald Square. And as you read this I\u2019ll be back saying hello to the gang on 42nd Street and telling them I will soon be there. Hey, it\u2019s only in New York, kids, only in New York.", "summary": "Nobody stays in seats anymore unless they passed on during intermission.", "url": "https://nypost.com/2024/06/17/opinion/behind-the-scenes-at-broadways-flops-and-hits-and-which-seasons-are-the-best-to-go/", "image": "https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/06/TOYNTNT1.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200", "video": "https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/ZJUcZPlg-RyIcpnTz.mp4", "publish_date": "2024-06-18 00:13:19", "author": "Cindy Adams", "authors": ["Cindy Adams"], "language": "en", "source_country": "us", "sentiment": -0.046}

{"id": 231969174, "title": "Election 2024: Fine Gael and Labour to battle it out for seat in Inishowen?", "text": "The Labour Party and Fine Gael could battle it out for the last seat in the Carndonagh Electoral Area. Sitting Fine Gael county councillor Johnny McGuinness (pictured above) and hi council colleague Martin Farren from Labour could do battle for the last seat. Tallies suggest that Ali Farren of the 100% Redress Party will take a seat as will Martin McDermott of the Fianna Fail party. Albert Doherty of Sinn Fein is in third place in the tally but he is just 100 votes ahead of Martin Farren. That looks like it will leave a straight shoot-out between McGuinness, the son of the late Bernard McGuinness, and Farren. Depending on transfers this could leave a situation where both the Fine Gael party of the Labou Party will be left without a county councillor in Inishowen. A first count is not expected until after 3pm so it is all to play for in Carndonagh.", "summary": "<p>The Labour Party and Fine Gael could battle it out for the last seat in the Carndonagh Electoral Area.

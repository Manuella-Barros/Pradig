David Trone (D-MD) and Prince George's County Angela Alsobrooks has garnered national attention as the contest has devolved into some of the most bitter infighting among Democrats ahead of the November election. Despite securing endorsements from top Democratic leaders early on in the cycle, Trone has since been heavily criticized for a slew of controversial comments, allowing Alsobrooks to close in on his initial lead.\n\nRecent polling from Emerson College/The Hill/DC News Now released on Thursday shows Alsobrooks leading Trone 42% to 41%, putting the two at a virtual tie and well within the poll's margin of error of 4.5 percentage points.

The campaign marks the first time an outside group has launched a campaign on Alsobrooks's behalf, as Trone has dominated the airwaves with his own personal fortune.\n\nThe ad campaign comes as campaign ads between Trone and Alsobrooks have increasingly turned negative over the last few weeks.\n\nFeatured Local Savings\n\nTrone was the first to air an attack ad against Alsobrooks, featuring comments from a black local official who said the Senate is not a place for \"training wheels.\" Trone later removed the line from the ad after receiving a letter signed by more than 650 black women decrying the ad as offensive.\n\nMeanwhile, Alsobrooks has taken aim at Trone's wealth, referencing the millions he has spent to fund his campaign on multiple occasions.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM THE WASHINGTON EXAMINER\n\nFormer GOP Gov.

But with a popular former Republican governor running for an open Senate seat and eight House races, the Old Line State could spring a few surprises this November. In this series, Old Line, New Battles: Maryland feels the primary pinch, the Washington Examiner will look at the key figures and important issues six months until Election Day. Part Two will focus on the Democratic Senate primary.\n\nThe Democratic primary for an open Senate seat in Maryland is shaping up to be one of the most contentious races of the 2024 cycle, driving a wedge between Democrats as they split on who should replace Sen. Ben Cardin (D-MD) and maintain their slim majority in the upper chamber.\n\nThe general election is not considered to be particularly competitive and is expected to favor the Democratic nominee, raising the stakes of the May primary as the party struggles to coalesce around a single candidate. The winner will go on to face former Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan, whose candidacy Republicans are hoping will tip the race in their favor.\n\nMaryland's Tuesday primaries will feature a faceoff between Rep. David Trone (D-MD) and Prince George's County Executive Angela Alsobrooks, a contest that has devolved into some of the bitterest infighting among Democrats ahead of the 2024 elections.\n\nTrone secured an early advantage after announcing his Senate bid last year, attracting widespread support among House Democratic leaders such as Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries (D-NY) and Whip Katherine Clark (D-MA).\n\nTrone was lauded as a strong candidate largely because of his ability to self-fund his campaign. Since then, the Maryland Democrat has poured tens of millions of dollars from his own pockets to keep his campaign afloat, dominating Alsobrooks in the polls.\n\nBut Alsobrooks has also received high-profile endorsements from a majority of the Maryland representatives, a blow to Trone who works alongside them in the House representing the state's 6th Congressional District.\n\nThe hotly contested primary has become even more competitive in recent weeks due to a slew of controversial comments by Trone, prompting many of his Democratic colleagues in the House to turn against him.\n\nTrone apologized in March after using a racial slur during a House Budget Committee meeting, drawing widespread scrutiny among Democratic lawmakers and prompting several of them to throw their support behind Alsobrooks. Shortly after those comments, several members of the Congressional Black Caucus endorsed Alsobrooks's campaign, as well as several other high-profile Democratic lawmakers.\n\nTrone later came under fire for other comments, including a jab at Prince George's County officials who endorsed Alsobrooks as being \"low-level.\"\n\nWith just days until the primary election, campaign ads between the two have increasingly turned negative. Trone was the first to air an attack ad against Alsobrooks, featuring comments from a black local official who said the Senate \"is not a place for training wheels,\" a phrase that prompted backlash for its \"tones of misogyny and racism.\"\n\nTrone later removed the line from the ad after receiving a letter signed by more than 650 black women decrying the ad as offensive.\n\nThe comments have also made some lawmakers on Capitol Hill uneasy, creating some tension among Maryland Democrats.\n\n\"I'll be glad when the primary's behind us, I'll say it that way,\" said Rep. Glenn Ivey (D-MD), who endorsed Alsobrooks. \"Whatever hard feelings there might be after this primary, I think they'll be cleared up quickly.\"\n\nFeatured Local Savings\n\nMeanwhile, Alsobrooks has taken aim at Trone's wealth, referencing the millions he has spent to fund his campaign on multiple occasions.\n\nAfter Trone accused Alsobrooks of spending her career \"working her way up the ladder from one political job to the next\" during an interview with NBC4 Washington, Alsobrooks rebuked his comment, saying she doesn't \"begrudge people who earn money, even if they do so selling liquor.\"\n\n\"To allow the person with the most money to buy an election, that is a very dangerous precedent, and I don't think Marylanders are going to allow it,\" Alsobrooks said to the outlet.\n\nRep. Steny Hoyer (D-MD), the former No. 2 Democrat in the House, is the latest to throw his support behind Alsobrooks, lauding her \"qualifications, temperament, and skills\" as a county executive. Hoyer also made an apparent swipe at Trone in his endorsement despite not referring to his fellow House Democrat by name.\n\n\"Making demeaning attacks against Angela only divides our party at a time when maintaining unity is more important than ever,\" Hoyer said in a statement. \"I have never been more certain that Angela is the right choice for Maryland.\"\n\nHowever, Trone's campaign remains confident in his chances to be elected, framing him as the best candidate to take on Hogan in November.\n\n\"We can't take anything for granted, and we can't sit on the sidelines in this election,\" a campaign spokesperson told the Washington Examiner in a statement. \"That's why we'll spend these final days doing what we've done since day one: listening to voters, understanding the challenges they face, and sharing our message of getting things done.\"\n\nA poll from the Washington Post in late March found Trone with a slim lead over Alsobrooks in the primary. However, a large bloc of nearly 40% of Democratic voters were undecided at the time, the survey showed.\n\nHowever, an Emerson College Polling/the Hill/DC News Now poll released Thursday showed Alsobrooks leading Trone 42% to 41%, essentially making the pair tied with the poll's margin of error being plus or minus 4.5 percentage points. The poll's results show that the field is not settled as voters prepare to cast their ballots.\n\nWhoever emerges from the primary will face a strong challenger in Hogan, who leads Trone and Alsobrooks in hypothetical matchups between the two, according to the poll. However, the seat is predicted to lean Democratic, according to the nonpartisan Cook Political Report, giving the party a boost as it looks to hold on to the seat, prompting some lawmakers to urge their colleagues to move past any infighting.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM THE WASHINGTON EXAMINER\n\n\"This is so much bigger than any individual's ego or career ambitions,\" Rep. Jamie Raskin (R-MD) told Axios. \"This really is about the future of the country. We cannot afford to lose a Senate seat.\"\n\nAlsobrooks's campaign did not respond to the Washington Examiner's request for comment.\n\nSign Up for Springs AM Update Your morning rundown of the latest news from Colorado Springs and around the country\n\nSign Up View all of our newsletters.

David Trone (D-MD) and Prince George's County Angela Alsobrooks has garnered national attention as the contest has devolved into some of the most bitter infighting among Democrats ahead of the November election. Despite securing endorsements from top Democratic leaders early on in the cycle, Trone has since been heavily criticized for a slew of controversial comments, allowing Alsobrooks to close in on his initial lead.\n\nRecent polling from Emerson College/The Hill/DC News Now released on Thursday shows Alsobrooks leading Trone 42% to 41%, putting the two at a virtual tie and well within the poll's margin of error of 4.5 percentage points. The survey underscores the recent momentum from Alsobrooks over the last few weeks, as a Washington Post poll from late March showed her trailing Trone by 7 points.\n\nAlsobrooks may also benefit from a last-minute ad campaign from Women Vote!, a super PAC tied to EMILY's List, seeking to attack Trone just days ahead of the primary election. The campaign marks the first time an outside group has launched a campaign on Alsobrooks's behalf, as Trone has dominated the airwaves with his own personal fortune.\n\nThe ad campaign comes as campaign ads between Trone and Alsobrooks have increasingly turned negative over the last few weeks.\n\nTrone was the first to air an attack ad against Alsobrooks, featuring comments from a black local official who said the Senate is not a place for \"training wheels.\" Trone later removed the line from the ad after receiving a letter signed by more than 650 black women decrying the ad as offensive.\n\nMeanwhile, Alsobrooks has taken aim at Trone's wealth, referencing the millions he has spent to fund his campaign on multiple occasions.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM THE WASHINGTON EXAMINER\n\nFormer GOP Gov. Larry Hogan's entrance into the race made what was a sure bet for Democrats in November far more competitive for the open Senate seat, raising the stakes of Tuesday's primary.\n\nHogan leads Trone and Alsobrooks in hypothetical matchups, according to the Washington Post poll.

Head-to-head polling has varied widely, but a pair of recent polls favors Trone and Alsobrooks against Hogan, with the former performing slightly better in both.", "source": {"uri": "washingtonexaminer.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Washington Examiner"}, "authors": [{"uri": "ross_o_keefe@washingtonexaminer.com", "name": "Ross O'Keefe", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Trone", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "David Trone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EMILY's_List", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "EMILY's List"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greg_Abbott", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Greg Abbott"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-abortion_movements", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Anti-abortion movements"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maryland", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Maryland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Maryland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angela_Alsobrooks", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Angela Alsobrooks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WTOP-FM", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "WTOP-FM"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian_Kemp", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Brian Kemp"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Washington_Post", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Washington Post"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince_George's_County,_Maryland", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Prince George's County, Maryland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Prince George's County, Maryland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abortion-rights_movements", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Abortion-rights movements"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_action_committee", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Political action committee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abortion", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Abortion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larry_Hogan", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Larry Hogan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Van_Hollen", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chris Van Hollen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor_of_Maryland", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Governor of Maryland"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wes_Moore", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wes Moore"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_states_and_blue_states", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Red states and blue states"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns_and_Elections", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns and Elections", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Niche/Politics", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Niche/Politics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Gay,_Lesbian,_and_Bisexual/Politics", "label": "dmoz/Society/Gay, Lesbian, and Bisexual/Politics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Democracy", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Democracy", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 95}], "image": "https://wex-s3.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/GettyImages-1760555221.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9554359", "eventUri": "eng-9554359", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-14", "textStart": 2022, "textEnd": 2028}], "sentiment": 0.223529411764706, "wgt": 212, "relevance": 1}

Surrogates of David Trone held a news conference to tout his campaign and to take more shots at Alsobrooks, though she was rarely mentioned by name.\n\nRead More Election 2024 News:\n\n\"We need someone who can be effective from day one,\" said Prince George's County State's Attorney Aisha Braveboy.\n\nAnd there were repeated suggestions from Prince George's County Council member Krystal Oriadha, an outspoken supporter of Trone's, that Republicans were \"trying to intentionally infiltrate\" the race by throwing money at Alsobrooks because she was a weaker candidate than Trone.\n\nBut Oriadha disputed the idea that the race has been \"super negative,\" in her words.\n\n\"I think there's some conversation around record, which is fair. There's conversation about what people support and don't support,\" she said. \"That's fair to do.\"\n\nShe denied any of her comments have been personal in nature, though as one of the more liberal members of the council, she's had frequent clashes with other colleagues as well as the Alsobrooks administration over policy.\n\n\"My colleagues see that. They see the bills I put forward. They see things that I fight for. And they see that the county executive doesn't align with those things,\" Oriadha said. \"So it's not a far stretch that I wouldn't be able to endorse her for Senate.\"\n\nBut those on the council who back Alsobrooks, including chair Jolene Ivey, believe it is personal for Oriadha and Ed Burroughs, whose suggestion that Alsobrooks would need \"training wheels\" initially appeared in a Trone commercial before later being edited out.\n\n\"There's only a couple of them who are not supporting Angela,\" Ivey said. \"But because David Trone has so much money he just puts it on TV all the time and it makes it look like there's all these people supporting him from Prince George's, but thank God the polls don't show that.\"\n\nSeveral former Democratic state party chairs have started putting out statements criticizing Trone for the tone of his campaign, including Thursday afternoon.\n\n\"David Trone has cast disparaging comments about women, inadvertently uttered racial slurs, and has denigrated public service. He will be challenged in building the statewide unity that is needed to win in November,\" said the statement signed by Kathleen Matthews, Susan Turnbull, Ike Leggett, Terry Lierman, Yvette Lewis and Peter Krauser.\n\nIvey said the increasing negativity is coming from the Trone side because the race has become so tight in recent weeks. A new Emerson College poll actually put Alsobrooks up by 1 point this week, though the Trone campaign was critical of the methodology behind it. Nonetheless, internal polls conducted by both campaigns are in agreement that the election will likely be super close on Tuesday.\n\nBoth Oriadha and Ivey were confident that the party would mend the disagreements once the primary is over.\n\n\"There will be a healing but it's going to take a lot of time,\" Ivey said.\n\n\"I have friends on either side and they're still going to be my friends either way,\" Oriadha said. \"My hope and what we have to do is unify after the primary.\"\n\nGet breaking news and daily headlines delivered to your email inbox by signing up here.\n\n\u00a9 2024 WTOP.

The state backed President Joe Biden by 33 points in 2020, and he is expected to easily win it again in November. But Republicans are banking on Hogan making the race more competitive than expected as the Democratic incumbent, Senator Ben Cardin, is vacating his seat at the end of the year.\n\nThe Republican has led several early polls of the race, but a new one from Emerson College released on Thursday suggests that the two leading Democrats in the race are gaining ground. While Hogan is viewed as the frontrunner in the Republican primary, Representative David Trone and Prince George's County Executive Angela Alsobrooks are both vying to become the Democratic nominee.\n\nBoth held a lead over Hogan in the Emerson poll.\n\nAlsobrooks held a lead of about 10 points with 48 percent of voters saying they would support her compared to 38 percent who would back Hogan in a head-to-head matchup between the two. About 14 percent were undecided.\n\nTrone held a slightly larger lead in the general, as 49 percent of respondents said they would support him, while just under 38 percent said they would vote for Hogan. About 14 percent said they were undecided.\n\nIn the Democratic primary, Alsobrooks held a one-point lead over Trone, though the survey remained in the margin of error. Forty-two percent of respondents said they would support her, while 41 percent said they would back Trone.\n\nThe poll was conducted from May 6 to 8, 2024, among 1,115 registered voters in Maryland. It has a margin of error of plus or minus 2.9 percentage points. Among Democrats, the sample was 462 registered voters with a margin of error of plus or minus 4.5 percentage points.\n\nNewsweek has reached out to the Alsobrooks, Hogan and Trone campaigns for comment via email.\n\nOther independent polls, however, have found Hogan with a lead over Democrats.\n\nA poll conducted by The Baltimore Sun, the University of Baltimore and WBFF in April found Hogan with large leads over Democrats in the race. He led Alsobrooks 54-36 and Trone by 53-40, according to the poll that surveyed 1,292 likely voters from April 7 to 10.\n\nA poll from The Washington Post and the University of Maryland Center for Democracy and Civic Engagement found Hogan leading Alsobrooks 50-36 and Trone 49-37. That poll was conducted from March 5 to 12 among 1,004 registered voters.\n\nThe Cook Political Report, which monitors elections across the country, classifies the race as \"Likely Democratic,\" meaning it is \"not considered competitive at this point,\" but has \"the potential to become engaged.\"", "source": {"uri": "newsweek.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Newsweek"}, "authors": [{"uri": "andrew_stanton@newsweek.com", "name": "Andrew Stanton", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emerson_College", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Emerson College"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larry_Hogan", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Larry Hogan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maryland_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Maryland Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ben_Cardin", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ben Cardin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incumbent", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Incumbent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Margin_of_error", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Margin of error"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Governor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maryland", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Maryland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Maryland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angela_Alsobrooks", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Angela Alsobrooks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Trone", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "David Trone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince_George's_County,_Maryland", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Prince George's County, Maryland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Prince George's County, Maryland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Cook_Political_Report_with_Amy_Walter", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Cook Political Report with Amy Walter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_politician", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Independent politician"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Baltimore", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "University of Baltimore"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WBFF", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "WBFF"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newsweek", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Newsweek"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Baltimore_Sun", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Baltimore Sun"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Maryland,_College_Park", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "University of Maryland, College Park"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Washington_Post", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Washington Post"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns_and_Elections", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns and Elections", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Gay,_Lesbian,_and_Bisexual/Politics", "label": "dmoz/Society/Gay, Lesbian, and Bisexual/Politics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Democracy", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Democracy", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2390657/larry-hogan-chances-maryland-senate-polls.webp?w=1600&h=900&q=88&f=00fc6903d3b5f1f5237cd16e177c9501", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9554359", "eventUri": "eng-9554359", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-04-07", "dateEnd": "2024-04-10", "textStart": 2356, "textEnd": 2369}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "-03-05", "dateEnd": "2024-03-12", "textStart": 2560, "textEnd": 2573}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-06", "textStart": 1691, "textEnd": 1696}], "sentiment": 0.3254901960784313, "wgt": 203, "relevance": 1}

This is work that has to happen in this moment where a lot of people are discouraged.\"\n\nAlsobrooks says what's been more discouraging is the assault on women's rights.\n\nAs a caregiver to her mother and her daughter, who is a first-year college student, codifying Roe versus Wade and restoring access to equitable healthcare for women, is worth the fight in her quest to become Maryland's next U.S. Senator.\n\n\"The least I can do is fight to make sure that women like my mother have the social security they need, have the healthcare they need and my daughter, who is 18 years old, and to your question, who is facing a world where she has fewer rights than me and her grandmother,\" Alsobrooks said. \"There is something wrong with that.\"\n\nAs she gears up to take on her Democratic challenger David Trone in the upcoming primary, Alsobrooks has her eyes set on another opponent, former Maryland Republican Gov.

I'm about creating opportunity and transportation is foundational to opportunity.\"\n\nBut it's the opportunity Alsobrooks has before her to be a force for change in Maryland which is an effort she says is inspired by the words of her matriarch - to use the talent she has and to make sure she's helping other people.\n\n\"People deserve to have someone fighting for them who understand them and who care about our families that's who I am and you know, if given the opportunity, I'm going to continue fighting for all of our families,\" Alsobrooks said.", "source": {"uri": "cbsnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CBS News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angela_Alsobrooks", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Angela Alsobrooks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maryland", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Maryland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Maryland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/County_executive", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "County executive"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women's_rights", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Women's rights"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Working_class", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Working class"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/District_attorney", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "District attorney"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grassroots", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Grassroots"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince_George's_County,_Maryland", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Prince George's County, Maryland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Prince George's County, Maryland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Largo,_Maryland", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Largo, Maryland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Largo, Maryland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baltimore", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Baltimore"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Baltimore"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gun_control", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gun control"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roe_v._Wade", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Roe v.

We're very proud that we've had this grassroots coalition that that we've built all across the state and my time traveling across the state in living rooms and backrooms showed me that we're growing momentum,\" Alsobrooks said.\n\nThursday is the eighth and final day of early voting in Maryland. FOX 5 spoke with voters at early voting locations in Bowie, Landover and Chevy Chase on what issues are important to them in this election year. Not surprisingly, the economy, crime, education and reproductive rights came up often.\n\n\"People that have a vision for the future, someone who's willing to make the tough choice,\" one voter told FOX 5 when asked what they are looking for in a candidate. \"Maybe not the popular choice but make the tough choices.\"\n\n\"I mean most important to me, obviously, with young kids is women's healthcare.

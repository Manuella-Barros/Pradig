They announced their relationship by changing their profile pictures on Spotify to selfies of them together. Badosa recently revealed that Tsitsipas made the first move during the Italian Open in May 2023.\n\nShortly after announcing they were dating, the former couple started a joint Instagram account called \"Tsitsidosa\" which quickly became a fan favorite. They shared glimpses of their time together on vacations and tournaments with fans. The account, with over 87,000 followers, has been deactivated after the breakup.\n\n\"Best friends & soulmates; Nothing less; nothing more,\" the account's bio read.\n\nFans were close to seeing the Greek-Spanish couple on court together for the first time at the Wimbledon Championships in July 2023. They signed up to play mixed doubles at SW 19 but Badosa was forced to withdraw due to a spinal stress fracture. Badosa did show up to support Tsitsipas during his singles campaign in London.\n\nIn October 2023, Badosa traveled to Antwerp to support Stefanos and his brother Petros at the European Open. After the brothers won their maiden doubles titles together in Antwerp, the Spaniard joined the Tsitsipas family on court during the celebrations.\n\nDuring the off-season, Paula Badosa and Stefanos Tsitsipas vacationed together in Dubai in December and frequently shared pictures of their time together in the Middle East. Later that month, the couple paired to play doubles for the first time at the 2023 World Tennis League in Abu Dhabi.\n\nThey won two mixed doubles matches. Shortly after the tournament, Tsitsipas stated how important Badosa is to him and thanked her for being his support system. The Greek added that Badosa is her \"No. 1 fan\" and vice versa.\n\n\"He [Paula Badosa] has been a very important part of my year and one that has brought me a lot of joy, a lot of confidence in my everyday life,\" Tsitsipas said. \"She is a great support, Paula. I've built a very good relationship with her, which is extremely important and she is my No. 1 fan and I am her No. 1 fan. We carry each other,\" Tsitsipas said.\n\n'Tsitsidosa' once again paired up at the Tiebreaker Tens, a mixed-doubles exhibition tournament ahead of the Indian Wells Masters in March 2024. They won against Swiatek-Hurkacz and Zheng-Tiafoe before losing to Shelton-Navarro in the final.\n\nTsitsipas revealed that the first time he met Badosa was at a Tiebreaker Tens event, so playing together at the exhibition was of great sentimental value to him.\n\n\"Tie Break Tens is pretty much where we met first time. So it has you know a sentimental type of value for us and I hope we cando many more inthe future,\" Tsitsipas said.\n\nA few weeks later, the couple was spotted together during the Miami Open, following which Stefanos Tsitsipas turned coach to Paula Badosa ahead of her campaign at the Charleston Open.\n\nThe Greek then traveled to Europe to play at the Monte-Carlo Masters and won his third title at the Masters 1000 tournament. Badosa was not present in Monte-Carlo to celebrate the 25-year-old's first big title in two years with him but shared a congratulatory message later on.\n\nAs reported by Spanish media, the couple's last public outing was in Madrid, where they both competed in the 1000-tournament. Unfortunately, they bowed out of the event in there opening matches.

Tennis players Paula Badosa and St\u00e9fanos Tsitsipas have put an end to their relationship, as the Spaniard has communicated through a statement shared on social networks. The young woman, 26 years old, explains that the breakup with the Greek athlete occurred by mutual agreement and on friendly terms.\n\n\"After great consideration and many precious moments together, we have decided to separate our paths amicably,\" the athlete began writing in a writing shared on her Instagram stories. \"We have shared a path full of love and learning and, now, as friends with great respect, we decided to each follow her side,\" the Catalan, born in New York in November 1997, continued.\n\nOn the other hand, he adds that \"we appreciate the support of our friends, family and everyone who has been part of our history. \"As we move forward into this new chapter of our lives, we continue to wish each other the best in all of our endeavors.\" Finally, he ends the statement by \"kindly asking for privacy during this time, thanking you for your understanding and respect.\"\n\nThis decision surprises many, since the images come just a few days after the two were captured on the streets of Madrid together, giving each other hugs and other signs of affection. These photographs, therefore, did not foreshadow this breakup, since everything pointed to the couple going through their best moment. However, nothing is what it seems, since they have finally decided to end their relationship.\n\nPaula and St\u00e9fanos have had a very passionate romance since it became known that they had started a relationship. It was last May 2023 when they both decided to give love a chance together. At that time, they created a common profile on social networks, which no longer exists today.\n\nTheir romance began just before the start of Roland Garros, a tournament from which the Catalan had to be eliminated due to her back injury. Despite not playing, Paula stayed in Paris following the Greek's games from the stands. Precisely because of this injury, Badosa has gone through some very difficult months. Recently, she revealed that she has injected herself with cortisone to try to continue competing. A complicated stage that now coincides with her break with the Greek.", "source": {"uri": "usanews.net", "dataType": "news", "title": "USANews Press Release Network"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sport_of_athletics", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Sport of athletics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paula_Badosa", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paula Badosa"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaniards", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Spaniards"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exhibition_game", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Exhibition game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tennis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_network", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Social network"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catalan_language", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Catalan language"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privacy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Privacy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Instagram"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greece", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Greece"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Greece"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cortisone", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cortisone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romance_(love)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Romance (love)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Open", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "French Open"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madrid", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Madrid"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Madrid"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 62}], "image": "https://www.usanews.net/images/haberler/2024/05/_354af.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9541045", "eventUri": "eng-9541045", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "1997-11-", "textStart": 815, "textEnd": 828}], "sentiment": 0.6000000000000001, "wgt": 120, "relevance": 1}

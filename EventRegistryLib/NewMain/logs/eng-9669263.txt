Joni Ernst (R-IA) says they amount to using taxpayer money for campaign signs before the November election. She wrote in a Thursday letter to the Office of Management and Budget that it's absurd to pay for campaign signs with taxpayer money.\n\n\"Political campaign signs are not infrastructure. They do nothing to improve our roads or bridges and it's obvious their real intent is only to pave the way for Biden's re-election,\" she wrote to OMB Director Shalanda D. Young.\n\nShe said that even though OMB justifies the signs as \"transparency,\" they are not in compliance with laws requiring agencies to disclose how much taxpayer money was spent when discussing a project. Complying with that law could have the opposite of the effect Biden hopes for, she wrote.\n\nThe administration's order was a more detailed version of one originally sent out in August 2022, a few months before the midterm elections.\n\nAgencies have complied. For example, the Environmental Protection Agency's website specifies that \"for construction projects funded in whole or in part by the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law or Inflation Reduction Act through the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, recipients must place a sign at construction sites that display the Investing in America emblem and identify the project as a 'project funded by President Biden's Bipartisan Infrastructure Law' or 'project funded by President Biden's Inflation Reduction Act.'\"\n\nBiden has been accused of using taxpayer dollars to buy political favor, such as sending emails to college graduates, signed by Biden, telling them that their student loans were forgiven, that his \"administration has delivered on that promise,\" and asking them to \"share your story about what this relief means to you.\"\n\nBut the language on the signs is even more audacious because, unlike the likely unconstitutional executive action Biden took to forgive loans, presidents do not make laws.\n\nErnst suggested to OMB in the letter that the administration put up signs to highlight the embarrassments of Biden's spending.\n\n\"Why is there no billboard next to the seven electric vehicle charging stations built over the past two years boasting that they were bought by the Biden administration with $7.5 billion? Such a sign could proudly declare, 'This billion dollar boondoggle brought to you President Biden!'\" she wrote.\n\n\"A similar sign should be posted alongside the route of the 1.3-mile San Francisco rail extension the Biden administration has committed at least $3.4 billion to build, which is only a fraction of the megaproject's ballooning $8.3 billion price tag. This gravy train is on track to be one of the most expensive transit projects in the world. That certainly makes it qualify as a historical attraction deserving of a sign for public recognition,\" Ernst added.\n\nDespite costing $1.2 trillion, the \"infrastructure\" law has accomplished so little that most Americans don't even know it exists.\n\nThe signs also could violate the Highway Beautification Act, which limits signage on federal highways, according to Ernst.\n\nThe senator asked OMB to disclose the cost of the signs and whether there \"was a legal determination made as to whether these taxpayer-funded campaign advertisements and billboards misuse official government resources for political campaign purposes.\"\n\nShe also pressed the OMB to explain \"what actions have been taken or are planned by OMB to enact the provisions of Public Law 118-47 requiring all projects funded by the White House and other agencies and departments with taxpayer dollars to disclose the cost.\"\n\nErnst has successfully inserted those provisions into federal law, and she wrote that \"If you check Section 632 of Division B, Title VI of Public Law 118-47, the Further Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2024 (Public Law 118-47), you will notice the COST Act requirements\" requiring OMB to \"clearly state... the dollar amount of Federal funds for the project or program\" when \"issuing statements, press releases, [or] describing projects or programs.\"\n\nErnst said that massive federal spending has led to inflation that has wiped out any benefits of the stimulus package. \"Highway construction costs are up nearly 70 percent since Biden became president. Because the dollar isn't going nearly as far as it once did, the actual amount put towards transportation could be reduced as much as 40 percent over the next five years, according to the administration's own estimates,\" she said in a statement.", "source": {"uri": "dailywire.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Daily Wire"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

His team has even provided the departments with templates to show them how to give him top billing.\n\nSen. Joni Ernst, Iowa Republican, says it's not only unseemly, it also may be against the law.\n\n\"Folks, political campaign signs are not infrastructure. It's obvious the real intent of these posters is to pave the way for Biden's reelection,\" the senator said.\n\nIn a letter to the White House, she said the signs are \"misusing official government resources for political purposes,\" violate \"the spirit\" of the Highway Beautification Act that restricts billboards along federal roads, and skirt a law she wrote making the government disclose the cost of taxpayer-funded projects.\n\nSigns are popping up at projects across the country -- and they're drawing attention.\n\nDoug Emhoff, husband of Vice President Kamala Harris, took to social media this month to highlight a sign he came across. He posed for a photo with the sign, which was being stabilized by sandbags and which said the construction equipment working in the background was \"funded by President Joe Biden's Bipartisan Infrastructure Law.\"\n\n\"During my travels across the country, I keep running into these signs. Seems like BIL is a BFD,\" Mr. Emhoff wrote.\n\nIn addition to the infrastructure law, the White House has urged the signs be placed near projects paid for out of money from Democrats' 2022 budget-climate law, a 2022 science spending bill, and the pandemic stimulus package Mr. Biden pushed through in his first weeks in office in 2021.\n\nThat includes San Francisco's mass transit rail extension project, which is billions of dollars over budget and years behind schedule.\n\n\"This gravy train is on track to be one of the most expensive transit projects in the world,\" the senator wrote. \"That certainly makes it qualify as a historical attraction deserving of a sign for public recognition.\"\n\nShe also suggested \"billion dollar boondoggle\" signs should be posted at the seven electric vehicle charging stations built over the past two years out of a $7.5 billion pot of money -- or $1 billion per station.\n\nTaking credit for taxpayer-funded projects is an ancient art.\n\nWhen Athenians objected to building the Parthenon using public money, Pericles said he would pay for it out of his own pocket -- and plaster his name all over the works. That threat was enough to sway the Athenians, according to Plutarch, who said the assembly then urged Pericles to spend as much public money as was needed.\n\nIn America, politicians have been claiming credit for public spending for as long as pork barrel projects have been around to tout. Members of Congress regularly issue press releases celebrating money they say they helped secure for projects in their states and districts.\n\nBut presidents seemed to have implicit limits.\n\nWhen President Barack Obama oversaw the Recovery Act, which spent tens of billions of dollars in infrastructure after the 2008 Wall Street collapse, his administration posted signs touting the source of the money -- but without a mention of Mr. Obama.\n\n\"Putting America to Work: Project funded by the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act,\" read the standard sign.\n\nMs. Ernst said that amounts to \"treating taxpayer money like campaign donations.\"\n\nShe pointed out that she voted against the infrastructure law, which did draw some GOP support, and the budget-climate law, which was passed with only Democratic votes.\n\nShe said signs themselves aren't infrastructure.\n\nMs. Ernst demanded the White House reveal how many Biden signs have gone up and to disclose their cost. She also asked for any analysis on whether they constitute illegal taxpayer-funded campaign materials and whether they violate the Highway Beautification Act.\n\nThe White House told CNN last year that it expects hundreds of thousands of signs to be erected.\n\nThat includes along roads, near bridges and dams and even an empty field in Montana where, CNN reported, Mr. Biden is claiming credit

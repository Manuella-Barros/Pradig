{"id": 237070644, "title": "Rory McIlroy's hasty US Open departure lacked class he so often displays", "text": "My heart breaks for Rory. Truly. I understand why, with Netflix \u2018Full Swing\u2019 cameras closely following to chronicle and ultimately dramatise his greatest anguish, he jumped in a getaway car and sped out of Pinehurst\u2019s exclusive car park reserved for former U.S. Open champions as quickly as possible. I get it. Yet I can\u2019t shake a feeling of disappointment. McIlroy didn\u2019t do media - but that matters little. He had suffered the most painful major miss of his - in Bryson DeChambeau\u2019s words - all-time \u2018great\u2019 career. Who cares if a crestfallen McIlroy speaks to media or not? This was DeChambeau\u2019s moment, anyway. Instead, it is McIlroy\u2019s decision to escape the scene without congratulating DeChambeau on his triumph that stings somewhat. Nobody is perfect. But across his sporting career, McIlroy came just as close to the mark as anyone in the way he carries and conducts himself. His exit was not a good look.

When LIV Golf rose from the Saudi shadows, he shunned the money. He became the poster boy for what is right and wrong, a bastion of class, the people\u2019s champion. Even if that title wasn\u2019t the fifth major he\u2019s been chasing, he wore it proudly. It was a joy to be at Pinehurst on Sunday. The buzz among the captivated crowd when Rory\u2018s birdie putts can only be described as electric. The crowd roared. Fans loudly serenaded the Northern Irishman with impassioned chants of his name, even as he jostled with an American to win the United States Open. They were moments I felt blessed to witness, and I will never forget them. Either would have been a popular champion. DeChambeau has expertly, genuinely or not, manicured his image and personality. It\u2019s hard not to like him. He oozes a goofy, light-hearted aura that draws fans in for good reason. Three years ago, DeChambeau was not as popular. The 30-year-old was brash when he played, and cocky when he labelled Augusta a \u2018par-67 for me because I can reach all the par fives in two\u2019. Then he, like many other high-profile stars, joined LIV Golf. It should have hurt, given DeChambeau\u2019s admittedly exhilarating power game. But it didn\u2019t. Fans were almost pleased to see him gone, fading into relative golfing obscurity as DeChambeau took the money and ran. Fast forward to Pinehurst last week, and everything has changed. The vibrant DeChambeau is beloved by the fans, and his absence from the PGA Tour is keenly felt. For all the latest on news, politics, sports, and showbiz from the USA, go to The Mirror US . On Sunday, his cheers were just as loud as McIlroy's, and remarkably the pair represent perhaps the two most popular players in world golf (after Tiger Woods - nobody touches Tiger). Sure, Scottie Scheffler is adored, but he doesn\u2019t command emotion like McIlroy. Nor DeChambeau, based on this weekend. Admittedly, it was hard to tell who the crowd truly wanted to win more when traversing Pinehurst on Sunday. Both challengers were well-supported and well-worthy. But given the weight of McIlroy\u2019s burden, narrative, and years of goodwill earned among followers of the sport, I think he was the favourite. And this is why McIlroy\u2019s hasty departure after DeChambeau\u2019s putt at 18 dropped hurts. When Xander Schauffele won the PGA Championship and finally delivered the major his career of near-misses so richly deserved, DeChambeau - who finished a stroke behind - immediately departed the range, where he was staying warm in case of a playoff, to embrace and congratulate his former Ryder Cup teammate. Alongside YouTube, this was the latest window into DeChambeau\u2019s renewed character, as he demonstrated humility in a cruel defeat his performance didn\u2019t merit as he eyed ending a major drought of his own. Defeat, especially in such brutal and painful circumstances, hurts. It will hurt for a long time and be tough to recover from mentally, but McIlroy has proved time and time again that he is up to the challenge. Hell, if he wins the Open at Royal Troon next month, his North Carolina agony will be in the rearview mirror. On Monday, McIlroy finally took to social media to congratulate DeChambeau, naming him a 'worthy champion' and 'exactly what professional golf needs right now'. It was a touching, poignant message. But it was late, and even his most loyal fans felt a tinge of disappointment when he left Pinehurst without acknowledging DeChambeau on Sunday. Both McIlroy and DeChambeau missed late close-range putts during the tense fourth round. Both have been in fine form, performing at levels that deserve major titles. But only one was truly gracious in cruel defeat. And similarly to how DeChambeau deserved a chance to rectify, McIlroy can do the same. He's certainly earned as much, and it's not like he has besmirched his career by leaving early. It just left a sour taste, is all. Perhaps, when his ball rolled into the 72nd cup of a thrilling week, DeChambeau became not only the U.S. Open champion but the people\u2019s champion he so desperately wanted to be - he just didn\u2019t know it.

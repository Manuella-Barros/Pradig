Several hundred miles east, driving toward the front line, the sweating coolers at the minimarts and gas stations are loaded with Volia and an array of other energy drinks: Burn, Monster, Non Stop, Hell, Pit Bull and of course the eye-widening veteran of them all, Red Bull. By the time one reaches the trenches, where thousands of troops are dug in, trying to survive, the supremacy is complete: Ukrainian soldiers will pass up coffee, Coke, even water in favor of the liquid jolt they need to keep going. \u201cIn the morning, when I wake up, I drink an energy drink. When I head out on patrol, I drink an energy drink. Before an attack, I drink an energy drink,\u201d said one Ukrainian soldier who identified himself by his call sign, Psycho, for security reasons, according to military protocol.", "summary": "Cans packed with caffeine and branded with patriotic machismo have become an essential antidote to the stresses of war.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/08/world/europe/ukraine-soldiers-energy-drinks.html", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/06/04/multimedia/00ukraine-energy-drinks-03-twkg/00ukraine-energy-drinks-03-twkg-facebookJumbo.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-09 14:50:38", "author": "Jeffrey Gettleman", "authors": ["Jeffrey Gettleman"], "language": "en", "source_country": "us", "sentiment": -0.199}

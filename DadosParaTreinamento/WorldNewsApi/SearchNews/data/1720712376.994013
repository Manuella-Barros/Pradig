The TV series premiered in February 2021 and was immediately met with viral success, bolstered in large part by TikTok, where clips of the show garnered millions of views. The small-town dramedy follows 15-year-old Ginny Miller (Antonia Gentry) and her 30-year-old mother, Georgia Miller (Brianne Howey), as they learn to balance their new lives (and loves) in the wealthy fictional town of Wellsbury, Massachusetts. Created by Sarah Lampert, Ginny & Georgia has ignited Gentry and Howey\u2019s careers, alongside those of fellow up-and-coming actors Felix Mallard (Turtles All the Way Down) and Sara Waisglass (Degrassi), who play siblings and neighbors to the Millers. Within a month of Ginny & Georgia\u2019s release, a second season was confirmed; and four months after the second season aired, the show was guaranteed another two seasons. While the release date for season 3 has yet to be announced, fans are eagerly waiting for it \u2014 especially given last season\u2019s dramatic cliffhanger. But Ginny & Georgia obsessives don\u2019t have to wait in boredom \u2014 we\u2019ve rounded up a slew of other shows with similar themes to tide you over. Spanning complex mother-daughter relationships, small-town mystery and teen romance, here are 12 shows like Ginny & Georgia to watch while you wait for season 3. Gilmore Girls In the world of mother-daughter TV, chances are Gilmore Girls ranks among the most beloved. The early aughts cult classic aired from 2000 to 2007 and follows Lorelai Gilmore (Lauren Graham) and daughter Rory Gilmore (Alexis Bledel) as they navigate love, social class and belonging in their small, fictional town of Stars Hollow, Connecticut. With its witty writing, a series-long love triangle and infinite rewatchability, you won\u2019t regret bringing this mother-daughter series to your screen. The Fosters A slight departure from the predominantly mother-daughter narrative, The Fosters is a drama that follows a California-based family led by two moms, Lena Adams (Sherri Saum) and Stef Foster (Teri Polo), who share five children, several of whom they initially welcomed into their home under foster care. With Callie Adams-Foster (Maia Mitchell) as the show\u2019s titular teen, The Fosters is packed with high school social dynamics, budding romances and suspenseful personal histories, much like in Ginny & Georgia. Plus, the show has a spin-off, Good Trouble, so the series\u2019 characters will keep you entertained even beyond The Fosters\u2019 series finale. Never Have I Ever This hit Neflix dramedy follows Devi Vishwakumar (Maitreyi Ramakrishnan), an Indian American Tamil teen from Los Angeles. In the wake of her father\u2019s death, a grief-stricken Devi loses sensation in her legs, leaving her unable to walk for several months. However, given the chance to see her crush, Paxton Hall-Yoshida (Darren Barnet), she quickly recovers. Not only will the show give you that dose of high school romance you\u2019re longing for, but it\u2019s been celebrated for breaking Asian American stereotypes in Hollywood. Pretty Little Liars The teen mystery series to end all teen mysteries: Pretty Little Liars. Based on Sara Shepard\u2019s collection of books by the same name, this high school drama follows four teens \u2014 Aria Montgomery (Lucy Hale), Spencer Hastings (Troian Bellisario), Emily Fields (Shay Mitchell) and Hanna Marin (Ashley Benson) \u2014 in the aftermath of their friend Alison DiLaurentis (Sasha Pieterse) going missing. Having lost contact after Alison disappeared, the four girls are all contacted and harassed by a mysterious \u201cA\u201d who reunites the group and fuels seven seasons of chills and thrills. The Summer I Turned Pretty Based on the acclaimed trilogy of books by Jenny Han, The Summer I Turned Pretty is a coming-of-age romantic drama that follows Isabel \u201cBelly\u201d Conklin (Lola Tung), a teenager involved in a love triangle with two brothers, Conrad (Christopher Briney) and Jeremiah Fisher (Gavin Casalegno). More sentimental than stressful, this series gets at the heart of young love, new adventures and finding oneself amid it all. Jane the Virgin If you\u2019re in need of comedic relief, Jane the Virgin \u2014 which stars Gina Rodriguez as central character Jane Gloriana Villanueva \u2014 has you covered. The hilarious five-season series follows Jane, a young, religious woman who becomes pregnant after a doctor accidentally artificially inseminates her. Already hooked? It gets better. Not only is there a mother-daughter narrative that will fill the void while you wait for more of the Millers, but Jane\u2019s love interest, Rafael, is played by Justin Baldoni. Jane the Virgin has received critical acclaim for both its writing and Rodriguez's performance. The show was nominated for best television series musical or comedy at the 72nd Golden Globe Awards, and the same year Rodriguez won best actress in a television series musical or comedy at the ceremony. The OC Nineties babies won\u2019t have to think too hard to remember the fierce grip that four Orange County teens had on their psyches with The OC. Featuring four central characters \u2014 Marissa Cooper (Mischa Barton), Summer Roberts (Rachel Bilson), Ryan Atwood (Ben McKenzie) and Seth Cohen (Adam Brody) \u2014 the dramatic series examined girl-next-door crushes and social class clashes, all portrayed against a sunny, California-cool backdrop. One Tree Hill Return to the River Court with a One Tree Hill rewatch. This small-town drama does high school clich\u00e9s like no other: a catastrophic love triangle, a good-girl-meets-bad-boy affair and cruel parents masked by a veneer of wealth. Starring 2000s teen heartthrob Chad Michael Murray as Lucas Scott, alongside Hilarie Burton as Peyton Sawyer and Sophia Bush as Brooke Davis, this series will have you in its grip for all nine seasons. Degrassi Degrassi is the teen series that never seems to end. Centered around a fictional junior high/high school in Toronto, the many seasons and iterations of this show center on a wide variety of subjects and storylines, spanning questions of race, sexuality, disability, mental health and class, as well as timeless teen tropes we all know and love. With unexpected stars including Aubrey \u201cDrake\u201d Graham as Jimmy Brooks, Degrassi has more twists and turns than you could imagine. Glee While Glee is predominantly known for spontaneous musical renditions and Lea Michele\u2019s otherworldly voice, the series served up nonstop antics at William McKinley High School, the series' fictional high school. Upon its release in 2009, Glee became an instant hit and launched the careers of several aspiring stars including Michele, Cory Monteith, Dianna Agron, Naya Rivera and many more from the ensemble cast. From pregnancies to queer love stories \u2014 which, at the time, had rarely been portrayed onscreen \u2014 it\u2019s a monumental (and hilarious) show worth tuning into again and again. Sweet Magnolias A romantic drama based on Sherryl Woods\u2019 book series by the same name, Sweet Magnolias depicts the lives of three female best friends as they navigate several pillars of adulthood: family, work and romantic love. Based in South Carolina, the show revolves around recently separated single mother Maddie Townsend (JoAnna Garcia), flanked by Dana Sue Sullivan (Brooke Elliott), a chef and restaurant owner, and Helen Decatur (Heather Headley), an accomplished attorney. Firefly Lane This Netflix series premiered in 2021 and focuses on two women \u2014 Tully Hart (Katherine Heigl) and Kate Mularkey (Sarah Chalke) \u2014 who have been best friends since their teens. Much like Ginny & Georgia, the show follows the tight bond of two women and all of the ways in which their lives are challenged throughout the years. With only two seasons, it\u2019s a perfect rainy weekend watch.", "summary": "Full of teen drama and mother-daughter relationship dynamics, here are 12 shows like &#39;Ginny &amp; Georgia&#39; to watch now", "url": "https://people.com/shows-like-ginny-and-georgia-8655323", "image": "https://people.com/thmb/-jfX7H8zDsqxlmmHPmNOKWeNvgA=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(959x0:961x2)/Ginny-and-Georgia-Brianne-Howey1-6d41ba4d6e1648dcab0aa7faa6df6a9e.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-09 14:11:36", "author": "Erica Marrison", "authors": ["Erica Marrison"], "language": "en", "source_country": "US", "sentiment": 0.437}

Chen won gold in the women's synchronized 10m platform in the Tokyo Games while Quan won gold in the women's individual platform in Tokyo, setting an Olympic record.\n\nAs great as they are separately, they were equally as great together on Wednesday in Paris, tearing up the hearts of their competition. Eighteen-year-old Chen and 17-year-old Quan were perfectly in synch as they said bye, bye, bye to the rest of the field, winning their second Olympic gold medals by 43 points in the women's synchro platform finals.\n\nChen and Quan were the only divers to score more than 50 points on their first two dives, which had to have a degree of difficulty of 2.0. On the final three dives that had no limit on the difficulty, they scored at least 80 points each time off the board. No one else in the field had a dive score better than 80 all day.\n\nJo Jin Mi and Kim Mi Rae, of North Korea, finished second thanks to a final dive, a back 2 1/2 with 1 1/2 twists, that scored 77.76 points. Great Britain's Andrea Spendolini and Lois Toulson did the same dive and received the exact same score, but scores of 60.3 and 69.12 in the third and fourth rounds put the British duo in third place.\n\nJo and Kim's silver was the first ever Olympic diving medal for North Korea. The bronze was Great Britain's second diving medal in Paris. Tom Daley and Noah Williams won silver in the men's synchro platform on Monday.\n\nAmerican duo Jessica Parratto and Delaney Schnell came to Paris with high hopes after winning silver in Tokyo three years ago. But it was a disappointing day for the U.S. divers, who only had one dive score 70 points. They were in eighth place after each of the first and second rounds, moved up to third after Round 4, and finished the day sixth with a final score of 287.52.\n\nCanada's Caeli McKay and Kate Miller (299.22) finished fourth, and Mexico's Gabriela Agundez Garcia and Alejandra Orozco Loza (297.66) finished fifth. Ukraine's Kseniia Bailo and Sofiia Lyskun (285.00) and Frace's Jade Gillet and Emily Hallifax (234.84) finished seventh and eighth.\n\nChen and Quan's gold is the third for China in the Paris Games, and 50th for the country all-time, officially passing the U.S. for the most all-time Olympic diving gold medals. China came to Paris having won seven gold medals in each of the last two Olympics.

The Chinese took another step closer to an unprecedented sweep in the Olympic diving pool.\n\nKseniia Bailo and Sofiia Lyskun finished second-to-last and 74 points behind the winning Chinese pair - but the result really didn't matter to the Ukrainian women.\n\nBailo, 19, told The Associated Press she dedicated Wednesday's performance to everyone fighting to protect her war-torn homeland.\n\n\"I\u00b4m happy to be in the Olympics because I compete today for my country, for soldiers and for athletes and coaches who died in war. I'm really proud of me,\" she said, sharing that it's a challenge to focus on her sport. \"It's really difficult, it's really hard because emotionally, I'm in the Ukraine. I can't just live in Paris right now and don't think about war, because my family is there, my friends are there. I need to compete for them.\"\n\nBailo and Lyskun, 22, received warm cheers all morning. They scored a 285.00, ahead of the eighth-place French pair and 2.52 points behind Americans Jessica Parratto and Delaney Schnell in sixth.\n\nA first-time Olympian from the Southern port city of Mykolaiv, Bailo hopes this is the start of a long career on the world stage.\n\n\"It's a really good experience for me because it's my first Olympics, so I'm really happy to be in the Olympic family,\" she said. \"It's a really good job for me, because my country has a really bad problem. I feel like I can tell all the world about my country, about the situation, about athletes.\"\n\nMexico\u00b4s Gabriela Agundez and Orozco had aimed for another medal after earning bronze at the Tokyo Olympics three years ago.\n\nIt was their final competition together as Orozco plans to retire. The women still have the individual platform event.\n\n\"We grew up together, we made a great team because we dreamt together and we built a legacy and history together,\" said the 27-year-old Orozco from Guadalajara who was one of Mexico's flag bearers. \"We know that no matter what, we are one. We finished this today, and it was an honor to compete together on that platform.\"\n\nShe earned silver in the synchronized platform at the 2012 London Games.\n\nOrozco began pairing with the 23-year-old Garcia of La Paz after diving the first of her two Olympics alongside Paola Espinosa.\n\nThe Mexican women had plenty of support.\n\nBrothers C\u00e9sar and Azael J\u00e1uregui, both university students in Northern Mexico, couldn't wait to get to the pool. Azael made the 10-minute walk from the train station with a Mexican flag draped over his shoulders.\n\n\"It's very special for me as a Mexican because we have like five Olympics in a row that the people are in the finals, they are getting medals, so for me and my brother coming to the diving for the first time it's a really good experience,\" C\u00e9sar said. \"We are hoping to see medals and not only medals we hope to see our divers enjoy it and be happy with their results.\"\n\nAP Summer Olympics: https://apnews.com/hub/2024-paris-olympic-games\n\nNorth Korea's Jo Jin Mi and Kim Mi Rae celebrate on the podium after winning the silver medal in the women's synchronised 10m platform diving final at the 2024 Summer Olympics, Wednesday, July 31, 2024, in Saint-Denis, France.

North Korea achieved its first-ever diving medal, just as Great Britain, that earned bronze.\n\nIt's hard for many people to imagine achieving such brilliance at such a young age. Yet, curiously, the newly crowned Olympic champions, Chen Yuxi and Quan Hongchan, are still teenagers. However, these two Chinese divers were already part of the world elite in their discipline when they arrived at the Paris Olympics.\n\nChen won gold in the women's synchronized 10-meter platform at the Tokyo Games three years ago. Eager to match her teammate's achievement and not be overshadowed, Quan claimed gold in the women's individual 10-meter platform in Tokyo, setting an Olympic record.\n\nToday, instead of competing separately, the duo combined their efforts to outshine the other 14 competitors. The pair established their lead in the first round and finished with 359.10 points.\n\nWith a significant scoring difference, North Korea's Jo Jin Mi and Kim Mi Rae secured a coveted silver medal, while British divers Andrea Spendolini Sirieix, daughter of French TV personality Fred Sirieix, and Lois Toulson took home the bronze.\n\nThe disappointment was for Canada, a favorite to win a medal after their impressive performance. Caeli McKay and Kate Miller, who were in third place before the final round, lost their spot on the podium after an unsynchronized final dive.\n\nOn the other hand, the American pair Jessica Parratto and Delaney Schnell entered the Olympic pool with high expectations after winning silver in Tokyo in 2021. However, it was a disappointing day for the divers, overshadowed by the exceptional talent of the Chinese duo.\n\nThe 17 and 18-year-old Chinese athletes achieved a feat unmatched in diving disciplines. Both were the only divers to score more than 50 points in their first two dives, which had a degree of difficulty of 2.0.\n\nDetermined to continue making Olympic history, in the second round of dives, which had no difficulty limit, they scored at least 80 points on each dive. No other diver in the field achieved a dive score better than 80 throughout the day.\n\nChina's gold is a remarkable achievement. It is the third gold the giant Asian nation has won at the Paris Games and the fiftieth in total, officially surpassing the United States as the country with the most Olympic gold medals in diving history.", "source": {"uri": "insidethegames.biz", "dataType": "news", "title": "www.insidethegames.biz"}, "authors": [{"uri": "karate@insidethegames.biz", "name": "Karate", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "daniel_soriano@insidethegames.biz", "name": "Daniel Soriano", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quan_Hongchan", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Quan Hongchan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chen_Yuxi", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Chen Yuxi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gold medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diving_(sport)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Diving (sport)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Britain", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Great Britain"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokyo", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Korea", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "North Korea"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "North Korea"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Asia"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archery_at_the_2020_Summer_Olympics_\u2013_Women's_individual", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Archery at the 2020 Summer Olympics \u2013 Women's individual"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lois_Toulson", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lois Toulson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silver_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Silver medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "France"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Canada"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delaney_Schnell", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Delaney Schnell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caeli_McKay", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Caeli McKay"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jessica_Parratto", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jessica Parratto"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Degree_of_difficulty", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Degree of difficulty"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Olympic medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Outdoors", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Outdoors", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Outdoors/Scuba_Diving", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Outdoors/Scuba Diving", "wgt": 31}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Track_and_Field/Athletes", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Track and Field/Athletes", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally_Challenged", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally Challenged", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 66}], "image": "https://cdn.dmcl.biz/media/image/300989/o/GettyImages-D2.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9778621", "eventUri": "eng-9778621", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3725490196078431, "wgt": 177, "relevance": 1}

I can't just live in Paris right now and don't think about war, because my family is there, my friends are there. I need to compete for them.\"\n\nBailo and Lyskun, 22, received warm cheers all morning. They scored a 285.00, ahead of the eighth-place French pair and 2.52 points behind Americans Jessica Parratto and Delaney Schnell in sixth.\n\nA first-time Olympian from the Southern port city of Mykolaiv, Bailo hopes this is the start of a long career on the world stage.\n\n\"It's a really good experience for me because it's my first Olympics, so I'm really happy to be in the Olympic family,\" she said. \"It's a really good job for me, because my country has a really bad problem. I feel like I can tell all the world about my country, about the situation, about athletes.\"\n\nMexico's Gabriela Agundez and Orozco had aimed for another medal after earning bronze at the Tokyo Olympics three years ago.\n\nIt was their final competition together as Orozco plans to retire. The women still have the individual platform event.\n\n\"We grew up together, we made a great team because we dreamt together and we built a legacy and history together,\" said the 27-year-old Orozco from Guadalajara who was one of Mexico's flag bearers. \"We know that no matter what, we are one. We finished this today, and it was an honor to compete together on that platform.\"\n\nShe earned silver in the synchronized platform at the 2012 London Games.\n\nOrozco began pairing with the 23-year-old Garcia of La Paz after diving the first of her two Olympics alongside Paola Espinosa.\n\nThe Mexican women had plenty of support.\n\nBrothers C\u00e9sar and Azael J\u00e1uregui, both university students in Northern Mexico, couldn't wait to get to the pool. Azael made the 10-minute walk from the train station with a Mexican flag draped over his shoulders.\n\n\"It's very special for me as a Mexican because we have like five Olympics in a row that the people are in the finals, they are getting medals, so for me and my brother coming to the diving for the first time it's a really good experience,\" C\u00e9sar said. \"We are hoping to see medals and not only medals we hope to see our divers enjoy it and be happy with their results.\"\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2024 The Associated Press.

Three down, five to go for the perfect eight-timer in Paris.\n\nThe British pair Andrea Spendolini-Sirieix and Lois Toulson got a spirited bronze, so jolly well done and all that. But sport offers higher things than jolly-goodness; higher things than partisanship too. The Chinese showdown with perfection is becoming an enthralling aspect of these Games.\n\nThe scandal over the drugs-testing of Chinese swimmers rumbles on: but no drug in the world helps you to perform three and half inward tucked somersaults and then enter the water clean as a dart, let alone do so in perfect formation with your partner.\n\nDiving competitions begin with two compulsory dives: their simplicity gives them a special beauty, and all elite divers can do them very well indeed.

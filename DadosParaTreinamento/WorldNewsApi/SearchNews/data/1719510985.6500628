With the Hoops eating up the remaining time on the clock to see themselves through to the final whistle, late Gers substitute Lundstram lunged into a challenge on Matt O'Riley, who was able to avoid full contact with his opponent after jumping out of the way of the tackle. No action was taken by on-field referee Nick Walsh, with VAR opting not to intervene. But former Celtic hero Grant slammed the recklessness of the challenge by Lundstram and was shocked that he wasn't given his marching orders again, having been sent off in the Premiership clash with the Hoops at Parkhead just 14 days earlier. Speaking on Celtic TV's live commentary of the game, he said: \"I tell you what, if he (O'Riley) hadn't jumped over it that was another red card for Lundstram. \"It was a shocking attempt and how the referee has let him away with it, whether it was the last kick of the game or not, is shocking.\" Follow Record Sport on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram for all of the up-to-the minute breaking news, video and audio on the SPFL, the Scotland national team and beyond.

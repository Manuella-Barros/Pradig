Mandatory Credit: John David Mercer-USA TODAY Sports / John David Mercer-USA TODAY Sports\n\nOn Monday, it was revealed that a LANK documentary would be released on Friday, Aug. 2. The Alabama football program put out a trailer on Monday to break the news.\n\nThis documentary directed by Walt Brock and Michael Kulick will have many familiar names with the titles of executive producers: former Alabama cornerback Terrion Arnold, current quarterback Jalen Milroe, athletic director Greg Byrne, new head coach Kalen DeBoer, former head coach and six-time Alabama national champion Nick Saban, former Alabama Republican candidate Tripp Powell and Crimson Tide general manager Courtney Morgan.\n\nThe words \"doubt\" and \"Alabama football\" haven't typically been put in the same sentence for the past 15 or so years. In fact, the 2024 Rose Bowl matchup against No. 1 Michigan in the Rose Bowl was just the fifth time since 2009 that the Crimson Tide hadn't gone into a game as the favorite.\n\nBut this past season, Alabama had plenty of doubters, and it's part of the reason why the team fully rallied around the LANK (Let All Naysayers Know) mantra. It was something that Jalen Milroe and Terrion Arnold came up with in the offseason, but took on a whole new meaning for the team after the loss to Texas in Week 2 and poor performance at USF in Week 3.\n\nFrom that low point on, Alabama came together and started to dominate with each passing week. The Tide even ended then-No. 1 Georgia's 29-game win streak after defeating the Bulldogs 27-24 in the SEC Championship. This victory put Alabama over Florida State for the fourth and final spot in the College Football Playoff, where the Tide's magical season ended against eventual national champion Michigan in overtime.\n\nEven though it was originally Arnold and Milroe's thing, the LANK acronym quickly spread throughout the whole team and even the college football world with each victory. A few days before Christmas, Milroe and Arnold wanted it to be something the whole team could profit from as well. Along with Athlete's Thread, the tight-knit duo gifted the whole team LANK shirts with their name and number on the back.\n\nAs seen in the trailer, LANK was used by several teams in Alabama's prestigious athletic program. It's safe to say that the impact of this acronym will continue for years to come.\n\nThe documentary will likely be released on rolltide.com as it's an in-house film. This will be updated when more information is comes out.", "source": {"uri": "si.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sports Illustrated"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Milroe rushed for 531 yards and 12 touchdowns last season, developing into one of the best dual-threat quarterbacks in the country.\n\nWhile Milroe's running ability is strong, and he's also expected to lead a pass-heavy Alabama offense under first-year coach Kalen DeBoer, Milroe also understands that balancing the Crimson Tide's passing attack with strong running back play will be key for Alabama to have success.\n\nThe Tide heads into the 2024 season with a relatively young running back room. Sophomore Justice Haynes rushed for 168 yards and two touchdowns on 25 carries, including 31 yards on four carries against Michigan in the Rose Bowl. Haynes, along with Jam Miller (41 carries, 201 yards, 1 touchdown) and Richard Young (9 carries, 24 yards, 1 touchdown) are all expected to take jumps in production next season.\n\nDuring an interview Monday with the Gary Harris Show on Tide 100.9, Milroe praised Alabama's running backs for their work this offseason and gave a unique description of what the group's role will be in 2024.\n\n\"They're the exterminators in a sense,\" Milroe said. \"They clean everything out. They are the guys that do a really good job with their development.\"\n\nMilroe's comparison -- as Tide Illustrated understands it -- illustrates how Alabama's running backs will help make life comfortable for the rest of the offense.\n\nBoth Haynes and Miller could see breakout seasons with bigger roles in 2024. Their expected improvement will create more options for Alabama and take pressure off the Tide's passing game. Much like an exterminator clearing out a home full of unwanted pests, the Alabama running backs will keep defensive pests from focusing all their attention on Milroe by making Alabama's offense multi-dimensional.\n\nIn addition to praising the running backs themselves, Milroe also credited their position coach Robert Gillespie with the group's improvement this offseason. Entering his fourth season with the Crimson Tide, Gillespie has been vital in bridging the gap between the old and new staff, while developing an exciting young running back group this offseason.\n\n\"Coach Gillespie has been there the same length that I've been there at Alabama and he's done a really good job with the guys in the room, and I'm just super happy to see their development,\" Milroe said. \"All of those guys are unique in their own ways with Richard Young, Daniel Hill, Justice Haynes, Jam Miller. They're all unique in their own way, and that's what I like the most about that room.\"\n\nWhat's stood out the most to Milroe from Alabama's running back room is its attention to detail. Milroe credits that to offensive coordinator Nick Sheridan, who introduced the concept of taking both mental and physical reps at practice. If a player is not involved in a rep, they can maximize learning opportunities by paying attention and taking something from each drill, even when they're watching from afar. Milroe said the running back room has taken the concept seriously this offseason.\n\n\"Those guys do a really good job because they're behind each and every huddle, looking and communicating, whether it's good or bad just holding each other accountable,\" Milroe said. \"That's something that I notice from that group is they're very detail-oriented and you need that from a running back group.\"", "source": {"uri": "alabama.rivals.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Rivals.com"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jack_knowlton@alabama.rivals.com", "name": "Jack Knowlton", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jalen_Milroe", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jalen Milroe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Touchdown", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Touchdown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alabama", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Alabama"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Alabama"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kalen_DeBoer", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kalen DeBoer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dual-threat_quarterback", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dual-threat quarterback"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alabama_Crimson_Tide", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Alabama Crimson Tide"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rose_Bowl_Game", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rose Bowl Game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Quarterback"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michigan", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Michigan"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Michigan"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gary_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gary Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nick_Sheridan", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nick Sheridan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alabama_Crimson_Tide_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Alabama Crimson Tide football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Offensive_coordinator", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Offensive coordinator"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huddle", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Huddle"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Running", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Running", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Running/Trail_Running", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Running/Trail Running", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Running/Women", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Running/Women", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Health/Orthopedic", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Health/Orthopedic", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Running/Training", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Running/Training", "wgt": 24}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://images.rivals.com/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto,t_large/ccypyhuwabub15tqz3mm", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9774096", "eventUri": "eng-9774096", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2784313725490195, "wgt": 189, "relevance": 1}

A saying made famous by quarterback Jalen Milroe is now the basis of the film, it seems.\n\n\"Let all naysayers know\" is the phrase and it seems to be the team's mantra. In all instances of doubt, Alabama is here to remind folks who they are.\n\nThe trailer can be seen below.\n\nOf course, former head coach Nick Saban will be featured in the film. His mantra was \"rat poison,\" which was essentially any good or bad press. He just wanted his players to focus on their jobs.\n\nThe goal remains the same for Alabama: go 1-0 each week and compete for national titles. Simple enough right?\n\nThat's Milroe's mindset, even under new head coach Kalen DeBoer, who took Washington within one game of winning a national title last season.\n\n\"I think for us as a team, it's all about setting short term goals and long term goals,\" Milroe said on Get Up. \"To achieve those goals, we have to take care of right now and push each other to be the best us each and every day so that we have an opportunity to grow as a football team. So that whenever the time comes to go and attack a day as far as preparation for our opponent, it's all about the preparation in the offseason that's going to catapult us to get there.\n\n\"But what a great opportunity to have a 12 team playoff to push us to be victorious in a sense. So it's a great opportunity for a lot of teams to compete and have another opportunity.\"\n\nThe love and admiration for Saban at Alabama will never go away though, as Milroe detailed on Thursday's First Take.\n\n\"For us as players we didn't know when coach was gonna retire,\" Milroe said. \"We thought he was gonna coach for a long time. And with anything you got to look at, you know, of course as players, life after football, but also life after coaching football and what a great opportunity for him to still be around something that he loves, which is sports.\n\n\"Going into this new journey that he's going on now, I'm super excited for him, because this is something awesome for him and us as players we just had to unite together.\"", "source": {"uri": "on3.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "On3"}, "authors": [{"uri": "nick_kosko@on3.com", "name": "Nick Kosko", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Documentary_film", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Documentary film"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alabama", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Alabama"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Alabama"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_coach", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Head coach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "American football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jalen_Milroe", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jalen Milroe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alabama_Crimson_Tide_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Alabama Crimson Tide football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nick_Saban", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nick Saban"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kickoff_(gridiron_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kickoff (gridiron football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Quarterback"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kalen_DeBoer", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kalen DeBoer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/College_football_national_championships_in_NCAA_Division_I_FBS", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "College football national championships in NCAA Division I FBS"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Take_(talk_show)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "First Take (talk show)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Football", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Football", "wgt": 24}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Football/American", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Football/American", "wgt": 25}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Football/Canadian", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Football/Canadian", "wgt": 24}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Fun", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Fun", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Coaching", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Coaching", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 82}], "image": "https://on3static.com/uploads/dev/assets/cms/2024/07/29173343/USATSI_22206616-1.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9774096", "eventUri": "eng-9774096", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.05098039215686279, "wgt": 182, "relevance": 1}

The Tide also saw Malik Benson make way for Florida State and Ja'Corey Brooks leave for Louisville. Meanwhile, Jalen Hale suffered a season-ending knee injury in March.\n\nIn total, Alabama will need to replace 74.4% of its receiving production from an offense that ranked 70th last year, averaging 220.4 yards per game through the air. Fortunately for the Tide, it has plenty of talent to fill the void.\n\nWhile Alabama doesn't feature an established star in its receiving corps, it returns a pair of breakout candidates in juniors Kendrick Law and Kobe Prentice. The Tide also made a few key additions to the position group, snatching Washington transfer Germie Bernard from the portal while reeling in five-star freshman Ryan Williams. Junior Emmanuel Henderson and redshirt freshman Cole Adams might also be players to watch in what should be a deep unit this fall.\n\nThat collection of weapons has Jalin Milroe feeling optimistic. During a Monday morning appearance on Tide 100.9, the starting quarterback spoke glowingly of his targets heading into Alabama's preseason camp.\n\n\"One thing I can say is we're going to be very explosive on offense, and we have a lot of guys in that room that are very talented,\" Milroe said. \"And I truly believe that we have more talent this year than we did last year.\"\n\nMilroe credited the receiving corps for its camaraderie, stating that the receivers have leaned on each other and shown great communication this offseason. Much of the unit's positive momentum has been orchestrated by first-year receiver coach JaMarcus Shephard, who followed Kalen DeBoer from Washington this offseason.\n\n\"You've got to start with the leadership,\" Milroe said. \"Coach Shephard, the receivers coach. He's awesome, very awesome. The attention to detail, pushing excellence from the guys and ultimately not accepting mediocrity is very important, and no matter your age, how long you've been in the program, no matter what you can be held accountable and that's hailed from our leader in Coach Shephard.\"\n\nHeading into camp, Bernard, Law and Prentice are projected to be Alabama's starting trio. However, Williams has generated plenty of buzz since joining the team this summer. The 17-year-old reclassified to join the Tide a year early after becoming the first repeat winner of the Alabama Sports Writers Association's Mr. Football Award.\n\nLast season, Williams caught 71 passes for 1,320 yards and 19 touchdowns while also rushing for 269 yards. While it might take some time for him to translate those numbers to the college level, Milroe says the five-star talent is already ahead of the curve for most incoming freshmen.\n\n\"I can say this about Ryan Williams, he's prepared, he's ready to go,\" Milroe said. 'He's a guy that came in the summertime. The mentality of the guy is very important beyond anything it's how he approaches the game. Very confident player, very fast. He is appreciated by all the guys on the team.\n\n\"We just love the constant growth from him just in this short period of time, and you've got to look at and acknowledge that this guy just graduated early, and this is a kid in a sense but he came in with a great mindset, very passionate. He has goals set for himself and that's what we see from him. It's awesome to see and be around him because he's a special kid and he's going to be a key resource for us this year.\"\n\nAlabama will open its preseason camp Wednesday. The Tide will hold 20 preseason practices leading up to game week for its season opener against Western Kentucky on Aug. 31.", "source": {"uri": "alabama.rivals.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Rivals.com"}, "authors": [{"uri": "tony_tsoukalas@alabama.rivals.com", "name": "Tony Tsoukalas", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alabama", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Alabama"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Alabama"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alabama_Crimson_Tide", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Alabama Crimson Tide"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kobe_Prentice", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kobe Prentice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ja'Corey_Brooks", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ja'Corey Brooks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jermaine_Burton", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jermaine Burton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jalen_Milroe", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jalen Milroe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alabama_Crimson_Tide_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Alabama Crimson Tide football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida_State_Seminoles_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Florida State Seminoles football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louisville,_Kentucky", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Louisville, Kentucky"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Louisville, Kentucky"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JaMarcus_Shephard", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "JaMarcus Shephard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryan_Williams_(soccer,_born_1993)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ryan Williams (soccer, born 1993)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kalen_DeBoer", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kalen DeBoer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redshirt_(college_sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Redshirt (college sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Quarterback"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freshman", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Freshman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henderson,_Nevada", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Henderson, Nevada"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Henderson, Nevada"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Kentucky_Hilltoppers_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Western Kentucky Hilltoppers football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/College_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "College football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Touchdown", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Touchdown"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Camps", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Camps", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Camps/North_America", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Camps/North America", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Arts_and_Entertainment/Agents_and_Agencies", "label": "dmoz/Business/Arts and Entertainment/Agents and Agencies", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Coaching", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Coaching", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Camps/Sports", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Camps/Sports", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://images.rivals.com/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto,t_large/cs7ql7vhlevhw2chcbug", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9774096", "eventUri": "eng-9774096", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-31", "textStart": 3759, "textEnd": 3766}], "sentiment": -0.02745098039215688, "wgt": 171, "relevance": 1}

On Monday, ESPN's Greg McElroy fiercely defended the Crimson Tide and explained why they will be one of the best teams in the country in 2024.\n\n\"A lot of people want to take Alabama out of this discussion. I understand that because people have so much respect for Nick Saban,\" McElroy said. \"But, here's what I've kind of come to realize. You can respect Nick Saban and what he's done, and still acknowledge that Alabama might be still pretty good moving forward under Kalen DeBoer.\n\n\"If you give Kalen DeBoer his flowers, you're not taking away from what Nick Saban's accomplished. I think people are having a difficult time with that right now. Kalen DeBoer is fresh off a 25-3 record at Washington the last couple of years. He was 67-3 in NAIA. As a Division I head coach, he's 37-9. He's 12-2 against ranked opponents at both Washington and Fresno State. And he just had 10 guys drafted in the NFL. I think he knows what he's doing.\"\n\nDeBoer's record speaks for itself. He won the Pac-12 last season and led Washington to its first national championship appearance in the College Football Playoff era. As excellent as DeBoer is, he'll still face several obstacles in his debut campaign at Alabama.\n\nThe team lost 34 players to the transfer portal this offseason, landing at No. 57 in On3's Transfer Portal Team Rankings. In fact, Alabama will only return 44% of its total production from last season, per ESPN.\n\nHowever, DeBoer did keep the Crimson Tide's 2024 recruiting class intact. Alabama will have 26 freshmen on its roster in the upcoming season, including five-star prospects such as wide receiver Ryan Williams and cornerback Jaylen Mbakwe.\n\n\"I do think Alabama is maybe on slightly thinner ice as far as depth is concerned,\" McElroy said. \"But their best is still as good as anybody else in the entire conference. Their best is still as good as just about everybody in the sport.\"\n\nAlabama's \"best\" still includes veterans such as quarterback Jalen Milroe, linebacker Deontae Lawson and offensive lineman Kadyn Proctor.

The Crimson Tide opened practice in Tuscaloosa, in preparation for the 2024 season-opener against Western Kentucky.\n\nDeBoer's most obvious change from how Nick Saban ran practice was the time. Alabama is now a morning practice team, with start time set for 9:05 a.m. CT.\n\nThe new Crimson Tide head coach is set to address media members after Wednesday's practice. Before that, here's our observations from Alabama's opening day of camp.\n\n- Reporters were allowed in beginning with the fourth period of practice.\n\n- Endor's \"Pump it up\" was the first song on the playlist, with music a new DeBoer introduction to practice, starting in spring football.\n\n- Temperature was 83 degrees in Tuscaloosa during practice and the hydration team was hard at work, ferrying water and ice to players around the field.\n\n- After being down to two practice fields for spring ball due to construction, Alabama was back to full strength with three for the start of camp. The field furthest away from media members was mostly used for special team drills during the observable periods.\n\n- Besides the quarterbacks, no players appeared in black jerseys for the Crimson Tide, which signify non-contact participants in practice.\n\n- The observable periods didn't contain any sort of scrimmaging, with players scattered in group and individual drills based upon position.\n\n- Jalen Milroe and Ty Simpson took snaps as the apparent starter and backup during drills, as expected. Justice Haynes and Jam Miller paired with Milroe and Simpson respectively when the groups were together.\n\n- The practice offered the first chance to see Ryan Williams in an Alabama practice uniform. He made a one-handed grab and had some other solid catches.\n\n- DeBoer mostly coached with the quarterbacks throughout the observable periods. Defensive coordinator Kane Wommack stuck with the linebackers for the most part. Wommack also spent some time with the defensive line as Freddie Roach led a drill.\n\n- A few number changes for Alabama since spring. Wide receiver Cole Adams switched from 13 to 7, while defensive back Zabien Brown went from 15 to 2. Transfer linebacker Justin Jefferson took over 15.\n\n- Parker Brailsford was back on the field after missing spring practice due to personal issues. He appeared to mostly be working with the second-string offensive line, at center.\n\n- The observable practice time ended after the eighth period.", "source": {"uri": "al.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "al"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kalen_DeBoer", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kalen DeBoer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alabama_Crimson_Tide_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Alabama Crimson Tide football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alabama", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Alabama"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Alabama"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuscaloosa,_Alabama", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Tuscaloosa, Alabama"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tuscaloosa, Alabama"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Kentucky_Hilltoppers_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Western Kentucky Hilltoppers football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nick_Saban", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nick Saban"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_coach", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Head coach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_football_positions", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "American football positions"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Quarterback"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "American football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jalen_Milroe", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jalen Milroe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justin_Jefferson", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Justin Jefferson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kane_Wommack", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kane Wommack"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lineman_(gridiron_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lineman (gridiron football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defensive_back", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Defensive back"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defensive_coordinator", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Defensive coordinator"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wide_receiver", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wide receiver"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linebacker", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Linebacker"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Football/American", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Football/American", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cheerleading", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cheerleading", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Football/Arena_and_Indoor", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Football/Arena and Indoor", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Occupational_Health_and_Safety/Lasers", "label": "dmoz/Health/Occupational Health and Safety/Lasers", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://www.al.com/resizer/v2/MKD6SOKHTZFXHGH5AUHMKPGOBA.JPG?auth=1516a86894f084ae4e737ae2b468e101ab24584f7b7e5e45e0bd805d80b245a5&width=1280&quality=90", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9774096", "eventUri": "eng-9774096", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.03529411764705892, "wgt": 143, "relevance": 1}

Gabriel is +900 at Caesars, which is third at that book, behind Beck and Texas QB Quinn Ewers (+800).\n\nEwers is third on the BetMGM and FanDuel boards at +1000 with less than a month to go before the start of the season.\n\nAlabama's Jalen Milroe is the only player in the top five in odds who was in the running for last year's Heisman. The Crimson Tide dual-threat quarterback in his first year as a starter finished sixth in voting, almost 2,000 points behind winner Jayden Daniels from LSU.\n\n(*Odds courtesy of BetMGM, and are subject to change)\n\n2024 Heisman Trophy prediction: Oregon QB Dillon Gabriel (+700)\n\nGabriel will start the 2024 season for Oregon as perhaps the most experienced quarterback in all of college football.\n\nIn his sixth year of eligibility (redshirt and Covid years), the Ducks will be the third different program Gabriel has played for.\n\nThe 5-foot-11 lefty started his college career in 2019 at UCF. After three seasons in Orlando, Fla., with the Knights, Gabriel amassed 8,037 passing yards and 70 touchdowns. After suffering an injury in the third game of his junior season, he transferred to Oklahoma at the end of that year.\n\nHe then started two seasons for the Sooners, throwing for 6,828 yards and 55 touchdowns, to bring his career passing stats to 14,865 yards and 125 touchdowns.\n\nGabriel is currently sixth in NCAA history in passing yards and needs 4,352 yards to pass Houston's Case Keenum for No. 1 all-time. Gabriel has never had a 4,000-yard season.\n\nHowever, this Oregon offense might be the one to get him there.\n\nConsidering Bo Nix, who finished third in Heisman voting last year, threw for 4,508 yards and 45 touchdowns last season for the Ducks, the all-time passing record is certainly in reach for Gabriel.\n\nAnd if he can get there, there's no doubt he'll be hoisting the Heisman in December.\n\nBest College Football Betting Apps 2024 2024 Heisman Trophy picks : Alabama QB Jalen Milroe (+1000)\n\nMilroe had an incredible breakout season for Alabama in 2023.\n\nIn his first year as the starter, Milroe threw for 2,834 yards and 23 touchdowns, while rushing for 531 yards and 12 scores. And the 6-2, 220-pounder from Katy, Texas, didn't play in the Crimson Tide's third game of the season.\n\nBut once he came back as the starter, Milroe led Alabama to 10 straight wins, including beating two-time defending national champion Georgia for the SEC championship.\n\nMilroe's leadership and big-play talent put the Crimson Tide in the College Football Playoff. And even though they lost to Michigan in overtime, notice was served: Milroe is a force.\n\nBut Milroe's chances of winning the Heisman this season are predicated less on his on-the-field ability and more about Alabama's success as a whole.\n\nFor the first time in nearly two decades, Nick Saban won't be coaching Alabama, and for the first time in about as long the Tide isn't considered a favorite to play for a national title, let alone the SEC championship.\n\nA lot is riding on first-year coach Kalen DeBoer in his first year in Tuscaloosa, including Milroe's chances of winning the Heisman.\n\n2024 Heisman Trophy longshot odds: Penn State QB Drew Allar (+3500)\n\nAllar comes into his junior season at Happy Valley with a new offensive coordinator and the potential to put up big numbers.\n\nAndy Kotelnicki, a creative playcaller, comes to Penn State from Kansas as the Nittany Lions' new OC and he has plenty of experienced weapons to make things happen.\n\nIt all starts with Allar and his made-for-the-NFL, 6-5, 240-pound frame and big arm.\n\nLast year as a sophomore and first-year starter, Allar threw for 2,631 yards and 25 touchdowns and just two interceptions, helping lead the offense to an average of 36.2 points per game.\n\nWith more experience under his belt and an OC who will put him in position to utilize his play-making ability, the table is set.\n\nOf course, Allar's chances of winning the Heisman are similar to Milroe's in the fact that it really all depends on if Penn State can win the big games, especially against Ohio State and Michigan. Since 2011, the Nittany Lions are 1-11 against the Buckeyes, and have lost three straight to the Wolverines.\n\nIf Allar can lead Penn State to victories there, he'll see himself in New York.\n\nGambling problem?

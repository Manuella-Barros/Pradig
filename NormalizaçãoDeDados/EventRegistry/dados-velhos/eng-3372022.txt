Agency officials told senators in an estimates hearing in May it had struggled with a 15 per cent staff vacancy rate.\n\nIts rate of departing staff reached 19 per cent in 2015-16, dwarfing the APS average of 7 per cent, as the Nationals promised Mr Joyce's New England electorate it would host the APVMA if it re-elected them at the 2016 federal poll.\n\nLabor's agriculture spokesman Joel Fitzgibbon said Mr Joyce was guilty of a continuing \"pork barrel joke\".\n\n\"My advice to Barnaby Joyce's handpicked interim CEO is that he doesn't need to waste taxpayers' money on a review, he should just confront his boss about the mess he has caused,\" Mr Fitzgibbon said.\n\nMr Joyce, who faces a High Court challenge to his eligibility to sit in Parliament next week, and Nationals' deputy leader Fiona Nash are requiring all government ministers to justify the continued presence of public service departments and agencies in Canberra, Sydney and Melbourne as part of a whole-of-government decentralisation push.\n\nBusiness cases for the next round of forced moves are expected by the end of the year.\n\nFollow Tom McIlroy on Facebook and Twitter\n\nThe story Review to probe Australian

The rare hoodwinker sunfish, so named because it went undiscovered for years due to its similarities with the more common ocean sunfish, was confirmed to be a separate species in research published in 2017, the Seaside Aquarium posted on Facebook Thursday. \u201cThe new species managed to evade discovery for nearly three centuries by \u2018hiding\u2019 in a messy history of sunfish taxonomy [or classification]. \u2026That is why we named it Mola tecta \u2026 derived from the Latin tectus, meaning disguised or hidden. This new species is the first addition to the Mola genus in 130 years,\u201d researcher Marianne Nyegaard said seven years ago in a release from Australia\u2019s Murdoch University. This particular fish was found Monday and drew crowds to the beach. Word of mouth spread on social media to Ms. Nyegaard. She asked the Seaside Aquarium to get genetic samples, more photographs and measurements. The staff there obliged, and Ms. Nyegaard confirmed the fish\u2019s unique dimensions. The fish remains on Seaside\u2019s Gearhart Beach, where it\u2019s being scavenged by other wildlife, the aquarium said.", "summary": "A 7.3-foot hoodwinker sunfish that washed up on a beach in Seaside, Oregon, this week could be the largest specimen ever sampled for DNA.", "url": "https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2024/jun/8/large-sunfish-washes-oregon-beach-could-be-largest/", "image": "https://media.washtimes.com/media/image/2024/06/07/Oregon_Rare_Fish_75386.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-08 17:36:34", "author": "Brad Matthews", "authors": ["Brad Matthews"], "language": "en", "source_country": "us", "sentiment": -0.01}

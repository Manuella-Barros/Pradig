Biden case, which reached the Supreme Court as Murthy v. Missouri, already indicated that \"government coerced censorship\" has been proven.\n\nIn 2022, then-Missouri Attorney General and now Senator Eric Schmitt, along with his Louisiana counterpart at the time, filed the lawsuit alleging that government agencies' discussions with social media platforms about content moderation suppress free speech. Now, the case has been sent back to a lower court and Bailey suggests using this to fully expose \"that vast Censorship Enterprise.\"\n\n\"What the Supreme Court said was that the government absolutely coerced Big Tech social media into silencing American voices in violation of the First Amendment, but we need more evidence to prove that that censorship extended beyond the year 2021. Guess what? We're going back to the trial court. We're going to find it,\" Bailey said.\n\nBefore the SCOTUS decision, the watchdog Media Research Center found that the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), Department of State, Department of Justice, Department of Defense, Department of Health and Human Services, National Science Foundation and the Department of the Treasury have all pushed for various forms of censorship.\n\n\"There is a shocking degree of breadth and coordination within the Biden administration to use our tax dollars against us. We have never seen this kind of effort to silence regular, everyday Americans,\" MRC Free Speech America Vice President Dan Schneider told Fox News Digital.\n\nSchneider further said that the administration of President Joe Biden's justification for its censorship initiative is astonishing. He added that Biden's lawyers claimed that the federal government has a First Amendment right to censor citizens in court documents and oral arguments before the Supreme Court. \"This inversion of the Constitution threatens the very essence of our democracy,\" he warned.\n\nBailey to sue Biden for flying illegal immigrants to Missouri\n\nApart from censorship concerns, the MO-AG is also working on making the Biden administration pay for \"inviting\" illegal immigrants and illegally transferring them to his state.\n\nAccording to Fox News, Bailey is filing a lawsuit against President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris for refusing to turn over documents related to flying illegal immigrants into Missouri.\n\nThe lawsuit also indicated that the DHS has intentionally delayed responding to his request for the documents about the flights to Missouri.\n\n\"We have reason to believe they are deliberately flying illegal aliens from the border into our cities. Not on my watch,\" Bailey wrote on X. He also indicated in the lawsuit that the lack of transparency violates the spirit and the letter of FOIA, which states that an agency shall withhold information only when the agency 'reasonably foresees that disclosure would harm an interest protected by an exemption' or if 'disclosure is prohibited by law.'\"\n\nThe AG pointed out that the transportation of asylum seekers into his state is a matter of public concern. The citizens of Missouri have a right to know the facts about these alleged activities, he added. He also said in the suit that DHS did not provide any notice that its response and/or production of documents would be delayed due to \"unusual circumstances.\" The agency also failed to inform his office of the timeline for when the responsive records will be produced.\n\n\"Once again, the Biden Administration is trying to stonewall and circumvent every aspect of the law to hide information from Americans,\" Bailey alleged. \"Their most recent refusal to provide the truth about the flying of illegal immigrants into Missouri is just the tip of the iceberg.\" (Related: Bailey, 6 other AGs sue Biden's HHS for forcing healthcare providers to perform genital mutilations.)\n\nBigGovernment.news has more stories about the government's tough censorship yet \"weak\" illegal immigration policies.\n\nWatch the video below that talks about Big Tech censoring content about former Donald Trump's assassination.\n\nMissouri AG files lawsuit against State of New York over outrageous, lawless prosecution of Donald J.

Additionally, Bailey has offered support to county clerks and prosecutors to ensure election integrity amidst concerns over illegal immigration.\n\n\"Under Joe Biden and Border Czar Kamala Harris' Administration, there has been an orchestrated lack of enforcement of our nation's immigration laws. That failure has not only led to impeachment proceedings against top officials in the federal government; it has given rise to an unprecedented level of state actions necessary to fill the vacuum created by the federal government's ineptitude,\" stated Attorney General Bailey. \"The chaos unleashed at our open southern border has wreaked havoc on our communities, and now the individual states, including the State of Missouri, must stand in the gap as the federal government refuses to act.\"\n\nLast week, Bailey filed a lawsuit against the Biden-Harris Administration for withholding documents related to flights transporting illegal immigrants into Missouri. Following evidence suggesting such flights into St. Louis and Kansas City, he issued document requests to these cities and their airports.\n\nBailey also sent warning letters to major airlines and transportation companies, reminding them that state law prohibits knowingly transporting illegal immigrants through Missouri.\n\nIn his letter to transportation companies, Bailey emphasized that Missourians \"do not believe in mass illegal immigration, and have legislated accordingly. Missouri law makes '[t]ransportation of an illegal alien' into or through Missouri a class D felony. As a company or organization that facilitates transport of persons in or through Missouri, you are subject to this law.\"\n\nAdditionally, Bailey reached out to county clerks and prosecutors across Missouri offering assistance in securing elections. He expressed concern about budgets being stretched thin and offered prosecutorial support for crimes committed by individuals illegally present in Missouri who attempt to vote.\n\nBailey wrote to county officials stating, \"Among the most urgent issues facing our nation today is the flood of illegal aliens coming across our borders.

He endorsed Bailey in the same post.\n\nBailey was appointed as Missouri's top law enforcement official in November 2022 after Sen. Eric Schmitt (R-Mo.) won election to Congress the same month. This November, Bailey will run for a full term against Elad Gross.\n\nGross ran unopposed for the Democratic Party's nomination for Missouri attorney general. He was an Assistant Attorney General under former AG Chris Koster.\n\nWith the primary behind him, Bailey will head into November with a big advantage over the Democratic candidate. No Democrat has won a statewide election in Missouri since former State Auditor Nicole Galloway in 2018. The GOP currently controls the state's executive branch and both houses of its legislature.\n\nTuesday night's result ended a bruising, personal campaign that was flooded with attack ads against Bailey and his opponent, Will Scharf, financed by outside organizations allied with either campaign.\n\nScharf, an attorney working with the James Otis Law Group LLC, challenged Bailey for the state executive branch office with the support of national conservative power players. Scharf was endorsed by the influential Club for Growth, and his allied PAC Defend Missouri was financially supported by conservative activist Leonard Leo and Republican megadonor Paul Singer.\n\n\"This race was about taking on a political establishment in this state that I continue to believe is badly broken. I believe that Missourians deserve better government than they have been getting, and everything we have heard in our travels around the state confirms that belief. I am hopeful that our Republican slate of candidates delivers for Missouri conservatives in the years ahead,\" Scharf wrote in his concession post on X.\n\nThe down-ballot race was an exceptionally expensive contest. In a July 22 email to The Epoch Times, political spending analysis firm AdImpact said more than $14 million had been spent on the race. That amount made it the most expensive down-ballot race in the country.\n\nBailey, who won the endorsement of leading Missouri Republicans including Gov. Mike Parson, Schmitt, and Sen. Josh Hawley (R-Mo.), campaigned on a socially conservative platform highlighting his achievements and legal actions in office.\n\nScharf, who has worked on former President Donald Trump's legal team, ran as \"Trump's attorney\" and criticized Bailey for what he said were mismanaged cases and poor leadership in the office.", "source": {"uri": "ntd.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NTD"},

Mike Parson, who appointed him to the office less than two years ago, stands on the edge of winning a full, four-year term. Over the course of a bitter campaign, Bailey and his opponent, Will Scharf, went to ever-further lengths to demonstrate their support for former President Donald Trump as the GOP presidential nominee is criminally prosecuted.\n\nScharf conceded the race at a watch party in St. Louis. Bailey had more than 60% of the vote to Scharf's 37.5%, with approximately 14% of votes counted, according to the Associated Press.\n\nBailey will face Democrat Elad Gross in the November general election. Gross, a civil rights attorney from St. Louis, ran unopposed in the Democratic primary. Democrats last won the Missouri Attorney General's Office in 2012.\n\n\"Missouri's top leaders know who will get the job done. They know I will fight relentlessly for the rule of law and be a steadfast defender of our freedoms,\" Bailey said in a recent statement.\n\nBailey and Scharf, who serves as a member of Trump's legal team, shared extremely similar positions on policy. The tone of their campaigns were also remarkably similar, with both men casting themselves as delivering law and order against conservatism's perceived opponents - liberals, migrants and transgender residents.\n\nAt the same time, Bailey and Scharf - and the political action committees supporting them - painted each other as ineffectual and soft on crime. Bailey was cast as coddling criminals, while Scharf was attacked over his upbringing by affluent parents in New York.\n\nAs of late July, Scharf's campaign had taken in the most cash - 1.7 million to Bailey's 1.2 million, according to reports filed with the Missouri Ethics Commission. But those figures don't count the additional millions raised and spent by PACs supporting both candidates.\n\n\"You've got two candidates with virtually zero policy difference between them and virtually zero stylistic difference between them and you've got one who's got the benefit of incumbency - albeit appointed incumbency - and one who's got the benefit of a massive war chest,\" said John Hancock, a former chair of the Missouri Republican Party. \"So it's fascinating to look at, at that level.\"\n\nThe Republican contest underscored the ways in which state attorney general offices across the country have been transformed over the past two decades into instruments to battle the federal government and wage political and cultural battles. Traditional functions - such as consumer protection, anti-fraud work and defending criminal convictions in appeals courts - still happen but are frequently no longer front and center.\n\nFor his part, Gross promises to lean into the core components of the positions.\n\n\"We need a major change in that office. We need somebody who knows how to be the attorney general of Missouri,\" Gross said at a candidate forum this summer.\n\nScharf's loss marked a stunning setback for the first-time candidate, who had hoped to break into electoral politics by taking down a sitting attorney general. Scharf heavily promoted that he was a member of Trump's legal team.\n\nHe worked on the U.S. Supreme Court case that resulted in a landmark decision in July that former presidents enjoy presumptive immunity from criminal prosecution for official acts taken in office.\n\n\"Today, the left-wing campaign of lawfare against President Trump is collapsing or has collapsed,\" Scharf told a rally crowd in Lee's Summit last week. \"He's going to have the chance he deserves to run for president free and clear from these despicable leftist tactics.\"\n\nBut Trump didn't fully repay the loyalty in return. The former president endorsed both Scharf and Bailey last week - a split decision that was widely seen in Missouri Republican circles as benefiting Bailey at Scharf's expense.\n\nAlready in office, Bailey proposed few new initiatives or ideas if elected to a full term. Rather, he appeared to mostly promise a continuation of the way he's currently using the office as a vehicle to sue the federal government and influence the behavior of local officials through lawsuits and threatening letters.\n\nBailey sued Washington University over its transgender center at St. Louis Children's Hospital. Last year, he attempted to use a consumer protection law to restrict gender-affirming care for both adults and kids. A judge temporarily blocked the restrictions, but Bailey withdrew the rule before a final ruling in the case.\n\nAs recently as Friday, Bailey said his office had launched an investigation into a fitness center in St. Louis County over allegations the business was allowing \"a biological male to use women and girls' private spaces,\" his office said.\n\nBailey also filed numerous lawsuits against the Biden administration and was especially aggressive in opposing efforts by President Joe BIden to forgive student loan debt. The U.S. Supreme Court last year blocked a major debt cancellation plan, citing harm to Missouri.\n\nThe attorney general, who took office in January 2023 after Eric Schmitt resigned after winning election to the U.S. Senate, has also sought to block the release of wrongfully convicted prisoners. Last month, Bailey obtained a court decision temporarily delaying the release of Christopher Dunn, who was wrongly convicted of murder in the 90s; Dunn was released a week later.\n\nBailey also attempted to reverse the conviction of Eric DeValkenaere, a former Kansas City police detective who shot and killed a Black man in 2019 and was convicted of manslaughter. Jackson County Prosecutor Jean Peters Baker previously called his actions \"extremely distressing\" and \"disappointing.\"\n\nEarlier this year, the Missouri Supreme Court denied Bailey's application to review DeValkenaere's case.", "source": {"uri": "kansascity.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Kansas City Star"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jonathan_shorman@kansascity.com", "name": "Jonathan

The CHNV program has been a disaster for this country and is blatantly ILLEGAL. That is why he sued the administration last year. The case is currently in the Fifth Circuit.\n\nMissouri Attorney General Andrew Bailey told Rob Schmitt on Newsmax last night about the CHNV program. He said, \"Close to half a million migrants from Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua, and Venezuela were flown into the U.S., including Missouri.\n\n\"I had to file a lawsuit this week on that issue as well because the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) refused to turn over documents related to these illegal flights,\" Bailey told Schmitt. \"It's a felony offense in Missouri to knowingly transport a criminal alien into or through this state. We sent a demand letter.\"\n\nBailey filed the lawsuit on Monday, and on Friday, the Biden administration temporarily froze the program over allegations of widespread fraud. They knew what it would do, and they did it anyway, as Stephen Miller said.\n\nAn internal DHS report found thousands of sponsors for the migrants listing fake Social Security numbers and phone numbers, including, in some instances, those that belonged to people who were dead.\n\n\"We know that back in May, the House committee confirmed what the Center on Immigration Studies had already said, which was that 45 airports in the United States were being used for these illicit flights, two of them here in Missouri -- in St. Louis and Kansas City,\" Bailey added. \"And the people of the state of Missouri deserve to know how many illegal aliens border czar Kamala Harris transported illegally into our state.\"\n\nThey went to the red states, and many illegal aliens have insisted that they do vote. Polls show a good 10% to 15% vote. It will likely be more in November with the ne'er-do-wells we have pouring into the country.\n\nIt wouldn't take much to tilt the election to Democrats in most swing states.

Bailey beat Will Scharf in a Republican primary for state attorney general on Tuesday.\n\nFormer President Donald Trump had endorsed both Bailey and Scharf on Truth Social.\n\nBailey was first appointed to the attorney general position by Missouri Gov. Mike Parsons (R) in January 2023. Since then, he has launched investigations against a children's hospital, gym and retailer that provide services or a safe and affirming space for transgender Missourians.\n\nOne of the first actions Bailey took as attorney general was to attempt to investigate the Washington University Pediatric Transgender Center at St. Louis Children's Hospital after a former caseworker, Jamie Reed, accused the center of malpractice. Bailey gave Reed whistleblower protection and began asking the hospital for patient medical records; later, he also asked for information on therapists and social workers across the state who worked with trans youth. A Missouri judge eventually found that Bailey's office had no right to private medical information.\n\nLast year, Bailey also signed an emergency rule that created a burdensome set of requirements for trans people of all ages seeking gender-affirming care. He withdrew the emergency order only when the Republican-led legislature passed its own ban on gender-affirming care for minors, Medicaid recipients and incarcerated people.\n\nKaty Erker-Lynch, the executive director of PROMO, a Missouri LGBTQ advocacy group, said Bailey's actions have \"created a hostile environment for medical providers where they are afraid to stay and practice medicine.\"\n\nAnd just days before the state's primary election, Bailey sent out a stark warning to a St. Louis gym that had come under scrutiny from conservatives for allowing a transgender woman to use the women's locker room.\n\n\"While it might be considered fashionable in certain corporate boardrooms to pretend that biology is irrelevant, the American heartland still lives in reality,\" Bailey wrote in a statement to the company's CEO.\n\nAcross the country, GOP state attorneys general have increasingly tried to use their power to make life more challenging for transgender people. Like Bailey, many have tried to use their consumer protection powers to obtain private medical information. A U.S. Senate Finance Committee report said that such officials were \"weaponizing their oversight authorities for their own political gain, at the expense of LGBTQIA+ people and their families.\"\n\nBailey was also one of 22 Republican attorneys general to sue the Biden administration over its new Title IX rules, which expand protections more explicitly for LGBTQ+ students in federally funded schools.\n\nIf Bailey wins in November, he will no doubt be able to continue his anti-trans crusade -- along with his efforts to stomp out diversity programs and keep innocent people incarcerated -- in the deep-red state.\n\nBailey will face Democrat Elad Gross in November. Gross has heavily criticized Bailey and other Republicans for how much their anti-transgender policies distract from issues that are important to everyday Missourians and has proposed launching a civil rights division that focuses on protecting LGBTQ+ residents against discrimination.", "source": {"uri": "ca.news.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts":

This lawsuit highlights concerns over immigration practices and their impacts on Missouri, including public safety and the state's fentanyl crisis.\n\nAG Andrew Bailey's Concerns\n\nAndrew Bailey, the Attorney General of Missouri, has expressed significant concerns about the number of migrants being transported into Missouri. He emphasizes the need for explanations from Vice President Kamala Harris, who has been designated as the border czar. Bailey demands detailed information on the number of migrants brought into Missouri and the government's rationale behind these actions. He references reports from the Center of Immigration Studies and the House Committee, which confirm the use of federal resources to transport illegal immigrants into the state.\n\nImpact on Public Safety\n\nOne of the primary concerns raised by Bailey is the impact of these migrant flights on public safety in Missouri. He mentions that there have been 1,100 incidents of travel involving illegal migrants and 1,500 fentanyl tests within the state. Bailey attributes these issues directly to the actions of the federal government and the policies overseen by Kamala Harris. He stresses that these activities are making Missouri communities less safe and contributing to the state's ongoing fentanyl crisis, which has already resulted in 1,500 deaths.\n\nLegal Actions and Anti-Trafficking Measures\n\nIn response to these concerns, Bailey has filed a lawsuit against the Biden administration. He highlights that it is a felony offense in Missouri to knowingly transport illegal aliens into the state, citing anti-human trafficking measures in place to protect residents. Bailey's legal action aims to hold the federal government accountable for these activities and ensure that the safety of Missouri's residents is prioritized.\n\nBig Tech and Content Censorship\n\nIn addition to addressing immigration issues, Bailey also discusses the broader topic of content censorship by major tech companies. He accuses companies like Meta and Google of bias, particularly against conservative voices. Bailey points out a specific incident where Donald Trump's iconic photo with his fists in the air was censored, leading to outrage among his supporters. Meta has since apologized for the censorship, but Bailey questions why such incidents predominantly affect Republicans.\n\nSection 230 and Consumer Protection\n\nBailey delves into the legal framework that allows tech companies to engage in content moderation, specifically Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act. He argues that this section provides tech companies with a shield from civil liability while also giving them the power to censor speech. According to Bailey, this creates a dangerous precedent where these companies can clandestinely suppress certain viewpoints without the public's knowledge.\n\nChallenges of Fair Content Moderation\n\nBailey asserts that achieving fair and balanced content moderation is inherently challenging. He advocates for counter speech rather than censorship as the solution. Bailey warns that the current practices of the \"big tech oligarchy\" are more dangerous than historical instances of censorship, such as when King George shut down a printing press. He emphasizes that modern censorship is multidimensional, affecting both the speaker and the audience in ways that are not always visible.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe lawsuit filed by Missouri's Attorney General Andrew Bailey against the Biden administration underscores significant concerns about immigration practices and their impacts on state safety and public health. Additionally, Bailey's criticisms of big tech censorship highlight broader issues of free speech and the influence of major tech companies on American culture. As these issues unfold, the demand for transparency and accountability from the federal government and tech giants remains a crucial aspect of the ongoing debate.", "source": {"uri": "theindustry.biz", "dataType": "news", "title": "Radio Facts"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jamahl_davis@theindustry.biz", "name": "Jamahl Davis", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Bailey_(banker)", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Andrew Bailey (banker)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Missouri_Attorney_General", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Missouri Attorney General"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fentanyl", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Fentanyl"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Censorship", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Censorship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illegal_immigration", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Illegal immigration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawsuit", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lawsuit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Missouri", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Missouri"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Missouri"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidency_of_Joe_Biden", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Presidency of Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transparency_(behavior)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Transparency (behavior)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_government_of_the_United_States", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Federal government of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immigration", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Immigration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta_Platforms", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Meta Platforms"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Section_230", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Section 230"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Tech", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Big Tech"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Felony", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Felony"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_trafficking", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Human trafficking"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Google"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Printing_press", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Printing press"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Attorney_General", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Attorney General"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oligarchy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Oligarchy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accountability", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Accountability"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precedent", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Precedent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_of_speech", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Freedom of speech"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservatism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Conservatism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culture_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Culture of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Transportation", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Transportation", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Immigration", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Immigration", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Labor", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Labor", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 58}], "image": "https://www.theindustry.biz/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Screenshot_209.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9796166", "eventUri": "eng-9796166", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.07450980392156858, "wgt": 189, "relevance": 1}

Mike Parson, speaks on Feb. 29, 2024, at the Boone County Republican Lincoln Days dinner in Columbia (Rudi Keller/Missouri Independent).\n\nMissouri Attorney General Andrew Bailey survived a tough primary challenge from a member of former president Donald Trump's legal team on Tuesday to win the GOP nomination for a full term in office.\n\nHis opponent, Will Scharf, conceded the race shortly before 8:30 p.m. with Bailey leading 62% to 37%.\n\nBailey was appointed attorney general by Gov. Mike Parson in November 2022. At the time Bailey was Parson's general counsel and had no experience in elected office.\n\nAn Army veteran and former assistant prosecutor, Bailey has said much of his career has been shaped by his time as an assistant prosecutor and county juvenile office in Missouri.\n\nAmong his most high-profile cases since becoming attorney general include twice suing to block federal student loan forgiveness, and carrying forward a lawsuit alleging the Biden administration was censoring conservatives online by pressuring social media companies.\n\nBailey has also claimed credit for the closure of Washington University Transgender Center at St. Louis Children's Hospital and for driving former St. Louis Circuit Attorney Kim Gardner out of office.\n\nBut he's faced accusations of corruption, incompetence and grandstanding, with his critics alleging he's more interested in scoring appearances on Fox News than effectively running the sprawling office or winning in the courtroom.\n\nBailey recused himself from a gambling lawsuit filed against the Missouri State Highway Patrol after PACs connected to the lobbyist of the companies suing the state wrote checks to the committee supporting Bailey's campaign.\n\nHe was also criticized for accepting $50,000 in campaign donations from Doe Run, a St. Louis-based company being sued by thousands of Peruvians over allegations of lead smelter poisoning in their mining town in the Andes. A few months before the donation, Bailey filed a brief asking the federal court to move the lawsuit out of Missouri.\n\nPACs backing Scharf spent millions attacking Bailey's record. But Bailey benefited from a late endorsement of both candidates by Trump, taking away one of Scharf's most potent campaign messages -- his close ties to the former president.\n\nBailey also enjoyed late support from Parson, who even used his official office to boost Bailey in the campaign's final days.\n\nHe will face Democratic candidate Elad Gross in the November general election. Gross, a former assistant attorney general who runs a St. Louis law firm, has been an outspoken champion of Sunshine law and, like Scharf, a fierce critic of Bailey.", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com",

Eric Schmitt (R-Mo.) won election to Congress the same month. This November, Bailey will run for a full term against Elad Gross.\n\nGross ran unopposed for the Democratic Party's nomination for Missouri attorney general. He was an Assistant Attorney General under former AG Chris Koster.\n\nWith the primary behind him, Bailey will head into November with a big advantage over the Democratic candidate. No Democrat has won a statewide election in Missouri since former State Auditor Nicole Galloway in 2018. The GOP currently controls the state's executive branch and both houses of its legislature.\n\nTuesday night's result ended a bruising, personal campaign that was flooded with attack ads against Bailey and his opponent, Will Scharf, financed by outside organizations allied with either campaign.\n\nScharf, an attorney working with the James Otis Law Group LLC, challenged Bailey for the state executive branch office with the support of national conservative power players. Scharf was endorsed by the influential Club for Growth, and his allied PAC Defend Missouri was financially supported by conservative activist Leonard Leo and Republican megadonor Paul Singer.\n\n\"This race was about taking on a political establishment in this state that I continue to believe is badly broken. I believe that Missourians deserve better government than they have been getting, and everything we have heard in our travels around the state confirms that belief. I am hopeful that our Republican slate of candidates delivers for Missouri conservatives in the years ahead,\" Scharf wrote in his concession post on X.\n\nBailey, who won the endorsement of leading Missouri Republicans including Gov. Mike Parson, Schmitt, and Sen. Josh Hawley (R-Mo.), campaigned on a socially conservative platform highlighting his achievements and legal actions in office.\n\nScharf, who has worked on former President Donald Trump's legal team, ran as \"Trump's attorney\" and criticized Bailey for what he said were mismanaged cases and poor leadership in the office.", "source": {"uri": "theepochtimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "www.theepochtimes.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Missouri_Attorney_General", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Missouri Attorney General"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Missouri", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Missouri"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Missouri"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Bailey_(politician)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Andrew Bailey (politician)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Assistant_Attorney_General", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Assistant Attorney General"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eric_Schmitt", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Eric Schmitt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Koster", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chris Koster"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_(government)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Executive (government)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jefferson_City,_Missouri", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jefferson City, Missouri"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Jefferson City, Missouri"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicole_Galloway", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nicole Galloway"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota_State_Auditor", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota State Auditor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_conservatism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "National conservatism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservatism_in_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Conservatism in the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawyer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lawyer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legislature", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Legislature"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Parson", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mike Parson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Singer_(businessman)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Paul Singer (businessman)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Club_for_Growth", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Club for Growth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_action_committee", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Political action committee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_conservatism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Social conservatism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josh_Hawley", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Josh Hawley"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns_and_Elections", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns and Elections", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Niche/Politics", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Niche/Politics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Gay,_Lesbian,_and_Bisexual/Politics", "label": "dmoz/Society/Gay, Lesbian, and Bisexual/Politics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Democracy", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Democracy", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 87}], "image": "https://img.theepochtimes.com/assets/uploads/2024/07/18/id5689126-AP24177122483350-OP-1080x720.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9796166", "eventUri": "eng-9796166", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Jefferson City, Missouri"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.0980392156862746, "wgt": 184, "relevance": 1}

Biden case, which reached the Supreme Court as Murthy v. Missouri, already indicated that \"government coerced censorship\" has been proven.\n\nIn 2022, then-Missouri Attorney General and now Senator Eric Schmitt, along with his Louisiana counterpart at the time, filed the lawsuit alleging that government agencies' discussions with social media platforms about content moderation suppress free speech. Now, the case has been sent back to a lower court and Bailey suggests using this to fully expose \"that vast Censorship Enterprise.\"\n\n\"What the Supreme Court said was that the government absolutely coerced Big Tech social media into silencing American voices in violation of the First Amendment, but we need more evidence to prove that that censorship extended beyond the year 2021. Guess what? We're going back to the trial court. We're going to find it,\" Bailey said.\n\nBefore the SCOTUS decision, the watchdog Media Research Center found that the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), Department of State, Department of Justice, Department of Defense, Department of Health and Human Services, National Science Foundation and the Department of the Treasury have all pushed for various forms of censorship.\n\n\"There is a shocking degree of breadth and coordination within the Biden administration to use our tax dollars against us. We have never seen this kind of effort to silence regular, everyday Americans,\" MRC Free Speech America Vice President Dan Schneider told Fox News Digital.\n\nSchneider further said that the administration of President Joe Biden's justification for its censorship initiative is astonishing. He added that Biden's lawyers claimed that the federal government has a First Amendment right to censor citizens in court documents and oral arguments before the Supreme Court. \"This inversion of the Constitution threatens the very essence of our democracy,\" he warned.\n\nApart from censorship concerns, the MO-AG is also working on making the Biden administration pay for \"inviting\" illegal immigrants and illegally transferring them to his state.\n\nAccording to Fox News, Bailey is filing a lawsuit against President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris for refusing to turn over documents related to flying illegal immigrants into Missouri.\n\nThe lawsuit also indicated that the DHS has intentionally delayed responding to his request for the documents about the flights to Missouri.\n\n\"We have reason to believe they are deliberately flying illegal aliens from the border into our cities. Not on my watch,\" Bailey wrote on X. He also indicated in the lawsuit that the lack of transparency violates the spirit and the letter of FOIA, which states that an agency shall withhold information only when the agency 'reasonably foresees that disclosure would harm an interest protected by an exemption' or if 'disclosure is prohibited by law.'\"\n\nThe AG pointed out that the transportation of asylum seekers into his state is a matter of public concern. The citizens of Missouri have a right to know the facts about these alleged activities, he added. He also said in the suit that DHS did not provide any notice that its response and/or production of documents would be delayed due to \"unusual circumstances.\" The agency also failed to inform his office of the timeline for when the responsive records will be produced.\n\n\"Once again, the Biden Administration is trying to stonewall and circumvent every aspect of the law to hide information from Americans,\" Bailey alleged. \"Their most recent refusal to provide the truth about the flying of illegal immigrants into Missouri is just the tip of the iceberg.\" (Related: Bailey, 6 other AGs sue Biden's HHS for forcing healthcare providers to perform genital mutilations.)\n\nBigGovernment.news has more stories about the government's tough censorship yet \"weak\" illegal immigration policies.\n\nWatch the video below that talks about Big Tech censoring content about former Donald Trump's assassination.\n\nMissouri AG files lawsuit against State of New York over outrageous, lawless prosecution of Donald J.

Bailey beat Will Scharf in a Republican primary for state attorney general on Tuesday.\n\nFormer President Donald Trump had endorsed both Bailey and Scharf on Truth Social.\n\nBailey was first appointed to the attorney general position by Missouri Gov. Mike Parsons (R) in January 2023. Since then, he has launched investigations against a children's hospital, gym and retailer that provide services or a safe and affirming space for transgender Missourians.\n\nOne of the first actions Bailey took as attorney general was to attempt to investigate the Washington University Pediatric Transgender Center at St. Louis Children's Hospital after a former caseworker, Jamie Reed, accused the center of malpractice. Bailey gave Reed whistleblower protection and began asking the hospital for patient medical records; later, he also asked for information on therapists and social workers across the state who worked with trans youth. A Missouri judge eventually found that Bailey's office had no right to private medical information.\n\nLast year, Bailey also signed an emergency rule that created a burdensome set of requirements for trans people of all ages seeking gender-affirming care. He withdrew the emergency order only when the Republican-led legislature passed its own ban on gender-affirming care for minors, Medicaid recipients and incarcerated people.\n\nKaty Erker-Lynch, the executive director of PROMO, a Missouri LGBTQ advocacy group, said Bailey's actions have \"created a hostile environment for medical providers where they are afraid to stay and practice medicine.\"\n\nAnd just days before the state's primary election, Bailey sent out a stark warning to a St. Louis gym that had come under scrutiny from conservatives for allowing a transgender woman to use the women's locker room.\n\n\"While it might be considered fashionable in certain corporate boardrooms to pretend that biology is irrelevant, the American heartland still lives in reality,\" Bailey wrote in a statement to the company's CEO.\n\nAcross the country, GOP state attorneys general have increasingly tried to use their power to make life more challenging for transgender people. Like Bailey, many have tried to use their consumer protection powers to obtain private medical information. A U.S. Senate Finance Committee report said that such officials were \"weaponizing their oversight authorities for their own political gain, at the expense of LGBTQIA+ people and their families.\"\n\nBailey was also one of 22 Republican attorneys general to sue the Biden administration over its new Title IX rules, which expand protections more explicitly for LGBTQ+ students in federally funded schools.\n\nIf Bailey wins in November, he will no doubt be able to continue his anti-trans crusade -- along with his efforts to stomp out diversity programs and keep innocent people incarcerated -- in the deep-red state.\n\nBailey will face Democrat Elad Gross in November. Gross has heavily criticized Bailey and other Republicans for how much their anti-transgender policies distract from issues that are important to everyday Missourians and has proposed launching a civil rights division that focuses on protecting LGBTQ+ residents against discrimination.", "source": {"uri": "huffpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "HuffPost"}, "authors": [], "concepts":

'Your dedication and passion have been the driving force behind this incredible triumph. Together, we WILL keep Missouri strong, safe, and free.'\n\nScharf, meanwhile, conceded and endorsed Bailey.\n\n'Tonight we came up short. We always knew that challenging an incumbent and the Jefferson City establishment would be difficult, and despite the tremendous grassroots energy around our campaign Andrew Bailey has certainly earned a full term in office. He has my unqualified support in the general election, and I hope that he will do Missouri proud in the coming years.'\n\nBoth of Missouri's senators, Josh Hawley and Eric Schmitt, congratulated Bailey on his win.\n\nIn the governor's race, Donald Trump has endorsed three of the nine candidates who are in the running: Secretary of State Jay Ashcroft, Lt. Gov. Mike Kehoe and state Sen. Bill Eigel. Republican Gov. Mike Parson is term-limited and cannot seek reelection. That race has not yet been called.\n\nDespite almost no daylight policy-wise between Scharf and Bailey, the race has become so intense that it is now one of the most expensive down-ballot races in the country at nearly $20 million.\n\nAttorney General Andrew Bailey is defending his seat\n\nTrump attorney Will Scharf launched a primary challenge to Bailey for Missouri AG\n\n'These two men are truly outstanding in every way, shape, and form,' Trump wrote in his Truth Social endorsemenr. 'I am honored to give both Andrew Bailey and Will Scharf my Complete and Total Endorsement - NEITHER ONE WILL EVER LET YOU DOWN!'\n\nBailey's record on crime is in the spotlight in a new ad and mailers being funded by a political action committee supporting Scharf.\n\nIt blames Bailey for the death of police officer Mason Griffith, who was shot and killed in the line of duty in March 2023 at age 34.\n\nNow, the widow of the slain cop is demanding that her late husband be left out of the contentious campaign as she raises two young sons.\n\nJennifer Griffith says the ads have sent her family spiraling once again and is demanding they cease.\n\n'They're hitting this pretty hard,' Griffith told DailyMail.com, adding that she's received three mail ads, countless phone calls, surveys and text messages with videos exploiting her husband's death.\n\n'I have to explain to my son every time he sees a commercial on TV why Kenneth Simpson's face is on TV,' she added, referring to her husband's alleged killer.\n\nAlleged cop killer Kenneth Simpson had a long history of run-ins with the police beginning in 2004. He spent the next decade in and out or prison, according to court records.\n\nThe ad primarily hits Bailey for his time as assistant prosecutor in Warren County in 2017 when he handled multiple cases involving Simpson.\n\nSimpson was arrested, charged and released on bond multiple times in the fall of 2017 for allegedly punching his father in the face and possessing brass knuckles, two misdemeanors.\n\nRead More Cause of death for Missouri girl, 8, who died mid-flight while on vacation with her family is revealed\n\nHe ended up spending 10 days in jail for unlawful possession of drug paraphernalia under Bailey's prosecution. A judge sentenced him to another six months for unlawful possession of a weapon.\n\nThe pro-Scharf PAC's attack ads and mailers go on the offense against Bailey, saying Simpson's short sentences allowed him to commit more crimes.\n\n'As a prosecutor, Bailey went easy on a violent career felon who once shot up a cop car,' the contentious ad states.\n\n'Bailey knew that, and yet charged him with mere misdemeanors after he struck again, out within months,' the ad went on.\n\nAt the time of the shooting, Simpson had been out on bail for crimes that were being prosecuted after Bailey had left the prosecutor's office.\n\nThe widow of a slain cop in Missouri is demanding those backing Trump attorney Will Scharf, who is running for attorney general, stop throwing her late husband into the middle of his campaign\n\nKelly King, Bailey's successor in the Warren County prosecutor's office, claimed she had asked a judge to revoke Simpson's bail but was denied.\n\nAfter his arrest for shooting Griffith, Simpson told police he was on the run for several warrants.He told them he believed he was going to die and decided to commit 'suicide by cop.'\n\nHe is accused of killing police officer Mason Griffith and wounding officer Adam Sullentrup.\n\nPolice said Simpson had six felony warrants out of Warren County and one misdemeanor warrant from Franklin County.\n\nBailey's team is accusing the pro-Scharf PAC of 'exploiting' the tragedy during the campaign.\n\nScharf, as a candidate, is prohibited from coordinating with PACs like Defend Missouri on messaging or strategy.",

Eric Greitens' policy director and currently works as a lawyer for former President Donald Trump.\n\nScharf criticized Bailey's tenure as attorney general as one filled with legal fights that ended in losses for the Republican party.\n\nOriginally appointed by Gov. Mike Parson in 2022 after Eric Schmitt's election to the U.S. Senate, the primary was Bailey's first attempt at a full term.\n\nBailey previously served as the former assistant prosecuting attorney in Warren County and as assistant attorney general under Schmitt. He received endorsements from Parson, Schmitt and U.S. Sen. Josh Hawley.\n\nFrom early in his tenure, Bailey made headlines filing lawsuits on national issues on behalf of the state, following in the footsteps of his predecessor. He also attempted to enact rules prohibiting providers from offering gender-affirming treatment to transgender people.\n\nMore recently, Bailey worked to halt the release of Christopher Dunn, a man whose murder conviction was overturned. Dunn was released July 30 after Missouri's Supreme Court lifted an emergency order it issued last week that paused his release.\n\nIt is the second time in recent months Bailey blocked the release of an individual whose murder conviction had been overturned by a judge citing evidence that proved \"actual innocence.\"\n\nWhile Bailey and Scharf's views on policy are generally similar, Bailey had criticized Scharf as a servant of special interests in Washington, D.C.\n\n\"This is home for me, this is where I'm raising my kids, where he showed up here with a bag full of money in order to buy a political office,\" Bailey said.\n\nBailey will face St. Louis-based attorney Elad Gross, who ran unopposed in the Democratic primary for attorney general, and Libertarian nominee Ryan Munro.\n\nThe November general election will mark Bailey's first for office.", "source": {"uri": "kcur.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "KCUR 89.3 - NPR in Kansas City.

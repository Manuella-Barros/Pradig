In reference to the claim, Alex Deane said he was quoting the late Conservative diarist Alan Clark\u2019s remark: \u201chow do I know my advances are unwanted until I\u2019ve made them?\u201d It came after a female journalist accused the then PM Johnson of groping her leg under the table 20 years earlier. Charlotte Edwardes claimed Johnson, then Spectator magazine editor, grabbed \u201cenough inner flesh beneath his fingers\u201d to make her \u201csit suddenly upright\u201d at a 1999 lunch. But Deane, standing for the Tories in Finchley and Golders Green in London at the election, played down the allegation \u2013 denied by Number 10 \u2013 after it emerged in 2019. In a Sky News discussion with broadcaster Ayesha Hazarika about the allegation in 2019, he said: \u201c...You\u2019re talking about it as if it\u2019s true.\u201d Hazarika replied: \u201cI think it is true, I believe her. I believe the victim here, I do believe the victim.\u201d Deane responded: \u201cThat\u2019s remarkable. So you don\u2019t believe any more in the presumption of innocence, you don\u2019t believe that people get anything more than a trial by media, and someone like you, who won\u2019t even look at me, saying that someone\u2019s definitely guilty.\u201d Sky News\u2019 Kay Burley said: \u201cHe does have previous though.\u201d But Deane shot back: \u201cHang on\u2026 the late Alan Clark said, \u2018how do I know my advances are unwanted until I\u2019ve made them?\u2019\u201d In a twist, Deane\u2019s Wikipedia page was edited from London to remove reference to the Clark comment \u2013 on the day his seat selection was announced. A section which detailed how Deane quoted Clark in relation to the allegation was removed on 19 March. On the same day, Finchley and Golders Green Tories announced his selection , saying: \u201cAlex Deane brings a wealth of experience to this role. His commitment to representing the interests of all residents, coupled with his passion for positive change, makes him an excellent choice to lead Finchley and Golders Green into the future.\u201d The Tories held the seat in 2019 with a 6,562 majority. The seat of Finchley was previously represented by ex-PM Thatcher. Jonathan Ashworth, Labour's Shadow Paymaster General, said: \"Alex Deane's conduct raises serious questions about his suitability for public office, yet the Conservatives have been happy to select him as their candidate. Having promised to lead a government of integrity, there are now serious concerns about the calibre of Rishi Sunak \u2019s would-be MPs.\u201d In 1997, the late Simon Hoggart reported: \u201c... sexual misbehaviour, especially if it's undesired, can be fatal for a politician. So it was with mixed horror and fascination recently when one of the many foreign journalists' clubs in London met Alan Clark, the most politically incorrect politician in Britain. One of them asked how he justified making `unsolicited and unwanted advances to women'. Clark curled his lips and with a fine contempt demanded `how on earth do you know an advance is unwanted until after you've made it?'.\u201d Deane, who holds a senior post at a consulting firm, has appeared as a politics pundit on TV and previously been David Cameron \u2019s chief of staff. Deane told us: \u201cI was defending the then-Prime Minister against an historic allegation which has, to my knowledge, never been taken further \u2013 my repeated point was that everyone is entitled to the presumption of innocence, which was not being extended to Boris Johnson. The Alan Clark quote was a foolish mistake made after the repeated refusal by the other participants to acknowledge that point.\u201d Asked whether he, anyone associated with him, or anyone in the Conservative party edited his Wikipedia to remove the reference to his use of the Alan Clark quote, he said: \u201cNot to my knowledge. I certainly didn\u2019t.\u201d A Conservative Party spokesman said: \u201cThe Conservative Party does not condone these comments. Mr. Deane rightfully apologised for his remarks at the time.\u201d", "summary": "In reference to a female journalist\u2019s claim against the then PM, Alex Deane said he was quoting late Tory diarist Alan Clark\u2019s remark: \u2018how do I know my advances are unwanted until I\u2019ve made them?\u2019", "url": "https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/politics/tory-candidate-margaret-thatchers-old-32988285", "image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article32989145.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/2_EXCLUSIVE-MAIN-Recovered.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-08 15:00:01", "author": "Simon Murphy,Simon-Murphy", "authors": ["Simon Murphy", "Simon-Murphy"], "language": "en", "source_country": "GB", "sentiment": -0.09}

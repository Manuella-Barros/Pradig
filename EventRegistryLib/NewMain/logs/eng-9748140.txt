I know the guys last year got 45 to 55 reps in terms of those guys. We're looking right in that range. We'll see, but again, it's always week to week because you have to see what the health of your line is and where everybody is. But certainly, all those exposures are equally as valuable.\"\n\nEberflus quickly noted that the reps Williams will get in practice against the Bears' first-string defense will be equally, if not more, valuable than those he will get against vanilla defenses in the preseason.\n\n\"We'll take that week to week,\" Eberflus said of the preseason plan for Williams. \"But there's value in all the reps when you think about it because he's going to be going against the [No.] 1 defense. In preseason games you don't get all the looks sometimes that you would get during practice. So I think there's equal value to going against the ones every single day and also getting some of those preseason reps as well.\"\n\nDuring the spring, Eberflus mentioned the Bears staff looked at how many preseason reps rookie quarterbacks got last year to try and determine the appropriate number to prepare Williams for Week 1. However, the Bears also must be careful not to overexpose Williams in games that don't matter.\n\n\"There's definitely that,\" Eberflus said in June. \"You look at last year's reps. [C.J. Stroud], [Bryce Young], [Anthony Richardson], they all got between 45 and 65 reps in the preseason. So you look at those things and you look at the past and we'll be looking a little deeper than that and go back a few years. So you're always looking at that and gathering the data. And like I said, we'll always do what's best for the Bears.\"\n\nWilliams knows the preseason will serve its purpose. But for now, his focus is on the daily battles with the Bears' ascending defense that will begin Saturday.\n\n\"I think any reps are obviously valuable,\" Williams said Friday about his preseason desires. \"But we do have the understanding that, you know, it's preseason, and things are going to be a little different play-wise, offensively and defensively. So practice here is just as valuable as those moments. So, making sure I'm not looking forward to preseason and those preseason games, and I'm focused on playing against the Chicago Bears defense right now, and when those moments come, take those moments as just as valuable as practice.\"\n\nThe Bears will face the Houston Texans in the Hall of Fame Game on Aug. 1 in Canton, Ohio.

But what about the top player in the draft? How much do the Bears rest quarterback Caleb Williams?\n\nYou want to get him good reps. Yet do you risk injury with the new face of the franchise? Bears coach Matt Eberflus says he has yet to figure out the right mix of reps and rest. He still has some time to figure it out. Chicago and Houston kick off the preseason slate on Aug. 1.\n\nBecause of the early preseason game, the Bears started training camp, Thursday. That also introduced an interesting conundrum. How many snaps do you give Williams in training camp? NFL teams also don't stress their vets in late July and August. Williams isn't even veteran adjacent, but he is an ultra important player on the roster. The Bears coach said his new quarterback will receive \"significant\" practice time.\n\n\"We talked about that in the spring a little bit, about looking back at what some other guys have done in the past,\" Eberflus told reporters on Friday. \"And yeah, we certainly want to do that. We'll take that week-to-week. But there's value in, really, all the reps when you think about it because he's going to be going against the [No.] 1 defense.

Tyson Bagent is still with Chicago. He was an undrafted rookie last season, but started four games in relief of an injured Justin Fields. The Bears also signed veteran Brett Rypien as a free agent. And they picked up undrafted rookie Austin Reed, the former Western Kentucky star.\n\nAfter the Bears meet the Texans in the Pro Football Hall of Fame game, they'll meet the Bills (Aug. 10,) the Bengals (Aug. 17), then finish with the Chiefs (Aug. 22).\n\nThose games all represent chances for Williams to better learn the offense during live competition. However, how much do you risk playing Williams against opposing defenses stacked with younger players on the field. Eberflus does have a number in mind.\n\n\"We haven't made any decisions, but certainly want to get him some reps,\" Eberflus said. \"I know the guys last year got 45 to 55 reps, in terms of those guys.

Chicago chose not to pair the rookie with a veteran QB due to the belief that Williams was capable of starting from the moment they drafted him in April.\n\n\"It's just believing in Caleb. Putting him in there and let's go,\" Eberflus said.\n\nStill, despite the high expectations, Williams remains realistic about how he expects some days to play out at training camp and how he'll keep things in perspective.\n\n\"I've had rough days,\" Williams said. \"I expect myself to go out there. I think I'm the toughest on myself. I go out there and I'll mess up a play. I've thrown a pick in minicamp and things like that. Being tough on myself but also having an understatement of where we are and where I am. The progression like I said before is key. Those bad times it's not a time to have self doubt. That's just a waste of time. It's a time to keep growing, keep progressing and keep believing in yourself.\"\n\nOn a day where expectations were laid forth by Chicago's brass and players looking to take the next step after a 7-10 finish last season, general manager Ryan Poles' expressed a big-picture goal for the rookie quarterback that relies on the involvement of others.\n\n\"It's really just to maximize his ability,\" Poles said. \"I think I want to see just leaning on the talent around him as well. I think it's got to be comforting to know you don't have to do everything on your own, which makes it a pretty good situation for a young quarterback.\n\n\"There's going to be adversity and I just want to see him lean on all of us to get through those moments and then when you're clicking and in the zone that those high moments are high and we just continue to learn and continue to get better every single week and every single day.\"", "source": {"uri": "espn.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ESPN.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Quarterback"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Bears", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Chicago Bears"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bryce_Young", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bryce Young"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matt_Eberflus", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Matt Eberflus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Houston_Texans", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Houston Texans"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draft_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Draft (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pro_Football_Hall_of_Fame", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pro Football Hall of Fame"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rookie", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rookie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canton,_Ohio", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Canton, Ohio"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Canton, Ohio"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lake_Forest,_Illinois", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lake Forest, Illinois"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Lake Forest, Illinois"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soldier_Field", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Soldier Field"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cincinnati_Bengals", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cincinnati Bengals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryan_Poles", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ryan Poles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_manager", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "General manager"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Interactive", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Interactive", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Kissing", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Kissing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 88}], "image": "https://a3.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2024%2F0604%2Fr1341763_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9748140", "eventUri": "eng-9748140", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Lake Forest, Illinois"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-01", "textStart": 333, "textEnd": 339}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-15", "textStart": 1227, "textEnd": 1234}], "sentiment": 0.05882352941176472, "wgt": 226, "relevance": 1}

Bears Head Coach Reveals the Latest", "body": "The Chicago Bears are entering the 2024 season with as much hype as any team in the NFL. After drafting star quarterback Caleb Williams out of USC with the No. 1 pick in the 2024 NFL Draft, Chicago finally has the feeling of a true contender just waiting to burst. Chicago has been looking for a true franchise-level quarterback for years and Williams finally fits the mold. He can make every throw on the field and has the star power to drive the team forward for years.\n\nMore news: Caleb Williams, Chicago Bears Finally Agree to Fully-Guaranteed Rookie Contract\n\nNormally, rookies get their first taste of action in the preseason -- but in recent years, we have seen some be held out to avoid injury. With Williams, the Bears will want to be cautious before the start of the new season. Bears head coach Matt Eberflus spoke about his decision on whether Williams will play during the preseason.\n\n\"We haven't made any decisions, but certainly want to get him some reps,\" Eberflus said. \"I know the guys last year got 45 to 55 reps, in terms of those guys. And we're looking at that right in that range -- we'll see. But, again, it's always week to week because you have to see what the health of your line is and where everybody is. But, certainly, all those exposures are equally as valuable.\"\n\nGiving Williams snaps in the preseason can help him prepare for what is to come during the real games. While he won't always be playing against the main opposing defensive players, he will see real-time action against NFL-caliber players. Preseason snaps can be invaluable for a rookie, especially when there is so much pressure on Williams to find success early on this season.\n\n\"We talked about that in the spring a little bit, about looking back at what some other guys have done in the past. And yeah, we certainly want to do that,\" Eberflus said. \"We'll take that week-to-week. But there's value in, really, all the reps when you think about it because he's going to be going against the [No.] 1 defense. In preseason games, you don't get all the looks, sometimes, that you would get during practice.\"\n\nWilliams shined while in college, winning the Heisman trophy in 2022 with the Trojans. He entered the NFL Draft as one of the more hyped-up prospects in years and has been the center of attention all offseason. The Bears are hopeful that he can be the guy to turn things around for them and they have wasted no time in building a solid team around him.\n\nChicago traded for star veteran wide receiver Keenan Allen this offseason to pair him alongside D.J. Moore, giving Williams a dominant duo at the wide receiver position. The Bears also drafted rookie receiver Rome Odunze with the No. 9 pick in the draft, adding more talent to the offensive skill players on the Bears depth chart. Chicago is set up well to have success as early as Williams' first season -- but now it'll be up to him to show he belongs in the league.", "source": {"uri": "newsweek.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Newsweek"}, "authors": [{"uri": "matt_levine@newsweek.com", "name": "Matt Levine", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caleb_Williams", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Caleb Williams"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Bears", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Chicago Bears"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Quarterback"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USC_Trojans_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "USC Trojans football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rookie", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rookie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matt_Eberflus", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Matt Eberflus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_coach", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Head coach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/D._J._Moore_(cornerback)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "D.

Neither of their top draft picks - Caleb Williams and Rome Odunze - signed their rookie contracts ahead of Tuesday's report day.\n\nOdunze's agreement came down that day, and ESPN's Adam Schefter reported Williams' deal shortly thereafter. However, the Bears only announced Odunze's contract that day. Although the sense was Williams would also sign his deal, rumors swirled about the potential hang-ups before Wednesday's announcement.\n\nAccording to general manager Ryan Poles, the negotiations were just that. As far as where things ended up after Williams ultimately signed, it wasn't anything crazy.\n\n\"I'm not going to get into the negotiation and what's asked/what's not asked. Just for general knowledge, it's very common for different things to be asked for in the very beginnings of negotiations,\" Poles said, via NBC Sports Chicago's Josh Schrock. \"So it wasn't anything shocking in terms of what was being asked for or anything like that. But at the end of the day I'm glad it worked out and pretty kind of standard.\"\n\nWilliams' rookie deal is for four years and $39 million, and it also includes a $25.5 million signing bonus. He will also have a fifth-year option, which Pro Football Talk's Mike Florio reported was among the issues in negotiations. Williams - who doesn't have an agent - also reportedly asked to be paid as an LLC.\n\nThe former USC star, of course, signed on the dotted line just in time for training camp to begin. Rookies officially reported earlier this week and the rest of the team made its way to Halas Hall on Friday as a new era begins on Chicago's lakefront.\n\nWith the contract talks in the past, Williams and the Bears can focus on getting ready for the season. Chicago's first open practice will be on Saturday in Lake Forest and the first preseason game will be Aug. 1 in the Hall of Fame Game. As for how much Williams will play in the preseason, Bears head coach Matt Eberflus said the goal will be too get him reps in those games.\n\n\"We talked about that in the spring a little bit, about looking back at what some other guys have done in the past,\" Eberflus told reporters on Friday. \"And yeah, we certainly want to do that.

Discovery's TNT Sports even if the company doesn't emerge with NBA media rights.\n\n\"I'm looking forward to continuing to work with [TNT Sports] both on the shows we currently have and new ones we develop together in the future,\" Barkley said in a statement. \"This is the only place for me. I have to say ... I've been impressed by the leadership team who is fighting hard and have been aggressive in adding new properties to TNT Sports, which I am very excited about. I appreciate them and all of my colleagues for their continued support, and most importantly our fans. I'm going to give my all as we keep them entertained for years to come.\"\n\nBarkley's future has become hazy given the NBA's potential move away from TNT after next season.\n\nWarner Bros. Discovery sued the NBA last month to forcibly invoke the company's matching rights on a package of games earmarked to go to Amazon Prime Video as part of the league's new media rights deal. The NBA rejected Warner Bros.'s match as invalid because the league claimed Amazon's games are for a streaming-only service. While Warner Bros. would stream the games on Max, it would also air them on TNT.\n\nTNT Sports owns the media rights to a number of different sports, including Major League Baseball, the NCAA Men's Basketball Championship, the National Hockey League and the United States Soccer Federation. Beginning next year, the company will add NASCAR, The French Open, and more than 65 regular season Big East basketball games.\n\nWarner Bros. Discovery will be the home of some college football playoff games beginning this year. Barkley will play a role in the coverage of some of the events.\n\n\"It's fantastic to have Charles for this journey as we develop new content ideas and shows for our fans,\" TNT Sports Chairman and CEO Luis Silberwasser said in the statement.\n\nBarkley is one of the stars of the popular NBA studio show \"Inside the NBA,\" which debuted after TNT acquired NBA rights during the 1989-90 season. He said in June he planned to retire after next season as a broadcaster. Barkley signed a 10-year deal with TNT Sports in 2022.\n\n\"I ain't going nowhere other than TNT,\" Barkley said on June 14. \"But I have made the decision myself that, no matter what happens, next year is going to be my last year on television.\"\n\nBarkley seemed to waver on his decision to retire during a recent appearance on The Dan Patrick Show in late July.\n\n\"Everything is on the table,\" Barkley said of his future job opportunities.\n\nBarkley has a long-term contract with TNT. In May, Barkley said he had an opt-out clause in the contract in case TNT lost NBA rights. That's incorrect, according to a person with knowledge of the matter. Barkley has a long-term deal with TNT to which he's reaffirming his commitment, said the person. Barkley said last month his deal is worth $210 million over 10 years.\n\nBarkley's commitment to TNT Sports likely closes the door on recreating \"Inside the NBA\" for another network if Warner Bros. Discovery doesn't emerge with a package of games as an outcome of its NBA lawsuit.", "source": {"uri": "nbcnewyork.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NBC New York"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warner_Bros._Discovery_Sports", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Warner Bros.

Discovery, said in a statement Tuesday that \"TNT Sports and Charles Barkley today reaffirmed his long-term commitment that will see the broadcasting icon and Naismith Basketball Hall of Famer exclusively contribute to TNT Sports for many years to come.\"\n\nBarkley is a basketball Hall of Famer who has become a mainstay the last 24 years as an analyst on TNT's popular studio show, \"Inside the NBA,\" alongside Ernie Johnson, Kenny Smith and Shaquille O'Neal. Last month, the NBA snubbed TNT in its new media rights deal, which starts with the 2025-26 season.\n\nWarner Bros. Discovery has challenged that decision with a lawsuit filed in New York Supreme Court.\n\nEarlier this year, Barkley had criticized the way his employers were handling their negotiations with the NBA. In June, he announced his intention to retire from TV after next basketball season, even if TNT managed to keep broadcast rights to the NBA.\n\nAfter the league awarded those rights to ESPN, NBC and Amazon, Barkley stated on the \"Dan Patrick Show\" that he was still leaning toward retirement next year but had been listening to offers from the other networks.\n\nOn Tuesday, though, Barkley said in a statement that he plans to remain on the network \"for years to come.\"\n\n\"I love my TNT Sports family.

The NBA Hall of Famer and television analyst reaffirmed his commitment to fulfilling his 10-year contract with TNT Sports on Tuesday after he previously stated that he would retire following the conclusion of the 2024-25 season. The upcoming NBA season will be the final season TNT has television rights to air games, following a new media rights package that has the NBA partnering with NBC and Amazon in addition to ESPN.\n\n\"I love my TNT Sports family,\" Barkley said in a statement. \"My #1 priority has been and always will be our people and keeping everyone together for as long as possible. We have the most amazing people, and they are the best at what they do. I'm looking forward to continuing to work with them both on the shows we currently have and new ones we develop together in the future. This is the only place for me.\n\n\"I have to say ... I've been impressed by the leadership team who is fighting hard and have been aggressive in adding new properties to TNT Sports, which I am very excited about. I appreciate them and all of my colleagues for their continued support, and most importantly our fans. I'm going to give my all as we keep them entertained for years to come.\"\n\nPrior to the NBA making the new media rights package official, there were rumors for months that TNT would lose its package to another suitor. Amidst those rumors, Barkley was very vocal about not wanting to lose the NBA rights, as he's been a member of TNT's Inside the NBA for more than two decades. Back in June, Barkley said that regardless of what happens with the media rights, he would retire at the end of the 2024-25 season.\n\n\"I have made the decision myself, no matter what happens, next year is gonna be my last year on television,\" Barkley said. \"And I just want to say thank you to my NBA family. You guys have been great to me, my heart is full with joy and gratitude. But I'm gonna pass the baton at the end of next year.\"\n\nBarkley said that he was talking with other networks to possibly go elsewhere if TNT lost its NBA rights, but instead said that would retire after what would be his 25th year with the network. However, that sentiment has now changed for Barkley, who has been one of the most recognized voices covering the NBA for quite some time.\n\nBarkley's brutally honest commentating style and his camaraderie with Shaquille O'Neal have created one of the most entertaining sports broadcasting shows today. The entire cast of Inside the NBA has been inducted into the Basketball Hall of Fame, and Barkley himself has also been inducted into the Sports Broadcasting Hall of Fame.\n\nWhile this may be the final season of NBA games being aired on TNT, it won't be the last for Barkley on television. He'll be entering Year 3 of his contract with TNT Sports, so looking ahead beyond the 2024-25 season, it will be interesting to see what the network's plan is for Barkley and the rest of the Inside the NBA crew now that basketball will no longer be on the network.", "source": {"uri": "cbssports.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CBS Sports"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jasmyn_wimbish@cbssports.com", "name": "Jasmyn Wimbish", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warner_Bros._Discovery_Sports", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Warner Bros.

And TNT Sports is Charles Barkley.\n\nThat axiom was reinforced Tuesday as Sir Charles issued a statement declaring he's changed his mind about retiring from TV -- and plans to remain with his work \"family\" at TNT.\n\n\"I love my TNT Sports family. My #1 priority has been and always will be our people and keeping everyone together for as long as possible. We have the most amazing people, and they are the best at what they do. I'm looking forward to continuing to work with them both on the shows we currently have -- and new ones we develop together in the future. This is the only place for me,\" said the five-time Emmy winner in a statement. \"I have to say ... I've been impressed by the leadership team who is fighting hard and have been aggressive in adding new properties to TNT Sports, which I am very excited about. ... I'm going to give my all as we keep them entertained for years to come.\"\n\nLuis Silberwasser, chairman and CEO of TNT Sports, said in a statement: \"Charles is one of the best and most beloved sportscasters in the history of television. I know I speak for all the members of the TNT Sports family when I say we are incredibly thrilled to share this mutual commitment to continue showcasing Charles's one-of-a-kind talents and entertain fans well into the future.\"\n\nBarkley signed a 10-year, $210 million contract extension with TNT in 2022. In June, Barkley announced that his 25th season with TNT's Inside the NBA for the 2024-2025 season would be his last. But that threat always appeared to be a last-ditch Hail Mary by Barkley to try to help his longtime colleagues at TNT hang on to their jobs.\n\nIt remains to be seen whether TNT's legal challenge to retain its 40-year relationship with the NBA will succeed. Even if it doesn't, TNT wants Barkley to chip in across its sports programming lineup, whether it's March Madness, college basketball and football, the NHL, and made-for-TV golf events such as \"The Match.\"\n\nIn media appearances this summer, Barkley confirmed ESPN, NBC Sports, and Amazon Prime Video reached out to him about possibly jumping ship. But for now, Barkley's loyalty to his TNT family has won out.\n\nCould he change his mind? Of course. Barkley has the contractual right to opt out whenever TNT loses NBA rights, which would be after this coming NBA season if it fails in court. The statements from Barkley and TNT said nothing about his long-term future, although Barkley's statement did refer to \"years,\" plural, to come. But Barkley is an unpredictable force of nature who ripped his bosses at Warner Bros. Discovery as \"clowns\" and \"fools\" for bungling the NBA rights negotiation. More recently, he turned his guns on NBA owners for choosing Amazon's \"money\" over the TV needs of fans.\n\n\"Clearly, the NBA has wanted to break up with us from the beginning,\" he said. \"I'm not sure TNT ever had a chance. TNT matched the money, but the league knows Amazon and these tech companies are the only ones willing to pay for the rights when they double in the future. The NBA didn't want to piss them off. It's a sad day when owners and commissioners choose money over the fans. It just sucks.\"\n\nBarkley's a one-of-a-kind talent. His statement of loyalty is the best news to hit TNT in a long time. If he chose to become a free agent, Barkley could command $25 million to $30 million on the open market. But for now, he's staying with TNT. I can't wait to watch a totally unplugged Sir Charles chop it up with Shaquille O'Neal, Kenny Smith, and Ernie Johnson this coming season.", "source": {"uri": "frontofficesports.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Front Office Sports"}, "authors": [{"uri": "michael_mccarthy@frontofficesports.com", "name": "Michael McCarthy", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "alex_schiffer@frontofficesports.com", "name": "Alex Schiffer", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "margaret_fleming@frontofficesports.com", "name": "Margaret Fleming", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warner_Bros._Discovery_Sports", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Warner Bros.

What will he do at TNT Sports without the NBA?", "body": "Charles Barkley said he's retiring from TV. He has spent the last 24 years working for TNT, which could lose its NBA rights after next season.\n\nWhen Charles Barkley announced his retirement from television in June during the NBA Finals -- not the first time he'd threatened to walk away from his lucrative post-playing career -- some experts thought that this time, he really meant it.\n\n\"Barkley has made noises about leaving TV before and then signed on for more, like the short-lived 'King Charles,' a talk show in which he teamed with Gayle King on CNN for six months,\" one wrote. \"But he sounded pretty serious Friday night, and has bemoaned the ongoing negotiations between the league and the network and the toll it takes on network employees who wait in limbo for a decision.\"\n\nMe, not him. Far from it -- Barkley is a self-promotional genius, and he was outspoken about his worry that TNT Sports, home of \"Inside the NBA,\" the best sports studio of any kind, would lose NBA broadcast rights in the new league contract. (Barkley is the show's major draw.) Threats like this could have been a bargaining chip or just Barkley being Barkley, saying whatever popped into his head. That's a big part of his charm.\n\nWhatever the case, the ploy didn't work, as TNT Sports did lose the rights (though they're suing to regain them).\n\nAnd neither did the retirement. Warner Bros. Discovery, which owns TNT Sports, and Barkley announced Tuesday, Aug. 6 that Barkley will stay with the network \"for many years to come.\" And why not? The Athletic reported that Barkley is in the third year of a 10-year, $210 million contract.\n\n\"I love my TNT Sports family,\" Barkley, a former Phoenix Sun, said in a statement. \"My #1 priority has been and always will be our people and keeping everyone together for as long as possible. We have the most amazing people, and they are the best at what they do. I'm looking forward to continuing to work with them both on the shows we currently have and new ones we develop together in the future. This is the only place for me.\"\n\nI'm starting to believe you can't always trust what Barkley says. Fool me once, shame on you, as they say. Fool me twice, shame on me. Fool me, I don't know, 127 times and at some point you just have to chalk it up to whimsy.\n\n'Inside the NBA' has no home after this season\n\nESPN, Amazon Prime Video and NBC successfully negotiated with the NBA to carry the games after the upcoming season -- an 11-year, $76 billion deal. TNT Sports is suing the league to try to keep at least some broadcast rights. Most experts (real experts this time) believe the suit will be unsuccessful. What Barkley's role would be at a TNT Sports with no NBA is anyone's guess.\n\n\"We continue to add to the breadth and depth of our sports portfolio -- including new properties in the College Football Playoffs, Roland-Garros (the French Open), NASCAR, Big East college basketball, Mountain West football, among others -- and it's fantastic to have Charles for this journey as we develop new content ideas and shows for our fans,\" Luis Silberwasser, the chairman and CEO of TNT Sports, said in a statement.\n\nBarkley commenting on a tennis match is intriguing, in the way watching Snoop Dogg swim with Michael Phelps at the Summer Olympics is. But you have to wonder about the long-term appeal.\n\nWho knows how it'll play out? But one thing is certain, if you want to know the truth about Barkley's next move, don't ask him.", "source": {"uri": "azcentral.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "AZ Central"}, "authors": [{"uri": "arizona_republic@azcentral.com", "name": "Arizona Republic", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warner_Bros._Discovery_Sports", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Warner Bros.

I appreciate them and all of my colleagues for their continued support, and most importantly our fans. I'm going to give my all as we keep them entertained for years to come.\"\n\nBarkley's future has become hazy given the NBA's potential move away from TNT after next season.\n\nWarner Bros. Discovery sued the NBA last month to forcibly invoke the company's matching rights on a package of games earmarked to go to Amazon Prime Video as part of the league's new media rights deal. The NBA rejected Warner Bros.'s match as invalid because the league claimed Amazon's games are for a streaming-only service. While Warner Bros. would stream the games on Max, it would also air them on TNT.\n\nTNT Sports owns the media rights to a number of different sports, including Major League Baseball, the NCAA Men's Basketball Championship, the National Hockey League and the United States Soccer Federation. Beginning next year, the company will add NASCAR, The French Open, and more than 65 regular season Big East basketball games.\n\nWarner Bros. Discovery will be the home of some college football playoff games beginning this year. Barkley will play a role in the coverage of some of the events.\n\n\"It's fantastic to have Charles for this journey as we develop new content ideas and shows for our fans,\" TNT Sports Chairman and CEO Luis Silberwasser said in the statement.\n\nBarkley is one of the stars of the popular NBA studio show \"Inside the NBA,\" which debuted after TNT acquired NBA rights during the 1989-90 season. He said in June he planned to retire after next season as a broadcaster.\n\n\"I ain't going nowhere other than TNT,\" Barkley said on June 14. \"But I have made the decision myself that, no matter what happens, next year is going to be my last year on television.\"\n\nBarkley seemed to waver on his decision to retire during a recent appearance on The Dan Patrick Show in late July.\n\n\"Everything is on the table,\" Barkley said of his future job opportunities.\n\nBarkley signed a 10-year deal with TNT Sports in 2022 and is entering his 25th year with the company. In May, Barkley said he had an opt-out clause in the contract in case TNT lost NBA rights. That's incorrect, according to a person with knowledge of the contractual language. Barkley said last month his deal is worth $210 million over 10 years.\n\nBarkley's commitment to TNT Sports likely closes the door on recreating \"Inside the NBA\" for another network if Warner Bros.

He signed a 10-year contract extension with TNT Sports in 2022.\n\nWarner Bros. Discovery, the parent company of TNT Sports, has sued the NBA in New York state court after the league did not accept the company\u00b4s matching offer for one of the packages in its new 11-year media rights deal, which will begin with the 2025-26 season.\n\n\"I love my TNT Sports family.

(Photo by Richard Shotwell/Invision/AP, File)\n\nBarkley joined TNT in 2000 and has been a part of the iconic \"Inside the NBA\" show, which has won 21 Sports Emmy Awards and has been a model for studio shows. Barkley took home his fifth Sports Emmy for Outstanding Studio Analyst in May.\n\nWhat Barkley's future looks like if TNT does not have the NBA remains to be seen. Turner has had an NBA package since 1984 and games have been on TNT since the network launched in 1988.\n\nHowever, the relationship started to become strained when Warner Bros. Discovery CEO David Zaslav said during an RBC Investor Conference in November 2022 that Turner and WBD \"don\u00b4t have to have the NBA.\"\n\nTNT Sports also carries the NHL and NCAA men's basketball tournament with CBS. It recently has added the College Football Playoffs, Big East basketball, NASCAR and the French Open.\n\n\"Charles is one of the best and most beloved sportscasters in the history of television. I know I speak for all the members of the TNT Sports family when I say we are incredibly thrilled to share this mutual commitment to continue showcasing Charles\u00b4 one-of-a-kind talents and entertain fans well into the future,\" TNT Sports Chairman and CEO Luis Silberwasser said in a statement. \"We continue to add to the breadth and depth of our sports portfolio and it\u00b4s fantastic to have Charles for this journey as we develop new content ideas and shows for our fans.\"\n\nBarkley was the co-host of \"King Charles,\" a weekly talk show on CNN with \"CBS Mornings\" co-host Gayle King.

Please try again later.\n\nCharles Barkley will stay with TNT Sports even without the NBA, he and the network announced Tuesday.\n\nThe announcement comes after a stretch in recent months in which Barkley lambasted TNT for losing the NBA's broadcast rights, threatened to retire from broadcasting after next season and publicly flirted with the other networks that will be the league's long-term media partners: Amazon, NBC and ESPN.\n\nBarkley dramatically announced his retirement in June during the NBA Finals after reports began to emerge that TNT could lose the NBA rights. \"These people I work with, they screwed this thing up, clearly,\" Barkley said in May.\n\nLast month, when the NBA made its new deals official -- they are worth around $76 billion over 11 years -- Barkley criticized the move to Amazon as a money grab and bad for fans. TNT's parent company, Warner Bros. Discovery, then filed a lawsuit against the league, arguing its current contract gives it the right to match Amazon's new deal. The lawsuit is pending, and it remains possible it could lead to some sort of settlement with the league.\n\nBarkley has been a longtime co-host of the popular \"Inside the NBA\" pre- and postgame show on TNT's NBA coverage. He has also branched out beyond basketball, hosting a since-canceled show with Gayle King on CNN that touched on current events and cultural issues.\n\nBarkley signed a new 10-year contract with TNT in 2022. He recently told \"The Dan Patrick Show\" that his deal is worth a total of $210 million.\n\n\"I love my TNT Sports family,\" Barkley said in a statement distributed by TNT. \"My #1 priority has been and always will be our people and keeping everyone together for as long as possible. We have the most amazing people, and they are the best at what they do.

The NBA has signed with Amazon, Disney and NBC to be their broadcasting partners on their new 11-year media rights deal. Warner Bros. Discovery is now trying to exercise its right to match a contractual offer from a competitor, but the NBA is proceeding with its new agreements anyway.\n\nBarkley said earlier this year that he planned to retire after the 2024-25 season if TNT did not retain its NBA rights, but that always seemed like an attempt to pressure network executives into getting a new deal done. Barkley signed a 10-year, $210 million contract with TNT in 2022, and he hinted recently that he would stick with the network if they wanted to commit to paying him.\n\nShould Warner Bros.

In June, Barkley announced that his 25th season with TNT's Inside the NBA for the 2024-25 season would be his last. But that threat always appeared to be a last-ditch Hail Mary by Barkley to try to help his longtime colleagues at TNT hang on to their jobs.\n\nIt remains to be seen whether TNT's legal challenge to retain its 40-year relationship with the NBA will succeed. Even if it doesn't, TNT wants Barkley to chip in across its sports programming lineup, whether its March Madness, college basketball and football, the NHL and made-for-TV golf events such as The Match.\n\nDuring an interview, Barkley confirmed that ESPN, NBC Sports and Amazon Prime Video have all reached out to him about possibly jumping ship. But for now, Barkley's loyalty to his TNT family has won out.\n\nCould he change his mind? Of course. Barkley has the contractual right to opt out whenever TNT loses NBA rights, which would be after this coming NBA season if they fail in court. The statements from Barkley and TNT said nothing about his long-term future, although Barkley's statement did refer to \"years,\" plural, to come. But Barkley is an unpredictable force of nature who ripped his bosses at Warner Bros. Discovery as \"clowns\" and \"fools\" for bungling the NBA rights negotiation. More recently, he turned his guns on NBA owners for choosing Amazon's \"money\" over the TV needs of fans.\n\n\"Clearly, the NBA has wanted to break up with us from the beginning,\" he said. \"I'm not sure TNT ever had a chance. TNT matched the money, but the league knows Amazon and these tech companies are the only ones willing to pay for the rights when they double in the future. The NBA didn't want to piss them off. It's a sad day when owners and commissioners choose money over the fans. It just sucks.\"\n\nBarkley's a one-of-a-kind talent. His statement of loyalty is the best news to hit TNT in a long time. If he chose to become a free agent, Barkley could command $25 million to $30 million on the open market. But for now, he's staying with TNT. I can't wait to watch a totally unplugged Sir Charles chop it up with Shaquille O'Neal, Kenny Smith and Ernie Johnson Jr. this coming season.", "source": {"uri": "frontofficesports.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Front Office Sports"}, "authors": [{"uri": "michael_mccarthy@frontofficesports.com", "name": "Michael McCarthy", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warner_Bros._Discovery_Sports", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Warner Bros.

They were unable to match the offer presented by Amazon, according to the league itself, and as a result, the NBA will be leaving TNT after their contract expires at the conclusion of the 2025-26 season. Charles Barkley, one of the hosts of the award-winning Inside The NBA, has made his displeasure over the entire ordeal known.\n\nBarkley has already expressed his frustrations over how the negotiations between the two long-time partners broke down. And despite the last-ditch attempt from TNT to rescue its partnership with the NBA, Barkley knew that it was inevitable for his home network to lose the rights to cover the association.\n\n\"It's been really depressing for me because we kinda knew we were gonna lose the thing. It was one of the worst-kept secrets in the history of civilization,\" Barkley shared in an appearance on Podcast P with Paul George presented by Wave Sports + Entertainment.\n\nFor Charles Barkley, the most gut-wrenching part of this whole thing was witnessing his colleagues behind the scenes face the uncertainty of losing their job now that the NBA is leaving TNT.\n\n\"These people become part of your family. For 24 years, you know them, you know their kids, you know their husbands, you know their wives. That's what I feel really s****y about. ... They were like, 'I got a wife. I got kids. I got a mortgage. And I ain't got no f***ing job. It really hurt me that my friends were talking like that. It was really heartbreaking. It just really sucks, man. I can't believe we screwed it up. Next year is gonna be a bittersweet year,\" Barkley added.\n\nCharles Barkley and the Inside crew say goodbye to NBA on TNT\n\nTNT dragged along in its negotiations with the NBA, and in the end, they wanted to utilize the clause in their contract with the league that specified that they could match competing offers. However, Charles Barkley revealed that for TNT to extend its partnership with the NBA, they had to match the much-expensive offer package from ESPN and NBC instead of the least expensive one from Amazon.\n\nAll good things come to an end, but it certainly is disappointing for Barkley and the rest of the hard-workers over at TNT to lose their jobs over something that they did not have any control over.", "source": {"uri": "clutchpoints.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ClutchPoints"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jedd_pagaduan@clutchpoints.com", "name": "Jedd Pagaduan", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TNT_(American_TV_network)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "TNT (American TV network)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Barkley", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Charles Barkley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_(company)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Amazon (company)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_on_TNT", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NBA on TNT"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "ESPN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBC", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NBC"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan Pages", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Theme_Merchandise", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Theme Merchandise", "wgt": 7}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Show_Basketball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Show Basketball", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Science", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Science", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 59}], "image": "https://wp.clutchpoints.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Charles-Barkley-claims-TNT-losing-NBA-was-one-of-worst-kept-secrets-in-history-of-civilization.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9794242", "eventUri": "eng-9794242", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.192156862745098, "wgt": 215, "relevance": 1}

The 61-year-old announced during Game 4 of the NBA Finals that next year was going to be his final one on television. The announcement came amid rumors that the NBA was going to move away from TNT and have its rights with ESPN/ABC, NBC and Amazon Prime Video.\n\nTNT ended up losing its media rights after the 2024-25 NBA season, which means \"Inside the NBA\" -- which includes a panel of Barkley, Shaquille O'Neal, Ernie Johnson and Kenny Smith -- despite matching the offer that Disney put forth to acquire the league's rights.\n\nBarkley just completed the second of a 10-year deal. Included in his contract is an opt-out if TNT were to lose its rights. TNT does have NHL rights and will have the 2024-25 Stanley Cup after ESPN had it last season.\n\n\"Inside the NBA\" will return next season before TNT loses its media rights.

TNT and parent company Warner Bros.-Discovery are pursuing \"legal action\" against the NBA to keep basketball on the Warner networks after the league ultimately went with a different media rights package spearheaded by conglomerates like Disney and Amazon.)\n\nGiven the murky future of both the NBA and \"Inside the NBA\" on TNT, Barkley originally appeared ready to ride off into the sunset.\n\n\"I ain't going nowhere other than TNT,\" Barkley said during the NBA Finals, per ESPN.\n\n\"But I have made the decision that, no matter what happens, next year is going to be my last year on television,\" Barkley continued. \"And I just want to say thank you to my NBA family. You guys have been great to me.\n\nOn Tuesday, WBD and Barkley issued a joint statement announcing that Barkley will not be retiring following the coming NBA season.\n\n\"I love my TNT Sports family,\" Barkley said. \"My #1 priority has been and always will be our people and keeping everyone together for as long as possible.\n\n\"We have the most amazing people, and they are the best at what they do.

Discovery may be losing the NBA, but it won't lose Charles Barkley. The famed NBA analyst and Basketball Hall of Famer announced that he is sticking with the media conglomerate despite having conversations with the league's future media partners and incumbent Disney.\n\n\"I love my TNT Sports family. My No. 1 priority has been and always will be our people and keeping everyone together for as long as possible,\" said Barkley in a statement. \"We have the most amazing people, and they are the best at what they do. I'm looking forward to continuing to work with them both on the shows we currently have and new ones we develop together in the future. This is the only place for me.\"\n\nBarkley, who just finished the third year of a 10-year, $210 million deal, has been with TNT and its various ownerships since 2000. The upcoming NBA season will mark his 25th with the company.\n\nThe renewal of vows between the two sides comes nearly two weeks after Barkley criticized the NBA for choosing Amazon over WBD when the league declined the media company's offer based on matching rights. On July 26, he said that the league chose money over the fans, though the NBA has stated its new rights package with Amazon, Disney/ESPN and NBC will expand its reach in ways that WBD cannot.\n\nLater that morning, Barkley told The Athletic, \"I don't want to be in a relationship where I have to sue somebody to be in it. That makes zero sense. If you have to sue somebody to stay in a relationship, do you think that is a healthy relationship?\" He confirmed that he was talking with the NBA's new partners and Disney with the belief that he had an \"opt-out\" clause in his TNT contract.\n\nWBD, through TNT Sports, will have national rights to NBA games for the 2024-25 season, the final year under the nine-year extension that was signed in 2014. (TNT has carried NBA games since 1989.)\n\n\"I've been impressed by the leadership team who is fighting hard and have been aggressive in adding new properties to TNT Sports, which I am very excited about,\" Barkley said. \"I appreciate them and all of my colleagues for their continued support, and most importantly our fans. I'm going to give my all as we keep them entertained for years to come.\"\n\nWhat Barkley will do for the company after the NBA moves on remains to be seen. WBD has tried two different limited shows with the former power forward -- TNT's American Race and CNN's King Charles - that did not perform well in the Nielsen ratings. However, the company has been adding other sports rights in recent months, including the French Open, Big East basketball and a deal with ESPN to sublicense the College Football Playoff.\n\nThe company already carries the NHL, and Barkley has frequently appeared in Stanley Cup playoff coverage over the years for both TNT and former rightsholder NBC.", "source": {"uri": "sportico.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sportico.com"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jason_clinkscales@sportico.com", "name": "Jason Clinkscales", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Barkley", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Charles Barkley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warner_Bros._Discovery_Sports", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Warner Bros.

Discovery (WBD) to exercise its right to match an offer from Amazon for a part of the league's 11-year, $76 billion media rights deal. Shortly after the announcement, WBD, TNT's parent company, filed a lawsuit under seal in New York County Supreme Court.\n\nTNT'S PARENT COMPANY WARNER BROS.

I'm going to give my all as we keep them entertained for years to come.\"\n\nWhile Barkley revealed his intentions to retire at the conclusion of the 2024-25 NBA season in June, by late July, he hinted he was open to other opportunities.\n\nWhen longtime sports radio and television host Dan Patrick asked Barkley whether he would follow through with his retirement plans since he was fielding calls from other media companies, the NBA legend said he was \"going to listen\" to what the networks had to say.\n\n\"First of all, I'd be stupid not to take their call, but the beauty of this situation... I don't have to make any decision for a year, Dan,\" Barkley said. \"But I told all three networks, 'Hey I'm honored. I'm flattered that y'all want to talk to me, but let's see what happens in a year.\"\n\nDisney, which is ESPN's parent company, NBC, and Amazon Prime Video were the three networks Barkley was referencing during his remarks. All three of those networks recently closed deals for the some portion of the NBA's future media rights.\n\nIn May, the Sports Business Journal reported that Barkley has a clause in his contract that allows him to go elsewhere once the network's NBA deal runs out.\n\nDuring Barkley's conversation with Patrick, he added that he anticipated being a highly sought media personality next year. However, Barkley also reaffirmed his intention to bring his broadcasting career to a close, making Tuesday's reversal even more of a surprise.\n\n\"But I don't see them (TNT) guaranteeing it to be honest because they don't really have anything. So, I think I'm going to be a free agent next summer. Right now, my intention is to retire,\" Barkley told Patrick at the time.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nWhile TNT did recently land the rights to some College Football Playoff games. The network will also serve as the US broadcasting home for the French Open tennis tournament beginning in 2025. The pivot to tennis and college football could be viewed as a way for the company to try and fill the hole that would be left behind from the loss of the NBA.\n\n\"Charles is one of the best and most beloved sportscasters in the history of television.

The NBA has denied that, because the Amazon portion of the package is dedicated to a streaming-only service.\n\nBarkley, who candidly expressed his frustrations with Warner Bros. Discovery's approach to the negotiations on multiple occasions, indicated in June that he would retire if TNT did not retain NBA rights.\n\nDuring a recent appearance on \"The Dan Patrick Show,\" during which he confirmed that his contract with TNT is for 10 years and $210 million, Barkley seemed more open to other broadcasting possibilities.\n\nBarkley's commitment to remaining with TNT likely means he will be involved in coverage of an assortment of sports, whether or not the network retains some NBA broadcasting rights.

That's because the NBA's future with TNT is also even more in doubt.\n\nWell, it seems like Barkley and TNT have come to some sort of arrangement, as the parties released a joint statement on Tuesday. Barkley indicated he will remain with TNT -- whether the network keeps the NBA or not. (For the record, a return of the NBA on TNT beyond this season is highly unlikely.)\n\nThis comes just a day after Barkley left his future with the network very much in doubt.\n\nHe told Andrew Marchand of The Athletic that he will either remain with TNT Sports on his 10-year, $210 million contract or he will listen to offers from the others (along with contemplating retirement).\n\nBarkley, 61, is in the third year of his TNT deal. He is perhaps the most notable face on the TNT studio show Inside the NBA, along with Kenny Smith, Shaquille O'Neal and host Ernie Johnson.\n\n\"My deal is 10 years, $210 million,\" Barkley told Marchand. \"Turner has to come to me ASAP and they have to guarantee my whole thing or they can offer me a pay cut, which there is no chance of that happening and I'll be (a) free agent.\n\n\"My thing was, 'Wait, y'all f -- up, I didn't f -- up, why do I have to take a pay cut?\"\n\nWarner Bros. Discovery, the parent company of TNT, is suing the NBA after the NBA announced it would not honor TNT's right to match. TNT has attempted to match Amazon's portion of the league's new 11-year media rights deal, reportedly worth about $77 billion.\n\n\"I wouldn't want them to sue,\" Barkley said. \"The NBA clearly wanted to break up with us. I don't want to be in a relationship where I have to sue somebody to be in it. That makes zero sense.\n\n\"If you have to sue somebody to stay in a relationship, do you think that is a healthy relationship?\"\n\nHe added that he doesn't really see a place for TNT in the current media landscape.\n\n\"It's going to all go to streaming in 11 years,\" Barkley said. \"I think this is just a cash grab, but they needed streaming because in 11 years nobody's going to be able to afford these rights but streaming.\n\n\"They're kind of getting their cake and eating it, too.

Less than two months after announcing his television retirement, Barkley and TNT Sports have \"reaffirmed his commitment\" to the media company and \"will exclusively contribute to TNT Sports for many years to come.\" The news comes as WBD is taking legal action against the professional sports league, claiming that the NBA is legally bound by the terms of the existing contract to accept WBD's matching offer for Amazon's deal. If that fails, the media company would say goodbye to the NBA beginning with the 2025-2026 season and to one of the best coverage shows in all of professional sports - TNT's Inside The NBA with Barkley, Ernie Johnson, Shaquille O'Neal, and Kenny Smith. Near the end of July, the NBA announced new broadcasting rights deals with NBCUniversal, ABC/ESPN, and Amazon Prime Video\n\n\"I love my TNT Sports family. My #1 priority has been and always will be our people and keeping everyone together for as long as possible. We have the most amazing people, and they are the best at what they do,\" Barkley shared in a statement, reaffirming his commitment to the company. \"I'm looking forward to continuing to work with them both on the shows we currently have and new ones we develop together in the future. This is the only place for me. I have to say ... I've been impressed by the leadership team who is fighting hard and have been aggressive in adding new properties to TNT Sports, which I am very excited about. I appreciate them and all of my colleagues for their continued support and, most importantly, our fans. I'm going to give my all as we keep them entertained for years to come.\"\n\n\"Charles is one of the best and most beloved sportscasters in the history of television. I know I speak for all the members of the TNT Sports family when I say we are incredibly thrilled to share this mutual commitment to continue showcasing Charles' one-of-a-kind talents and entertain fans well into the future,\" shared TNT Sports CEO Luis Silberwasser. \"We continue to add to the breadth and depth of our sports portfolio - including new properties in the College Football Playoffs, Roland-Garros, NASCAR, BIG EAST college basketball, Mountain West football, among others - and it's fantastic to have Charles for this journey as we develop new content ideas and shows for our fans.\"", "source": {"uri": "bleedingcool.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Bleeding Cool"}, "authors": [{"uri": "ray_flook@bleedingcool.com", "name": "Ray Flook", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warner_Bros._Discovery_Sports", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Warner Bros.

Charles Barkley can still do with TNT when Inside the NBA leaves the network", "body": "To absolutely no one's surprise, it looks like Charles Barkley is actually isn't going to retire like he said he was.\n\nBarkley was clearly frustrated with how TNT's negotiations with the NBA were going. For months, he addressed his concerns about the future of the partnership both on and off the record. His telling us that he was retiring felt like something between a lash-out in frustration about the situation and a shrewd negotiating tactic.\n\nBut, the reality is he was almost certainly never going to leave. Barkley is just two years into 10-year, $210 million deal with TNT and is one of the highest paid media personalities in sports. He's not going anywhere.\n\nSo, if he's sticking around, what will Barkley do on TNT without the NBA?\n\nThere are a few good answers already out there. Let's dig into them.\n\nCharles Barkley has always been a fixture in TNT's college basketball coverage for March Madness.\n\nSure, his brackets are usually terrible and he's always rooting for Auburn. But he also still gives that very blunt analysis that everyone loves. He can do that a bit more with the college basketball team when the fall comes around, even if the NBA isn't around anymore.\n\nTNT has a presence in hockey now with NHL games broadcasting on its network on Wednesdays.\n\nCharles Barkley seems to have a blast talking about hockey. Here he is talking to the TNT crew about the Stanley Cup final. It's pretty good!\n\nI don't know if he can do this all the time, but I definitely wouldn't mind seeing a bit more of it.\n\nLike the NHL, I wouldn't say Charles Barkley is a golf aficionado by any stretch of the imagination. I wouldn't want to hear him on The Masters main broadcast or anything of that nature.\n\nBut when TNT does special events like \"The Match\" it'd be great to hear Barkley bringing a bit of levity to the broadcast and having a good time.\n\nPlus, we'd talk about his golf swing some more. He's gotten pretty good, hasn't he?\n\nI know Charles Barkley doesn't have any social media, but man, this would be a fantastic opportunity to get him involved in a bit more social content.\n\nGetting Barkley's instant reactions to NBA moves on the B/R app would be a bit of a change of pace from what we're used to. It might not even be as good. But I'm still eager to see how it'd work.\n\nThink of a fusion between Sportscenter and The Tonight Show. That's something Turner could do to maximize having Barkley on its roster.\n\nHe's tailormade for late-night TV, isn't he? Obviously, you need a sports hook to the show. But Barkley has so many opinions about so many other things and he's never afraid to share them no matter what others might think.\n\nWe know Barkley can talk about sports, but he's also done political commentary. He did a show with Gayle King for a bit that didn't really work out as well as some thought it might. TNT also gave Barkley a show on race relations in America back in 2017. The company is willing to try different angles with Charles.\n\nThe thing is, I don't even think the show needs to be that serious. Just take the Inside the NBA crew, sit them down on a set and let them cook for an hour or so on primetime NBA nights. They'll talk about basketball, obviously, but the conversation might spill elsewhere, too. It could be funny at times. It could be serious for others. That's the beauty of that show. That's why it works.\n\nTNT should do everything it can to keep it going, and I think this would be a good way to ensure that.", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TNT_(American_TV_network)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "TNT (American TV network)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Barkley", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Charles Barkley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/College_basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "College basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Hockey_League", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National Hockey League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Golf"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NCAA_Division_I_men's_basketball_tournament", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Match_(golf)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Match (golf)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanley_Cup_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Stanley Cup Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auburn_University", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Auburn University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Masters_Tournament", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Masters Tournament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fan_(person)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fan (person)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inside_the_NBA", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Inside the NBA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SportsCenter", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "SportsCenter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turner_Broadcasting_System", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Turner Broadcasting System"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gayle_King", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gayle King"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Tonight_Show", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Tonight Show"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_time", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Prime time"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_app", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mobile app"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 59}], "image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/PwmmlLGhiLtkbLQCLC21bQ--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD03MDE7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/ftw_outdoors_usa_today_article_609/3ebb9d4bd14b8e833e5536c98522742b", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9794242", "eventUri": "eng-9794242", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.0980392156862746, "wgt": 205, "relevance": 1}

If he retired, he would be forfeiting hundreds of millions of dollars.\n\nGiven that he's a legitimate superstar and synonymous to anything involving the NBA on television, Barkley was being targeted by Amazon, ESPN, and NBC with the three-letter network beginning its 11-year, $77 billion contract with the NBA beginning after the upcoming season.\n\nDespite saying that \"I'm not doing any more interviews\" during his original announcement about retirement, Barkley joined 'The Dan Patrick Show' on July 26 and laid out the terms and negotiation demands he had if TNT wanted him to stay on board.\n\n\"Next year will be year three. Turner (TNT) has to come to me today or next week and say, 'Hey we screwed up. Will you take a pay cut?'\" Barkley told Dan Patrick. \"So they'll either have to guarantee the full 10 years, ($210 million), or they're going to have to ask me to take a pay cut, which, under no circumstances, am I taking a pay cut. Zero chance of me taking a pay cut.\"\n\nBarkley explained that he'd \"politely decline\" taking a pay cut because of the great relationship he has had with the network.\n\nThat presented two options for TNT: guarantee the entire contract, or watch Barkley walk. Based on Marchand's report, TNT guaranteed the full deal.\n\nWhile things are interesting on the Barkley-NBA-TNT front now, they'll be even more so after next season when the league heads to NBC. TNT is suing the NBA to enforce its non-compete agreement, but if NBC becomes the home of the NBA, it'll be intriguing to see what direction TNT goes with Barkley.", "source": {"uri": "outkick.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "OutKick"}, "authors": [{"uri": "mark_harris@outkick.com", "name": "Mark Harris", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TNT_(American_TV_network)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "TNT (American TV network)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Barkley", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Charles Barkley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBA Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_York_Times", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The New York Times"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Dan_Patrick_Show", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Dan Patrick Show"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "ESPN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBC", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NBC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dan_Patrick_(sportscaster)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dan Patrick (sportscaster)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turner_Broadcasting_System", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Turner Broadcasting System"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Show_Basketball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Show Basketball", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Science", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Science", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 51}], "image": "https://static.outkick.com/www.outkick.com/content/uploads/2024/05/GettyImages-1158097800-1.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9794242", "eventUri": "eng-9794242", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-26", "textStart": 1240, "textEnd": 1247}], "sentiment": 0.01960784313725483, "wgt": 205, "relevance": 1}

It's been reported that Ernie Johnson won't leave Turner, and Charles Barkley stated at the end of the season he'd retire after next year -- although not many believed him -- and that he wouldn't feel right going to a new network no matter the money.\n\nWhile folks were right not to buy the retirement bit, Barkley was telling the truth when it came to his loyalty to TNT. On Tuesday, the network announced they had reached an agreement with Barkley to stay with the network for the remainder of his 10-year, $210 million deal he signed in 2022, despite them no longer having NBA rights.\n\n\"I love my TNT Sports family. My #1 priority has been and always will be our people and keeping everyone together for as long as possible,\" said Barkley. \"We have the most amazing people, and they are the best at what they do. I'm looking forward to continuing to work with them both on the shows we currently have and new ones we develop together in the future. This is the only place for me. I have to say ... I've been impressed by the leadership team who is fighting hard and have been aggressive in adding new properties to TNT Sports, which I am very excited about. I appreciate them and all of my colleagues for their continued support, and most importantly our fans. I'm going to give my all as we keep them entertained for years to come.\"\n\n\"Charles is one of the best and most beloved sportscasters in the history of television,\" said TNT Sports CEO Luis Silberwasser. \"I know I speak for all the members of the TNT Sports family when I say we are incredibly thrilled to share this mutual commitment to continue showcasing Charles' one-of-a-kind talents and entertain fans well into the future. We continue to add to the breadth and depth of our sports portfolio -- including new properties in the College Football Playoffs, Roland-Garros, NASCAR, BIG EAST college basketball, Mountain West football, among others - and it's fantastic to have Charles for this journey as we develop new content ideas and shows for our fans.\"\n\nThe announcement comes as a fairly big surprise, not that Barkley isn't in fact hanging up the microphone, but that he'll be staying with TNT without them having the NBA. Barkley loves hockey, so I'd guess he'll be a semi-regular guest on their NHL coverage, and I wouldn't be surprised if they looked to start some kind of Chuck Bets show around his love of gambling.\n\nThis also opens the door for Inside the NBA to continue in one of two forms. One would be as a standalone, weekly NBA show for TNT. I'm not sure how that'd do from a viewership perspective on linear without being alongside a game broadcast, but they could certainly still churn out the kind of viral content that fans love even without being attached to game coverage -- and open it up to become even more of a late night show type feel if they wanted. The other option would be to license out the show to Amazon, with TNT Sports owning and producing it.\n\nThis is an idea that's been kicked around for some time, and it would make a ton of sense for all parties. Amazon is still new enough to the sports media space that they'd have to build out a physical studio anyway to create a show from scratch, and licensing Inside would give them immediate authority with fans by porting over the best studio show in sports en masse. If TNT produces the show in Atlanta, you'd have the same people running it behind the scenes, which is almost as important to the show's feel as the folks in front of the camera, and gives TNT a way to keep Barkley and the rest around for other shows while mitigating the cost with whatever Amazon would be paying them.", "source": {"uri": "uproxx.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "UPROXX"}, "authors": [{"uri": "derrick_rossignol@uproxx.com", "name": "Derrick Rossignol", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "steven_hyden@uproxx.com", "name": "Steven Hyden", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "aaron_williams@uproxx.com", "name": "Aaron Williams", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "wongo_okon@uproxx.com", "name": "Wongo Okon", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warner_Bros._Discovery_Sports", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Warner Bros.

Or maybe his emotional retirement speech was merely a ploy to try and force TNT to pay up the money to keep the NBA and his Inside the NBA team on the air past the 2024-2025 season.\n\nInterestingly, TNT announced in July that it had matched the financial package Amazon offered for NBA broadcast rights beginning in 2025-26, but the NBA rejected that proposal, leading to some furious words being directed at the NBA by Sir Charles.\n\n\"I'm not sure TNT ever had a chance. TNT matched the money, but the league knows Amazon and these tech companies are the only ones willing to pay for the rights when they double in the future. The NBA didn't want to piss them off,\" said Barkley.\n\n\"It's a sad day when owners and commissioners choose money over the fans. It just sucks.\"\n\nWhat he will be doing for TNT after the 2024-2025 NBA season remains to be seen, but TNT has added the French Open and Big East basketball to go with properties it already has the rights to such as college basketball and football, the NHL, and events like \"The Match.\"", "source": {"uri": "brobible.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "BroBible"}, "authors": [{"uri": "douglas_charles@brobible.com", "name": "Douglas Charles", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warner_Bros._Discovery_Sports", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Warner Bros.

Charles Barkley can still do with TNT when Inside the NBA leaves the network", "body": "To absolutely no one's surprise, it looks like Charles Barkley is actually isn't going to retire like he said he was.\n\nBarkley was clearly frustrated with how TNT's negotiations with the NBA were going. For months, he addressed his concerns about the future of the partnership both on and off the record. His telling us that he was retiring felt like something between a lash-out in frustration about the situation and a shrewd negotiating tactic.\n\nBut, the reality is he was almost certainly never going to leave. Barkley is just two years into 10-year, $210 million deal with TNT and is one of the highest paid media personalities in sports. He's not going anywhere.\n\nSo, if he's sticking around, what will Barkley do on TNT without the NBA?\n\nThere are a few good answers already out there. Let's dig into them.\n\nIncrease his college basketball presence\n\nCharles Barkley has always been a fixture in TNT's college basketball coverage for March Madness.\n\nSure, his brackets are usually terrible and he's always rooting for Auburn. But he also still gives that very blunt analysis that everyone loves. He can do that a bit more with the college basketball team when the fall comes around, even if the NBA isn't around anymore.\n\nDo a bit of hockey\n\nTNT has a presence in hockey now with NHL games broadcasting on its network on Wednesdays.\n\nCharles Barkley seems to have a blast talking about hockey. Here he is talking to the TNT crew about the Stanley Cup final. It's pretty good!\n\nI don't know if he can do this all the time, but I definitely wouldn't mind seeing a bit more of it.\n\nLet him talk about Golf\n\nLike the NHL, I wouldn't say Charles Barkley is a golf aficionado by any stretch of the imagination. I wouldn't want to hear him on The Masters main broadcast or anything of that nature.\n\nBut when TNT does special events like \"The Match\" it'd be great to hear Barkley bringing a bit of levity to the broadcast and having a good time.\n\nPlus, we'd talk about his golf swing some more. He's gotten pretty good, hasn't he?\n\nHave him work with Bleacher Report\n\nI know Charles Barkley doesn't have any social media, but man, this would be a fantastic opportunity to get him involved in a bit more social content.\n\nGetting Barkley's instant reactions to NBA moves on the B/R app would be a bit of a change of pace from what we're used to. It might not even be as good. But I'm still eager to see how it'd work.\n\nLet him have a late-night sports show with the Inside the NBA crew\n\nThink of a fusion between Sportscenter and The Tonight Show. That's something Turner could do to maximize having Barkley on its roster.\n\nHe's tailormade for late-night TV, isn't he? Obviously, you need a sports hook to the show. But Barkley has so many opinions about so many other things and he's never afraid to share them no matter what others might think.\n\nWe know Barkley can talk about sports, but he's also done political commentary. He did a show with Gayle King for a bit that didn't really work out as well as some thought it might. TNT also gave Barkley a show on race relations in America back in 2017. The company is willing to try different angles with Charles.\n\nThe thing is, I don't even think the show needs to be that serious. Just take the Inside the NBA crew, sit them down on a set and let them cook for an hour or so on primetime NBA nights. They'll talk about basketball, obviously, but the conversation might spill elsewhere, too. It could be funny at times. It could be serious for others. That's the beauty of that show. That's why it works.\n\nTNT should do everything it can to keep it going, and I think this would be a good way to ensure that.", "source": {"uri": "ftw.usatoday.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "For The Win"}, "authors": [{"uri": "mike_d_sykes@ftw.usatoday.com", "name": "Mike D.

After providing entertainment and game analysis for decades, the group of Ernie Johnson, Kenny Smith, Charles Barkley and Shaquille O'Neal will have their last run together in the 2024-25 season. This is due to TNT losing the NBA's media rights to Amazon.\n\nWhen Barkley recently made an appearance on Podcast P with Paul George, he was asked about his experience on the show and whether any other TV network will be able to replicate the impact and longevity of Inside the NBA. In an elaborate answer, Barkley detailed what sets TNT apart from other networks like ESPN.\n\nBarkley outlined that a show like Inside the NBA can only be created if a network is willing to give a group a fair chance. Taking ESPN as an example, he explained that these networks have a very straightforward and an almost mechanical approach with what they create.\n\nThe Chuckster pointed out that ESPN throws a random group of people together and when the product fails for a few months, they don't care about giving it more time to grow. Instead, they take it off air.\n\nBarkley told PG and his crew, \"It's easy to say after 24 years how great our show has been. And I can't remember, but I' pretty sure we had some rocky roads in the beginning...I'm positive we had some rocky roads when Shaq first came on because it's always an adjustment.\"\n\nIn Barkley's opinion, the confidence to let one group try their best over an indefinite period of time helped create the incredible chemistry that we see in Inside the NBA. That's what sets TNT apart from ESPN.\n\nHowever, Barkley doesn't think ESPN will ever be patient for that long with the same group of people. That is why when the rumors of his show going off air started floating around, Chuck made it clear that he won't join another network.\n\nThe NBA's decision to part ways with Warner Bros. Discovery to give the media rights to Amazon was described by Barkley as the league prioritizing money over fans. Dejected by the news, Chuck released an official statement, putting his feelings into words.\n\nHe wrote, \"Clearly, the NBA has wanted to break up with us from the beginning. I'm not sure TNT ever had a chance. TNT matched the money. The league knows Amazon and these tech companies are the only ones willing to pay for the rights when they double in the future. The NBA didn't want to piss them off. It's a sad day when owners and commissioners choose money over the fans. It just sucks.\"\n\nAlthough it's a lost battle, TNT is not going down without a fight. They have filed a lawsuit in the New York state court in Manhattan, requesting the court to delay the new deal between the NBA and Amazon from going into effect.", "source": {"uri": "thesportsrush.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The SportsRush"}, "authors": [{"uri": "prateek_singh@thesportsrush.com", "name": "Prateek Singh", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TNT_(American_TV_network)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "TNT (American TV network)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inside_the_NBA", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Inside the NBA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Barkley", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Charles Barkley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "ESPN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shaquille_O'Neal", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Shaquille O'Neal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_George", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paul George"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ernie_Johnson_Jr.", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ernie Johnson Jr."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenny_Smith", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kenny Smith"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_(company)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Amazon (company)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warner_Bros._Discovery", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Warner Bros.

Discovery,\" Ourand explained. \"David Zaslav has told people that even having lost the NBA, Charles Barkley is still a bona fide television star. He's great on television. And they have other sports that are there.

Likely, Barkley would rather retire than work harder for the person responsible for breaking up Inside the NBA.\n\nBarkley recently revealed he spoke with other NBA media partners, but there is a twist: the TNT star's deal doesn't include an opt-out clause.\n\nRelated: Charles Barkley Destroys Bosses Over TNT Decision, Loss of 'Inside The NBA'\n\nUnless Zaslav lets him walk to another company, Barkley has three options: retire, do multiple jobs with WBD, or convince Zaslav to release him from the deal.

Barkley, who recently criticized the NBA, has been a key part of the success of the \"Inside The NBA\" show on TNT. However, the show will end after the next NBA season as TNT's bid for the broadcasting rights was turned down by the NBA. Despite this, the 1993 Most Valuable Player has emphasized the significance of the show for the NBA.\n\nDuring a recent appearance on Podcast P with Paul George, Barkley reflects on the legacy and what went wrong with 'Inside the NBA' as the show is about to conclude.\n\n\"It's been really depressing for me because we kind of knew we were gonna lose the thing. It was one of the worst kept secrets in the history of civilization. It just really sucks man. I can't believe we screwed it up. So next year is going to be a bittersweet year.\" Barkley said.\n\nBarkley expressed his disappointment that the show would be ending during a conversation with Paul George. Additionally, he said that since it would be their final year covering the NBA season, the upcoming year will be painful.\n\nIn the same podcast, Barkley shared his opinion on the performance of Philadelphia 76ers star player Joel Embiid at the 2024 Paris Olympics. The 61-year-old legend mentioned that Embiid's underwhelming performance for Team USA during the Olympics was due to his poor physical condition. Barkley feels that Embiid should take this into account.\n\n\"I hope this is a wake-up [call] for Joel, this Olympic experience. He has not played well and I'm hoping he's like, 'Yo man, I gotta get in better shape.' Me personally, I think that's one of the reasons he's always injured.\" Barkley said.\n\nIn addition to receiving criticism for his performance, Embiid was chastised for choosing to play for Team USA rather than France. Barkley's guidance may have a significant effect on Embiid's output. it could be interesting to see Embiid's performance against Brazil in the quarterfinal match on August 7.\n\nAlso Read: \"Everybody's Looking To Get Paid\"- Stephen A.

Discovery Beyond NBA Deal", "body": "Charles Barkley says he isn't getting out of Warner Bros. Discovery's sports game.\n\nThe roundball great, who is a mainstay of the long-running TNT studio show \"Inside the NBA,\" said Tuesday that he will put off previously articulated plans to retire and continue to work through what is believed to be a ten-year contract that kicked off in 2022. Warner Bros. Discovery is in the midst of a heated legal squabble with the NBA over keeping some passel of rights to show games after the league's next season. Barkley's reversal could be seen as a sweetener, though NBA executives are believed to have soured on their long-term alliance with Warner. NBCUniversal, Amazon and Disney are the league's partners in a new rights deal that would commence next year.\n\n\"I love my TNT Sports family. My #1 priority has been and always will be our people and keeping everyone together for as long as possible. We have the most amazing people, and they are the best at what they do. I'm looking forward to continuing to work with them both on the shows we currently have and new ones we develop together in the future. This is the only place for me,\" Barkley said in a statement. \"I have to say ... I've been impressed by the leadership team who is fighting hard and have been aggressive in adding new properties to TNT Sports, which I am very excited about. I appreciate them and all of my colleagues for their continued support, and most importantly our fans. I'm going to give my all as we keep them entertained for years to come.\"\n\nBarkley's future presence would not be limited to NBA play. There are plans in place that would have him contribute to other parts of the Warner sports portfolio if the company proves unable to persuade the league or force it though the courts to keep games parked at TNT. Barkley could participate in content built around Warner's share of the NCAA \"March Madness\" basketball tournament it operates with Paramount Global; Major League Baseball games; Warner's celebrity golf contests; or NHL matches. Barkley could also devise original programming.\n\n\"We continue to add to the breadth and depth of our sports portfolio -- including new properties in the College Football Playoffs, Roland-Garros, NASCAR, BIG EAST college basketball, Mountain West football, among others - and it's fantastic to have Charles for this journey as we develop new content ideas and shows for our fans,\" said Luis Silberwasser, chairman and CEO of TNT Sports.\n\nStill, relations between Warner and the NBA are at an all-time low, and it isn't clear that even the continued presence of Sir Charles can remedy the situation.\n\nWarner on July 26 filed a suit against the NBA in the Supreme Court in the State of New York, alleging that the league had ignored its legal standing to make a matching offer for any package of games previously shown on TNT that had been awarded to a new party. \"Warner Bros. Discovery's claims are without merit and our lawyers will address them,\" the NBA said in a statement at the time. Its new deals with NBCU, Amazona and Disney last 11 years.\n\nKeeping NBA games is critical for the media company, led by CEO David Zaslav. The NBA rights are \"a significant driver of TNT's current affiliate value,\" noted Robert Fishman, a media analyst with MoffettNathanson, an independent analysis firm, in a recent research note. \"With some of its key network's carriage agreements are up for renewal next year, we would expect TNT to have far less leverage in these affiliate negotiations, perhaps even seeing rollbacks in rates, even after factoring in the\n\nnew sports rights acquired over the past few months. WBD's refers to these NBA rights in its\n\nlawsuit as a \"unique asset that cannot be replaced.\" We can see the damage extend to other parts\n\nof WBD's cable portfolio, as the company would no longer be able to use the NBA on TNT as a\n\nhammer to push rates on its slew of other domestic cable networks.\"\n\nThe legal battle may not serve Warner well, argued Fishman. \"It is difficult for us to fully understand what positive outcome can be achieved by WBD with this lawsuit.\"\n\nThe new agreement with Barkley may serve other imperatives. By maintaining ties with its star announcer, Warner Bros.

So, understandably, there was a serious outcry when Barkley revealed his plans to retire from the TV business in 2025. The ex-Phoenix Sun's comments coincided with the reported cancellation of Inside the NBA - the show he famously co-hosts - due to TNT losing the broadcast rights to the eponymous league. But, now, in a surprising turn of events, Barkley is walking back his statements on retiring.\n\nIt would seem that the Round Mound of Rebound has now decided to remain with TNT Sports, which is owned by Warner Bros. Discovery, even after Inside the NBA's run ends after the 2024-2025 season. This development comes less than two months after he announced on air that he would hang up his microphone after over two decades of TV work. Sir Charles shared a statement on the matter, which was obtained by Variety and, by the sounds of it, he's incredibly committed to remaining with his longtime employers:\n\nWhile it may still be tough for fans to fathom that Inside the NBA will come to an end, Charles Barkley's decision to remain with TNT Sports should provide them with some comfort. This is a cool prospect and one that one could add on to the silver lining of wild send-off season for Inside.

With a panel of legendary hoop icons like Shaquille O'Neal and Charles Barkley, along with Kenny Smith and Ernie Johnson, the show has provided insightful and often humorous commentary on all things NBA.\n\nHowever, as the 2024-2025 season nears, one 'Inside the NBA' member is feeling bittersweet about what will most likely be the show's final hurrah. Chuck, who has been a mainstay on the show since its inception in 2000, recently shared his thoughts on the future of the beloved program.\n\nA family-like atmosphere\n\nAs tough as Charles was during his playing years, he showed his softer, more fragile side when sharing how he felt about the impending end of 'Inside the NBA.' The crew of the show is more than just colleagues, they are a family. Through the years, the man known as 'Sir Charles' has come to know everyone he works with, including their families. That's one of the things he'll miss most.\n\n\"If you've been at the same job for 24 years, when I got there, some of those people didn't have kids. Now I've seen the kids. They come in to see me, Kenny, Ernie, and everybody, before they go to their proms,\" Barkley said on \"Podcast P.\"\n\nChuck added that in the two decades-plus he's worked on \"Inside the NBA,\" he has seen his co-workers' children go from toddlers to graduating college.\n\n\"The first time you came in here, you were like six years old. Then, the next time I saw you, you were in high school going to the prom. Then you were off to college, and now they've all graduated from college. These people become part of your family,\" the 1993 NBA MVP relayed.\n\nRelated: Oscar Schmidt shares how beating Team USA after a miraculous 35-point second-half performance was 'the best part of his life'\n\nFriends losing their jobs\n\nWith the NBA agreeing on a brand-new $76 billion broadcast deal with ESPN/ABC, NBCU, and Amazon Prime Video, TNT will lose its NBA broadcasting rights after the 2024-25 season. The news also means that 'Inside the NBA' will likely end on TNT. While this development will not mean the end of Barkley's media career, he feels crappy about the uncertain futures of his co-workers.\n\n\"I was taking everybody out, trying to keep their spirits up, and they were like, 'Man, I'm married.

I was like, 'Man, I ain't never been in that situation in my life where I was going to lose my job, and I had a family to take care of.'\"\n\nWhile Charles and the rest of the 'Inside the NBA' crew enjoy their last dance, Barkley stresses that next season will be a \"bittersweet year,\" knowing full well that his colleagues may not find work elsewhere. While he may be financially secure, he knows that many of his co-workers are not as fortunate.\n\nRelated: \"There's probably going to be 200 people who lose their jobs\" - Charles Barkley on his main concern about TNT losing NBA TV rights", "source": {"uri": "postandcourier.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Post and Courier"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jonas_panerio@postandcourier.com", "name": "Jonas Panerio", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inside_the_NBA", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Inside the NBA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Barkley", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Charles Barkley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ernie_Johnson_Jr.", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Ernie Johnson Jr."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenny_Smith", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Kenny Smith"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emmy_Awards", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Emmy Awards"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shaquille_O'Neal", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Shaquille O'Neal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TNT_(American_TV_network)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "TNT (American TV network)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Most_Valuable_Player_Award", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NBA Most Valuable Player Award"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_Awards", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Academy Awards"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_Prime_Video", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Amazon Prime Video"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_TV", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NBA TV"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN_on_ABC", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "ESPN on ABC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friends", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Friends"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USA_Network", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "USA Network"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Show_Basketball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Show Basketball", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 60}], "image": "https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/postandcourier.com/content/tncms/custom/image/6903687a-a7dc-11e9-896c-0bef6d6c9301.jpg?resize=600%2C314", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9794242", "eventUri": "eng-9794242", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.223529411764706, "wgt": 153, "relevance": 1}

He reflected on his 24-year tenure and the significant impact the show has had on his life and the lives of his colleagues. He shared his emotional struggle, knowing that the show might be coming to an end. The staff had a strong sense that this would happen, and it wasn't a well-kept secret.\n\n\"The people, because you got to understand some, if you've been at the same job for 24 years, when I got there, some of them people didn't have kids. Then you say, man, they graduated high school. Now they've graduated college. And you're like, man, the first time you came in here, you were like six years old.\"\n\n\"Then the next time I saw you, you were in high school going to the prom, then you were like off to college, and now they've all graduated from college. So these people become part of your family. We work one day a week doing the regular season.\"\n\n\"But during the playoffs, we like, we work like every night for like two straight months. If you see the same people for two straight months, you're like, for 24 years, you know them, you know their kids, you know their husbands, you know their wives.\"\n\n\"That's what I feel really s***y about. Because, you know, I was telling somebody the other night, we were sitting around smoking cigars, and I said, yo, man, this has been really depressing for me because we kind of knew we were going to lose the thing. I mean, it was one of the worst kept secrets in the history of civilization.\"\n\n\"We were traveling for the conference finals, and then we did a couple of games on NBA TV in the finals. I was taking everybody out, trying to keep their spirits up, and they were like, man, I'm married. I got a wife. I got kids. I got a mortgage. And I ain't got no job. It really hurt me that people of my friends was talking like that.\"\n\n\"And I was like, man, I ain't never been in that situation in my life where I was going to lose my job and I had a family to take care of. And it was really heartbreaking. It just really sucks, man. And I can't believe we screwed it up. So next year is going to be a bittersweet year.\"\n\nBarkley emphasized the deep bonds formed with his colleagues over the years. He mentioned that many of the staff members had started their families during their time on the show, watching their children grow up. The close-knit nature of the team made the potential end of the show even more poignant. Barkley found it heartbreaking to hear his friends express their fears about job security, something he had never personally experienced to that extent.\n\nBarkley also talked about the legal battle between TNT and the NBA regarding broadcasting rights.\n\n\"So we filed a lawsuit. What I think and I'm what I'm talking about. I think the NBA said you can match, but they met ESPN or NBC. You don't get the match the Amazon offer. I'm sure with Adam Silver... yeah, y'all had the right to match, but it had to match NBC or ESPN because when we said y'all could match, Amazon didn't exist.\"\n\n\"I don't think Adam would leave himself open to lose a lawsuit. He was a lawyer and I think he's too smart. We have filed a lawsuit, but I think the NBA is like, yes, too late, we don't care. You guys sued to get the Amazon package.\"\n\n\"But when we signed the original deal like six, eight years ago, y'all had to match NBC or ESPN, which is like another 500 million a year. And I think our people like, we're going to try to match the cheapest one. And Adam's like, yeah, that's not going to work. Y'all could match, but y'all had to match the bigger number.\"\n\n\"So I don't think Adam is dumb enough where he would open this up to lose that lawsuit. First of all, I'm not even sure why we sued. Hey, they want to break up with us. I don't want no woman who I gotta sue to say, hey, you gotta stay with me. No, all right, now kick rocks, girl.\"\n\nHe explained that TNT had filed a lawsuit to retain the rights to broadcast NBA games, competing against offers from other networks like ESPN and NBC. Barkley doubted the lawsuit's success, given NBA Commissioner Adam Silver's legal expertise and the unlikelihood of Silver making a mistake that could lead to a loss in court.\n\nReflecting on the situation, Barkley questioned the rationale behind the lawsuit, suggesting that if the NBA wanted to move on, perhaps it was better to let them. He expressed a pragmatic view, likening the situation to a relationship where one party wants to end things, implying that it might be better to accept the breakup rather than fight it.\n\nOverall, Barkley's reflections highlight the deep personal connections formed over the years and the complex emotions surrounding the potential end of \"Inside The NBA.\" He emphasized the familial bonds with his colleagues and the challenges they face as they contemplate an uncertain future.\n\nRelated: Charles Barkley Calls Out The NBA And Says That He Will Leave TNT If They Do Not Pay His $210 Million Contract In Full\n\nThank you for being a valued reader of Fadeaway World.

These people are so excited to have you in Philadelphia.\"\n\nBarkley played eight seasons of his NBA career with the 76ers and lives in the Philly area during the summertime. As a self-described \"diehard Sixer fan,\" he certainly joined in the fan base's excitement when the team added George on a four-year, $212 million contract in July. While on the podcast, the Hall of Famer also commended the Sixers' front office for their acquisitions of Caleb Martin, Andre Drummond, Reggie Jackson, and Eric Gordon.\n\n\"The Sixers have had the best summer of any team in the NBA,\" he said, echoing a sentiment he shared with The Inquirer last month in Tahoe. \" ... I cannot wait for the season to start.\"\n\n\" READ MORE: Charles Barkley rips the NBA, TNT files lawsuit after TV deals went to Amazon, NBC, and ESPN\n\nThough George doesn't appear to need much more advice on how to handle Philly fans -- he asked them to \"be as critical and as hard as you can\" in his introductory press conference last month, received some pointers from fan favorite Tyrese Maxey, and has already met some while out and about in the city -- Barkley offered his thoughts.\n\n\"I know you played in Indiana and they got a great fan base, but New York, Philly, and Boston -- they're different animals,\" Barkley told George. \"They love you, but they can turn to hate really quickly. But if you give 110 percent ... they're gonna love you. They want this team to win so badly.\"\n\nJoel Embiid's struggles for the United States in the Paris Olympics have already drawn plenty of criticism, and Barkley added to it during his discussion with George. He wants Embiid to take his second-half benching against Serbia, and his subsequent DNP against South Sudan, as fuel for the 2024-25 NBA season.\n\n\"I hope this is a wake-up [call] for Joel, this Olympic experience,\" Barkley said. \"He has not played well, and I'm hoping he's like, 'Yo, man, I gotta get in better shape. ... I gotta get healthy, because if we don't win the championship or go deep in the playoffs, it's going to be because of me.'\"\n\n\" READ MORE: Mike Sielski: Sitting Joel Embiid against South Sudan was the right thing for Team USA. Time for him to understand that.\n\nGeorge and Barkley, each former Olympians, can relate to Embiid's discomfort while finding a role on a star-studded team. George, who won a gold medal with Team USA at the 2016 Summer Olympics, says his limited offensive duties allowed him to expend more energy on defense. In a recent conversation with Embiid, George advised his new teammate to be open-minded this summer.\n\n\"Just try to find a way to stay engaged and challenge yourself in a different way than you would do in the NBA,\" George recalls telling Embiid. \"We had a good talk about that.\"\n\nBarkley drew a comparison between Embiid's roles with Team USA and the Sixers. The 2023 NBA MVP is one of several capable options on the American roster, and while that's a different dynamic than the one Embiid is used to in Philly, his supporting cast next season will be the best it has been in a long time. Barkley hopes Embiid's Olympic experience will help him settle into a reduced role alongside George and Tyrese Maxey.\n\n\"He can't mope around,\" Barkley said. \"He's gotta be like, 'OK, it's Paul's night. OK, it's [Maxey]'s night. What can I do when I don't get the ball?'\"\n\nBarkley also shared stories of his earliest encounters with the Sixers, which began in the lead up to the 1984 NBA draft. The Sixers had interest in selecting the Auburn product with the No. 5 overall pick, but Harold Katz, then the team's owner, wanted Barkley to shed a few pounds from the 300-pound frame he held coming out of college.\n\nBarkley lost the weight, but two days before the draft, his agent informed him that the Sixers were over the salary cap and thus would only be able to offer him a one-year contract for a mere $75,000.\n\n\"I'm like, 'Yo man, I didn't leave college for $75,000, that's crazy. ... Let's make sure the Sixers don't draft me,'\" Barkley recalls thinking. \"I went on an eating spree ... I fly into Philly, I'm like 299 [pounds]. The owner of the Sixers called me every name in the book. ... He put me on the train, we go up to New York ... I'm thinking I'm going to slip to six or seven and get me some good money.\"\n\n\" READ MORE: Charles Barkley praises Sixers for 'great summer,' and laments likely end of TNT's NBA broadcast rights\n\nThe Sixers drafted him anyway, and while that didn't please Barkley initially, it all worked out for him in the end. He impressed the team that summer, enough that they traded a couple of players so they could pay him a lucrative, multiyear contract.\n\nBarkley grew to be thankful that he landed in Philly. He called Billy Cunningham the \"best coach I've ever played for\" and commended the veterans on the team for taking him under their wing. He specifically credited Moses Malone for helping him through a difficult start to his rookie year, when Barkley was still out of shape and struggling to crack the Sixers' starting five.\n\n\"This whole thing changed my whole career,\" Barkley said of his relationship with Malone. \"One of the greatest players ever met me before practice, after practice, and he got me to lose 50 pounds. ... If it wasn't for Moses Malone ... I'd be working at McDonald's.\"\n\nBarkley finished his thought by imploring the 34-year-old George, who is entering his 15th NBA season, to be that same helpful veteran during his time with the Sixers.", "source": {"uri": "inquirer.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Philadelphia Inquirer"}, "authors": [{"uri": "ben_istvan@inquirer.com", "name": "Ben Istvan", "type": "author",

NBA", "body": "Charles Barkley didn't hold back his true thoughts about the lawsuit that Warner Bros. Discovery has filed against the NBA over its latest media rights deal.\n\nFor those who missed it, Warner Bros. Discovery--the parent company of TNT Sports---sued the NBA after it did not accept the matching offer the network gave for one of the packages in its upcoming 11-year media rights deal.\n\nWarner Bros. Discovery said it matched the $1.8 billion offer that Amazon gave as part of the media rights deal with NBC and ESPN. However, the league rejected the offer and said that the \"most recent proposal did not match the terms of Amazon Prime Video's offer.\"\n\nThat being said, the NBA signed a new media rights deal with NBC, ESPN and Amazon that is reportedly worth $78 billion over 11 years.\n\nWarner Bros. Discovery, however, quickly took action and said it will pursue its legal rights based on the contract it previously signed. The media giant has the right to match offers that the NBA receives, and it believes it has done so while the league says otherwise.\n\nWhen asked about the situation, however, Barkley admitted that it's unlikely NBA Commissioner Adam Silver is not aware of the contract rights of Warner Bros. Discovery.\n\n\"So I don't think Adam would leave himself open to lose a lawsuit. He was a lawyer and I think he's too smart. So your question is correct: we have filed a lawsuit, but I think the NBA is like, yes, too late, we don't care,\" Barkley shared during an appearance in the Podcast P With Paul George (presented by Wave Sports + Entertainment).\n\n\"You guys sued to get the Amazon package, but when we signed the original deal six, eight years ago, y'all had to match NBC or ESPN, which is like another 500 million a year and I think our people were like, we're going to try to match the cheapest one and Adam's like, yeah, that s**t's not going to work. Y'all could match, but y'all had to match the bigger number.\"\n\nCharles Barkley added that he's not \"not even sure why\" Warner Bros. Discovery sued, emphasizing that he doesn't think \"Adam is dumb enough where he would open himself up to lose that lawsuit.\"\n\nIt's certainly a complicated situation, and it remains to be seen how Warner Bros. Discovery will fight back. For now, however, it looks like the league is set to push through with its new media partners come the 2025-26 season.\n\nThe bad news is that it could mark the end of the popular show, Inside The NBA, that features Barkley, Shaquille O'Neal, Ernie Johnson and Kenny Smith.\n\nRelated: Dwyane Wade's Honest Take On Simone Biles, Jordan Chiles' Viral Move For Rebeca Andrade", "source": {"uri": "postandcourier.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Post and Courier"}, "authors": [{"uri": "angelo_guinhawa@postandcourier.com", "name": "Angelo Guinhawa", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warner_Bros._Discovery", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Warner Bros.

Amazon will officially take over as the NBA's new broadcast partner starting next season after the league accepted their massive $1.8 billion bid.\n\nThis only means that one of the basketball world's most-loved shows, Inside the NBA, will officially bid farewell once TNT's contract ends. As such, the 2024-25 season will serve as the farewell tour of Charles Barkley, Shaquille O'Neal, Ernie Johnson, and Kenny Smith.\n\nIn a recent appearance on Philadelphia 76ers superstar Paul George's podcast, Barkley shared his brutally honest thoughts on their show's looming finale. Clearly, the Hall of Famer is hurting over this tragic turn of events.\n\n\"So these people become part of your family,\" Barkley said of his co-workers on the program. \"I mean if you think about you've been working with the same people for 24 years. ... You know them, their kids, their husbands, you know their wives.\n\n\"This has been really depressing for me because we kind of knew we were going to lose the thing. I mean, it was one of the worst-kept secrets in the history of civilization.\"\n\nBarkley went on to share how he's been deeply affected by how the show's ending will significantly impact everyone who has been working on the show for the past two decades.\n\n\"They were like, 'Man, I'm married, I got a wife, I got kids, I got a mortgage and I ain't got no f**king job,' and it really hurt me,\" Barkley continued. \"It really hurt me that people-my friends was talking like that and I was like, 'Man, I ain't never been in that situation in my life where I was going to lose my job and I had a family to take care of and it was really heartbreaking.\n\n\"So that was painful and surreal for me and that hurt me the most. So it just really sucks, man and I can't believe we screwed it up. I can't believe we screwed it up. So next year's going to be a bittersweet year.\"\n\nThat's just tough to hear.\n\nYou can almost feel the guilt in Barkley's statement here over the fact that there's simply nothing he can do about the show coming to an end.\n\nApart from the fact that he will miss his job and his friends, what's even more depressing for Barkley is how all this will impact the families of the people who will be losing their jobs at the end of the upcoming season.\n\nRelated: Team USA Facing Intense Backlash Amid $15 Million Olympic Decision", "source": {"uri": "postandcourier.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Post and Courier"}, "authors": [{"uri": "paolo_songco@postandcourier.com", "name": "Paolo Songco", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_(company)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Amazon (company)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Barkley", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Charles Barkley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TNT_(American_TV_network)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "TNT (American TV network)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ernie_Johnson_Jr.", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ernie Johnson Jr."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenny_Smith", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kenny Smith"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inside_the_NBA", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Inside the NBA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shaquille_O'Neal", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Shaquille O'Neal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_George", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Paul George"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naismith_Memorial_Basketball_Hall_of_Fame", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philadelphia_76ers", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia 76ers"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Employment/Job_Search", "label": "dmoz/Business/Employment/Job Search", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Show_Basketball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Show Basketball", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work/Job_Sharing", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work/Job Sharing", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Employment", "label": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Employment", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 82}], "image": "https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/postandcourier.com/content/tncms/custom/image/6903687a-a7dc-11e9-896c-0bef6d6c9301.jpg?resize=600%2C314", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9794242", "eventUri": "eng-9794242", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.04313725490196074, "wgt": 139, "relevance": 1}

Interestingly, Paul George has gained recognition for his impressive Charles Barkley impression. What better way for the legendary Barkley to experience this tribute than by seeing it performed by the impersonator himself?\n\nPG-13 has been known to mimic the Round Mound of Rebound from time to time. One of the most iconic performances given by the nine-time All-Star was during his appearance on The Stephen A. Smith Show.\n\nAn old video of SAS and PG discussing the outcome of his former team turned into a hilarious one-minute span of the now-76ers star imitating the legend.\n\nHaving heard numerous stories of George's uncanny resemblance to Barkley's takes on live television, Smith got an absolute treat when he asked PG to give that answer in his best Charles Barkley impersonation.\n\nBeing drafted first overall by the Philadelphia 76ers back in 1985, Charles Barkley is a longtime supporter of the franchise. While he does rip the Sixers on their poor performances every now and then, Sir Charles seems to be quite optimistic about the team going forward, as per Inquirer.com.\n\n\"Now, they've just got to put it together. It's just on paper right now. It's got to work. Every season is different. And then, obviously, bringing [in that] many pieces, it's going to be an experiment. But, listen, they had a great summer.\"\n\nSpeaking on the 76ers being able to land George this summer, Barkley believes the team may be ready to cross all hurdles that have limited them in the past. However, it is still too early to speculate if this new core will work for Philly or not.\n\nPG is a versatile scorer who is a huge upgrade from Tobias Harris. Tyrese Maxey has developed into an All-Star guard that can score and facilitate the ball.

By then, the Sixers window in the 1980s was shutting. However, Barley singled out Sixers legend Moses Malone for his influence on Barkley's playing career.\n\nBarkley explained why Malone was such a good influence on him on new Sixer Paul George's podcast, \"Podcast P with Paul George.\" He brought up one story when they first became teammates on the Sixers.\n\n\"The best thing happened to me... was Moses Malone,\" Barkley said. \"I was not getting to play. I was fat and out of shape. I asked Moses one day...Moses, can I come see you after practice? He says, sure, young fella. I said, 'Moses, why am I not getting to play?' He says, 'Son, you fat and you lazy.' He said, 'Son, you got a lot of talent, but you can't work hard because you're so fat.'\n\nBarkley then explained how Malone's brutal honesty changed everything for Barkley.\n\n\"This whole thing changed my whole career. One of the greatest players ever met me before practice after practice, and he got me to lose 50 pounds and the rest is history.\"\n\nBarkley was known for being heavier-set compared to most NBA stars. However, because he was an excellent athlete despite his mass, that played a role in why he became an NBA legend. Malone clearly helped him not get too heavy.\n\nBarkley also explained that had it not been for Malone, his career may have been different. He thinks he may have fallen so far off that he would have had to work a blue-collar job.\n\n\"If it wasn't for Moses Malone, man, I have zero idea. I'd be working at McDonald's, but that guy who was already one of the all-time greats. He took me on his wing. He worked with me every day before practice, after practice, he got me from 300 to 250 [pounds] and like I say, the rest is history. That's the best thing that ever happened to me in my NBA career- Moses Malone.\"\n\nMalone and Barkley played together from 1984 to 1986 before the Sixers traded Malone to Washington. The Sixers then traded Barkley to Phoenix in 1992, and Malone came back the following season. Malone won a title with the Sixers in 1983, while Barkley only made the NBA Finals once with the Suns in 1993.\n\nThough their efforts led to one title in Philadelphia, both Barkley's and Malone's numbers are retired by the Sixers. Both of them won multiple accolades during their time with the Sixers, including Most Valuable Player, though Barkley won it with the Suns.\n\nBarkley made the Eastern Conference Finals with the Sixers back when he was teammates with Malone on the Sixers. They lost to the Boston Celtics that year in 1986. Barkley never got that close again with the Sixers, but he played long enough for the franchise to keep them in the playoffs.\n\nFrom the horse's mouth, Barkley may not have become the legend he did without Malone's help.", "source": {"uri": "heavy.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Heavy"}, "authors": [{"uri": "matt_john@heavy.com", "name": "Matt John", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_George", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Paul George"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moses_Malone", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Moses Malone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Barkley", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Charles Barkley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naismith_Memorial_Basketball_Hall_of_Fame", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philadelphia_76ers", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia 76ers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Conference_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NBA Conference Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Most_Valuable_Player_Award", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NBA Most Valuable Player Award"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NBA Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Celtics", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Boston Celtics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McDonald's", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "McDonald's"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phoenix,_Arizona", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Phoenix, Arizona"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Phoenix, Arizona"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philadelphia", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Show_Basketball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Show Basketball", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 69}], "image": "https://heavy.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/GettyImages-2153107950-e1722891704340.jpg?quality=65&strip=all&w=780", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9794242", "eventUri": "eng-9794242", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1372549019607843, "wgt": 122, "relevance": 1}

Charles Barkley isn't a lawyer, but he certainly has opinions on the lawsuit that TNT's parent company, Warner Brothers Discovery, filed against the NBA after the league rejected its matching offer for Amazon's upcoming broadcast package.\n\n\"I don't think Adam [Silver] would leave himself open to lose a lawsuit,\" Barkley said on Podcast P with Paul George. \"He was a lawyer. I think he's too smart so ... we have filed a lawsuit, but I think the NBA is like, 'Yeah, it's too late, we don't care. You guys sued to get the Amazon package, but when we signed the original deal like six, eight years ago, y'all had to match NBC or ESPN,' which is like another $500 million a year. I think our people were like, 'we're going to try to match the cheapest one' and Adam's like, 'yeah that s---'s not going to work, y'all could match but y'all had to match the bigger number.'\n\n\"I don't think Adam is dumb enough where he would open himself up to lose that lawsuit, so I'm not even sure why we sued,\" Barkley added. \"Hey, they want to break up with us. I don't want no woman who I gotta sue to say, 'Hey, you got to stay with me.' Hey, kick rocks, girl.\"\n\nDuring the podcast with George, Barkley also addressed whether another version of Inside the NBA could be replicated.\n\n\"I don't know if anybody ever gives it a chance, to be honest with you,\" said Barkley. \"ESPN, which I love, they never give anybody a chance to get any chemistry. They're all just kind of throwing stuff at the wall. Like, 'let's put this group together' and they'll do that for like six months to a year and then they're like, 'it didn't work well.' You didn't give it a chance to work.\"\n\n2. As a lifelong wrestling devotee, a sports media person who remembers Deadspin's glory days and a fan of Ben Affleck and Matt Damon movies, this sounds absolutely glorious.\n\n\"Gus Van Sant-who previously directed Damon and Affleck in Good Will Hunting from the pair's Oscar-winning script-is in talks to helm Killing Gawker. Affleck has been circling the role of Hogan, according to media reports, although casting decisions have not been finalized.\"\n\n3. I mentioned in Traina Thoughts last week that I was surprised the White Sox' losing streak was getting so little attention. I also threw out a tweet about it over the weekend.\n\nThings seem to be picking up a little steam now, though, with Chicago dropping 21 in a row and the MLB record of 23 straight losses within sight.\n\nIf the White Sox set the record with a 24th consecutive loss, it would come Friday when they host the Cubs. In a beautiful sense of irony, the White Sox are scheduled to have a fireworks show after Friday's game.\n\n4. Here's some broadcasting news regarding the Peacock-exclusive NFL game in Week 1, featuring the Packers and Eagles on Friday night from Brazil.\n\n5. This is why Chris \"Mad Dog\" Russo is a radio Hall of Famer. He can turn helping his son set up a new apartment into riveting content.\n\n6. The latest episode of SI Media With Jimmy Traina features an interview with Puck sports correspondent John Ourand.\n\nOurand discusses the latest news regarding the NBA refusing Warner Bros. Discovery's matching offer for Amazon's television package and WBD subsequently filing a lawsuit against the league.\n\nWill this ever go to trial? Why did the NBA want to move on from WBD after a 30-plus year relationship? Why did WBD let the NBA negotiate with outside companies? Ourand tackles all those questions.\n\nIn addition, Ourand handicaps the Barkley sweepstakes that will take place between Disney/ESPN, NBC/Peacock and Amazon. Or will WBD try to keep Barkley in the fold since he's still under contract for seven more years after the 2024-25 season?\n\nFollowing Ourand, Sal Licata from WFAN radio and SNY TV in New York joins me for our weekly \"Traina Thoughts\" segment. This week, we discuss Major League Baseball not having a national voice, ignorance when it comes to the Olympics and HBO's Pete Rose documentary. In addition, I read SI Media With Jimmy Traina Apple reviews for the month of August.\n\n7. RANDOM VIDEO OF THE DAY: George used Barkley's appearance on his podcast to show off his pretty solid Barkley impression.\n\nBe sure to catch up on past editions of Traina Thoughts and check out the Sports Illustrated Media Podcast hosted by Jimmy Traina on Apple, Spotify or Google.

The NBA will \"likely settle the case for a monetary amount, rather than any future broadcasting rights.\" The \"only alternative is going to trial,\" which \"could potentially cost far more in legal fees than whatever amount WBD would accept as a settlement.\" What will be \"more fascinating to watch, however, is what happens beyond this lawsuit,\" as other parent companies with linear cable subsidiaries \"attempt to ink future deals\" (FAST COMPANY, 8/3).\n\nTOO SMART: TNT analyst Charles Barkley -- who previously called out the league for rejecting WBD's match proposal -- \"admitted that it's unlikely\" NBA Commissioner Adam Silver was \"not aware of the contract rights\" of WBD before making the decision to go with Amazon.

During a recent appearance on Podcast P with Paul George, Barkley stated he hopes that these showings in the Olympics serve as a wake-up call for the seven-time All-Star.\n\n\"I hope this is a wake-up for Joel, this Olympic experience,\" Barkley said. \"He has not played well, and I'm hoping he's like, 'Yo man, I got to get in better shape.' Because me, personally, I think that's one of the reasons he's always injured. I don't think he's in good enough shape, but I think the way he's played -- which is not well during the Olympics -- should be a wake-up call for him.\n\n\"Like, 'You know what? I got to get in better shape. I got to get healthy because if we don't win the championship or go deep in the playoffs, it's going to be because of me.' And he's been -- he keeps getting hurt,\" Barkley stated. \"And like I said, he's got to take some responsibility for that.\n\n\"Bringing in you, (Tyrese) Maxey's a stud, bringing all those other guys -- if Joel don't do his thing, the Sixers are not going to win,\" Barkley added. \"And like I say, he has not played well in these Olympic Games at all.\n\n\"I'm hoping somebody can get to him say, 'Yo man, you need to get in better shape, because the way you play in the NBA, when we just going up and down the court, pound inside, number one, you can't win like that consistently in the NBA today, but also, you got to be a little bit embarrassed the way you played in the Olympics,'\" Barkley concluded.\n\n(starts at 2:24 mark):\n\nBarkley makes some interesting points and there is one I completely agree with. If the Philadelphia 76ers once again fail to get out of the second round, Embiid will get all the blame. This is the best team he has ever had and it's time for him to show why he is regarded as one of the best players in the NBA.\n\nAs for Embiid not being in shape, I am not sure that's all that accurate. He was out for two months with a lateral meniscus injury in his left knee earlier this year and was not 100% when he made his return.\n\nEmbiid's knee was clearly bothering him in the first round series against the New York Knicks as well and I think he is just being very cautious at the Olympics. While I get the allure of wanting to win a gold medal, I am not sure playing at this event was a great idea.\n\nEmbiid's injury history and the fact that he wasn't 100% at the end of the season make me think he should have just rested this offseason. If the 30-year-old suffers an injury during the 2024-25 campaign, you better believe that this decision to play in the Olympics would be criticized.\n\nAs for Embiid's play in Paris, he is averaging only 9.5 points, 2.5 rebounds, 1.0 assists, and 1.5 blocks per game. The 2023 MVP has also shot just 42.1% from the field and 20% from beyond the arc. Maybe Embiid will step up in the knockouts to silence the critics but I am not all too optimistic about that.\n\nRelated: Paul George Advised Joel Embiid On How To Succeed For Team USA In The Olympics\n\nThank you for being a valued reader of Fadeaway World.

Charles Barkley isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t a lawyer, but he certainly has opinions on the lawsuit that TNT\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s parent company, Warner Brothers Discovery, filed against the NBA after the league rejected its matching offer for Amazon\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s upcoming broadcast package.\n\n\u00e2\u20ac\u0153I don't think Adam [Silver] would leave himself open to lose a lawsuit,\u00e2\u20ac Barkley said on Podcast P with Paul George. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153He was a lawyer. I think he's too smart so \u00e2\u20ac| we have filed a lawsuit, but I think the NBA is like, \u00e2\u20ac~Yeah, it's too late, we don't care. You guys sued to get the Amazon package, but when we signed the original deal like six, eight years ago, y'all had to match NBC or ESPN,\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 which is like another $500 million a year. I think our people were like, \u00e2\u20ac~we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re going to try to match the cheapest one\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 and Adam's like, \u00e2\u20ac~yeah that s---\u00e2\u20ac~s not going to work, y'all could match but y'all had to match the bigger number.\u00e2\u20ac\u2122\n\n\u00e2\u20ac\u0153I don't think Adam is dumb enough where he would open himself up to lose that lawsuit, so I'm not even sure why we sued,\" Barkley added. \"Hey, they want to break up with us. I don't want no woman who I gotta sue to say, \u00e2\u20ac~Hey, you got to stay with me.\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Hey, kick rocks, girl.\"\n\nDuring the podcast with George, Barkley also addressed whether another version of Inside the NBA could be replicated.\n\n\u00e2\u20ac\u0153I don't know if anybody ever gives it a chance, to be honest with you,\u00e2\u20ac said Barkley. \u00e2\u20acESPN, which I love, they never give anybody a chance to get any chemistry. They're all just kind of throwing stuff at the wall. Like, \u00e2\u20ac~let's put this group together\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 and they'll do that for like six months to a year and then they're like, \u00e2\u20ac~it didn't work well.' You didn't give it a chance to work.\u00e2\u20ac\n\n2. As a lifelong wrestling devotee, a sports media person who remembers Deadspin\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s glory days and a fan of Ben Affleck and Matt Damon movies, this sounds absolutely glorious.\n\n\u00e2\u20ac\u0153Gus Van Sant\u00e2\u20ac\"who previously directed Damon and Affleck in\u00c2 Good Will Hunting\u00c2 from the pair\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Oscar-winning script\u00e2\u20ac\"is in talks to helm\u00c2 Killing Gawker. Affleck has been circling the role of Hogan, according to media reports, although casting decisions have not been finalized.\u00e2\u20ac\n\n3. I mentioned in Traina Thoughts last week that I was surprised the White Sox' losing streak was getting so little attention. I also threw out a tweet about it over the weekend.\n\nThings seem to be picking up a little steam now, though, with Chicago dropping 21 in a row and the MLB record of 23 straight losses within sight.\n\nIf the White Sox set the record with a 24th consecutive loss, it would come Friday when they host the Cubs. In a beautiful sense of irony, the White Sox are scheduled to have a fireworks show after Friday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s game.\n\n4. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s some broadcasting news regarding the Peacock-exclusive NFL game in Week 1, featuring the Packers and Eagles on Friday night from Brazil.\n\n5. This is why Chris \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Mad Dog\u00e2\u20ac Russo is a radio Hall of Famer. He can turn helping his son set up a new apartment into riveting content.\n\n6. The latest episode of\u00c2 SI Media With Jimmy Traina\u00c2 features an interview with Puck sports correspondent John Ourand.\n\nOurand discusses the latest news regarding the NBA refusing Warner Bros. Discovery\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s matching offer for Amazon\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s television package and WBD subsequently filing a lawsuit against the league.\n\nWill this ever go to trial? Why did the NBA want to move on from WBD after a 30-plus year relationship? Why did WBD let the NBA negotiate with outside companies? Ourand tackles all those questions.\n\nIn addition, Ourand handicaps the Barkley sweepstakes that will take place between Disney/ESPN, NBC/Peacock and Amazon. Or will WBD try to keep Barkley in the fold since he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s still under contract for seven more years after the 2024\u00e2\u20ac\"25 season?\n\nFollowing Ourand, Sal Licata from WFAN radio and SNY TV in New York joins me for our weekly \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Traina Thoughts\u00e2\u20ac segment. This week, we discuss Major League Baseball not having a national voice, ignorance when it comes to the Olympics and HBO\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Pete Rose documentary. In addition, I read\u00c2 SI Media With Jimmy Traina\u00c2 Apple reviews for the month of August.\n\n7.

Mandatory Credit: Kyle Terada-USA TODAY Sports\n\nThe rest of the world may have improved drastically when it comes to basketball, but that has not changed Charles Barkley's expectation for Team USA.\n\nBarkley joined Wave Sports show \"Podcast P with Paul George\" for an episode that was published on Monday. During his interview with George, Barkley explained why he still expects the United States team to win a gold medal.\n\nBarkley acknowledged that some great players such as Giannis Antetokounmpo and Nikola Jokic play for foreign countries, but that still doesn't change that the U.S. has the best depth.\n\n\"We still got the next 10 best players in every game. Well probably 12. So this notion that yeah, the international teams, they have gotten better. They are, but we still got the best players in the world. When we go to our bench, there's nobody bringing a Jayson Tatum or Jrue Holiday or [Tyrese] Haliburton or Derrick White. Those foreign teams ain't bringing no dudes off the bench that good. I guarantee you that,\" Barkley said. \"Listen I don't even know every country, ain't nobody bringing nobody off the bench better than Jayson Tatum okay? Ain't nobody bringing anybody off the bench better than Kevin Durant. So this notion, yeah, the international teams have gotten better, but there's never an excuse for the United States not to win the gold medal. We got the best team, we got the best players by far.\"\n\nBarkley makes a great point. When it comes to the strength of the roster from top to bottom, other countries cannot compare to the U.S.\n\nThe knockout portion of the tournament begins on Tuesday at the Paris Olympics. The U.S. will face Brazil in the quarterfinals. Should they advance as expected, they are set to face the winner of the Serbia-Australia game in the semis on Thursday.", "source": {"uri": "larrybrownsports.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Larry Brown Sports"}, "authors": [{"uri": "larry_brown@larrybrownsports.com", "name": "Larry Brown", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Barkley", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Charles Barkley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warner_Bros._Discovery_Sports", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Warner Bros.

I'll tell them. You can't come back.\"\n\nBarkley won Olympic gold with the 1992 Dream Team in Barcelona and the 1996 Dream Team II in Atlanta. This year's team is being compared to the 1992 team with Michael Jordan, Magic Johnson and Barkley because of its star power, starting with LeBron James, Kevin Durant and Stephen Curry.\n\nTeam USA is the top seed heading into Tuesday's quarterfinals against Brazil (3:30 p.m. ET, 12:30 PT, NBC). Looking to win a fifth straight Olympic gold medal, the men's national team is facing more NBA players in the Olympics than ever before.\n\nThree of the five All-NBA first-team selections are on teams still vying for a gold medal in Paris - Milwaukee Bucks forward Giannis Antetokounmpo (Greece), Oklahoma City Thunder guard Shai Gilgeous-Alexander (Canada) and Denver Nuggets big Nikola Jokic (Serbia).\n\nJokic just won his third NBA MVP award, Antetokounmpo is a two-time MVP and Gilgeous-Alexander led the Thunder to the best record in the Western Conference this past season.\n\nThis isn't even counting Dallas Mavericks point guard Luka Doncic, who is from Croatia. He has made the All-NBA first team five straight seasons. Jokic, Gilgeous-Alexander, Doncic and Antetokounmpo were the top four MVP vote-getters this past season.\n\nStill, Barkley believes Team USA should always win Olympic gold no matter what.\n\n\"Have the international teams gotten better, 100%,\" Barkley said. \"They still not better than the United States. You take away Joker (Jokic) and Giannis and Luka. All three guys are great, great players. Shai is great also, but we still got the next 10 best players in every game.\"\n\nTeam USA won its three games in Olympic C group play by a total of 64 points and is favored to win the gold medal.\n\n\"Ain't nobody bringing anybody off the bench better than Jayson Tatum,\" said Barkley as Tatum made the All-NBA first team this past season.\n\nJaylen Brown and Tatum led the Boston Celtics to an NBA title this year.\n\n\"Ain't nobody bringing anybody off the bench better than Kevin Durant,\" Barkley continued. \"The international teams have gotten better, but there's never an excuse for the United States not to win the gold medal. We got the best team, we've got the best players by far.\"\n\nA win on Tuesday over Brazil could lead to a third matchup against Jokic and Serbia in the tournament semifinals Thursday.\n\nThe two quarterfinal matchups on the other side of the bracket have France taking on Canada and Germany facing Greece. The host country of the Olympics features 7-footers Victor Wembanyama and Rudy Gobert while Germany has rising NBA star Franz Wagner and veteran point guard Dennis Schroder.\n\nThe 7-foot-4 Wembanyama was the first overall pick in the 2023 NBA draft and is viewed as a generational talent. He won Rookie of the Year by a unanimous vote.\n\nGobert won NBA Defensive Player of the Year for a fourth time this past season.\n\nThe 6-10 Wagner led the Orlando Magic back to the NBA playoffs for the first time since 2020 along with Paolo Banchero while Schroder is entering his 12 NBA season.\n\nStill, Team USA should win gold, no matter what.\n\n\"I think Canada is probably one of the better teams that could give USA a real shot if they can put it together,\" George said. \"Top to bottom, their guard play is great, but they're just not big enough. You look at France, they got the size, but they don't have the guard play. You can't find teams internationally that can put it all together the way the USA team can. If we're locked in, there's not shot at USA losing.\"", "source": {"uri": "azcentral.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "AZ Central"}, "authors": [{"uri": "arizona_republic@azcentral.com", "name":

The network intends to knock its coverage out of the park, as relayed by Andrew Marchand of The Athletic.\n\nBetween NBC and Peacock, broadcasts of NBA games will be everywhere. NBC is returning to carrying the league for the first time since 2002, joining holdover ESPN/ABC and newcomer Amazon Prime in an 11-year deal with the NBA that is believed to be worth about $77 billion.\n\nMeanwhile, Warner Bros. Discovery and its TNT network have been left behind -- assuming their pending litigation against the NBA goes nowhere, as many suspect will be the case. Either way, that has nothing to do with NBC (only Amazon). So for NBC, it will be let the games begin in the fall of 2025.\n\n\"Besides the marquee events, such as six conference finals, the All-Star game and 'Sunday Night Basketball,' NBC will have Tuesday night national games where the East and West coast will receive different games that begin in prime time locally,\" Marchand wrote.\n\n\"On a given Tuesday, NBC could have a Knicks-Celtics game at 8 p.m. in New York, while the Lakers face the Nuggets at 8 p.m. Los Angeles time. All the matchups will be available via Peacock, which also will have exclusive games on Mondays.\"\n\nAs for TNT, the league contends it didn't actually match Amazon's portion of the package, as Amazon is a streaming provider. TNT can't offer the same type of platform, the league seemed to contend.\n\n\"Warner Bros.

He has given a stern warning to LeBron James and Co. ahead of their quarterfinal game against Brazil.\n\nDuring his appearance in 'Podcast P with Paul George,' the NBA Hall of Famer shared his honest belief and expectations on the team's star-studded roster.\n\n\"You take away Joker [Nikola Jokic], Giannis [Antetokounmpo] and Luka [Doncic]. Those three are all great players. Shai [Gilgeous Alexander] is great also.

Despite this strong showing, Paul George expressed some concerns about facing Canada in the Paris Olympics' knockout stage.\n\n\"I think they're probably one of the teams that could give the USA a real shot if they can put it together,\" Paul said.\n\nGeorge claimed that Canada's guard strength is strong. However, he also pointed out that the players are not \"big enough\" in size.\n\n\"Top to bottom, their guard play is great. But they're not big enough. You look at France. They have the size, but not the guard play. You can't find teams internationally that can put it all together the way the USA team can. If we're locked in, there's no shot at USA losing,\" he added.\n\nAfter securing the No. 1 overall seed with a perfect 3-0 record, Team USA is set to face Brazil in the first round of the knockout stages on August 6.", "source": {"uri": "totalprosports.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Total Pro Sports"}, "authors": [{"uri": "shabiha_akter@totalprosports.com", "name": "Shabiha Akter", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Barkley", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Charles Barkley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gold medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_George", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paul George"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naismith_Memorial_Basketball_Hall_of_Fame", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LeBron_James", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "LeBron James"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikola_Joki\u0107", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nikola Joki\u0107"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giannis_Antetokounmpo", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Giannis Antetokounmpo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Canada"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brazil", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Brazil"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Brazil"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada_men's_national_ice_hockey_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Canada men's national ice hockey team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-elimination_tournament", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Single-elimination tournament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "France"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Paintball/Teams", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Paintball/Teams", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Flying_Discs/Ultimate_Frisbee", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Flying Discs/Ultimate Frisbee", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Airsoft/Teams", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Airsoft/Teams", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 84}], "image": "https://www.totalprosports.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Barkley-James-1024x563.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9794242", "eventUri": "eng-9794242", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-06", "textStart": 1898, "textEnd": 1906}], "sentiment": 0.2941176470588236, "wgt": 105, "relevance": 1}

Mandatory Credit: USA TODAY Sports\n\nExcitement was at a fever pitch among fans when Team USA decided to send a roster full of NBA players for the first time to the Olympics in 1992. Their eagerness to catch a glimpse of the world's finest basketball players left Charles Barkley astonished.\n\nDuring an appearance on Podcast P with Paul George, the Hall of Famer shared some stories from his time in Barcelona with the Dream Team in 1992. When asked what was the wildest moment he witnessed, Barkley said,\n\n\"It was so crazy. When we were going to practice or going to a game... Probably 20 or 30 feet from the hotel, there were 5000 people out there for practice, for games, just screaming every time we left the hotel.\"\n\nHe revealed that fans were particularly desperate to catch sight of Michael Jordan, Magic Johnson, and Larry Bird. The two-time Olympic gold medalist added that the large gatherings everywhere the Dream Team went prompted organizers to beef up security around them. When fans couldn't get close to them, they came up with an ingenious plan to get the players' attention. Barkley said,\n\n\"Anytime we'd travel, we had two motorcycle guys on the side with machine guns. Had a guy in the front with a motorcycle with a guy in the back with a machine gun. Had two police cars in the front and the back and then we had a helicopter above the bus... Man, on the highway, there were hundreds of people holding up signs. It was crazy, like, woah.\"\n\nThe Dream Team cruised to the gold medal and became the most revered international team ever assembled. However, their impact goes beyond that. In an interview with Graham Bensinger, the 11-time All-Star revealed that several European NBA stars credited the 1992 roster for sparking their interest in basketball. Barkley said,\n\n\"I think [The Dream Team] changed the world. Because some of these guys, I talk to them today, whether it's Ginobili, Dirk Nowitzki, or Tony Parker. Guys like that, they said it made them play basketball. It was huge.\"\n\nThe Dream Team's cultural impact is irrefutable. Their sheer dominance and style of play turned basketball into a global sensation. They were among the marquee attractions at the 1992 Barcelona Olympics and lived up to the hype.\n\nWithout the Dream Team, we likely wouldn't have had an NBA dominated by European stars, like it is today, and a league full of stars from all across the globe.", "source": {"uri": "thesportsrush.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The SportsRush"}, "authors": [{"uri": "abhishek_dhariwal@thesportsrush.com", "name": "Abhishek Dhariwal", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Barkley", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Charles Barkley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic_Johnson", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Magic Johnson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_men's_national_basketball_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States men's national basketball team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Jordan", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Michael Jordan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Robinson", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "David Robinson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_George", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paul George"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Stockton", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "John Stockton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIBA_AmeriCup", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "FIBA AmeriCup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball_positions", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Basketball positions"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_national_baseball_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States national baseball team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patrick_Ewing", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Patrick Ewing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naismith_Memorial_Basketball_Hall_of_Fame", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Memorial_Coliseum", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USA_Today", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "USA Today"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puerto_Rico", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Puerto Rico"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Puerto Rico"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larry_Bird", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Larry Bird"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Olympic medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barcelona", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Barcelona"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Barcelona"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tony_Parker", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tony Parker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball_All-Star_Game", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball All-Star Game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gold medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dirk_Nowitzki", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dirk Nowitzki"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Show_Basketball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Show Basketball", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 93}], "image": "https://cdn-wp.thesportsrush.com/2024/08/5978e324-untitled-design-2024-08-06t210518.743.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9794242", "eventUri": "eng-9794242", "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1450980392156862, "wgt": 100, "relevance": 1}

He set his iPhone alarm to go off every half hour as he anxiously awaited the official news from the NBA.\n\nCordella maybe didn't need the alarm as his eager bosses and negotiating team were buzzing in with texts, asking if he had heard anything.\n\nAt 3 a.m. Paris time, Cordella's alarm woke him and he checked his phone. He received the text from the NBA's lead negotiator, Bill Koenig, informing him that TNT was making a play with its matching rights for Amazon Prime Video's streaming package, not NBC's. Cordella pumped his fist, called his bosses and some members of the deal team. Finally, he could go back to bed and sleep easy.\n\nThe network was back in the NBA business.\n\nJust as ESPN had swiped the NBA from NBC in 2002, NBC had done the same to TNT, buoyed by a surprise distribution plan and an eye-popping financial offer made in the league's 5th Avenue offices nearly four months earlier.\n\nBeing partners with the NBA is so vital in the future of media that the loser in the proceedings, the parent company of TNT Sports, Warner Bros. Discovery, is suing its still current partner, the NBA, in a Hail Mary attempt to stay involved. TNT, home to the wildly popular \"Inside the NBA,\" believes its matching rights from its current contract with the league should be enforced.\n\nThe implications of what has transpired over the last four months of haggling are magnified by the murky shape of media with cable in decline, streaming emerging, free broadcast networks, like NBC, born again as the top sports destinations, and uncertainty constant.\n\nWhile there is an intense focus on the digital giants taking over, there are few big toys -- save for UFC -- available anytime soon.\n\nWith the NFL locked up into next decade, this NBA deal would be basically the final one before \"The Great Rebundling\" over the next decade in which consolidation, mergers and acquisitions will very well decide the future of how fans access games well into the end of the century.\n\n\"If you look at what else is available, there is not much coming,\" Cordella said over the phone from Paris' Muss\u00e9e de l'Homme, where the \"Today Show\" set is located during the Olympics. \"This was clearly a big one.\"\n\nThe three agreements the NBA officially struck with ESPN, Amazon and NBC will result in the league receiving an extraordinary $77 billion over 11 years, beginning in 2025-26.\n\nIt is the exclamation point on ESPN chairman Jimmy Pitaro's six-plus-year run, where he has outlayed nearly $80 billion to create a sports rights moat as his network enters its full direct to consumer streaming era.\n\nIt establishes Amazon Prime Video as the clear biggest player in the future of sports viewing with the full-year of programming and realistic designs to one day have a Super Bowl and/or NBA Finals.\n\nAnd, nearly a quarter century after Bob Costas, Marv Albert and John Tesh's \"Roundball Rock\" said goodbye to the league, NBC/Peacock will go into this next stage with the triple threat of the NFL, the Olympics and now the NBA leading as it further tries to establish its streamer and broadcast network as year-round must watches.\n\nThe deals also will improve the WNBA's standing as its Finals will be spread between the three companies with ESPN maintaining five, while NBC and Amazon received three each. The WNBA also will have the ability to forge other agreements and eventually reopen talks with its three big partners if Caitlin Clark, Angel Reese and company continue to see their ratings skyrocket.\n\nToward the end of April, after TNT failed to reach an agreement with the NBA during an exclusive negotiating window, Comcast chairperson Brian Roberts was quickly on the phone with NBA commissioner Adam Silver, expressing NBC's interest in the rights to the leagues' games.\n\nShortly after, Comcast president Michael Cavenaugh, NBC Universal chairman Mark Lazarus and Cordella made the one-minute walk from their Rockefeller Center offices to the NBA's on 5th Avenue.\n\nAt this point, the NBA already had a framework agreement with one incumbent, Disney's ABC-ESPN to retain the Finals, while a newly formed streaming rights deal was being locked up by Amazon Prime Video.\n\nWhile NBA executives, led by Silver and its president of global content and media distribution, Koenig game-planned for years of what could happen during negotiations, NBC surprised the league, according to executives briefed on the discussions.\n\nSitting across from the NBC team in the NBA's offices, Silver, Koenig and their lieutenants listened to NBC's pitch as talks took off.\n\nNot only did NBC topple TNT's best offer of slightly more than $2 billion, but also NBC put on the table more than it pays the NFL. The $27 billion deal over 11 years ($2.45B a season) is larger than the $22 billion the NFL receives for the same length of time.\n\nIn addition, NBC made available to the NBA two prime-time windows. The NBA executive team, according to those briefed on their thinking, thought NBC would want to add \"Sunday Night Basketball\" after its No. 1 rated in prime time, \"Sunday Night Football,\" but the NBA was pleasantly surprised that Comcast also had a special, national/regional hybrid plan for the NBA on NBC on Tuesdays throughout the season.\n\nBesides the marquee events, such as six conference finals, the All-Star game and \"Sunday Night Basketball\", NBC will have Tuesday night national games where the East and West coast will receive different games that begin in prime time locally.\n\nOn a given Tuesday, NBC could have a Knicks-Celtics game at 8 p.m. in New York, while the Lakers face the Nuggets at 8 p.m. Los Angeles time. All the matchups will be available via Peacock, which also will have exclusive games on Mondays.\n\nComcast's idea is to combine the NFL, the NBA/WNBA, the Olympics, Premier League and the Big Ten on Peacock to prevent churn, creating a must-have product for the whole year.\n\n\"Our portfolio of sports on Peacock is incredibly robust,\" Cordella, who played college hoops at Providence under Pete Gillen, said. \"You add the NBA to it. I'm a sports fan. You are a sports fan. It feels like a must-have. If you are a sports fan worth your salt, you need Peacock. You need NBC.\"\n\nThe network believes Peacock will add subscribers and they will stay. It thinks the streamer and the broadcast network will do well in the advertising market. It also hurt a rival, and the cable wing of Comcast could claw back affiliate fees from TNT.\n\nThe fear of TV executives for years was that the behemoth digital players -- Amazon, Apple, Netflix, Google/YouTube -- would just start buying all the rights. But with this NBA round completed, it is clear that Amazon Prime Video is the one that will be a huge part of sports fans' lives now and for the foreseeable future.\n\nThe others have dipped their toes in without fully committing and now will be largely shut out, save for a Christmas Day doubleheader (Netflix) and a Sunday Ticket sale (Google) and smaller leagues (Apple/MLS).\n\nWith Amazon's 11-year, near $20 billion deal for the NBA and WNBA, it now has major sports programming throughout the year. The NBA/WNBA joins \"Thursday Night Football\" and NASCAR as part of Amazon's Prime \"Free Shipping\" $139 per year subscription.\n\n\"The model is working,\" Jay Marine, Amazon Prime Video's global head of sports, told The Athletic.\n\nWhen Amazon was invited to join ESPN and TNT Sports in the exclusive negotiating window early, prior to the late April deadline, Marine and his team showed up with plans as quickly as one of Amazon's ubiquitous boxes appear on doorsteps. They expediently sealed a deal, including the worldwide rights to \"League Pass,\" in which fans can directly buy their favorite team's games. They also will be the home of the WNBA Finals three times over the 11 years.\n\nOnly two years into Amazon's NFL deal, the streamer already was a proven performer to NBA executives. When strong \"Thursday Night Football\" ratings would arrive, Koenig would text Marine congratulating him. The NBA and Amazon leaders further forged a relationship due to the streamer's WNBA coverage and its deal to show the NBA in Brazil.\n\nThe global reach of Amazon also made the company an ideal partner for the NBA, which has focused on the international scene since late commissioner David Stern led the operation.\n\nMarine loved the fit with the NBA, but also was very cognizant that, besides UFC, this was the last big deal and that the NBA would likely seek a very long-term contract.\n\n\"One of the things we talked about on this NBA deal is that, while it is an 11-year deal, we think about it more like a 30-year deal,\" Marine said. \"We want a three-decade, four-decade-plus relationship with the NBA. And we view this deal as kind of just the first chapter.\"\n\nAmazon already has convinced the NBA it is worthy of hosting conference finals six times and has grand designs for the future.\n\n\"I was asked the other day, 'Would you ever want to broadcast the Super Bowl?'' Marine said. \"And I've never answered yes so quickly in my life. And do I see that being a reality at some point.\"\n\nDuring Pitaro's six-plus years leading ESPN, he has gotten what he has wanted in the sports rights game. Pitaro, a diehard Yankee fan, has been on a shopping spree akin to George Steinbrenner in his heyday. The multi-path plan has been designed to beat away potential newcomers, protect its declining, but lucrative cable business and forge ahead with the dawn of ESPN's streaming era.\n\nPitaro has built a sports rights moat by doling out nearly $80 billion - that's a b for billions - in new deals with the NFL, college football playoff, MLB, SEC, NCAA, NHL, PGA, Wimbledon, La Liga and now the NBA.\n\nOne rival executive called ESPN's suite of rights, \"the greatest in the history of sports television.\"\n\nIt continues to not be cheap. The just-signed NBA contract is for that quaint sum of 11 years and $28.8 billion. ESPN's current NFL contract, which includes two Super Bowls and 25 games a year, mostly on Monday Nights, is for 10 years and $27 billion.\n\nABC/ESPN retained the Finals every year, while keeping a conference final for each season except for one. It also believes it added value for its soon-to-arrive full ESPN direct-to-consumer product with a Red Zone type show on its game nights and, internationally, where it can stream its games on Disney+. It will remain the top home for the WNBA with five of its Finals over the 11 years.\n\nWhile ESPN will attempt to retain the UFC and is expected to use or threaten to trigger an opt-out in its MLB contract that is due after next season, it is largely done for the moment, according to executives briefed on its plans.\n\nThe NFL's opt-out on ESPN's deal is after the 2030-31 season, while the network's and Amazon's are up following the 2029-30 year. So ESPN has a slightly longer runway with the most important league rights, allowing it to move into streaming with the NFL and NBA leading the way.\n\nThe network has also discussed equity deals with both leagues that would see either or both have a stake in ESPN. Those talks could heat up again relatively soon.\n\nWhile ESPN is looking to the future with streaming, it wants to maintain its linear carriage agreements, which are for $10-plus a month, still a great business even if the current 66.5 million homes are way fewer than the 100 million from 2011.\n\nESPN has upcoming negotiations with Comcast, YouTube TV, DirecTV and Verizon Fios over the next two years, and it always planned to have top NBA games, along with the NFL and college football, to stack its deck.\n\nWhile the digital players outside of Amazon mostly sit on the sidelines, ESPN is about to make a big pitch to be the solution for sports fans without cable.\n\nIn the fall, the start of \"The Great Rebundling\" in partnership with Fox Sports and TNT Sports, ESPN will debut Venu Sports, a direct-to-consumer subscription service that will cost $42.99 per month.\n\nIn 2025, it will bring ESPN, the mothership, to consumers directly with its own offering that will cost $42.99 per month. Pitaro has structured all the new rights deals so ESPN's entire programming lineup can be available to customers without a cable subscription.\n\nFans also can access ESPN through places such as YouTube TV, which can be had for $70-$75 and offers a larger collection of channels than Venu will. The billion dollar moat has been built so ESPN can meet customers at different price points to access its games.\n\nTNT knows this is very well its final season with the NBA. Over its 35 years, it has built arguably the greatest sports studio show of all-time, centered around Charles Barkley. It is proceeding with the litigation in which it claims it has the right to match Amazon Prime Video's package and continue with the NBA. It knows potentially losing the NBA is a huge blow to its portfolio.\n\nWhile it is blaming the NBA and seems desperate to keep it, two years ago, Warner Bros. Discovery's CEO David Zaslav told an investors conference, \"We don't have to have the NBA.\" The network didn't get a deal done during the exclusive negotiating window, allowing NBC to blindside it by making a financial and reach offer that exceeded what TNT had put forth. W\n\nTNT's view of the NBA negotiations basically comes down to it believes it was Charlie Brown and the NBA was Lucy, moving the football at the last moment whenever a deal was close. The NBA looks at it differently and was prepared to never give NBC the opportunity if the TNT numbers were right. A judge will have a say about how it all works or maybe the parties will settle for some sort of rights and/or financial package.\n\nBut TNT is not putting \"Going Out of Business\" signs on its Atlanta studios. Barkely told The Athletic that his contract is for 10 years and $210 million. TNT, with or without the NBA, is determined to figure out a way to utilize him and not let him go elsewhere.\n\nIt has made moves over the last 10 months to try to fortify its lineup. It spent in excess of $25 million per game for a couple of first round College Football Playoff games in a sublicense agreement with ESPN. It added the French Open at $65 million a tournament. Big East men's and women's hoops and Mountain West football are going to be on TNT. They are singles and doubles compared to the home run of the NBA.\n\nTNT already has deals for MLB and the NHL, including significant playoff action. United States men's and women's soccer, as well as NASCAR, are on its air. TNT Sports are aligned with ESPN and Fox with the Venu Sports direct-to-consumer streaming service. The company is trying to turn TruTV into something equivalent to ESPN2.\n\nThough Warner Bros. Discovery is in debt, it seemingly has billions in its vault that was headed to the NBA's Fifth Avenue offices. It will need to be creative to grow, perhaps leaning on more sub-licensing to fill out its programming roster.\n\nAs far as the NBA, TNT left the door ajar, allowing NBC and Amazon to walk in and partner with the league, in the potential last market-moving deal of the sports media decade.\n\nAmazon and NBC joined ESPN, forming the NBA's new Big Three, believing the league was a must-have, an unusually available powerful commodity. Cordella was willing to wake up through the night to confirm it was official. Marine wants Amazon in business with the NBA for decades. Pitaro never looked back in keeping the \"A\" package.\n\nIt will be three presidential elections before the NBA rights are conceivably available again. The corporate winners and losers during the forthcoming media reckoning very well may be decided by then.", "source": {"uri": "nytimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New York Times"}, "authors": [{"uri": "andrew_marchand@nytimes.com", "name": "Andrew Marchand", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_Prime_Video", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Amazon Prime Video"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peacock_(streaming_service)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Peacock (streaming service)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TNT_(American_TV_network)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "TNT (American TV network)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adam_Silver", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Adam Silver"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broadcast_network", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Broadcast network"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comcast", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Comcast"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women's_National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Women's National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cable_television", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cable television"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "ESPN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streaming_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Streaming media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBC", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "NBC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warner_Bros._Discovery_Sports", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Warner Bros.

The Americans won all three of their games in group play convincingly, and now, they're set up nicely for a run to the championship game, as they would play Brazil in the quarters and either Australia or a Serbia team they already beat in the semis.\n\nAll of this is coming in a tournament that was billed as a potentially serious challenge for the United States, which has won gold in each of the last four Summer Olympics. Perhaps that will still end up being the case, but on the latest episode of Podcast P, both Charles Barkley and Paul George expressed their belief that the U.S. should be able to take care of business -- and if not, Barkley said, something serious needs to happen.\n\n\"Have the international teams gotten better? One-hundred percent,\" Barkley said. \"They still not better than the United States. You take away Joker, and Giannis, and Luka, all three guys are great, great players. Shai is great, also. But we still got the next 10 best players in every game. Ain't nobody bringing nobody off the bench better than Jayson Tatum, ain't nobody bringing anybody off the bench better than Kevin Durant. The international teams have gotten better, but there's never an excuse for the United States not to win a gold medal. We got the best team, we got the best players, by far.\"\n\nGeorge then identified Canada as a team that can challenge the U.S. due to their guards, but expressed his belief that they don't have enough size. He said the inverse about France, which has great bigs but guards that really struggle.\n\n\"You can't find teams internationally that can put it all together the way a USA team can,\" George said. \"If we're locked in, there's no shot that USA loses.\"\n\n\"Listen, if they lose, we can't let 'em back in the country,\" Barkley replied. \"We can't. I told 'em, they can't come back.\"\n\nI think that is a joke by the Chuckster, but frankly, I am not sure.", "source": {"uri": "uproxx.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "UPROXX"}, "authors": [{"uri": "derrick_rossignol@uproxx.com", "name": "Derrick Rossignol", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "steven_hyden@uproxx.com", "name": "Steven Hyden", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "aaron_williams@uproxx.com", "name": "Aaron Williams", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "wongo_okon@uproxx.com", "name": "Wongo Okon", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Barkley", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Charles Barkley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gold medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serbia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Serbia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Serbia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brazil", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Brazil"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Brazil"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Australia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_George", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Paul George"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Summer_Olympic_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Summer Olympic Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jayson_Tatum", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jayson Tatum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_men's_national_basketball_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States men's national basketball team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Durant", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kevin Durant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "France"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Canada"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Paintball/Teams", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Paintball/Teams", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Flying_Discs/Ultimate_Frisbee", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Flying Discs/Ultimate Frisbee", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Softball/Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Softball/Organizations", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Airsoft/Teams", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Airsoft/Teams", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 81}], "image": "https://uproxx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/barkley-2.jpg?w=640", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9794242", "eventUri": "eng-9794242", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.5372549019607844, "wgt": 95, "relevance": 1}

He thinks that by adding PG, the Sixers have a real shot at winning next season's NBA title. But while Chuck was glad his former team added a legit superstar in George, he gave a brotherly warning to its franchise player, Joel Embiid.\n\n\"I hope this is a wake-up call for Joel -- this Olympic experience,\" Barkley said. He has not played well, and I'm hoping he's like, 'Yo man, I got to get in better shape' cuz I think that's one of the reasons he's always injured.\"\n\nBarkley's message to Embiid\n\nEmbiid's performances in the Paris Olympics have drawn plenty of criticism, with guys like Colin Cowherd saying JoJo is hindering Team USA's offense.\n\nThe 2023 NBA MVP has averaged 9.5 points, 2.5 rebounds, and 1.5 blocks in two games. Even though those numbers are solid, Embiid has looked sluggish every time he stepped on the floor.\n\n\"I don't think he's in good enough shape,\" added Barkley. \"But I think the way he's played, which was not well during the Olympics, should be a wake-up call for him, like, 'You know what? I gotta be in better shape. I got to get healthy because if we don't win the championship or go deep in the playoffs, it's going to be because of me.'\"\n\nLegler said that this could be the Sixers' year\n\nEmbiid has a long history of postseason failures, as he's never taken the Sixers past the second round of the NBA playoffs. But with George joining him and Tyese Maxey next season, ESPN's Tim Legler believes that the Sixers are a legit threat to win it all next campaign.\n\n\"If they don't figure it out with this group they never will because they have everything that they need now,\" Legler said. \"Anything short of the championship should be considered a disappointment. There is no question. The time is now. There'd been 41 parades in the NBA since the Sixers last had one. They're ready. The city is ready. They're ready to erupt...Philadelphia is a basketball city, and they are starving for a champion. They might finally have enough pieces to get that done.\"\n\nLas Vegas oddsmakers give the Sixers the third-best odds to win the 2025 NBA championship, with only the Boston Celtics and Denver Nuggets ahead. However, they will go as far as Embiid takes them. And for him to be the No.1 guy on a championship contender, the big man needs to be better.\n\nRelated: Rasheed Wallace suggests Joel Embiid focus on the Sixers, not Team USA: \"This NBA title is more important than getting that gold medal\"", "source": {"uri": "postandcourier.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Post and Courier"}, "authors": [{"uri": "shane_garry_acedera@postandcourier.com", "name": "Shane Garry Acedera", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joel_Embiid", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joel Embiid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Barkley", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Charles Barkley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_George", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paul George"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Legler", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tim Legler"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philadelphia_76ers", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia 76ers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point_guard", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Point guard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Most_Valuable_Player_Award", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NBA Most Valuable Player Award"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NBA Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebound_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rebound (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rasheed_Wallace", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rasheed Wallace"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Celtics", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Boston Celtics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denver_Nuggets", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Denver Nuggets"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "ESPN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Las_Vegas", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Las Vegas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Las Vegas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philadelphia", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Show_Basketball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Show Basketball", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/postandcourier.com/content/tncms/custom/image/6903687a-a7dc-11e9-896c-0bef6d6c9301.jpg?resize=600%2C314", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9794242", "eventUri": "eng-9794242", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2705882352941176, "wgt": 92, "relevance": 1}

You answer, of course.\n\nThat's exactly what Eagles quarterback Jalen Hurts did when he was suddenly asked by Barkley during their recent practice: \"You think you're fearless?\"\n\nThe moment was caught during a mic'd up interaction between the two Eagles studs. Hurts gave a perfect answer, touting his resolve during tough situations.\n\n\"Fearless? Yeah, absolutely,\" Hurts said in response. \"You got some s*** you're gonna worry about but you have to check yourself. You either gonna pray or you're gonna worry. You can't do both.\"\n\nIn a report from NBC Sports Philadelphia, Barkley revealed his intention behind why he asked his new teammate the peculiar question. Apparently, he was inspired by a book he read recently, entitled \"Victory Favors the Fearless: How to Defeat the 7 Fears that Hold You Back.\"\n\n\"Whatever happens, adapt and be ready for whatever,\" said the 27-year-old Barkley. \"Trust in your faith. No need to have fear when you have faith. That's kind of the message that I took from the book.\"\n\nWhen asked if he was fearless as well, he gave a more introspective response.\n\n\"I think within your highs and lows, you're going to have those moments where you question yourself and you lose trust in your faith but you always gotta find a way to get back,\" Barkley added.\n\nA two-time Pro Bowler, Barkley signed a three-year deal with the Eagles last March. With the way he's connected with Hurts, also a two-time Pro Bowler, during training camp, it seems chemistry won't be a problem for them as they look to carry the Eagles.\n\nNow that's something their opponents should fear.\n\nRelated: Andy Reid Has Perfect Explanation For Surprise Guest At Chiefs Training Camp", "source": {"uri": "postandcourier.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Post and Courier"}, "authors": [{"uri": "paolo_mariano@postandcourier.com", "name": "Paolo Mariano", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philadelphia_Eagles", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia Eagles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Barkley", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Charles Barkley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jalen_Hurts", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jalen Hurts"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Quarterback"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saquon_Barkley", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Saquon Barkley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBC_Sports", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NBC Sports"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philadelphia", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andy_Reid", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Andy Reid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pro_Bowl", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pro Bowl"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kansas_City_Chiefs", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kansas City Chiefs"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Romance", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Romance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 91}], "image": "https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/postandcourier.com/content/tncms/custom/image/6903687a-a7dc-11e9-896c-0bef6d6c9301.jpg?resize=600%2C314", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9794242", "eventUri": "eng-9794242", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1137254901960785, "wgt": 92, "relevance": 1}

Stay ahead of the shifts impacting the media landscape and gain fresh strategies to drive platform growth. Save 20% on passes.\n\nOn July 26, WBD and TBS filed suit in New York against the NBA, NBA Media Ventures and NBA Properties, asserting that they exercised their \"matching rights\" by accepting an offer that the NBA was willing to extend to Amazon in a new media rights deal with the streamer, fellow newcomer NBCUniversal and current NBA broadcaster ESPN.\n\nWBD and TBS imply that this gives them the right to broadcast NBA games from the 2025-26 season through 2035-36 -- as they have for the past 40 years -- while the NBA claims WBD and TBS fell short of that match.\n\nThe complaint demands a jury trial to determine monetary damages and an injunction against the NBA deal with Amazon that also declares WBD and TBS' offer a \"match.\"\n\nWBD and TBS's complaint attempts to narrow its dispute over NBA media rights to \"cable rights.\" According to the complaint, these are \"the rights that TBS, ESPN, and NBA TV are granted under their current NBA agreements -- i.e., 'TNT Rights, ESPN Rights, [and] NBA TV Rights' -- as well as 'any other national cable network telecast rights to NBA game and related non-game programming.'\" It does so because, as it points out, it's up against Amazon Prime Video distribution that \"TBS could not match by telecasting the games on TNT and Max.\"\n\nDan Rozansky, a partner at the legal firm Stubbs Alderton & Markiles specializing in business, entertainment and media litigation, noted that matching rights can get tricky when their boundaries extend beyond time and money.\n\n\"Let's say that there's a buyer who's very creditworthy -- take somebody like Amazon, who has billions of dollars basically in the bank, and let's say somebody else comes along who has a matching right, but isn't as financially stable,\" Rozansky said. \"They could match on price, but what about these other factors? Does it matter that they're not as financially stable, can there be payment terms, does that mean that the price all has to be paid first, what's the length of time to close? That can be an issue if it's not exactly spelled out.\n\nWarner Bros. Discovery entered 2024 with roughly $45 billion in debt. Kenneth Suh, chief strategy officer for video and connected television advertising platform Nexxen, noted that Amazon would enter the NBA deal with diverse revenue streams and a Prime Video segment that still accounts for a relatively small percentage of Amazon's overall business. With the NBA and WBD disputing multiple facets of the contractual definition of \"match,\" broadcast reach and bankroll carry similar weight in the court battle to come.\n\n\"It's not just like the top-line number, but it's the structure of the financing,\" said Corey Martin, managing partner and chair of the entertainment finance practice at entertainment law firm Granderson Des Rochers.\n\nMartin added that if Amazon Prime Video does what's been reported, then it will essentially prepay or take a sum equivalent to three years -- or reportedly $1.8 billion per year -- of rights fees and put it in escrow. To match, WBD would need to do the same thing. \"So here's $6 billion in an escrow account and you draw down from it over three years -- good luck matching that.\"\n\nWBD and the NBA spent much of the week before the lawsuit in a back-and-forth over the definition of \"match.\" WBD claimed it had matched Amazon's portion of that deal, worth roughly $1.8 billion per year, according to the matching rights provision in its contract. However, the NBA refuted that statement while announcing its broader media rights deal with Disney's ESPN, NBCUniversal and Amazon.\n\n\"The challenge is to anticipate the unanticipated,\" Rozansky said. \"Let's say you did a media deal 30 years ago and there's a matching right and suddenly there are new technologies that aren't anticipated: The delivery of content over the internet, streaming to your cell phone, delivery of content through an app... delivery of content through a place where you buy most of your goods.\"\n\nThe NBA's perspective on its deal with Amazon suggests those unanticipated technologies and their global impact played a role. In a statement on the new partnerships, the NBA noted that its primary objective in deals was to maximize reach and accessibility. The last time it publicly released a tally of Amazon Prime members, Amazon put the count at 200 million worldwide at the end of 2021. According to research from Gitnux, the number of cable households in the U.S. is 75 million.\n\n\"Our new arrangement with Amazon supports this goal by complementing the broadcast, cable and streaming packages that are already part of our new Disney and NBCUniversal arrangements,\" the statement read.\n\nAfter the NBA unveiled its new media rights deals and Amazon's role in them, WBD announced it was taking the NBA to court due to the league's \"unjustified rejection of our matching of a third-party offer.\"\n\n\"We have taken legal action to enforce our rights,\" the statement continued. \"We strongly believe this is not just our contractual right, but also in the best interest of fans who want to keep watching our industry-leading NBA content with the choice and flexibility we offer them through our widely distributed WBD video-first distribution platforms -- including TNT and Max.\"\n\nTaking the stance that TBS is \"not required to accept terms that do not relate to cable rights,\" WBD couches its argument in the limited technologies of its original agreement. While WBD sees this as a \"match\" of Amazon's offer by that measure, Martin sees it as a counterproposal in a modern context.\n\n\"Only [WBD CEO and president] David Zaslav and his team know, but I think a lot of this has been gamesmanship from the outset,\" Martin said. \"Even the announcement that they 'matched'... I think they were being kind of cute because they probably knew that they didn't match but...put forth a counterproposal.\"\n\nIn a statement to ADWEEK, NBA spokesman Mike Bass said, \"Warner Bros. Discovery's claims are without merit and our lawyers will address them.\"\n\nRozansky noted that, from WBD's perspective, it has the matching right and known commodities like Inside the NBA and host Charles Barkley and could face a path through litigation similar to Scarlett Johansson's breach-of-contract suit against Disney over Black Widow's streaming launch and its ties to her compensation. Martin's \"best guesstimate, meanwhile,\" is that the case ends in a monetary settlement between WBD and the NBA. He predicts the NBA will still answer WBD's complaint, likely make a motion to dismiss and, if that isn't granted, enter a discovery phase in which things get interesting.\n\nWBD already included a 74-page copy of its previous deal with the NBA as an attachment to its 29-page complaint. What few people beyond the principal parties have seen is the rumored $1.8 billion-per-year Amazon deal and the exact terms WBD was asked to match. While the imbalance of streaming and linear offerings has already been noted, a look at the Amazon deal could also provide insights into how the deal addressed foreign markets -- where the NBA is more popular than any other U.S. sports export and where WBD offerings can't reach.\n\n\"Whether Warner Bros. Discovery's litigation is successful, as it pertains to the breach of contract claim that they brought, depends, on what the Amazon Prime Video deal looks like,\" Martin said. \"There's every reason to believe, and the signaling in this case indicates, that the NBA very carefully constructed this deal with all three partners -- Disney, NBCUniversal, and Amazon -- in such a manner that Warner Brothers Discovery would not be able to match.\"\n\nRegardless of how WBD's complaint resolves itself, Martin said it's likely already changed one important aspect of the NBA's media landscape.\n\n\"I'm gonna go out on a limb and say that I'm almost certain that there are no matching rights in any of these new agreements that they're entering into.\"", "source": {"uri": "adweek.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Adweek"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_Prime_Video", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Amazon Prime Video"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TBS_(American_TV_channel)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "TBS (American TV channel)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TNT_(American_TV_network)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "TNT (American TV network)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_(company)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Amazon (company)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cable_television", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cable television"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "ESPN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_TV", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "NBA TV"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBCUniversal", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "NBCUniversal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawsuit", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Lawsuit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Livestreaming", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Livestreaming"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injunction", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Injunction"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Damages", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Damages"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streaming_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Streaming media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Walt_Disney_Company", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Walt Disney Company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warner_Bros._Discovery", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Warner Bros.

They have added so much depth to their roster that it will be difficult to discard them as a title contender next season. However, Charles Barkley believes that there's still one missing piece in the puzzle. And that's Joel Embiid's form.\n\nSir Charles recently joined the newest star member of the 76ers, Paul George on Podcast P with Paul George. The Philly legend gave major props to the 76ers' management for getting the biggest draw in free agency, as well as other players who will help the team contend for the title. But that could be a tough journey judging by the poor performances that Embiid has had in the Olympics.\n\nBarkley said that the seven-time All-Star's failure in Paris should act as a wakeup call for him and the Philadelphia franchise as they can't afford to mess up another season.\n\nBarkley straight up told PG, \"I hope this is a wake-up [call] for Joel, this Olympic experience. He has not played well and I'm hoping he's like, 'Yo man, I gotta get in better shape.' Me personally, I think that's one of the reasons he's always injured.\"\n\nIn Chuck's assessment, Embiid is not adequately fit, which is why he often finds himself warming the bench due to injuries. Barkley said that there's a lot of scope for improvement as far as Embiid's physical conditioning is concerned and his failure in the Olympics should work as a sign for him to get in better shape.\n\nEmbiid has played two games so far in Paris, one against Serbia and the other against Puerto Rico. In the Serbia game, he played 11 minutes and had four points while shooting two of five from the field. The rest of his scorecard featured two rebounds, one block and no assists and steals.\n\nHe did redeem himself a bit in the last game with a 15-3-2 score line. But he shot 6-of-14 from the field.\n\nSir Charles believes that if the 76ers wish to have a real shot at the title next season, they will need their star player to be at his absolute best. Otherwise, they might fail to make any major impact in the league.", "source": {"uri": "thesportsrush.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The SportsRush"}, "authors": [{"uri": "prateek_singh@thesportsrush.com", "name": "Prateek Singh", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joel_Embiid", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joel Embiid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philadelphia_76ers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia 76ers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Barkley", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Charles Barkley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_George", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Paul George"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_All-Star_Game", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NBA All-Star Game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point_guard", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Point guard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_agent", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Free agent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philadelphia", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steal_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Steal (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assist_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Assist (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebound_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rebound (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serbia", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Serbia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Serbia"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Adventure", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Adventure", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Interactive", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Interactive", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Historical", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Historical", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://cdn-wp.thesportsrush.com/2024/08/3e2c627c-nba-2024-08-05t214519.770.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9794242", "eventUri": "eng-9794242", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.08235294117647052, "wgt": 91, "relevance": 1}

I'll tell them. You can't come back.\"\n\nThe U.S. come into the matchup with Brazil as massive favorites and will continue to be heavily favored in contests if they continue to advance.\n\nBarkley, who won two gold medals for the U.S. in 1992 and 1996, did acknowledge the increasingly impressive uptick in talent around the world, but ultimately still believes that America should reign supreme every four years.\n\n\"Have the international teams gotten better, 100%,\" Barkley said. \"They still not better than the United States. You take away Joker and Giannis and Luka. All three guys are great, great players. Shai is great also, but we still got the next 10 best players in every game.\n\n\"Ain't nobody bringing anybody off the bench better than Jayson Tatum. Ain't nobody bringing anybody off the bench better than Kevin Durant,\" Barkley explained, expanding on the overall roster talent gaps despite many countries possessing better top-end talent than ever before.\n\n\"The international teams have gotten better, but there's never an excuse for the United States not to win the gold medal. We got the best team, we've got the best players by far.\"\n\nThis is certainly an argument with much merit, as Tyrese Haliburton is an all-NBA level talent that has received sparse playing time thus far in group play - he would be a virtual lock to be a starting player if he were to represent any other country.\n\nAs for what we've already seen - Team USA has looked much more impressive in Olympic play compared to the exhibition phase, winning the three group contests by an average of 21.3 points per contest - and much of that has had to do with the contributions of the pair of current Suns stars.\n\nDevin Booker and Kevin Durant have both been vital pieces to the squad. Booker has started all but one game for the team over the last month, while Durant has taken on a sixth-man role and has been a ridiculously efficient scorer on low volume.\n\nIf the U.S. is to win today, they will be guaranteed to at least have a shot at the bronze medal - and a semifinal date with Serbia would be set for Thursday.", "source": {"uri": "si.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sports Illustrated"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Barkley", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Charles Barkley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Gold medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brazil", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Brazil"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Brazil"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_George", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paul George"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_national_baseball_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States national baseball team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phoenix_Suns", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Phoenix Suns"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Arizona_Republic", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Arizona Republic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-elimination_tournament", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Single-elimination tournament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phoenix,_Arizona", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Phoenix, Arizona"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Phoenix, Arizona"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jayson_Tatum", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jayson Tatum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Durant", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kevin Durant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyrese_Haliburton", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tyrese Haliburton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Devin_Booker", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Devin Booker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serbia", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Serbia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Serbia"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Paintball/Teams", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Paintball/Teams", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Airsoft/Teams", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Airsoft/Teams", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 60}], "image": "https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_crop,w_4382,h_2464,x_0,y_0/c_fill,w_1440,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/images/ImagnImages/mmsport/inside_the_suns/01j4m5xsjvttkgs7h9gj.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9794242", "eventUri": "eng-9794242", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Phoenix, Arizona"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3176470588235294, "wgt": 90, "relevance": 1}

Seemingly out of the blue. But somehow Hurts wasn't fazed.\n\n\"Fearless?\" Hurts answered in a mic'd up clip shared by the Eagles. \"Yeah. Absolutely. You got some s -- you're gonna worry about but you have to check yourself. You either gonna pray or you're gonna worry. You can't do both.\n\n\"God got it. God knows I work too. Shouldn't be s -- to fear when you done already put the work in. I come ready.\"\n\nBarkley seemed pleased with the answer.\n\nBut why did Barkley ask Hurts that question in the first place? The star running back said on Monday that he recently read a book called \"Victory Favors the Fearless\" -- full title: \"Victory Favors the Fearless: How to Defeat the 7 Fears that Hold You Back.\" It was on his mind and it's shaping his mindset in training camp.\n\nBarkley said he asked several teammates the same question but it just so happened that Hurts was mic'd up that day.\n\nWhat was Barkley's biggest takeaway from the book?\n\n\"My biggest takeaway from the book is being OK with adapting,\" Barkley said. \"And attack and adapt. That was the biggest thing that I took from it. That's how I want to focus on this whole camp, everything I do. If I'm messing up, if I'm making mistakes, do it full speed.\n\n\"Go out there and try to make plays, do it full speed, attack. And whatever happens, adapt and be ready for whatever. Trust in your faith. No need to have fear when you have faith. That's kind of the message that I took from the book.\"\n\nThe story in the book follows a fictional boxer named Mickey McGavin, a pro boxer struggling to overcome his fears during a series of ups and downs in his career.\n\nThe message really seemed to resonate with Barkley.\n\nThat was surprising and humbling news to author Darrin Donnelly when an email popped up in his inbox late Monday afternoon.\n\n\"I thought it was awesome,\" Donnelly said to NBC Sports Philadelphia on Monday evening. \"I couldn't believe it. Just real cool. And I saw a clip of it and how he was talking about the attack and adapt, the real central message of the book. I loved it. I thought it was great.\"\n\nDonnelly said Barkley nailed the takeaway from his book. One of the big themes was about attacking and adapting without fear of making the wrong decision.\n\nAnd that theme was actually inspired by a quote from late, great football coach Mike Leach, who was a big proponent of risk-taking. In fact, there's one quote from Leach's book \"Swing Your Sword\" that really stands out to Donnelly:\n\n\"When it comes to taking chances and sizing up risk, there are certainly some wrong decisions that get made, but they happen less often than you'd think. What affects an outcome more than anything else is effort and attitude.\"\n\nSo this is a message that went from football to boxing and now back to football again at Eagles training camp.\n\n\"That really always stuck with me,\" Donnelly said. \"When you think about it, if we're waiting for things to be just right before taking action, we're never going to do it. So it's all about weigh the pros and cons, make the best decision you can. Or if you're being blindsided by some change, there's nothing you can do about it. All you can do is worry about your attitude now. Adapt and attack.\"\n\n\"Victory Favors the Fearless\" is the fifth in Donnelly's series of seven Sports for the Soul books. Donnelly says these books are similar to business fables but all take place in the world of athletics.\n\nDonnelly had long been a reader of business and self-improvement books, but he also realized some of the best advice he had ever been given came from coaches, athletes and sports psychologists. And for good reason.\n\n\"They say 'be positive' and 'think big' and those sorts of things,\" Donnelly said. \"Well, what does that actually mean? And has that really been proven to change your results? And the answer is emphatically yes when you really study it.\"\n\nAfter six years of playing for the New York Giants, Barkley is now with the Eagles on a three-year deal to start a new chapter in his professional life. He's entering what could be a pivotal season in his career.\n\nTo turn the tables, does Barkley think he's fearless?\n\nYeah, he does.\n\n\"I think within your highs and lows,\" Barkley said, \"you're going to have those moments where you question yourself and you lose trust in your faith but you always gotta find a way to get back.\"\n\n\"I think the book illustrates a really good job of how to continue to try to improve every single day and get better. When you have that mindset and when you trust in the work you put in, you trust in the faith, you truly live your life and you go out in life in whatever your profession is and do it at a fearless level.\"", "source": {"uri": "nbcsportsphiladelphia.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NBC Sports Philadelphia"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Barkley", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Charles Barkley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/God", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "God"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boxing", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Boxing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jalen_Hurts", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jalen Hurts"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philadelphia_Eagles", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia Eagles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "American football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saquon_Barkley", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Saquon Barkley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Leach_(American_football_coach)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mike Leach (American football coach)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBC_Sports_Philadelphia", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NBC Sports Philadelphia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swing_music", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Swing music"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soul_music", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Soul music"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Giants", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "New York Giants"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Track_and_field", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Track and field"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Romance", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Romance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 82}], "image": "https://media.nbcsportsphiladelphia.com/2024/08/Barkley-Hurts-USATSI-23422408.jpg?quality=85&strip=all&resize=1200%2C675", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9794242", "eventUri": "eng-9794242", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1294117647058823, "wgt": 88, "relevance": 1}

Whereas teams before considered it an immense honor to share the floor with legendary American basketball players like Michael Jordan, Magic Johnson, and Larry Bird, now it's a chance for teams to prove themselves against the best in the world. And even though Team USA has still been dominant in the last four Olympic basketball tournaments, the competition's knockout format opens the possibility of an upset.\n\nCharles Barkley, a Hall of Famer and current basketball analyst, recently joked about the consequences for Team USA if they lost in the Paris Olympics. During an interview with Paul George, Chuck quipped that losing in the Olympics would mean not being able to come back to the country.\n\nInternational teams have gotten better\n\n\"Sir Charles,\" a two-time Olympic gold medal winner, is certain that foreign teams and their players have improved by leaps and bounds. You don't even have to look too far for proof of this, as some of the top NBA players are now from different countries. Giannis Antetokounmpo, Luka Doncic, and Nikola Jokic are all examples of international players who have risen to become superstars in the league.\n\nAt the same time, Chuck emphasized that despite this development, international squads still aren't better than Team USA.\n\n\"You take away Joker, Giannis, and Luka, all three of whom are great players. If I'm missing someone, let's not forget Shai -- Shai is great also. But we still have the next ten best players in every game, probably even 12,\" Barkley said on \"Podcast P.\"\n\nTeam USA's biggest strength in any international competition, especially the Olympics, is its depth. While the team starts superstars like LeBron, Steph Curry, and Devin Booker, the drop-off in talent -- if any -- is barely noticeable when the Americans go to their second unit, with All-Stars like Kevin Durant, Bam Adebayo, and Anthony Davis coming off the bench.\n\n\"When we go to our bench, there's nobody bringing a Jason Tatum or a Jrue Holiday or a Haliburton or a Derrick White. Those foreign teams aren't bringing dudes off the bench that are that good. I guarantee you that,\" Charles added. \"I don't know about every country, but ain't nobody bringing anybody off the bench better than Jason Tatum. Ain't nobody bringing anybody off the bench better than Kevin Durant.\"\n\nRelated: Oscar Schmidt shares how beating Team USA after a miraculous 35-point second-half performance was 'the best part of his life'\n\nNo excuse not to win the gold medal\n\nGeorge, a gold medal winner in the 2016 Rio de Janeiro Olympics, chimed in on the discussion, saying that while international teams have several fantastic players, the U.S. is the only team that has the complete package.\n\n\"When you look at it, Canada, in particular, has amazing guard play, and I think Canada is probably one of the better teams that could give USA a real shot if they can put it together. But top to bottom, their guard play is great, but they just aren't big enough,\" PG explained. \"You look at France; they've got the size, but they don't have the guard play. You can't find international teams that can put it all together the way the USA team can.\"\n\nChuck stopped short of guaranteeing gold for the United States and joked that Team USA must win the entire thing or risk not being welcomed back home.\n\n\"I just don't see how, if we're locked in, there's any shot at USA losing. If they lose, we can't let them back in the country. They can't come back because, with the team we've got, there's no excuse to lose the gold medal,\" Barkley said.\n\nWith a quarterfinal game against Brazil looming, the Americans must stay focused on the ultimate prize. If not, they better believe Charles would be at the airport, trying to ensure they don't get past immigration.\n\nRelated: Charles Barkley sends a warning to Joel Embiid amid disappointing Olympic

On a team that boasts the likes of LeBron James, Stephen Curry, and Kevin Durant, among other superstars of similar caliber, it's very easy to fall through the cracks and go unnoticed. This is something that Paul George thought that his new Philadelphia 76ers teammate, Joel Embiid might face in Paris. Therefore, PG advised him a way out.\n\nOn Podcast P with Paul George, George was in conversation with Charles Barkley when the two started discussing how Joel Embiid has had a few poor games for Team USA on this Olympics run. PG revealed that he had a conversation with Embiid recently when he gave the 2023 NBA MVP some advice on staying relevant in that stacked squad.\n\nGeorge said that it's difficult to see success with Team USA while following the same formula as the NBA. That's why he believes Embiid needs to make a few changes.\n\nPG said, \"I had a conversation with him [Joel] not too long ago...It's a different dynamic when you play Team USA...It's a little bit of a different thing that I think he's going through because there's so much talent on the floor.\"\n\nCiting his own experience during the 2o16 Olympics in Rio, PG said that Embiid needs to do things differently to remain a valuable member of the team. He said, \"When I played on that 2016 team, my mindset was more so geared towards, I'mma pick dudes up 94 feet, I'mma pressure the hell out of whoever I'm guarding. I don't do that in the NBA.\"\n\nPG advised Embiid to find something different to contribute on that team full of superstars. Because players on the team won't just pass him the ball like they do in Philly.\n\nTherefore, Embiid has to find ways to hustle for the basketball to get more shots and more opportunities.\n\nWhile Charles Barkley agreed with PG's point, he had a different perspective on why Embiid is performing poorly on the team.\n\nThe Philly legend said that Embiid isn't in great shape. As it was the case with him during the NBA season as well, Embiid's subpar fitness level has made him inconsistent with his performances.\n\nBarkley said that now the 76ers have a great team to contend for the title, and if Embiid doesn't get himself in perfect shape, he will be the one to be blamed if they lose again next season.", "source": {"uri": "thesportsrush.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The SportsRush"}, "authors": [{"uri": "prateek_singh@thesportsrush.com", "name": "Prateek Singh", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joel_Embiid", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joel Embiid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point_guard", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Point guard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_George", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Paul George"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Curry", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stephen Curry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LeBron_James", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "LeBron James"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Durant", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kevin Durant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Most_Valuable_Player_Award", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NBA Most Valuable Player Award"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philadelphia_76ers", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia 76ers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Barkley", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Charles Barkley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Basketball"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Show_Basketball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Show Basketball", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Science", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Science", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 93}], "image": "https://cdn-wp.thesportsrush.com/2024/08/97f0715e-nba-2024-08-05t230604.056.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9794242", "eventUri": "eng-9794242", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2470588235294118, "wgt": 77, "relevance": 1}

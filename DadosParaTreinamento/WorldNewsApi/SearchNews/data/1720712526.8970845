Skye O'Neill, who lives in Wilford, Nottingham, started working as a funeral arranger at the beginning of 2023. Originally hailing from East London, Skye moved to Nottingham to live with her grandmother and great-grandmother after her father was hit and killed by a lorry when she was 14. Her father's funeral was conducted by firm A.W. Lymn - who Skye said helped make her feel included in the process. Now, eight years later, Skye is working for the same firm and has revealed how her first service was for her great-grandmother Irene who passed away at the age of 103. The first funeral Sky O'Neill, 22, ever conducted was that of her beloved great-grandmother's Irene (pictured: Skye and Irene) The 22-year-old is 'absolutely in love' with her job and sees herself in the profession 'forever' Skye (pictured conducting Irene's funeral) originally became interested in the niche job following the sudden and tragic passing of her father when she was only 14-years-old Discussing her experience as a teenager and what drove her to pursue her career, Skye told MailOnline: 'Because of my age I wasn't able to be involved in anything [father's funeral], but I really wanted to be. 'When it came to the funeral side of things, the company's chairman Nigel came out to see my Nan, and every question he asked was directed at either me or both of us. 'Whether it was about the music or the coffee, or whatever it was - it made me feel like I wasn't a kid. 'I remember thinking, \"oh, this is something I would like to do for other people\". 'I always knew I wanted to help people, in the same way they [A.W. Lymm] helped me at the time.' The 116-year-old funeral directors firm has played a vital role in Skye's life, being a helping hand in organising four family members' funerals as well as her father's. Having been so intertwined with the company through tragedy, Skye felt like she had 'grown up' with the team. So, when she officially became a funeral arranger for the firm in 2023, her 'vibrant' great-grandmother Irene was 'obsessed'. 'She always wanted to come into the office and she would ask every day whose funeral I organised and so on,' she said. The crematorium was filled with attendees donning pink to celebrate Skye's 'vibrant' great-grandmother 'When we would get the monthly newsletter, she would cut out every single bit that had me in.' But at the age of 103, Irene passed away from a stroke in her sleep with the family pet by her side. \u2018She was none the wiser to what had happened. She was ever so peaceful, and she was ready. you know - 103 years is a long time,' Skye said. The funeral arranger was the only person home at the time of her great-grandmother's death. Following her passing, Skye knew she would try fulfil Irene's final wish and lead her funeral - even though she was not yet a conductor. The 103-year-old as well as her daughter and Skye's grandmother, Cheryl, 76, had always been quite clear they wanted the young woman to organise Irene's final farewell. The 22-year-old and her grandmother even found notes scattered around the house with funeral instructions for Skye from her great-grandmother. Initially Skye wasn't sure if she would be able to conduct the funeral having never done it before. But with the support of her boss, Nigel, she was able to bring the celebration together for 'vibrant' Irene. Skye explained that became a funeral arranger because she wanted to help others like - A.W.Lymn: The Family Funeral - helped her She joked: 'I didn't really have a choice, because my Nan [Cheryl] had told the whole street I was doing it after Nigel confirmed. 'She was just over the moon with it all, as it took some pressure off her. 'Even things as silly as having a slideshow at the at the funeral, she didn't have to worry about getting the pictures together or doing it I could just do it all for her.' Although Skye ensured every aspect of her great-grandmother's funeral was perfect even down to Irene's makeup, she was in awe to see the crematorium filled with mourners. 'From my experience with her age, I assumed booking the smaller chapel, would be the right thing to do but it ended up being packed.' She acknowledged she wouldn't have been able to bring the vibrant and pink affair together if it wasn't for her boss, Nigel. 'Nigel was just my number one supporter, telling me every step I needed to take, everything I needed to do. 'It just he made the whole thing seamless - he took the reins where he needed to. 'There is no one else I would have you wanted by my side he quite literally held my hand through the whole process.' She added: 'I wouldn't say [conducting] was pressure, It was an honour. Most of my nerves came from walking and making sure I didn't fall over. 'It was scary, but I just could see the look on my Nan's face, and she was so proud, so it was. It just made it worth it.' Even though she deals with death on the daily, Skye 'absolutely loves' her job and envisions herself working in the funeral sector 'forever'. She believes experiencing grief from a young age has made her well equipped to help others through the grieving process. 'I would like to think my experience does help others, because my mindset is about making them feel supported, she said. Skye confessed she wouldn't have been able to conduct her first very personal farewell had it not been for the unwavering support from the firm's company director -Nigel Lymn Rose (pictured) 'Of course everybody feels sorry for someone when they lose a loved one but to actually be able to say, I have been in the space you currently feel, sometimes helps.' Although Skye adores her work it does come with its difficulties, despite a 'constant stream of support' from their close knit team. 'It sometimes gets to me is when parents come in, and it doesn't matter how old their child it was when when it the parents of somebody,' she said. 'I sometimes find myself thinking my Nan had to do this, and and then my heart bleeds for them. 'It's natural to lose your parents and your grandparents but no one should ever have to lose their child.'

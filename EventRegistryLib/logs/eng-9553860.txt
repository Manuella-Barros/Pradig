(Image from Shutterstock)\n\nThe U.S. Supreme Court has ruled against two women who loaned their cars to others arrested for drug crimes while using the vehicles, leading Alabama police to seek civil forfeiture of the cars.\n\nThe car owners, Halima Culley and Lena Sutton, had argued that they were entitled to a preliminary hearing to determine whether police could retain their cars during the forfeiture process. Their cars were seized under an Alabama law that allows police to seize vehicles used to commit or facilitate drug crimes.\n\nIn a 6-3 decision, the Supreme Court ruled that the due process clause of the 14th Amendment requires a timely forfeiture hearing in cases involving the seizure of personal property -- but it does not require a separate preliminary hearing.\n\nThe Supreme Court said Congress and the states have long authorized police to seize and hold personal property pending a forfeiture hearing, without separate preliminary hearings. That historical practice is reinforced by two Supreme Court cases that resolve the issue, the high court said.\n\nOne of the cases is the 1983 decision in United States v. $8,850, which created a four-factor test to assess the timeliness of a forfeiture hearing, the majority said in an opinion by Justice Brett Kavanaugh.\n\n\"Culley and Sutton's argument for a separate preliminary hearing appears in many respects to be a backdoor argument for a more timely hearing so that a property owner with a good defense against forfeiture can recover her property more quickly,\" Kavanaugh wrote. \"But the court's precedents already require a timely hearing, and a property owner can of course raise $8,850-based arguments in an individual case to ensure a timely hearing.\"\n\nKavanaugh's opinion was joined by Chief Justice John Roberts and Justices Clarence Thomas, Samuel Alito, Neil Gorsuch and Amy Coney Barrett.\n\nGorsuch also wrote a concurrence, joined by Thomas. He said he agreed with the majority that a prompt hearing is required in civil forfeiture cases, and the hearing doesn't have to take the form advocated by Culley and Sutton.\n\nBut Gorsuch said he also agrees with the dissent \"that this case leaves many larger questions unresolved about whether, and to what extent, contemporary civil forfeiture practices can be squared with the Constitution's promise of due process.\"", "source": {"uri": "abajournal.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ABA Journal - Law News Now"}, "authors": [{"uri": "debra_cassens_weiss@abajournal.com", "name": "Debra Cassens Weiss", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asset_forfeiture", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Asset forfeiture"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preliminary_hearing", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Preliminary hearing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Supreme Court of the United States"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alabama", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Alabama"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Alabama"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brett_Kavanaugh", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Brett Kavanaugh"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Due_Process_Clause", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Due Process Clause"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourteenth_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Supreme court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Roberts", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "John Roberts"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amy_Coney_Barrett", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Amy Coney Barrett"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neil_Gorsuch", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Neil Gorsuch"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samuel_Alito", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Samuel Alito"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clarence_Thomas", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Clarence Thomas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Due_process", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Due process"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precedent", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Precedent"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal_Information", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal Information", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Trials", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Trials", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Law", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Law", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 92}], "image": "https://www.abajournal.com/images/main_images/shutterstock_car_steering_wheel.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9553860", "eventUri": "eng-9553860", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2784313725490195, "wgt": 216, "relevance": 1}

Police had stopped the cars when they were being driven by other people and, after finding drugs, seized the vehicles.\n\nCivil forfeiture allows authorities to take someone's property, without having to prove that it has been used for illicit purposes. Critics of the practice describe it as \"legalized theft.\"\n\nJustice Brett Kavanaugh wrote for the conservative majority that a civil forfeiture hearing to determine whether an owner will lose the property permanently must be timely. But he said the Constitution does not also require a separate hearing about whether police may keep cars or other property in the meantime.\n\nIn a dissent for the liberal members of the court, Justice Sonia Sotomayor wrote that civil forfeiture is \"vulnerable to abuse\" because police departments often have a financial incentive to keep the property.\n\n\"In short, law enforcement can seize cars, hold them indefinitely, and then rely on an owner's lack of resources to forfeit those cars to fund agency budgets, all without any initial check by a judge as to whether there is a basis to hold the car in the first place,\" Sotomayor wrote.\n\nThe women, Halima Culley and Lena Sutton, filed federal lawsuits arguing they were entitled to a prompt court hearing that would have resulted in the cars being returned to them much sooner. There was no suggestion that either woman was involved in or knew anything about the illegal activity.\n\nSutton had loaned her car to a friend. Police in Leesburg, Alabama seized it when they arrested him for trafficking methamphetamine.\n\nSutton ended up without her car for 14 months, during which she couldn't find work, stay current with bills or keep her mental-health appointments, her lawyers wrote in court papers.\n\nCulley had bought a car for her son to use at college. Police in Satsuma, Alabama stopped the car and found marijuana and a loaded hangun. They charged the son with marijuana possession and kept the car.\n\nJustice Neil Gorsuch was part of Thursday's majority, but in an opinion also joined by Justice Clarence Thomas, Gorsuch said larger questions about the use of civil forfeiture remain unresolved.\n\nNoting that civil forfeiture has become a \"booming business,\" Gorsuch wrote the court should use a future case to assess whether the modern practice of civil forfeiture is in line with constitutional guarantees that property may not be taken \"without due process of law.\"\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2024 The Associated Press.

Marshall, Attorney General of Alabama that property owners in civil asset forfeiture proceedings have no due process right to a preliminary court hearing to determine if police had probable cause to seize their property.\n\n\"When police seize and then seek civil forfeiture of a car that was used to commit a drug offense, the Constitution requires a timely forfeiture hearing,\" Justice Brett Kavanaugh wrote in the majority opinion, joined by Chief Justice John Roberts and Justices Samuel Alito, Clarence Thomas, Neil Gorsuch, and Amy Coney Barrett. \"The question here is whether the Constitution also requires a separate preliminary hearing to determine whether the police may retain the car pending the forfeiture hearing. This Court's precedents establish that the answer is no: The Constitution requires a timely forfeiture hearing; the Constitution does not also require a separate preliminary hearing.\"\n\nUnder civil asset forfeiture laws, police can seize property suspected of being connected to criminal activity, even if the owner is never charged or convicted of a crime. Law enforcement groups say it is a vital tool to disrupt drug trafficking and other organized crime.\n\nCivil liberties groups across the political spectrum argue that the process creates perverse profit incentives for police and is unfairly tilted against property owners, who bear the burden of challenging the seizures in court.\n\nThose criticisms have been echoed in the past by not just the Supreme Court's liberal justices but also Justices Clarence Thomas and Neil Gorsuch, giving forfeiture critics hope that a skeptical majority on the Court would clamp down on civil forfeiture.\n\nHowever, despite writing in a concurrence that \"this case leaves many larger questions unresolved about whether, and to what extent, contemporary civil forfeiture practices can be squared with the Constitution's promise of due process,\" Gorsuch, joined by Thomas, both agreed with the majority opinion.\n\nToday's ruling is a disappointment, then, for groups such as the Institute for Justice, a libertarian-leaning public-interest law firm that filed an amicus brief on behalf of the petitioners. Kirby Thomas West, an Institute for Justice attorney, calls the ruling \"a big loss for private property rights.\"\n\n\"Today's decision will mean many more property owners will never get their day in court when it could do them some good -- shortly after the seizure of their vehicle or other property,\" says West. \"Instead, civil forfeiture cases will languish for months or years before they are resolved. Meanwhile owners of seized vehicles will scramble to find a way to get to work, take their kids to school, run errands, and complete other essential life tasks.\"\n\nThe Supreme Court agreed to hear the case -- two consolidated cases both involving Alabama women whose cars were seized by police for offenses they were not involved or charged with -- last year.\n\nIn the first case, Halima Culley's son was pulled over by police in Satsuma, Alabama, while driving Culley's car. He was arrested and charged with possession of marijuana and drug paraphernalia. The City of Satsuma also seized Culley's car. It took 20 months, during all of which Culley was bereft of her vehicle, before a state court ruled that she was entitled to the return of her car under Alabama's innocent-owner defense.\n\nIn the second case, a friend of Lena Sutton took her car to run an errand in 2019. He was pulled over by police in Leesburg, Alabama, who found methamphetamine in the car and seized it. Sutton also eventually was granted summary judgment on an innocent-owner defense, but not until more than a year after the initial seizure of her car.\n\nCulley and Sutton both filed lawsuits claiming that the towns violated their Eighth and 14th Amendment rights by depriving them of their cars for months when a pretrial hearing to establish probable cause for the seizures could have quickly determined that they were innocent owners.\n\nThose long waits are not unusual. Last year, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 6th Circuit ruled that Detroit's asset forfeiture scheme violated residents' constitutional rights by making them wait months for court hearings to challenge the validity of seizures. One of the plaintiffs in that lawsuit waited two years for a hearing.\n\nHowever, the 11th Circuit rejected Culley's claims, finding the state's civil forfeiture process satisfied the requirements for a timely hearing under the speedy trial test, a balancing test created to resolve allegations of Sixth Amendment violations. However, every other circuit that has weighed in on the issue used a different balancing test established in the 1976 Supreme Court case Mathews v. Eldridge to determine due process violations.\n\nThe Supreme Court's conservative majority sidestepped the question of which test to use altogether, ruling that the existing requirement for a timely court hearing in forfeiture cases satisfied constitutional requirements.\n\n\"A timely forfeiture hearing protects the interests of both the claimant and the government,\" Kavanaugh wrote. \"And an additional preliminary hearing of the kind sought by petitioners would interfere with the government's important law-enforcement activities in the period after the seizure and before the forfeiture hearing.\"\n\nIn a dissent, Justice Sonia Sotomayor, joined by Justices Elena Kagan and Ketanji Brown Jackson, wrote that the majority opinion's reasoning was \"deeply flawed\" and, rather than resolve the question of which test lower courts should apply, creates a universal rule that \"hamstrings federal courts from conducting a context-specific analysis in civil forfeiture schemes that are less generous than the one here.\"", "source": {"uri": "reason.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Reason"}, "authors": [{"uri": "c_j_ciaramella@reason.com", "name": "C.J.

The court was divided along ideological lines, with all six Republican-appointed justices in the majority.\n\nPlaintiffs Halima Culley and Lena Sutton filed class actions against the state of Alabama and their local governments, claiming their due process rights were violated because they did not receive prompt hearings after their cars were seized.\n\nCulley's son was driving her 2015 Nissan Altima when police pulled him over and found marijuana, drug paraphernalia, and a loaded pistol in the car. In Sutton's case, her friend was using her 2012 Chevrolet Sonic when police pulled him over for speeding and discovered methamphetamine in the car.\n\nThe U.S. Court of Appeals for the 11th Circuit in the Culley and Sutton cases held that the \"speedy trial\" test, formed to resolve allegations of Sixth Amendment violations, applied and that due process is satisfied by the civil forfeiture process itself.\n\nAlabama Attorney General Steven Marshall, a Republican, had called on the high court to uphold the 11th Circuit's ruling, saying that the Supreme Court \"for centuries\" has held that civil forfeitures need not inquire into the guilt or innocence of the property's owner, \"only the use of the property itself in a prohibited act,\" according to a brief.\n\nCivil forfeiture laws, which are in place in all 50 states and Washington, D.C., allow law enforcement officers to seize property, such as a vehicle, if it is used in connection to a crime, even if the property is owned by an innocent party.\n\nBetween 2000 and 2019, states and the federal government pocketed a total of $68.8 billion through forfeiture, as police departments across the country rake in millions of dollars worth of property each year.\n\nDemocratic-appointed Justices Sonia Sotomayor, Elena Kagan, and Ketanji Brown Jackson dissented.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM THE WASHINGTON EXAMINER\n\nSotomayor wrote that when a police officer has a \"financial incentive\" to hold on to a vehicle and an owner pleads innocence, the petitioners contend \"a retention hearing at least ensures that the officer has probable cause to connect the owner and the car to a crime.\"\n\n\"Today, the Court holds that the Due Process Clause never requires that minimal safeguard,\" Sotomayor added. \"In doing so, it sweeps far more broadly than the narrow question presented and hamstrings lower courts from addressing myriad abuses of the civil forfeiture system.\"", "source": {"uri": "washingtonexaminer.com",

In the interim, the innocent owner may be without their car.\n\nThe court considered appeals from two women whose cars were seized by Alabama police who had arrested the drivers on drug charges.\n\nHalima Culley had lent her car to her college-age son. Lena Sutton lent her car to a friend. Within two weeks, the police filed a notice to the two women that their cars may be forfeited, and they did not respond.\n\nLater, they joined a class-action lawsuit seeking damages for the state's failure to give them a speedy hearing and to return their vehicles.\n\nJustice Brett M. Kavanaugh, speaking for the court, said states have adopted different rules for handling forfeitures, and the justices were wary of requiring a second, preliminary hearing in all forfeiture cases.\n\n\"When police seize and then seek civil forfeiture of a car that was used to commit a drug offense, the Constitution requires a timely forfeiture hearing,\" he wrote in Culley vs. Marshall. \"The question here is whether the Constitution also requires a separate preliminary hearing to determine whether the police may retain the car pending the forfeiture hearing. This Court's precedents establish that the answer is no.\"\n\nCulley waited a year before filing a complaint that she was an innocent owner, and a month later, a state judge ordered her car to be returned to her. Sutton also had her car returned after she asserted she was the innocent owner.\n\nJustices Sonia Sotomayor, Elena Kagan and Ketanji Brown Jackson dissented.\n\n\"A police officer can seize your car if he claims it is connected to a crime committed by someone else. The police department can then keep the car for months or even years until the State ultimately seeks ownership of it through civil forfeiture. In most States, the resulting proceeds from the car's sale go to the police department's budget,\" Sotomayor said.\n\nThe two women who sued said the Constitution \"requires a prompt, post-seizure opportunity for innocent car owners to argue to a judge why they should retain their cars pending that final forfeiture determination. \"Today, the Court holds that the Due Process Clause never requires that minimal safeguard.\"\n\nJustice Neil M. Gorsuch concurred in the result, but said the court needed to devise better rules in this area.\n\n\"In future cases, with the benefit of full briefing, I hope we might begin the task of assessing how well the profound changes in civil forfeiture practices we have witnessed in recent decades comport with the Constitution's enduring guarantee that '[n]o person shall ... be deprived of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law.'\"\n\nThe National Federation of Independent Business called the decision a disappointment for small business owners.\n\n\"When it comes to civil asset forfeiture, small business owners who rent, sell, or conduct cash transactions are particularly vulnerable to harm,\" said Beth Milito, executive director of NFIB's Small Business Legal Center. \"Because of this decision, many small business property owners will continue to be targeted and injured by a civil asset forfeiture procedure that violates due process and punishes businesses for the actions of the public.\"", "source": {"uri": "latimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Los Angeles Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitution_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Constitution of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asset_forfeiture", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Asset forfeiture"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preliminary_hearing", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Preliminary hearing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Class_action", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Class action"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Damages", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Damages"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Supreme Court of the United States"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alabama", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Alabama"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Alabama"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ketanji_Brown_Jackson", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ketanji Brown Jackson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brett_Kavanaugh", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Brett Kavanaugh"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elena_Kagan", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Elena Kagan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sonia_Sotomayor", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sonia Sotomayor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precedent", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Precedent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Police", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Police"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_forfeiture_in_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Civil forfeiture in the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neil_Gorsuch", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Neil Gorsuch"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Federation_of_Independent_Business", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "National Federation of Independent Business"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Due_Process_Clause", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Due Process Clause"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Due_process", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Due process"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberty", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Liberty"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Small_business", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Small business"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Autos", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Autos", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Classifieds/Automotive", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Classifieds/Automotive", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Autos/Driving_and_Safety", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Autos/Driving and Safety", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings/Automobiles", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings/Automobiles", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Automotive/Car_Rentals", "label": "dmoz/Business/Automotive/Car Rentals", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 70}], "image": "https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/74136c7/2147483647/strip/true/crop/4401x2476+0+229/resize/1200x675!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F04%2F9b%2Fc65ad18103006d268fb7561f8b71%2F163556873f6c4efa8b83e304a512ee5f", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9553860", "eventUri": "eng-9553860", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.02745098039215677, "wgt": 197, "relevance": 1}

At issue was whether preliminary hearings - opportunities that may allow owners to regain their property more quickly than a different process known as a forfeiture hearing - are necessary to fulfill constitutional due process requirements.\n\nConservative Justice Brett Kavanaugh, writing for the majority, said preliminary hearings, also known as retention hearings, are not legally required.\n\n\"In civil forfeiture cases involving personal property such as cars,\" Kavanaugh wrote, \"the (Constitution's) Due Process Clause requires a timely forfeiture hearing but does not require a preliminary hearing.\"\n\nCivil forfeiture laws permit the federal and state governments to seize and often permanently keep vehicles, real estate and other property alleged to have been used to carry out or facilitate a crime - even when the owner has not been convicted or even charged with a criminal offense.\n\nSome state laws require government officials to promptly show that seized property is likely involved in illegal activity and, failing that, return the assets while court proceedings over the owner's ultimate right to the property play out.\n\nAlabama was previously among the U.S. states that did not mandate a prompt pretrial retention hearing in which the government must justify the property seizure, though the state revised its civil forfeiture law while the case was pending.\n\nJustice Sonia Sotomayor criticized the court's ruling in a dissent that was joined by fellow liberal Justices Elena Kagan and Ketanji Brown Jackson.\n\n\"The majority today holds that due process never requires the minimal check of a retention hearing before a police officer deprives an innocent owner of her car for months or years,\" Sotomayor wrote.\n\nPlaintiff Lena Sutton's vehicle was seized while it was being driven by a friend who borrowed it and was arrested for methamphetamine possession. Sutton's case was consolidated with that of a second plaintiff, Halima Culley, whose car was seized when her college-aged son was arrested for marijuana possession while driving it.\n\nDespite their pleas to law enforcement to return their property, Sutton had to wait 14 months and Culley 20 months before courts determined that their cars should be returned.\n\nThe plaintiffs filed federal lawsuits arguing that the state government's failure to provide a prompt court hearing to let them try to reclaim their property violated the 14th Amendment's promise that government not \"deprive any person of life, liberty or property without due process of law.\"\n\nFederal judges ruled against the plaintiffs in their lawsuits. The Atlanta-based 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed those decisions. President Joe Biden's administration sided with Alabama in the case.\n\nKirby Thomas West, an attorney at the libertarian public interest law firm Institute for Justice, called Thursday's ruling \"a big loss for private property rights\" that would cause civil forfeiture cases to \"languish for months or years before they are resolved.\"\n\n\"Meanwhile owners of seized vehicles will scramble to find a way to get to work, take their kids to school, run errands and complete other essential life tasks,\" West said.", "source": {"uri": "usnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "U.S. News &

Marshall, the Supreme Court reached a dubious decision in an asset forfeiture property rights case, holding that the seizure of property through civil forfeiture requires a \"timely hearing,\" it does not require \"a separate preliminary hearing to determine whether the police may retain the car pending the forfeiture hearing.\" The justices split 6-3 along ideological lines. However, a concurring opinion by Justice Neil Gorsuch (joined by Justice Clarence Thomas) suggests there may be a majority in favor of a more fundamental challenge to the abusive asset forfeiture regimes that exist in many states.\n\nCivil asset forfeiture enables the government to seize property that has allegedly been used in the commission of a crime, even if the owner has never been charged or convicted of anything. In many states, including Alabama (whose policies are at issue in Culley), law enforcement can then hold on to the property for many months before the owner is allowed to contest the seizure. Moreover, many states allow law enforcement to keep the proceeds from seized property, thereby creating an incentive to take as much as possible. Culley involves two Alabama cases where the owners of cars were subject to asset forfeitures as a result of the use of the vehicles by other people to conduct illegal drug transactions. The owners eventually managed to prevail in state court. But that process took many months. In the meantime, they were deprived of their vehicles, without any compensation.\n\nCritics have long argued that such practices violate the Due Process Clauses of the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments, which bar the government from depriving \"any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law.\" If the police can seize property and hold on to it for months on end without any meaningful process at all, that surely is not \"due process of law.\"\n\nIn an opinion written by Justice Brett Kavanaugh, the Supreme Court nonetheless ruled that a separate \"preliminary hearing\" is not required in such cases, for two reasons. First, they contend the issue was resolved in two earlier Supreme Court precedents:\n\nUltimately, we need not reweigh the competing due process arguments advanced by the parties because this Court's decisions in United States v. $8,850, 461 U. S. 555 (1983), and United States v. Von Neumann, 474 U. S. 242 (1986), already resolved the issue. After a State seizes and seeks civil forfeiture of personal property, due process requires a timely forfeiture hearing but does not require a separate preliminary hearing....\n\nThe dispute in $8,850 arose when the Customs Service seized currency from an individual entering the United States, but then waited before filing for civil forfeiture of the currency.... The property owner argued that the delay violated due process....This Court concluded that a post-seizure delay \"may become so prolonged that the dispossessed property owner has been deprived of a meaningful hearing at a meaningfultime.\" Id., at 562-563. The Court elaborated that timeliness in civil forfeiture cases must be assessed by \"analog[izing] . . . to a defendant's right to a speedy trial\" and considering four factors: the length of the delay, the reason for the delay, whether the property owner asserted his rights, and whether the delay was prejudicial. Id., at 564... Those factors are appropriate guides in the civil forfeiture context, the Court explained, because the factors ensure that \"the flexible requirements of due process have been met....\"\n\nIn Von Neumann, the Court addressed whether a timely forfeiture hearing, without more, provides the process that is due in civil forfeiture cases. See 474 U. S., at 249-251. The property owner there failed to declare the purchase of his new car upon driving it into the United States. See id.,at 245. A customs official determined that the car was subject to civil forfeiture and seized it. See ibid. The plaintiff filed a petition for remission of the forfeiture -- in essence, a request under federal law that the Federal Government exercise its discretion to forgive the forfeiture. See id., at 245-246. The Government did not respond to that petition for 36 days. See id., at 246. The plaintiff sued, arguing that the Government's 36-day delay in answering the remission petition violated due process.... Justice Brennan's opinion for the Court broadly held that due process did not require a pre-forfeiture-hearing remission procedure in the first place....\n\nThis Court's decisions in $8,850 and Von Neumann resolve this case. As the Court stated in Von Neumann, a timely forfeiture hearing \"satisfies any due process right\"\n\nwith respect to a \"car\" that has been seized for civil forfeiture. 474 U. S., at 251; see also id., at 249. The Due Process Clause does not require a separate preliminary\n\nhearing.\n\nThe second reason why the majority rejects the need for a pre-forfeiture hearing is the originalist argument that Founding-era evidence suggests it wasn't required:\n\nHistorical practice reinforces the holdings of $8,850 and Von Neumann that due process does not require preliminary hearings in civil forfeiture cases. Since the Founding era, statutes have authorized the Government to seize personal property and hold it pending a forfeiture hearing, without a separate preliminary hearing. For example, the first federal forfeiture law, the Collection Act of 1789, authorized the civil forfeiture of ships, goods, and merchandise involved in suspected violations of the customs laws.... The collector then filed a forfeiture action, which a court would \"hear and determine . . . according to law.\" \u00a736, id., at 47. While that action was pending, the seized property could remain in the custody of the collector.\" \u00a725, id., at 43....\n\nThe Collection Act did not require a separate preliminary hearing before the forfeiture hearing. Rather, the forfeiture \"trial\" supplied the opportunity for the property owner to challenge the collector's case.\n\nIn a forceful concurring opinion that reads more like a dissent, Justice Gorsuch outlines serious due process flaws in the current asset forfeiture regime, and in the process undermines the majorities arguments. Like Justice Sotomayor in her dissent for the three liberal justices, Gorsuch emphasizes the abusive practices of the modern asset forfeiture regime, and the fact that most of it is of relatively recent origin, arising from the growth of the War on Drugs. This puts it in serious tension with text and original meaning:\n\nTo my mind, the due process questions surrounding these relatively new civil forfeiture practices are many. Start with the most fundamental one. The Fifth and Fourteenth\n\nAmendments guarantee that no government in this country may take \"life, liberty, or property, without due process of law.\" As originally understood, this promise usually meant that a government seeking to deprive an individual of her property could do so only after a trial before a jury in which it (not the individual) bore the burden of proof. See, e.g., 1 W. Blackstone, Commentaries on the Laws of England 134- 135 (1765) (Blackstone); Vanhorne's Lessee v. Dorrance, 2 Dall. 304, 315 (CC Pa. 1795) (Patterson, J.); Wilkinson v. Leland, 2 Pet. 627, 657 (1829) (Story, J.). So how is it that, in civil forfeiture, the government may confiscate property first and provide process later?\n\nThe answer, if there is one, turns on history. If, as a rule, the Due Process Clauses require governments to conduct a trial before taking property, some exceptions are just asdeeply rooted. And for just that reason, these exceptions, too, may be consistent with the original meaning of the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments.\n\nGorsuch goes on to note that the Founding-era and Supreme Court precedents cited by the majority may not be generally applicable, because they arose in \" the discrete arenas of admiralty, customs, and revenue law.\" That's true of the Collections Act, and also of $8850 and Von Neumann, the two modern precedents emphasized by Kavanaugh. But, as Gorsuch points out, these areas are likely to be special cases, exceptions to the general rule that the government may only seize property after a trial:\n\nThe reasons for the law's traditionally permissive attitude toward civil forfeiture in those three contexts may merit exploration, too. From a brief look, it seems they were\n\nsometimes justified for reasons particular to their fields. In the early Republic, for example, once a ship involved in violations of the Nation's piracy or customs laws slipped port for a foreign destination, American courts often could not exercise jurisdiction over it or its crew, let alone its owners.... In many instances, the law recognized that seizing the ship, subject to postdeprivation procedures, represented \"the only adequate means of suppressing the offence or wrong, or insuring an indemnity to the injured party.\" Harmony v. United States, 2 How. 210, 233 (1844) (Story, J.); see also 3 Blackstone 262 (1768) (justifying civil forfeiture in customs cases as necessary \"to secure such forfeited goods for the public use, though the offender himself had escaped the reach of justice\"). But if history sanctions that line of thinking, it's hard not to wonder: How does any of that support the use of civil forfeiture in so many cases today, where the government can secure personal jurisdiction over the wrongdoer? And where seizing his property is not the only adequate means of addressing his offense?\n\nHow indeed?\n\nNotice that Gorsuch's reasoning effectively disposes of both of the main arguments advanced by the majority: $8850 and Von Neumann are not dispositive precedents, because both were customs cases, which are a special, distinct situation. For the same reason, the Founding-era evidence cited by Kavanaugh is also inadequate. It too focuses on customs legislation.\n\nMore generally, if Gorsuch is right to conclude that \"a government seeking to deprive an individual of her property could do so only after a trial before a jury in which it (not the individual) bore the burden of proof,\" then the Alabama laws at issue in this case are clearly unconstitutional! A procedure under which the government can seize and hold on to property for many months before providing any kind of hearing clearly doesn't meet that standard. Ditto for the way in which Alabama (like many other states) effectively shifts the burden of proof onto the property owner.\n\nThus, by their own reasoning, Gorsuch and Thomas should have dissented. Even if a \"separate preliminary hearing\" isn't required, the government still may not seize property without holding a trial first, and a procedure that, as Gorsuch puts it, allows \"it take and keep private property without a warrant or any other form of prior process\" is clearly unconstitutional, and violates the requirement of a \"timely\" hearing.\n\nJustice Sotomayor's dissenting opinion offers additional constitutional criticisms of the Alabama asset forfeiture system, and others like it. Like Gorsuch, she also highlights the perverse incentives created by the current system (which allows law enforcement to profit from seizures), ways in which that system disproportionately burdens the poor and disadvantaged, including property owners who don't have the resources for a prolonged legal battle. Losing the use of your car for many months may be only a moderate burden for the relatively affluent. It's a much bigger one for a poor or working class person. She also points out additional flaws in the majority's use of precedent.\n\nFrom the standpoint of civil libertarians and property rights advocates, there is a silver lining to today's otherwise terrible decision: at least five justices seem open to issuing a broader ruling curbing asset forfeiture. In his concurring opinion, Gorsuch comes close to inviting litigants to file a broad challenge arguing that most asset forfeitures require a prior jury trial:\n\nWhy does a Nation so jealous of its liberties tolerate expansive new civil forfeiture practices that have \"led to egregious and well-chronicled abuses\"? Leonard, 580 U. S., at 1180 (statement of THOMAS, J.). Perhaps it has something to do with the relative lack of power of those on whom the system preys. Perhaps government agencies' increasing dependence on forfeiture as a source of revenue is an important piece of the puzzle.... But maybe, too, part of the reason lies closer to home. In this Nation, the right to a jury trial before the government may take life, liberty, or property has always been the rule. Yes, some exceptions exist. But perhaps it is past time for this Court to examine more fully whether and to what degree contemporary civil forfeiture practices align with that rule and those exceptions.\n\nIf Justice Sotomayor's dissent is any indication, the three liberal justices also seem open to a broader attack on at least the more egregious current asset forfeiture practices, prevalent in many states. Defense lawyers and public interest organizations should take note -- and take up Gorsuch's thinly veiled invitation.

Justice Brett Kavanaugh, a Donald Trump appointee, said when police seize a car used in a drug crime, the Constitution already requires a timely hearing.\n\n\"The question here is whether the Constitution also requires a separate preliminary hearing to determine whether the police may retain the car pending the forfeiture hearing,\" Kavanaugh wrote for the majority. \"This court's precedents establish that the answer is no: The Constitution requires a timely forfeiture hearing; the Constitution does not also require a separate preliminary hearing.\"\n\nKavanaugh said adding an additional preliminary hearing requirement would interfere with law enforcement activities.\n\nThe three liberal justices dissented from the ruling. Justice Sonia Sotomayor, a Barack Obama appointee, said the ruling ignored the Constitution's minimal safeguards against property seizures.\n\n\"The majority today holds that due process never requires the minimal check of a retention hearing before a police officer deprives an innocent owner of her car for months or years,\" Sotomayor wrote for the dissenters.\n\nSotomayor said civil forfeitures sit in a murky space between criminal forfeiture and ordinary government deprivations of property. Outside of criminal cases, Sotomayor said, the government is usually required to provide a hearing before seizing personal property. But civil forfeitures are a hybrid, where law enforcement believes the property is connected to a crime even though the owner is not.\n\nThe rules around civil forfeitures vary among the federal government, states and localities, which Sotomayor said makes them ripe for abuse.\n\n\"In 32 states and the federal system, when law enforcement agencies forfeit property, the proceeds go to their own budgets,\" Sotomayor wrote. \"As a result, police agencies often have a financial incentive to seize as many cars as possible and try to retain them.\"\n\nHalima Culley had her car seized by the city of Satsuma, Alabama, after her son was arrested on possession of marijuana and drug paraphernalia charges. Culley had to wait almost two years for a hearing to get her vehicle back.\n\nAlabama filed a civil asset forfeiture in an attempt to seize Culley's car permanently, but the state court ruled in Culley's favor under the state's innocent-owner defense.\n\nCulley was joined by Lena Sutton -- another \"innocent owner\" whose car was seized for over a year -- to file a class action claiming Alabama took their property unlawfully.\n\nTwo lower courts shot down their suits but the Supreme Court agreed to review the matter.\n\nCulley and Sutton told the justices that the courts had applied the wrong test, using the court's ruling in Barker v. Wingo when Mathews v. Eldridge was the better fit. Barker determined when delays deprive criminal defendants of their constitutional rights, whereas Mathews determined whether the cities' continued impoundment of the cars violates due process.\n\nShay Dvoretzky, an attorney with Skadden, Arps, Slate representing Culley, told the court it only had to issue a narrow ruling during oral arguments in October. He claimed Mathews was about protecting due process instead of micromanaging courts.\n\nKavanaugh said the court didn't need to reweigh the cases presented by Culley and Sutton because two rulings from the 1980s -- United States v. $8,850 and United States v. Von Neumann -- already resolved the issue. Kavanaugh said Von Neumann established that a timely forfeiture hearing satisfied any due process right involving a car seized through civil forfeiture.\n\nKavanaugh said Culley was asking for a \"back door\" to receive a more timely hearing than already required by the court's precedents. He said historical practice confirmed those rulings, citing government seizures of personal property without a separate preliminary hearing requirement during the founding era.\n\n\"The absence of separate preliminary hearings in civil forfeiture proceedings -- from the founding until the late 20th century -- is weighty evidence that due process does not require such hearings,\" Kavanaugh wrote.\n\nThe liberal justices said the majority took a narrow question and created a broad ruling that would hamstring the lower courts.\n\n\"Given the diverse schemes adopted by states, some with adequate safeguards and some without, the court should have just answered the question presented,\" Sotomayor wrote. \"Instead, it announces a universal rule for all schemes without heeding the dictates of this court's due process precedents that require a scheme-specific analysis.\"\n\nSotomayor said police officers can be incentivized to target low-level drug possession in cars rather than drug sales on the street because of the potential to seize a vehicle. She cited a brief before the court where Detroit car owners accused Wayne County of seizing and holding vehicles, forcing owners to pay steep fees to get their vehicles back.\n\n\"In short, law enforcement can seize cars, hold them indefinitely, and then rely on an owner's lack of resources to forfeit those cars to fund agency budgets, all without any initial check by a judge as to whether there is a basis to hold the car in the first place,\" Sotomayor wrote.\n\nJustice Neil Gorsuch, a Donald Trump appointee, said he agreed with both the majority and dissent. He said the ruling didn't give any greater weight to government interests -- which he disagreed with. Gorsuch said the case left open bigger questions about government authority to seize property that the court should answer in another case.\n\n\"In this nation, the right to a jury trial before the government may take life, liberty, or property has always been the rule,\" Gorsuch wrote. \"Yes, some exceptions exist.

At issue was whether preliminary hearings - opportunities that may allow owners to regain their property more quickly than a different process known as a forfeiture hearing - are necessary to fulfill constitutional due process requirements.\n\nConservative Justice Brett Kavanaugh, writing for the majority, said preliminary hearings, also known as retention hearings, are not legally required.\n\n\"In civil forfeiture cases involving personal property such as cars,\" Kavanaugh wrote, \"the (Constitution's) Due Process Clause requires a timely forfeiture hearing but does not require a preliminary hearing.\"\n\nCivil forfeiture laws permit the federal and state governments to seize and often permanently keep vehicles, real estate and other property alleged to have been used to carry out or facilitate a crime - even when the owner has not been convicted or even charged with a criminal offense.\n\nSome state laws require government officials to promptly show that seized property is likely involved in illegal activity and, failing that, return the assets while court proceedings over the owner's ultimate right to the property play out.\n\nAlabama was previously among the U.S. states that did not mandate a prompt pretrial retention hearing in which the government must justify the property seizure, though the state revised its civil forfeiture law while the case was pending.\n\nJustice Sonia Sotomayor criticized the court's ruling in a dissent that was joined by fellow liberal Justices Elena Kagan and Ketanji Brown Jackson.\n\n\"The majority today holds that due process never requires the minimal check of a retention hearing before a police officer deprives an innocent owner of her car for months or years,\" Sotomayor wrote.\n\nPlaintiff Lena Sutton's vehicle was seized while it was being driven by a friend who borrowed it and was arrested for methamphetamine possession. Sutton's case was consolidated with that of a second plaintiff, Halima Culley, whose car was seized when her college-aged son was arrested for marijuana possession while driving it.\n\nDespite their pleas to law enforcement to return their property, Sutton had to wait 14 months and Culley 20 months before courts determined that their cars should be returned.\n\nThe plaintiffs filed federal lawsuits arguing that the state government's failure to provide a prompt court hearing to let them try to reclaim their property violated the 14th Amendment's promise that government not \"deprive any person of life, liberty or property without due process of law.\"\n\nFederal judges ruled against the plaintiffs in their lawsuits. The Atlanta-based 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed those decisions. President Joe Biden's administration sided with Alabama in the case.\n\nKirby Thomas West, an attorney at the libertarian public interest law firm Institute for Justice, called Thursday's ruling \"a big loss for private property rights\" that would cause civil forfeiture cases to \"languish for months or years before they are resolved.\"\n\n\"Meanwhile owners of seized vehicles will scramble to find a way to get to work, take their kids to school, run errands and complete other essential life tasks,\" West said.\n\n(Reporting by John Kruzel; Editing by Will Dunham)\n\nSign Up for Springs AM Update Your morning rundown of the latest news from Colorado Springs and around the country\n\nSign Up View all of our newsletters.

The court was divided along ideological lines, with all six Republican-appointed justices in the majority.\n\nPlaintiffs Halima Culley and Lena Sutton filed class actions against the state of Alabama and their local governments, claiming their due process rights were violated because they did not receive prompt hearings after their cars were seized.\n\nCulley's son was driving her 2015 Nissan Altima when police pulled him over and found marijuana, drug paraphernalia, and a loaded pistol in the car. In Sutton's case, her friend was using her 2012 Chevrolet Sonic when police pulled him over for speeding and discovered methamphetamine in the car.\n\nThe U.S. Court of Appeals for the 11th Circuit in the Culley and Sutton cases held that the \"speedy trial\" test, formed to resolve allegations of Sixth Amendment violations, applied and that due process is satisfied by the civil forfeiture process itself.\n\nAlabama Attorney General Steven Marshall, a Republican, had called on the high court to uphold the 11th Circuit's ruling, saying that the Supreme Court \"for centuries\" has held that civil forfeitures need not inquire into the guilt or innocence of the property's owner, \"only the use of the property itself in a prohibited act,\" according to a brief.\n\nFeatured Local Savings\n\nCivil forfeiture laws, which are in place in all 50 states and Washington, D.C., allow law enforcement officers to seize property, such as a vehicle, if it is used in connection to a crime, even if the property is owned by an innocent party.\n\nBetween 2000 and 2019, states and the federal government pocketed a total of $68.8 billion through forfeiture, as police departments across the country rake in millions of dollars worth of property each year.\n\nDemocratic-appointed Justices Sonia Sotomayor, Elena Kagan, and Ketanji Brown Jackson dissented.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM THE WASHINGTON EXAMINER\n\nSotomayor wrote that when a police officer has a \"financial incentive\" to hold on to a vehicle and an owner pleads innocence, the petitioners contend \"a retention hearing at least ensures that the officer has probable cause to connect the owner and the car to a crime.\"\n\n\"Today, the Court holds that the Due Process Clause never requires that minimal safeguard,\" Sotomayor added. \"In doing so, it sweeps far more broadly than the narrow question presented and hamstrings lower courts from addressing myriad abuses of the civil forfeiture system.\"\n\nSign Up for Springs AM Update Your morning rundown of the latest news from Colorado Springs and around the country\n\nSign Up View all of our newsletters.

Civil asset forfeiture laws are ripe for abuse and provide undue incentives to governments to seize private property, critics say.\n\nCAF is a legal procedure in which law enforcement officials take assets from people suspected of criminal or illegal activity without necessarily charging the owners with wrongdoing. Often the owners are required to prove the asset was not involved in criminal or illegal activity. Failing that, the government keeps the property.\n\nIn the case, co-petitioner Halima Tariffa Culley's automobile was seized by the city of Satsuma, Alabama, in 2019 when her college-age son was arrested while using it. The police found marijuana and a loaded handgun in the car. The son was arrested and the car was seized.\n\nShe filed a federal class-action lawsuit in federal district court claiming the city and the state violated her 14th Amendment rights by failing to provide her with a prompt post-deprivation hearing.\n\nSuch a hearing, she argued, should have determined whether the vehicle should be retained by the state pending the disposition of the case against her son and whether continued impoundment of the car was \"the least restrictive way for the State to secure its interest in the vehicle during the pendency of the Civil Asset Forfeiture ... proceeding filed against her.\"\n\nThe city referred the matter to the state, which made Ms. Culley a defendant in a case it brought under Alabama's CAF statute. Ms. Culley moved for summary judgment and the state court granted it, ordering the car returned to her because she was deemed an innocent owner of the vehicle that was not subject to forfeiture under state law.\n\nCo-petitioner Lena Sutton lent her automobile to a friend in 2019. It was pulled over by police who discovered a large quantity of methamphetamine in it. The friend was arrested and charged with drug trafficking and possessing drug paraphernalia. The car was seized by police.\n\nMs. Sutton filed a federal class-action lawsuit against the town of Leesburg, Alabama, claiming she had been improperly deprived of her car and that, like Ms. Culley, she was not given a prompt post-deprivation hearing at which the state would have to show probable cause. Before that, Ms. Sutton won her case in state court and showed she was an innocent owner who did not participate in or have knowledge of the use of the vehicle in a crime.\n\nMs. Sutton asked the federal district court to grant summary judgment to her but it refused. Ms. Sutton appealed and her case was consolidated with Ms. Culley's. In July 2022, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 11th Circuit ruled against the two women.\n\nThe petitioners asked the Supreme Court to grant their petition because the various circuit courts do not agree \"on the controlling issue of federal law\" and because the Supreme Court previously agreed to hear a similar case. The Supreme Court was unable to resolve that case because of a jurisdiction-related problem, according to the petition filed with the Supreme Court.\n\nIn his opinion, Justice Kavanaugh confirmed that when police seize and then apply for civil forfeiture of a vehicle that was used in the commission of a drug offense, the Constitution requires that a forfeiture hearing take place on a timely basis.\n\nBut the Constitution does not require that a separate preliminary hearing be conducted to determine if the police may hold onto the car pending the forfeiture hearing, he wrote. Different jurisdictions have chosen different means of administering forfeiture laws, he added, and this is permissible under the Constitution.\n\nWhen the two cars were seized, Alabama law allowed the civil forfeiture of a vehicle used to commit or facilitate a drug crime. The Alabama Code provided that police could seize the car \"incident to an arrest\" as long as the state then \"promptly\" initiated a forfeiture proceeding. Before the forfeiture hearing, the owner could regain possession of the car by posting bond at double the car's value.\n\nAt the forfeiture hearing itself, the owner could recover the vehicle under the state's \"affirmative defense\" for \"innocent owners of property subject to forfeiture.\" Such a defense required that the owner demonstrate he or she did not know about the car's connection to the drug crime.\n\nThe state initiated a forfeiture complaint against Ms. Culley's car on Feb. 27, 2019, 10 days after seizing it. But Ms. Culley waited six months before filing a response to that complaint and held on for another year until Sept. 21, 2020, before bringing up an innocent owner defense in a motion to the court. On Oct. 30, 2020, a state court ordered the car returned to Ms. Culley.\n\nMs. Sutton also moved slowly in her forfeiture proceeding, Justice Kavanaugh wrote.\n\nThe state filed for forfeiture on March 6, 2019, which was 13 days after the car was seized. Ms. Sutton missed a court date and the state court entered a default judgment for Alabama. At Ms. Sutton's request, the state court set aside the judgment. She filed an answer and served discovery requests on the state, but didn't do anything else until the state court set a date for the forfeiture trial. She moved for summary judgment as an innocent owner and on May 28, 2020, the state court approved her motion, allowing her to recover her car.\n\nWhile the forfeiture process was moving forward, the two women filed purported class action lawsuits in federal court.\n\nBoth asked for monetary damages under the federal civil rights law known as 42 U.S.C. Section 1983, arguing that state officials violated their due process rights by keeping their cars before holding a preliminary hearing. Federal courts in Alabama ruled against the women and the 11th Circuit consolidated the two cases and affirmed.\n\nJustice Kavanaugh wrote that the Supreme Court recognizes that under the Due Process Clause of the 14th Amendment states may not ordinarily seize real property before providing notice and a hearing but states may immediately seize personal property such as a car and put it through the civil asset forfeiture process.\n\nWhen states seek civil forfeiture of personal property, due process demands a timely post-seizure forfeiture hearing but in this case the petitioners did not challenge the timeliness of their hearings. Instead, they argued the Due Process Clause requires the state to also conduct a separate preliminary hearing before the forfeiture hearing to focus on the validity of the forfeiture.\n\nHowever, after a state seizes and seeks civil forfeiture of personal property, \"due process requires a timely forfeiture hearing but does not require a separate preliminary hearing,\" the justice wrote.\n\nThe Supreme Court affirmed the judgment rendered by the 11th Circuit.\n\nJustice Sotomayor dissented.\n\nAfter seizing your car if it is suspected of being connected to a crime committed by someone else, the police department \"can then keep the car for months or even years until the State ultimately seeks ownership of it through civil forfeiture,\" she wrote.\n\nIn most states, the money raised from selling the car goes into the police department's budget. The petitioners argued that the Due Process Clause requires a speedy opportunity after seizure for innocent car owners to argue in court why they should hang onto their car pending the final forfeiture determination, she wrote.\n\n\"When an officer has a financial incentive to hold onto a car and an owner pleads innocence, they argue, a retention hearing at least ensures that the officer has probable cause to connect the owner and the car to a crime.\n\n\"Today, the Court holds that the Due Process Clause never requires that minimal safeguard. In doing so, it sweeps far more broadly than the narrow question presented and hamstrings lower courts from addressing myriad abuses of the civil forfeiture system,\" Justice Sotomayor wrote.\n\nSmall businesses had been hopeful that the Supreme Court would determine that innocent small business owners were entitled to a prompt post-deprivation hearing, but now many small businesses will be subjected to \"a lengthy and costly forfeiture process,\" the group said in a press release.\n\n\"When it comes to civil asset forfeiture, small business owners who rent, sell, or conduct cash transactions are particularly vulnerable to harm,\" said Beth Milito, executive director of the group's Small Business Legal Center.\n\n\"Because of this decision, many small business property owners will continue to be targeted and injured by a civil asset forfeiture procedure that violates due process and punishes businesses for the actions of the public.\"", "source": {"uri":

Marshall found that civil forfeiture cases involving personal property require a timely but not a separate preliminary hearing. Justice Brett Kavanaugh issued the opinion.\n\nThe case stems from two plaintiffs from Alabama, Halima Culley and Lena Sutton, who had their vehicles seized after they were being driven by another individual and police discovered drugs inside.\n\n\"When police seize and then seek civil forfeiture of a car that was used to commit a drug offense, the Constitution requires a timely forfeiture hearing,\" Kavanaugh wrote. \"The question here is whether the Constitution also requires a separate preliminary hearing to determine whether the police may retain the car pending the forfeiture hearing.\n\n\"This Court's precedents establish that the answer is no.\"\n\nThe Court heard oral arguments on October 30, debating whether local courts should provide individuals with a probable cause hearing after a piece of property is seized by police.\n\nCivil asset forfeiture laws are on the books in all 50 states, though each state has its own unique policies that determine how incidents are reported and where proceeds go.\n\nBut a concurrent opinion written by Thomas and Gorsuch, who were among the six-member conservative majority who all voted in favor, ponders whether future cases could be better adjudicated under the laws and Constitution.\n\nThe pair also express some agreement with Justice Sonia Sotomayor's dissenting opinion, writing: \"This case leaves many larger questions unresolved about whether, and to what extent, contemporary civil forfeiture practices can be squared with the Constitution's promise of due process.\"\n\nThey conclude: \"In asking the questions I do today, I do not profess a comprehensive list, let alone any firm answers. Nor does the way the parties have chosen to litigate this case give cause to supply them.\n\n\"But in future cases, with the benefit of full briefing, I hope we might begin the task of assessing how well the profound changes in civil forfeiture practices we have witnessed in recent decades comport with the Constitution's enduring guarantee that '[n]o person shall . . . be deprived of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law.'\"\n\nAttorney Nicole Brenecki told Newsweek via email that the Court's decision fails to strengthen the protection afforded to personal property under the due process clause.\n\n\"One positive aspect of this decision is that, despite there being no requirement for a post-seizure hearing, the Court underscored the significance of a prompt post-seizure hearing,\" she said. \"However, this language may not be strong enough given that most lower-level courts are overburdened and process cases slowly.\"\n\nThe National Federation of Independent Business, a nonprofit association of small businesses with presence in all 50 states, scrutinized the decision -- saying in a press release that it is \"disappointed\" and that \"many small businesses will be forced to go through a lengthy and costly forfeiture process.\"\n\nNFIB filed an amicus brief in the case in June 2023.\n\n\"When it comes to civil asset forfeiture, small business owners who rent, sell or conduct cash transactions are particularly vulnerable to harm,\" Beth Milito, executive director of NFIB's Small Business Legal Center, said in a

This time, the court approved stingy safeguards for civil forfeiture proceedings, when law enforcement takes your personal property, such as a car, that is allegedly tied to crime, even if you're innocent.\n\nLed by Justice Brett Kavanaugh, the majority said Thursday that, while timely forfeiture hearings are required, the Constitution doesn't require a preliminary hearing to determine whether police can keep your property pending such a hearing.\n\nIn declining to grant that \"minimal safeguard,\" Justice Sonia Sotomayor wrote in dissent, the majority \"sweeps far more broadly than the narrow question presented and hamstrings lower courts from addressing myriad abuses of the civil forfeiture system.\" Joined by Justices Elena Kagan and Ketanji Brown Jackson, Sotomayor wrote that she \"would have decided only which due process test governs whether a retention hearing is required and left it to the lower courts to apply that test to different civil forfeiture schemes.\"\n\nKavanaugh was joined by Chief Justice John Roberts and Justices Clarence Thomas, Samuel Alito, Neil Gorsuch and Amy Coney Barrett. (Gorsuch joining the majority is somewhat notable, given his sometimes libertarian approach, and he did write a lengthy concurring opinion, joined by Thomas, that criticizes civil forfeiture -- but that didn't stop them from going along with the majority.)\n\nDissenting, Sotomayor recalled the procedural history of the appeal that the majority has stretched to reach this result. She noted that the court took the case to address the question of which test should govern due process challenges regarding retention hearings. Instead, she wrote, the majority \"reaches far beyond that question to hold that people whose cars are seized by the police never have a due process right to a retention hearing.\" The majority's reasoning was flawed, too, she explained, because it takes precedent out of context.\n\nSotomayor stressed that the ruling only applies to retention hearings and doesn't \"foreclose other potential due process challenges to civil forfeiture proceedings.\" In light of Gorsuch's separate opinion, there may be gettable court majorities against the government on future civil forfeiture-related appeals. Indeed, the Trump appointee wrote that he agreed with the dissent \"that this case leaves many larger questions unresolved about whether, and to what extent, contemporary civil forfeiture practices can be squared with the Constitution's promise of due process.\" So this may end up being a silver lining from the decision.\n\nOn the broader point of the court making its decisions broader than it has to, the Democratic appointees' dissent echoes their similar recent complaint in Trump v. Anderson. There they faulted the majority (which they agreed with on the bottom line) for going further than necessary in cementing Trump's place on the presidential ballot.\n\nThursday's decision in the forfeiture case, Culley v.

This time, the court approved stingy safeguards for civil forfeiture proceedings, when law enforcement takes your personal property, such as a car, that is allegedly tied to crime, even if you're innocent.\n\nLed by Justice Brett Kavanaugh, the majority said Thursday that, while timely forfeiture hearings are required, the Constitution doesn't require a preliminary hearing to determine whether police can keep your property pending such a hearing.\n\nIn declining to grant that \"minimal safeguard,\" Justice Sonia Sotomayor wrote in dissent, the majority \"sweeps far more broadly than the narrow question presented and hamstrings lower courts from addressing myriad abuses of the civil forfeiture system.\" Joined by Justices Elena Kagan and Ketanji Brown Jackson, Sotomayor wrote that she \"would have decided only which due process test governs whether a retention hearing is required and left it to the lower courts to apply that test to different civil forfeiture schemes.\"\n\nKavanaugh was joined by Chief Justice John Roberts and Justices Clarence Thomas, Samuel Alito, Neil Gorsuch and Amy Coney Barrett. (Gorsuch joining the majority is somewhat notable, given his sometimes libertarian approach, and he did write a lengthy concurring opinion, joined by Thomas, that criticizes civil forfeiture -- but that didn't stop them from going along with the majority.)\n\nDissenting, Sotomayor recalled the procedural history of the appeal that the majority has stretched to reach this result. She noted that the court took the case to address the question of which test should govern due process challenges regarding retention hearings. Instead, she wrote, the majority \"reaches far beyond that question to hold that people whose cars are seized by the police never have a due process right to a retention hearing.\" The majority's reasoning was flawed, too, she explained, because it takes precedent out of context.\n\nSotomayor stressed that the ruling only applies to retention hearings and doesn't \"foreclose other potential due process challenges to civil forfeiture proceedings.\" In light of Gorsuch's separate opinion, there may be gettable court majorities against the government on future civil forfeiture-related appeals. Indeed, the Donald Trump appointee wrote that he agreed with the dissent \"that this case leaves many larger questions unresolved about whether, and to what extent, contemporary civil forfeiture practices can be squared with the Constitution's promise of due process.\" So this may end up being a silver lining from the decision.\n\nOn the broader point of the court making its decisions broader than it has to, the Democratic appointees' dissent echoes their similar recent complaint in Trump v. Anderson. There they faulted the majority (with whom they agreed on the bottom line) for going further than necessary in cementing Trump's place on the presidential ballot.\n\nThursday's decision in the forfeiture case, Culley v. Marshall, comes as the justices are starting to issue their final decisions of the term. Still among the pending rulings is Trump's immunity appeal, in which the court has signaled it's poised to go further than needed again and to further delay the federal election interference trial in the process.\n\nThere are many more appeals for the court to decide -- both related to the former president and otherwise -- over the next couple months.

Eighteen were already issued this year, leaving roughly 40 to issue between now and the end of June.\n\nThe court handed down two more decisions on Thursday. Below is a brief overview of those decisions, both of which were split (and largely along ideological lines).\n\nAgain, if you're one of those folks who's interested in what SCOTUS is up to but don't have the time (or mental energy) to read and digest each opinion as it's handed down, then hopefully, you'll find this little endeavor of assistance.\n\nPetitioner Halima Culley loaned her car to her son, who was later pulled over by Alabama police officers and arrested for possession of marijuana. Petitioner Lena Sutton loaned her car to a friend, who was stopped by Alabama police and arrested for trafficking methamphetamine. In both cases, petitioners' cars were seized under an Alabama civil forfeiture law that permitted seizure of a car \"incident to an arrest\" so long as the State then \"promptly\" initiated a forfeiture case. Ala. Code \u00a720-2-93(b)(1), (c). The State of Alabama filed forfeiture complaints against Culley's and Sutton's cars just 10 and 13 days, respectively, after their seizure. While their forfeiture proceedings were pending, Culley and Sutton each filed purported class-action complaints in federal court seeking money damages under 42 U. S. C. \u00a71983, claiming that state officials violated their due process rights by retaining their cars during the forfeiture process without holding preliminary hearings. In a consolidated appeal, the Eleventh Circuit affirmed the dismissal of petitioners' claims, holding that a timely forfeiture hearing affords claimants due process and that no separate preliminary hearing is constitutionally required.\n\nIssue:\n\nIn determining whether the Due Process Clause requires a state or local government to provide a post-seizure probable cause hearing prior to a statutory judicial forfeiture proceeding and, if so, when such a hearing must take place, should district courts apply the \"speedy trial\" test employed in United States v. $8,850, 461 U.S. 555 (1983) and Barker v. Wingo, 407 U.S. 514 (1972), as held by the Eleventh Circuit or the three-part due process analysis set forth in Mathews v. Eldridge, 424 U.S. 319 (1976) as held by at least the Second, Fifth, Seventh, and Ninth Circuits?\n\nHolding: Affirmed.\n\nIn civil forfeiture cases involving personal property, the Due Process Clause requires a timely forfeiture hearing but does not require a separate preliminary hearing.\n\nSkinny:\n\nIf the government seizes your personal property via civil forfeiture, you get one hearing (not two), but it must be timely.\n\nUnder the Copyright Act, a plaintiff must file suit \"within three years after the claim accrued.\" 17 U. S. C. \u00a7507(b). On one understanding of that limitations provision, a copyright claim \"accrue[s]\" when \"an infringing act occurs.\" Petrella v. Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, Inc., 572 U. S. 663, 670. But under an alternative view, the so-called discovery rule, a claim accrues when \"the plaintiff discovers, or with due diligence should have discovered,\" the infringing act. Ibid., n. 4. That rule enables a diligent plaintiff to raise claims about even very old infringements if he discovered them within the three years prior to suit. In this case, respondent Sherman Nealy invoked the discovery rule to sue Warner Chappell Music for copyright infringements going back ten years. Nealy argued that his claims were timely because he first learned of the infringing conduct less than three years before he sued. In the District Court, Warner Chappell accepted that the discovery rule governed the timeliness of Nealy's claims. But it argued that, even if Nealy could sue under that rule for older infringements, he could recover damages or profits for only those occurring in the last three years. The District Court agreed. On interlocutory appeal, the Eleventh Circuit reversed, rejecting the notion of a three-year damages bar on a timely claim.\n\nIssue:\n\nWhether the Copyright Act's statute of limitations for civil actions, 17 U.S.C. 507(b), precludes retrospective relief for acts that occurred more than three years before the filing of a lawsuit.\n\nHolding: Affirmed.\n\nThe Copyright Act entitles a copyright owner to obtain monetary relief for any timely infringement claim, no matter when the infringement occurred. The Act's statute of limitations establishes a three-year period for filing suit, which begins to run when a claim accrues (here, the Court assumes without deciding, upon its discovery). That provision establishes no separate three-year limit on recovering damages. If any time limit on damages exists, it must come from the Act's remedial sections. But those provisions merely state that an infringer is liable either for statutory damages or for the owner's actual damages and the infringer's profits. See \u00a7504(a)-(c). There is no time limit on monetary recovery. So a copyright owner possessing a timely claim is entitled to damages for infringement, no matter when the infringement occurred.\n\nSkinny:\n\nYou may recover damages for a copyright claim -- even if the infringement happened long ago -- as long as you file the claim within three years of discovering the infringement.", "source": {"uri": "redstate.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Redstate"}, "authors": [{"uri": "susie_moore@redstate.com", "name": "Susie Moore", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asset_forfeiture", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Asset forfeiture"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Supreme Court of the United States"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alabama", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Alabama"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Alabama"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Due_Process_Clause", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Due Process Clause"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Search_and_seizure", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Search and seizure"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preliminary_hearing", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Preliminary hearing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oral_argument", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Oral argument"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Court_of_Appeals_for_the_Eleventh_Circuit", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_property", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Personal property"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Due_process", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Due process"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Damages", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Damages"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methamphetamine", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Methamphetamine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cannabis_(drug)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cannabis (drug)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._state", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "U.S. state"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_district_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States district court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plaintiff", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Plaintiff"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathews_v._Eldridge", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mathews v.

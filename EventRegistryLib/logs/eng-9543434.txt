Four-star Lexington Christian quarterback Cutter Boley participated in spring practice after graduating from high school a semester early. Former Wildcat Beau Allen, who backed up Will Levis in 2021 but spent the last two seasons at FCS-level Tarleton State and Georgia Southern, has returned to UK as a walk-on.\n\nWimsatt entered the portal after losing Rutgers' starting job to Minnesota transfer Athan Kaliakmanis in spring practice. Kaliakmanis reunited at Rutgers with his former Minnesota offensive coordinator Kirk Ciarrocca.\n\nWith 17 interceptions and 14 touchdown passes in his career, Wimsatt might not be able to find a guaranteed starting job at the Power Five level, but the proximity to home and lack of a quarterback with a proven track record as a starter would at least offer appeal at Kentucky. UK coaches were universal in their praise for Vandagriff during spring practice, but he has yet to start a college game now three years removed from being ranked alongside Caleb Williams, Drake Maye, Quinn Ewers and others in the top 10 of the 2021 high school quarterback rankings.\n\nWith Kentucky breaking in a new offense and looking to bounce back from disappointing back-to-back 7-6 seasons, the staff is sure to play the quarterback who proves most capable in practice, regardless of transfer hype.\n\nEven if Vandagriff holds onto the starting job as expected, Wimsatt's running ability could make him an asset in certain packages of new offensive coordinator Bush Hamdan's scheme.\n\n\"I really believe that the quarterback has got to get you at least two first downs a game with his legs,\" Hamdan said at his introductory news conference after being hired from Boise State. \"I think it can be a huge, huge advantage, especially in the college game.\"\n\nIn his final season at Rutgers, Wimsatt rushed for 497 yards and 11 touchdowns on 131 carries.\n\nWimsatt transferring to Kentucky would continue a trend of UK landing locals from the transfer portal who initially chose to play out of state as high-profile high school recruits.\n\nOriginally a member of the high school class of 2022, Wimsatt finished his graduation requirements at Owensboro in September 2021 shortly after leading Owensboro to a win over rival Daviess County in order to enroll at Rutgers that fall amid reports of a significant name, image and likeness contract. Kentucky recruited him out of high school and appeared to lead for his commitment at one point before he pledged to Rutgers.\n\nWimsatt would be the fourth transfer to sign with UK who was rated as a four-star prospect as a senior at a Kentucky high school in recent years, following wide receiver Wan'Dale Robinson (Nebraska), defensive back Jantzen Dunn (Ohio State) and offensive lineman Tanner Bowles (Alabama).\n\nLike Vandagriff, Wimsatt will have two seasons of eligibility remaining at his next school.", "source": {"uri": "kentucky.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Lexington Herald

College football programs are still hosting transfers on visits and attempting to lock up commitments to fill remaining roster holes. Kentucky is once again telling us without telling us that they are shopping in the QB market.\n\nNew offensive coordinator Bush Hamdan inherited a position room with only two scholarship quarterbacks in February. After making a push for UCLA transfer Collin Schlee, the Wildcats hosted a Big Ten transfer on Monday.\n\nRutgers quarterback Gavin Wimsatt was a late entrant into the portal after losing a QB competition to Minnesota transfer Athan Kaliakmanis during spring practice. Now the redshirt junior is looking for a new home.\n\nKentucky could provide that home. Wimsatt is currently visiting Kentucky and could give the Wildcats another player to add to the quarterback room at the Joe Craft Football Training Facility.\n\nGavin Wimsatt was a star quarterback in the class of 2022 playing at Owensboro (Ky.) High. The multi-sport athlete (basketball and baseball) became the starter as a sophomore in 2019 and led the Red Devils to the state semifinals throwing for 2,729 yards and 31 touchdowns. Wimsatt threw for 2,075 yards and 26 touchdowns as a junior in the COVID-19 shortened season in 2020 leading Owensboro to the state championship game.\n\nAfter that season, Wimsatt saw his recruitment blow up. The prospect became a consensus four-star recruit and received an Elite 11 invite. That ultimately led to a commitment to Rutgers in April of his junior season despite a huge push made by Kentucky for the in-state prospect.\n\nAfter playing three games for Owensboro during his senior year, Wimsatt left the program after getting enough coursework done to graduate early and enrolled at Rutgers in September after reclassifying to the 2021 class.\n\nAs a true freshman in 2021, Gavin Wimsatt saw action in four games and was able to preserve his redshirt. The young quarterback played 37 total snaps but showed some pop as a rusher in the Gator Bowl 39 yards on four attempts.\n\nWimsatt returned to Rutgers as a redshirt freshman in 2022 and started six games splitting time with Evan Simon and Noah Vedral under offensive coordinator Sean Gleeson. The Scarlet Knights struggled scoring only 17.4 points per game. Wimsatt finished the season with 757 passing yards (44.8% completion rate, 5.2 yards per attempt) with five touchdowns and seven interceptions. However, Wimsatt did show some pop as a rusher with 152 non-sack rushing yards on 6.6 yards per rush.\n\nAfter the season, Greg Schiano brought in former Minnesota offensive coordinator Kirk Ciarrocca to call plays at Rutgers. Wimsatt would start all 13 games for the Scarlet Knights in 2023, but the results were similar.\n\nThe redshirt sophomore was a very effective rusher (581 non-sack rushing yards with 11 touchdowns on 4.9 yards per rush) but struggled as a passer finishing the year with 1,735 passing yards, 6.0 yards per attempt, nine touchdowns, eight interceptions, and 47.8 percent completion rate.\n\nIn the offseason, Rutgers brought in a transfer, and Wimsatt lost his starting job during a spring position battle. The transfer became a free agent with 21 career starts (1,205 snaps), 2,537 career passing yards, and 28 total touchdowns.\n\nGavin Wimsatt brings a ton of starting experience to the table and his ability to run the football potentially gives him a high floor as a power conference backup. There is still some upside with the quarterback with two years of eligibility remaining, but some drastic growth is needed as a passer.\n\nHere is my scouting write-up on the Big Ten transfer.\n\nGavin Wimsatt (6-3, 225) played in a primarily shotgun offense at Rutgers under offensive coordinator Kirk Ciarocca in 2023 that included a high volume of RPO actions. A team captain at just 19 years old, Wimsatt struggled with three-level accuracy last season on tape. Looks like he aims the ball on short passes around the line of scrimmage and misfires on slants. Better at pushing the ball downfield showing some good touch and ball placement on throws up the seam and down the sideline. Has velocity to drive the football down the middle. Footwork is erratic and leads to misfires on all three levels. Has pocket awareness and good athleticism allowing him to extend plays. Still raw as a pocket passer. North/south runner on zone read concepts who does a good job of reading blocks and getting downhill. Long strider is can get rolling in the long speed department. Can provide a legit threat as a change-of-pace runner with the ability to execute multiple gap scheme runs.\n\nKentucky wants to get back to running the football. New offensive coordinator Bush Hamdan has talked about how important it is for the quarterback to provide some value as a rusher. There is no doubt that Gavin Wimsatt can provide that, but a ton of development as a passer in the pocket will be needed for the transfer.\n\nWimsatt projects as a power conference backup who can provide a short window high floor to the offense thanks to his running ability. The redshirt junior has starter-level tools as a passer but must develop better accuracy quickly as constant misfires can make him turnover-prone and prevent an offense from playing on schedule.", "source": {"uri": "on3.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "On3"}, "authors": [{"uri": "adam_luckett@on3.com", "name": "Adam Luckett", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rutgers_Scarlet_Knights_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rutgers Scarlet Knights football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redshirt_(college_sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Redshirt (college sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Quarterback"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Offensive_coordinator", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Offensive coordinator"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Touchdown", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Touchdown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kentucky", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kentucky"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Kentucky"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Owensboro,_Kentucky", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Owensboro, Kentucky"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Owensboro, Kentucky"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kentucky_Wildcats", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Kentucky Wildcats"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NCAA_transfer_portal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NCAA transfer portal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bush_Hamdan", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bush Hamdan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rutgers_Scarlet_Knights", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rutgers Scarlet Knights"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sophomore", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sophomore"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Franklin_(American_football_coach)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "James Franklin (American football coach)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penn_State_Nittany_Lions_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Penn State Nittany Lions football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_California,_Los_Angeles", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "University of California, Los Angeles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Ten_Conference", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Big Ten Conference"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/College_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "College football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_agent", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Free agent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Track_and_field", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Track and field"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baseball", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kirk_Ciarrocca", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kirk Ciarrocca"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Coronavirus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greg_Schiano", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Greg Schiano"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TaxSlayer_Bowl", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "TaxSlayer Bowl"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interception", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Interception"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Ten-Pin", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Ten-Pin", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Candlepin", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Candlepin", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://on3static.com/uploads/dev/assets/cms/2024/05/06132519/Gavin-Wimsatt.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9543434", "eventUri": "eng-9543434", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.003921568627450966, "wgt": 210, "relevance": 1}

Four-star Lexington Christian quarterback Cutter Boley participated in spring practice after graduating from high school a semester early. Former Wildcat Beau Allen, who backed up Will Levis in 2021 but spent the last two seasons at FCS-level Tarleton State and Georgia Southern, has returned to UK as a walk-on.\n\nWimsatt entered the portal after losing Rutgers' starting job to Minnesota transfer Athan Kaliakmanis in spring practice. Kaliakmanis reunited at Rutgers with his former Minnesota offensive coordinator Kirk Ciarrocca.\n\nWith 17 interceptions and 14 touchdown passes in his career, Wimsatt might not be able to find a guaranteed starting job at the Power Five level, but the proximity to home and lack of a quarterback with a proven track record as a starter would at least offer appeal at Kentucky. UK coaches were universal in their praise for Vandagriff during spring practice, but he has yet to start a college game now three years removed from being ranked alongside Caleb Williams, Drake Maye, Quinn Ewers and others in the top 10 of the 2021 high school quarterback rankings.\n\nWith Kentucky breaking in a new offense and looking to bounce back from disappointing back-to-back 7-6 seasons, the staff is sure to play the quarterback who proves most capable in practice, regardless of transfer hype.\n\nEven if Vandagriff holds onto the starting job as expected, Wimsatt's running ability could make him an asset in certain packages of new offensive coordinator Bush Hamdan's scheme.\n\n\"I really believe that the quarterback has got to get you at least two first downs a game with his legs,\" Hamdan said at his introductory news conference after being hired from Boise State. \"I think it can be a huge, huge advantage, especially in the college game.\"\n\nIn his final season at Rutgers, Wimsatt rushed for 497 yards and 11 touchdowns on 131 carries.\n\nWimsatt transferring to Kentucky would continue a trend of UK landing locals from the transfer portal who initially chose to play out of state as high-profile high school recruits.\n\nOriginally a member of the high school class of 2022, Wimsatt finished his graduation requirements at Owensboro in September 2021 shortly after leading Owensboro to a win over rival Daviess County in order to enroll at Rutgers that fall amid reports of a significant name, image and likeness contract. Kentucky recruited him out of high school and appeared to lead for his commitment at one point before he pledged to Rutgers.\n\nWimsatt would be the fourth transfer to sign with UK who was rated as a four-star prospect as a senior at a Kentucky high school in recent years, following wide receiver Wan'Dale Robinson (Nebraska), defensive back Jantzen Dunn (Ohio State) and offensive lineman Tanner Bowles (Alabama).\n\nLike Vandagriff, Wimsatt will have two seasons of eligibility remaining at his next school.\n\n'I know he has the talent.' Mark Stoops thinks Devin Leary could be NFL starting QB.\n\nCould Ray Davis become the rare Kentucky running back to thrive in NFL with Buffalo Bills?\n\nKentucky ties a program record with two picks in the 2024 NFL draft's third round\n\nThe football transfer portal is open again.

After making a surprising initial move out of high school, the Kentucky native is back on the Big Blue Nation's radar.\n\nKSR's Matt Jones reports Wimsatt is in Lexington to visit with the coaches at the University of Kentucky.\n\nWimsatt was a four-star talent at Owensboro High School, ranked as a top-25 quarterback in the 2021 recruiting class. Heavily pursued by Kentucky, he went against the grain and became the first high-profile commitment during Greg Schiano's second stint as the Scarlet Knights head coach. He made a head-turning move by leaving Owensboro a few games into his senior season to enroll early at Rutgers.\n\nIn 2023 Gavin Wimsatt (6-3, 225 pounds) started all 13 games at quarterback for Rutgers, helping lead the team to a 7-6 finish with a win over Miami in the Pinstripe Bowl. Wimsatt finished the season completing only 47.8 percent of his 22.2 passes per game, putting up 6.0 yards per attempt. He threw for 1,735 yards, nine touchdowns, and eight interceptions as a starter, but used his legs to make plays. Last fall he rushed for 11 touchdowns and in three years at Rutgers he has for over 700 non-sack rushing yards.\n\nThis spring Wimsatt entered the transfer portal after Minnesota transfer Athan Kaliakmanis was named the starting quarterback at Rutgers. The Owensboro native has two years of eligibility remaining.\n\nKentucky brought in Brock Vandagriff from Georgia to be the primary signal-caller for the Cats in 2024. That hasn't stopped new offensive coordinator Bush Hamdan from pursuing other options. UCLA transfer Collin Schlee, another dual-threat quarterback, visited Kentucky before committing to Virginia Tech. With only two scholarship quarterbacks on the roster, Wimsatt could be just what the Cats' new quarterback coach is looking for to fill out his 2024 roster.\n\nKSR has been delivering UK Sports news in the most ridiculous manner for almost two decades.

The Wildcats were among the schools the Owensboro, Kentucky, native spurned to head to Rutgers as a four-star prospect in high school.\n\nWimsatt, who has two years of eligibility remaining, entered the transfer portal last Wednesday -- less than 24 hours after head coach Greg Schiano informed him that Minnesota transfer Athan Kaliakmanis was named the Scarlet Knights' starting quarterback for the 2024 season.\n\nBarring an unexpected reversal, the decision marked the end of up-and-down career in Piscataway.\n\nWimsatt led Rutgers to its first winning season in nearly a decade last fall, helping them finish with a 7-6 record culminating in a win over Miami in the Pinstripe Bowl. He had the greatest rushing season by a quarterback in program history, collecting 493 yards and nine touchdowns on 112 non-sack carries, per ProFootballFocus.\n\nBut Wimsatt struggled mightily through the air, completing just 47.8% of his passes (138/289), marking the lowest completion percentage among the 157 FBS quarterbacks with at least 125 drop backs this season, per ProFootballFocus. His adjusted completion rate (58.8%) the fifth-lowest among the group.\n\nWimsatt finished last season with 1,734 yards, nine touchdowns and eight interceptions.\n\n\"(The coaching staff does) a good job of just evaluating and keeping (where the quarterback battle is leaning) between themselves,\" Wimsatt said after the spring game. \"I think me and Athan do a good job of not getting too caught up in that. We're competing, we're gonna compete, but just picking each other's brains and not letting it affect us off the field. (Athan is) a great guy, he's lifted up our room a really good amount with his experiences.\"\n\nThe quarterback arrived to much fanfare at Rutgers. He enrolled at the school early, skipping his senior season and arriving ahead of the second game of the 2021 season after seeing fellow standout recruit Quinn Ewers do the same at Ohio State. Wimsatt made a stunning debut against Illinois a month later in October, then flashed his potential in a cameo at the Gator Bowl against Wake Forest to conclude the season.\n\nWimsatt's redshirt freshman season was a roller coaster as well. He appeared in Rutgers' first three games last season -- including his first career start against Wagner -- before suffering a lower-body injury that kept him out for three games. He recovered in time to feature in the final five games of the season, but between his inexperience and the lingering injury, he put together a rough statline: 757 yards, five touchdowns and seven interceptions on 65-of-145 passing -- the 44.8% completion rate was the second-lowest among the 146 FBS quarterbacks who threw at least 125 pass attempts this season, per PFF -- to go with 156 rushing yards on 21 non-sack carries.", "source": {"uri": "nj.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NJ.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rutgers_Scarlet_Knights_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rutgers Scarlet Knights football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Quarterback"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kentucky", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kentucky"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Kentucky"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kentucky_Wildcats_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kentucky Wildcats football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota_Golden_Gophers_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota Golden Gophers football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rutgers_Scarlet_Knights", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rutgers Scarlet Knights"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greg_Schiano", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Greg Schiano"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pro_Football_Focus", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pro Football Focus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_school_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "High school football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_coach", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Head coach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Touchdown", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Touchdown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Owensboro,_Kentucky", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Owensboro, Kentucky"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Owensboro, Kentucky"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NCAA_Division_I_Football_Bowl_Subdivision", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NCAA Division I Football Bowl Subdivision"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinstripe_Bowl", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pinstripe Bowl"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interception", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Interception"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piscataway,_New_Jersey", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Piscataway, New Jersey"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quinn_Ewers", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Quinn Ewers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wake_Forest_Demon_Deacons_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wake Forest Demon Deacons football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TaxSlayer_Bowl", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "TaxSlayer Bowl"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ohio_State_Buckeyes_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ohio State Buckeyes football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redshirt_(college_sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Redshirt (college sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illinois", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Illinois"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Illinois"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Candlepin", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Candlepin", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://www.nj.com/resizer/v2/NYLVZP5FI5HZXI6RUEYL265OHM.jpg?auth=89c6eca2b6a87d8f502b70b6a87047ed8dd114dd3c0bfaa76631af810c888ec7&width=1280&quality=90", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9543434", "eventUri": "eng-9543434", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.09019607843137245, "wgt": 205, "relevance": 1}

The Scarlet Knights basically traded a quarterback-run attack for a more balanced one.\n\n\"We knew exactly what Athan is and what he was going to be able to do,\" Rutgers coach Greg Schiano said on BTN. \"I think our quarterback room is as strong as it's ever been in all my years as the head coach here at Rutgers.\"\n\nSchiano said that hours before Wimsatt went in the portal.\n\nNow it's Kaliakmanis' job. Will Schiano's decision to bring in a high-profile transfer -- which led to the transfer of his 2023 starter -- work?\n\nThere's no better year for Rutgers to answer that question.\n\nAfter going a combined 1-29 against Michigan, Ohio State and Penn State the past decade, the Scarlet Knights avoid all three in 2024. Ditto for Oregon, perhaps the Big Ten favorite.\n\nUCLA, Southern California and Washington are on the docket. And so is Nebraska.\n\nRutgers visits Lincoln Oct. 5 for Husker Homecoming. NU has won all five matchups since 2014, when Rutgers joined the Big Ten, so Husker fans may have a knee-jerk expectation to win again next season.\n\nPump the brakes.\n\nIf Kaliakmanis -- who has already beaten Nebraska twice -- delivers a more consistent performance under Ciarrocca, Rutgers could have its best team since Schiano's first stint at the school in the mid-2000s.\n\nThe Scarlet Knights have a proven placekicker in Jai Patel, who made 15 of 19 field goals last season. They bring back the bulk of a defense that allowed 313.5 yards and 21.2 points per game. Those figures ranked 16th and 33rd in the FBS.\n\nDefensive lineman Aaron Lewis and linebacker Mohamed Toure are All-Big Ten-caliber players, and Schiano's scheme consistently forces opposing offenses to take long drives. Rutgers allowed 11 plays of 30 yards or longer last season.\n\nRutgers also returns one of the nation's best running backs in Kyle Monangai, who rushed for 1,262 yards and eight touchdowns last season. The 5-foot-9, 200-pounder opted to return for 2024 after considering the NFL draft. He runs behind a seasoned offensive line anchored by 6-8, 345-pound left tackle Hollin Pierce.\n\nFor Rutgers' first seven years in the league, the gap between its rush offense and rush defense was minus-1.18 yards per carry. In the past three years, the gap shrunk to minus-0.26 yards per carry. That speaks to Rutgers' growing competence along the lines.\n\nThe Scarlet Knights' fundamental struggle boils down to this: They can't pass the ball.\n\nThey haven't averaged more than 200 passing yards per game since 2015.\n\nIn five of the subsequent eight seasons, they've averaged fewer than 150 yards. The nadir came in 2018, when in an extraordinary display of incompetence, Rutgers had five touchdown passes against 22 interceptions and a pass efficiency rating of 78.84. No FBS team has been worse since.\n\nEven last year while Wimsatt rumbled for 497 yards and 11 touchdowns, Rutgers couldn't get its passing game off the ground.\n\nAfter a 6-2 start, Rutgers lost its last four regular-season contests. The four-game passing stat line: 40 for 93, two touchdowns, four interceptions, 5.6 yards per attempt. In a 42-24 loss to close the regular season, Wimsatt completed 13 of 34 passes.\n\n\"Consistency comes last,\" Schiano told Rutgers reporters that day in late November. \"But he's done some really good stuff. Today wasn't his best day, but I can say that for a lot of guys.\"\n\nOn Dec. 28, Rutgers beat Miami 31-24 in the Pinstripe Bowl. Just after New Year's Day, Kaliakmanis picked Rutgers as his transfer destination.\n\nIt's no cinch Kaliakmanis provides Rutgers with \"the guy.\"\n\nWithout Ciarrocca, he threw for 1,838 yards and 14 touchdowns at Minnesota -- which had a pretty talented group of receivers. P.J. Fleck offered New Hampshire transfer Max Brosmer a scholarship before Kaliakmanis even hit the portal.\n\nBut it's possible, too, Kaliakmanis provides Rutgers with enough stability that, when coupled with a solid run game, gives the Scarlet Knights a competitive offense. A Sept. 21 trip to Virginia Tech should offer clues. Washington visits a week later. Then the trip to Nebraska.\n\nIf Rutgers comes out of that three-game stretch with two wins, who knows? Maybe this is an eight-win team. Even a nine-win team.\n\nIn that way, Rutgers mirrors Nebraska's potential -- and Nebraska's potential question mark.\n\nWhoever \"passes\" the test might be the victor Oct. 5 -- and throughout 2024.\n\nPhotos: Nebraska football spring game", "source": {"uri": "omaha.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Omaha.com"}, "authors": [{"uri": "sam_mckewon@omaha.com", "name": "Sam McKewon", "type":

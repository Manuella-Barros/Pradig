Of course, we could not function well without the electricity we use to power our lights, ovens, TVs and computers. Over the last few years, as we have had some significant storms in Northern California, our home has lost power multiple times. Each time it does, I yell at the power company and brood because I can't do much of what I usually do when the power is off. In my case, I have a significant workstation set up in my study, where, at last count, I have three computers, a 49-inch monitor, and at least 12 other tech gadgets connected. The good news is that all but the monitor have batteries and sometimes run for many hours without power. On the other hand, my Wi-Fi needs electricity to operate, and when it goes down, doing any work that demands connectivity comes to a standstill. I have been pondering and researching the role of power and electricity in our lives a great deal recently. In my hometown of San Jose, demand for housing is strong. Every time I see new high-rise apartments or condos going up, I ask, \"Do we have enough power/electricity for people to live there?\" Some of these new complexes, in some cases with at least 100 units, will be a new drain on our power grid. I ask the same question when I hear of new data centers being built: What will power them, and how will these new facilities impact the local power grid? Now, in the age of AI, where electricity demand is even more critical, I have been asking what it will take to power our AI future.

Why it matters: This scarcity crisis is among the top threats to America building out AI at scale, and maintaining its edge over China on the large-language models that power AI tools. It takes an insane amount of data, then awesome programming intelligence \u2014 human technologists \u2014 to create human-like AI. But that's just table stakes. It then takes an insane amount of compute power to will their data and work into existence \u2014 then a mind-blowing amount of actual energy to make it all happen. We're short on all of it. Mark Zuckerberg, Meta's founder and CEO, said in a podcast interview that the equivalent output of one nuclear power plant can be needed to train a single AI model. Rene Haas, CEO of the chip-design company Arm, told The Wall Street Journal that AI models, including OpenAI's ChatGPT, \"are just insatiable in terms of their thirst [for electricity]. ... The more information they gather, the smarter they are, but the more information they gather to get smarter, the more power it takes.\" Please read the whole Axios article, as it also points out the other issue facing AI's future: the human talent needed to create the AI hardware and software necessary to deliver the type of AI solutions we will need for an AI industrial age. One fascinating solution for providing more clean power, championed by Bill Gates, is to create small nuclear reactors, including micro-reactors and small modular reactors (SMRs). Gates has invested in TerraPower to create an advanced nuclear foundation for clean energy. Although TerraPower Natrium Reactor's primary focus is on clean energy, given Gates's background and tech interests, you can bet he is also thinking of small modular reactors to power large data centers and AI inferencing computing. The other solution is hydroelectric power plants. Many of these are already in the U.S., but to power AI in addition to current needs, these plants need to be expanded exponentially to handle increased AI workloads. The demand for power needed to train new AI models and power AI solutions, giant data centers, and people tapping into our power grids needs to become a greater priority for the U.S. and governments around the world. Our current power plants and grids were not designed for the modern computing needs and demands of today and the future. Many believe we are on the cusp of an AI industrial age, but we are still determining how to power it. Follow me on Twitter. Check out my website.

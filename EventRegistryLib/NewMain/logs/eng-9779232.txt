Last year, Ferry released a deluxe edition of this 1994 solo album Mamouna, and it featured a full unreleased album as a bonus. Today, Ferry announces plans for a career-spanning box set called Retrospective: Selected Recordings 1973-2023. It'll feature more previously unreleased music, including Ferry's first new original song in 10 years.\n\nIn recent years, Bryan Ferry has released a lot of covers, as well as reimaginings of his own music. He hasn't released any new original songs since his 2014 album Avonmore, but that's about to change. The 81-track Retrospective box set will include the new song \"Star,\" a collaboration with the Glasgow musician Amelia Barratt.\n\nRetrospective will also include a lot of cover songs, since those have long been a staple of Ferry's solo career. The first single from Ferry's first solo album, 1973's These Foolish Things, was an arch take on Bob Dylan's \"A Hard Rain's A-Gonna Fall,\" and Ferry has covered Dylan plenty of times over the years. Along with the Retrospective announcement, Ferry has shared a newly recorded Dylan cover, his luxe take on Dylan's playful 1965 classic \"She Belongs To Me.\" Below, listen to Ferry's cover and Dylan's original.", "source": {"uri": "stereogum.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Stereogum"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bryan_Ferry", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bryan Ferry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roxy_Music", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Roxy Music"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glam_rock", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Glam rock"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Box_set", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Box set"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Hard_Rain's_a-Gonna_Fall", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "A Hard Rain's a-Gonna Fall"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/These_Foolish_Things_(Remind_Me_of_You)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "These Foolish Things (Remind Me of You)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/15th_Annual_Grammy_Awards", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "15th Annual Grammy Awards"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Dylan", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bob Dylan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cover_version", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cover version"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glasgow", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Glasgow"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Glasgow"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Reviews", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Reviews", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Lyrics", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Lyrics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Children/Recordings", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Children/Recordings", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Musical", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Musical", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Weddings/Music", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Weddings/Music", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 64}], "image": "https://static.stereogum.com/uploads/2024/07/Bryan-Ferry-1722432803.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9779232", "eventUri": "eng-9779232", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2078431372549019, "wgt": 208, "relevance": 1}

It begins, aptly enough, with 'Disc One: The Best Of Bryan Ferry' gathering 20 essential tracks.\n\nThe second disc - 'Disco Two: Compositions' - examines the 1977-2014 period, and how Ferry's craft has evolved. 'Disc Three: Interpretations' focusses on Bryan Ferry's gifts as a vocalist and arranger, reinterpreting material by other artists by interpolating it into his own aura.\n\n'Disc Four: The Bryan Ferry Orchestra' probes his fondness for jazz, in particular a decade-long run of work with full swing orchestras. The final disc opens the vaults - 'Disc Five: Rare and Unreleased' contains a version of Roxy Music's 'Mother Of Pearl' recorded in the early-1990s with Ronnie Spector on backing vocals; a take on 'Don't Be Cruel' bolstered by Elvis's original rockabilly bandmates Scotty Moore and DJ Fontana; and a version of John Lennon's knockabout smash 'Whatever Gets You Thru The Night'.\n\nIn all, the project contains some 81 tracks - including 'Star', the first original Bryan Ferry song to be released in over a decade.\n\nAvailable to pre-order now, it's led by a 2024 re-imagining of Bob Dylan's 'She Belongs To Me' - Dylan is a recurring touchstone in his work, and this emotive take is pristine Ferry.\n\nThe release is part of a new five track EP titled 'Retrospective: She Belongs To Me' - the first of three digital EP releases that will accompany 'Retrospective: Selected Recordings 1973-2023' over the coming months.", "source": {"uri": "clashmusic.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Clash Magazine"}, "authors": [{"uri": "robin_murray@clashmusic.com", "name": "Robin Murray", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bryan_Ferry", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bryan Ferry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Record_chart", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Record chart"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roxy_Music", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Roxy Music"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swing_music", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Swing music"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arrangement", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Arrangement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jazz", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jazz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disco", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Disco"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don't_Be_Cruel", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Don't Be Cruel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronnie_Spector", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ronnie Spector"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/D._J._Fontana", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "D.

This edition of the quadrennial European football tournament began June 14 and is entering its knockout stage, when the 16 teams left in the competition will look to progress to the quarterfinals. With Spain\u2019s hopes of winning their fourth Euros still very much alive, Xinhua took to the streets Friday to ask locals who they thought might win the final in Berlin\u2019s Olympic Stadium July 14. \u201cI think Germany could do very well, England also has a good chance, but I think just about the best right now is Spain because they are undefeated,\u201d Pol Montero told Xinhua. While Ariadna Matamoros shared Pol\u2019s positive opinion of Spain, she was less confident about their chances of lifting the trophy: \u201cI hope Spain wins because it\u2019s my country and I think they have very good players, but I don\u2019t think they will win, I think that Italy will win.\u201d Alba Martinez was more optimistic about Spain\u2019s chances but admitted they had some tough competition. \u201cI want Spain to win because they\u2019re my team and I think that this year we have a good chance, but Italy and Germany and Austria also have possibilities,\u201d she told Xinhua. Meanwhile, Alvaro Aviles told Xinhua that he had \u201clost a lot of enthusiasm for Spain.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s not the team it used to be. Also, I don\u2019t like the coach. If they win that\u2019s fine, but I want Germany to win,\u201d he said. Germany is also unbeaten so far in the tournament, while teams like France, Belgium and England have failed to impress and have managed only one win each. \u201cI\u2019ve seen all the teams play but none of them have quite convinced me like in other years. Spain seems [only] to be doing a little better, even though I\u2019m Spanish. But we\u2019ll have to see how things go from now on,\u201d said Jose Maria Baldoma. Martinez agreed that some of the top national teams had so far failed to live up to expectations. \u201cI must say that I expected more from France, England and Portugal. But Portugal lost against Georgia, for example, I didn\u2019t expect that,\u201d she said. Also, with Portugal and the Netherlands losing their final group matches to Georgia and Austria respectively, Euro 2024 is throwing up plenty of surprises. \u201cThere are always surprises. In the 2010 World Cup, Spain lost the first match against Switzerland. In the last World Cup in Qatar, Argentina lost the first match against Saudi Arabia. Then they were both champions. Football is like that, if football were predictable it wouldn\u2019t be fun,\u201d added Aviles.", "summary": "<img width=\"300\" height=\"169\" src=\"https://www.orissapost.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Spain-National-Football-Team-Players-in-a-Huddle-380x214-1-300x169.jpg\" class=\"webfeedsFeaturedVisual wp-post-image\" alt=\"\" style=\"display: block; margin: auto; margin-bottom: 5px;max-width: 100%;\" link_thumbnail=\"\" decoding=\"async\" srcset=\"https://www.orissapost.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Spain-National-Football-Team-Players-in-a-Huddle-380x214-1-300x169.jpg 300w, https://www.orissapost.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Spain-National-Football-Team-Players-in-a-Huddle-380x214-1.jpg 380w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" />Barcelona (Spain): Spain may have won all their matches so far at Euro 2024, but many Spaniards remain unconvinced about their national team&#8217;s chances of going all the way to the title.

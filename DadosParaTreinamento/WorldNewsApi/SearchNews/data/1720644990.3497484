After an insider alleged that 'it\u2019s pretty clear a divorce is imminent' for the couple, the superstar, 54, is said to be 'taking steps to protect herself' from any public scrutiny. 'She\u2019d love to save things, but if she can\u2019t she\u2019s vowed to at least come out on top,' a source told The Sun of the singer's decision to hire specialists to advise her on how to proceed professionally after cancelling her summer tour to be with her family. On Wednesday, the On the Floor hitmaker seemingly had a message for her critics as she addressed that 'there's a lot of negativity out in the world right now.' 'But don't let the voices of a few drown out that there is soooo much love out there,' she reminded friends in her OntheJLo newsletter. 'Thank you, thank you, thank you. I love you all so much.' Last month, she shocked the world by announcing that she had scrapped her This Is Me... Live tour. At the time, DailyMail.com was given a statement on the cancelation. 'Representatives for Live Nation announced today that the Jennifer Lopez US Summer 2024 Tour THIS IS ME...LIVE is canceled. 'Jennifer is taking time off to be with her children, family and close friends,' it was added. 'For those who purchased through Ticketmaster, tickets will automatically be refunded \u2013 there is nothing further fans need to do. 'For those who purchased via third-party resale sites such as SeatGeek, StubHub, VividSeats, etc. \u2013 please reach out to your point of purchase for more details.' Jennifer also sent this special message to her fans through her OntheJLo site. 'I am completely heartsick and devastated about letting you down,' the Hustlers star began. 'Please know that I wouldn\u2019t do this if I didn\u2019t feel that it was absolutely necessary. 'I promise I will make it up to you and we will all be together again. I love you all so much. Until next time\u2026' wrote the producer. A source told DailyMail.com that Lopez was sad to be dropping out of the tour, which was selling well, but needed to be home at this time. 'She\u2019s taking time off to be with family and close friends,' said the insider as they noted she had been rehearsing often for the show and was ready to commit, but felt it was time for a break. 'This was a very difficult decision made by Jennifer this week and she\u2019s sorry to her fans.' This decision was not made around ticket sales as the tour was actually doing well in most key cities and there had been a good uptick, a source told DailyMail.com. There were rumors the tour was not selling well when it was billed as This Is Me... Now in support of her recent album that went with her film. But when it was changed to a greatest hits tour called This Is Me... Live, tickets started selling very well. She has just come off promoting her scifi movie Atlas. 'Jennifer had a huge hit with her film Atlas, it was number one all over the world, and she is proud of that and now wants some time at home.' Indeed, Atlas, which she starred in and produced, was number one in 55 countries. And the film was in the top 10 in 93 countries. X users flocked to react to the news of the cancellation, including one saying Lopez made the decision to 'save' her marriage. 'She cancelled because she didn't sell enough tickets,' one X user speculated. Another wrote: 'Translation = No one wants to see her show no wthat they know she aint' singing' 'The lack of Jennifer Lopez fans is what canceled her tour,' a third troll snarked. This comes after Jennifer recently talked about how she loves to stay home. During an interview with Harper's Bazaar, she said that she is happiest at her $60M Bel Air, California mansion that Affleck moved out of. 'I love to cook. My kids love to bake. I love hosting at home, family and friends, especially now that the weather is warmer. I like to have people over. I don\u2019t like to go out a bunch,' said the star. And she told AP that she has slowed her career down, adding she goes at 'half' the speed she used to. Lopez explained that she has 'been doing things that are really exciting' or 'inspiring' to her as opposed to 'doing just everything.' Meanwhile, UsWeekly claimed that she is reportedly on the rocks with Affleck because she works too much. Jennifer went into detail with Harper's Bazaar about how much she loves to relax at home. 'Sometimes it\u2019s a brunch or an afternoon by the pool, or a nice small dinner with a few friends,' said the Hustlers star. 'Even just an everyday kind of like\u2014a friend coming over and sitting down by the fire.' The Bronx native also said: 'It\u2019s all those things that to me are the artful moments of your life. It\u2019s like creating the most beautiful life you can for yourself, and creating these moments that are unforgettable for you and your family and friends. To me, that\u2019s really what the Delola lifestyle is about: creating beautiful moments.' Meanwhile, UsWeekly has claimed that Jennifer overextends herself.' The source went on to state that Ben 'doesn't agree with Jennifer's lifestyle' and now feels 'worn down' by their marriage. Ben is said to have 'checked out' of their relationship and the insider added that he and Jennifer are on 'two completely different pages most of the time.' Another source close to Jennifer suggested the couple's work commitments have also caused a rift, saying, 'both have demanding careers that often require them to be in different cities.' With the pair forced to spend time apart in recent months as a result of their careers - she went to NYC for the Met Gala and to shoot Kiss Of The Spider Woman while he was in LA shooting The Accountant 2 - the insider said the absence 'highlighted the emotional and physical distance between them.' They said: 'Over time, Jennifer and Ben found it increasingly difficult to communicate effectively, and small misunderstandings grew into significant arguments. 'They have fundamentally different approaches to conflict', the insider added, explaining that Jennifer prefers to confront issues head-on, while Ben isn't as quick to open up. As they navigate their work obligations, often from opposite coasts, communication has also become a source of contention between the duo. The couple also have 'fundamentally different approaches to conflict' as Affleck tends to withdraw and Lopez prefers to talk things out. Affleck wed Lopez in 2022 after a 2021 reunion. They were first an item 20 years ago and even got engaged, but broke it off before 2004. People, however, had a more positive stance on Bennifer last month. 'They just have very different approaches when it comes to media attention,' said a source. 'Ben hates all attention and it makes him very uncomfortable. Jennifer has always had a different approach.' It was added it is just not 'his way' to share so much of his personal life. 'It doesn't make him happy and causes stress in his life and then in hers. There is no question their different styles clash,' added the source. A third source, from the music world, relayed: 'She needs that expression but Affleck simply is not comfortable with it. After a while it causes tension in the relationship. 'He is more introspective and private. She likes to open her heart to her fans and to the world. This makes them considerably different, and it has been difficult in the day-to-day relationship.' The People source said they will stick it out. 'There have always been clashes in their styles, how they handle issues, and their actions, but nothing has stopped their love over the years. This is a great love story,' the insider shared.", "summary": "Jennifer Lopez has\u00a0reportedly hired a\u00a0crisis PR team to help her next steps as she navigates the possible end to her nearly two-year marriage to husband Ben Affleck.", "url": "https://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-13509029/Jennifer-Lopez-hired-crisis-PR-team-Ben-Affleck-split-rumors.html?ns_mchannel=rss&ns_campaign=1490&ito=1490", "image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2024/06/08/16/85876561-0-image-m-12_1717860459336.jpg", "video": "https://videos.dailymail.co.uk/video/mol/2024/05/21/429647099087599089/1024x576_MP4_429647099087599089.mp4", "publish_date": "2024-06-08 15:49:42", "author": "Deirdre Durkan-Simonds,Editor,Heidi Parker", "authors": ["Deirdre Durkan-Simonds", "Editor", "Heidi Parker"], "language": "en", "source_country": "GB", "sentiment": -0.115}

Licensed firearm dealers in TT maintain strict accountability, reporting daily sales to the police and submit quarterly hard copies. The US should reconsider its decision as restricting sales to licensed dealers and firearm user\u2019s licence (FUL) holders undermines the ability of law-abiding citizens to protect themselves against armed criminals. Given that a significant portion of illegal firearms in TT originate from the US, it would be more effective for the US to support legal sales to vetted individuals. This approach would empower responsible citizens and enhance public safety, while addressing the root of the problem by focusing on illegal arms trafficking. Why is TT blacklisted when, more than likely, 90 per cent of our arms and ammunition come from the US?

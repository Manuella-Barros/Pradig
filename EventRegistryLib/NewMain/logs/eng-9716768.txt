The two were on vacation\n\nJudge Andre Manssourian speaks during a court hearing for Jaden Cunningham, Malachi Darnell, and Leroy McCrary. He was puzzled as to why none of them showed up, adding that he heard it may have been because of 'a 24-hour psychiatric hold.'\n\nAnd McCrary - who cops say led them on a high-speed 30-mile plus chase while fleeing the scene of the botched robbery - was also charged with evading police while driving recklessly.\n\nPolice say that Darnell and Cunningham, both wearing masks, jumped out of a white Toyota Camry driven by McCrary and accosted the McKays as they were walking outside the Barnes & Noble store.\n\nOne of the suspects allegedly put a gun to the head of Mr. McKay, 69, demanding his watch and forcing him to the ground.\n\nWhen they couldn't get the watch, say cops, the robbers turned on McKay, who was holding several shopping bags.\n\nAs McKay fought to hang on to the bags, Cunningham allegedly dragged her into the street in front of the white Toyota getaway car with McCrary at the wheel.\n\nProsecutors say Douglas McKay jumped in front of the vehicle to protect his wife, but McCrary, with Darnell back in the car, accelerated and forced the husband out of the way, then ran over McKay, trapping her under the vehicle and dragging her until she was dead.\n\nPolice arrested McCrary, pictured, after he was forced to hide behind trash cans between houses after the overweight narcotics addict ran out of puff fleeing cops following the fatal mall robbery\n\nTrish McKay and her husband had been outside a Barnes & Noble bookstore at the Fashion Island mall when they were approached by two men. McCrary (above) and two teenagers were taken into custody after the men fled the scene\n\nCunningham was was still running toward the moving escape vehicle, trying to jump in and a Good Samaritan was chasing him, trying to stop him.\n\nBut, according to cops, the pursuer gave up the chase when Darnell fired three shots toward him from the Toyota and Cunningham got away with his two accomplices. Nobody was hit by gunfire.\n\nThe men fled north toward Los Angeles with the Toyota reaching speeds of up to 110mph, say police, who eventually were able to pull the car over and arrest all three.\n\nThe victim's husband Douglas McKay - a prominent businessman and community leader in New Zealand's capital, Auckland - was not injured in the incident.\n\nMeanwhile Los Angeles County Sheriff George Gascon - and CA Democrat Governor Gavin Newsom - are facing a growing storm of anger over why one of the accused men - McCrary, 26, - was free on probation instead of behind bars for a string of earlier LA convictions, including one last year for a similar robbery.\n\nProsecutors say that before last week's robbery and killing, McCrary had prior convictions for residential burglary in 2018, criminal threats in 2020, and robbery in 2023.\n\nLeroy McCrary, pictured, has a criminal history including a chillingly similar hold up at a different upmarket beach community\n\nGeneral view of the Fashion Island Mall in Newport Beach, California where the the McKays were targeted for robbery. It is generally considered a safe location\n\nThe scene where the three men were pulled over after allegedly killing McKay. They were driving at speeds of up to 110mph, police say\n\nHe pleaded no congest last year to the robbery charge plus another of being a drug addict in possession of a firearm. Yet he was only sentenced to two years probation and a three-year prison sentence was suspended, leaving him free on the streets.\n\n'Our shopping centers and malls have become hunting grounds for criminals who are stalking innocent shoppers to rob them blind because our Governor and our Legislature refuse to hold anyone accountable for their actions,' blasted Republican Orange County District Attorney Todd Spitzer when he announced the charges against the three men.\n\nHe said that McKay's murder was a crime 'that should have never happened,' adding, 'Lawlessness and violence will not be tolerated in our society.'\n\nNewport Beach Mayor Will O'Neill reacted with anger to the horrendous slaying of McKay, saying that McCrary 'shouldn't have been in free society' because of his past crimes.\n\n'Frankly, to hell with these guys... These are thugs. Every community is now dealing with this. We have to do better as a society. We cannot tolerate this.'\n\nAsked to explain why McCrary didn't get jail time for his previous crimes, Gascon said in a statement that 'the case against him had significant problems with proof' so 'the management team at the court authorized a plea offer that allowed him to be placed on probation,' plus a prison sentence that was suspended.\n\nDailyMail.com asked a spokesman for Orange County Superior Court if a judge there is empowered to order a jail inmate to be physically compelled to come to court for a scheduled appearance if he refuses to leave his cell but we have not yet received

Two masked men jumped out, and authorities say one put a gun to the businessman's head, demanding his watch and forcing him to the ground.\n\nThe other dragged Trish McKay into the street, in front of the Camry, while trying to wrest the shopping bags away from her.\n\nBy then, the Camry and its getaway driver were moving forward. Doug McKay jumped in front of the vehicle to try to save his wife. But authorities say the driver -- identified by police as Leroy Ernest Joseph McCrary -- ran over the woman, dragging her body 65 feet across the parking lot.\n\nA good Samaritan, Beau Bayless, chased after the fleeing car. But police say his efforts were cut short when one of the robbers fired three shots at him.\n\nEyewitnesses immediately called 911, and within minutes, police had begun a pursuit of the Camry as it raced north toward Los Angeles County, reaching speeds of up to 110 mph. A television news helicopter captured video of the car speeding on the left shoulder of the 105 Freeway and at one point grazing the concrete median.\n\nOne of the men -- later identified by police as Jaden Cunningham -- was arrested after he bailed out of the vehicle in the city of Cypress. McCrary and the other suspect -- identified as Malachi Eddward Darnell -- were arrested later in South Gate.\n\nProsecutors have charged the men with murder.\n\nDoug McKay, 69, is the former chair of the Bank of New Zealand and a prominent energy and business executive who served three years as the first chief executive of the Auckland Council, created in 2010 for the region's \"supercity.\"\n\nProsecutors say the couple were visiting Newport Beach, a hot spot for upscale tourists and deemed one of the region's safer cities.\n\nThe pair were friends with New Zealand Prime Minister Christopher Luxon, who described the death of Trish McKay, 68, as \"an absolute tragedy\" and extended condolences to family and friends in a message on X.\n\nMcKay's family is still reeling from her death. In a statement after the killing, the family said: \"No words can express our sadness as we try to come to terms with the loss of our mother, wife, and friend Patricia. We ask for privacy at this time as we work through this as a family.\"\n\nIn a statement issued over the weekend, a family spokesperson expressed \"deep gratitude\" for the support they had received in the wake of the killing and said they hoped to have McKay's remains returned to New Zealand within the next week.\n\nOrange County prosecutors last week charged three men with murder with a felony enhancement in McKay's death, making them eligible for the death penalty. California has had a moratorium on carrying out the death penalty since 2019 and has not executed anyone since 2006.\n\nThe trio -- McCrary, 26, of Los Angeles; Darnell, 18, also of Los Angeles; and Cunningham, 18, of Lancaster -- made brief video appearances from their cells via video links after refusing to appear in court Monday as required. The judge scheduled a new arraignment and plea hearing for Wednesday and ordered the men to appear then.\n\nMcCrary is a third-striker who had not served prison time for his most recent two felony convictions in L.A. County. He also faces charges of felony attempted second-degree robbery and evading while driving recklessly. He was previously convicted of residential burglary in 2018, criminal threats in 2020 and robbery in 2023, all in L.A. County, according to prosecutors.\n\nIn 2023, McCrary pleaded no contest to charges of robbery and being a narcotics addict in possession of a firearm. He was sentenced to two years of probation with three years in state prison suspended.\n\nHe also was previously arrested in a nearly identical armed robbery. Santa Monica police said McCrary and another suspect placed a gun to the head of a man while stealing his Rolex in September 2022. He was arrested in January 2023 while in court on another case, and it was that robbery case that resulted in a suspended sentence and two years' probation.\n\nWhen asked to explain the lack of prison time for McCrary, the Los Angeles County district attorney's office said in a statement: \"The case against [him] had significant problems with proof. As a result of these issues, the management team at the Airport Court authorized a plea offer that allowed Mr. [McCrary] to be placed on probation with a suspended state prison sentence.\"\n\nThe office called the latest crime with which McCrary has been charged \"reprehensible.\"\n\nIn addition to the murder charge against him, Darnell faces charges of attempted second-degree robbery, attempted murder and personal use of a firearm, as well as a felony enhancement of personal discharge of a firearm.\n\nCunningham is also charged with attempted second-degree robbery in addition to murder.\n\nOrange County Dist. Atty. Todd Spitzer said he was particularly outraged that the crime occurred at a landmark shopping mall.\n\n\"Our entire community extends its deepest sympathies to the loved ones of Patricia McKay and to the entire country of New Zealand as we mourn her senseless death in the commission of a crime that should have never happened,\" Spitzer said in a statement announcing the charges. \"Lawlessness and violence will not be tolerated in our society.\"", "source": {"uri": "latimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Los Angeles Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Nobody was hit by gunfire.\n\nThe men then fled north toward Los Angeles with the Toyota reaching speeds of up to 110mph.\n\nAs it sped through Los Angeles County, Cunningham bolted out of the car and was arrested, according to police.\n\nMcCrary and Darnell were later arrested in a residential community in South Gate.\n\nPolice arrested Leroy McCrary McCrary, pictured, following a high-speed chase\n\nMcCrary and his accomplices are now facing murder and robbery charges\n\nAll three suspects are now facing murder charges with felony enhancements that make them eligible for the death penalty, as well as second-degree robbery.\n\nIn addition, Darnell is charged with attempted murder and discharging a firearm after allegedly firing at the Good Samaritan.\n\nAnd McCrary - who cops say acted as the driver - was also charged with evading police while driving recklessly.\n\nThey are all due back in court on Wednesday.\n\nIn the meantime, Los Angeles County Sheriff George Gascon is facing a growing storm of anger for his decision to allow McCrary to be free on probation instead of behind bars for a string of earlier LA convictions - including one last year for a similar robbery.\n\nProsecutors say that before last week's robbery and killing, McCrary had prior convictions for residential burglary in 2018, criminal threats in 2020, and robbery in 2023.\n\nHe pleaded no contest last year to the robbery charge plus another of being a drug addict in possession of a firearm. Yet he was only sentenced to two years probation and a three-year prison sentence was suspended, leaving him free on the streets.\n\n'Our shopping centers and malls have become hunting grounds for criminals who are stalking innocent shoppers to rob them blind because our Governor and our Legislature refuse to hold anyone accountable for their actions,' blasted Republican Orange County District Attorney Todd Spitzer when he announced the charges against the three men.\n\nHe said that McKay's murder was a crime 'that should have never happened,' adding, 'Lawlessness and violence will not be tolerated in our society.'\n\nMcCrary, pictured, has a criminal history including a chillingly similar hold up at a different upmarket beach community\n\nNewport Beach Mayor Will O'Neill also reacted with anger to the horrendous slaying of McKay, saying that McCrary 'shouldn't have been in free society' because of his past crimes.\n\n'Frankly, to hell with these guys... These are thugs. Every community is now dealing with this. We have to do better as a society. We cannot tolerate this.'\n\nAsked to explain why McCrary didn't get jail time for his previous crimes, Gascon said in a statement that 'the case against him had significant problems with proof' so 'the management team at the court authorized a plea offer that allowed him to be placed on probation,' plus a prison sentence that was suspended.", "source": {"uri": "expressdigest.com", "dataType":

Two masked men got out and, authorities said, one of them pointed a gun at the businessman's head, demanded his watch and forced him to the ground.\n\nThe other dragged Trish McKay out into the street in front of the Camry while trying to grab the shopping bags from her.\n\nAt the time, the Camry and its driver were moving forward. Doug McKay jumped in front of the vehicle to try to save his wife. But authorities say the driver, identified by police as Leroy Ernest Joseph McCrary, ran over the woman, dragging her body 20 yards across the parking lot.\n\nA good Samaritan, Beau Bayless, gave chase to the getaway car. But police say his efforts were thwarted when one of the robbers fired three shots in his direction.\n\nWitnesses immediately called 911, and minutes later police began chasing the Camry as it sped north toward Los Angeles County, reaching speeds of 110 mph. A television helicopter captured the car speeding along the left shoulder of the 105 Freeway and at one point brushing the concrete median.\n\nOne of the men, later identified by police as Jaden Cunningham, was arrested after jumping from the vehicle in the town of Cypress. McCrary and the other suspect, identified as Malachi Edward Darnell, were later arrested in South Gate.\n\nDoug McKay, 69, is a former chairman of the Bank of New Zealand and a prominent energy and business executive who spent three years as the first chief executive of Auckland Council, created in 2010 for the region's supercity.\n\nProsecutors say the couple was visiting Newport Beach, a popular spot for high-end tourists and considered one of the safest cities in the area.\n\nThe couple were friends with New Zealand Prime Minister Christopher Luxon, who described the death of Trish McKay, 68, as an absolute tragedy and offered his condolences to family and friends. a message on X.\n\nThe McKays family is still reeling from her death. In a statement after the killing, the family said: \"No words can express our sadness as we try to cope with the loss of our mother, wife and friend Patricia. We ask for privacy as we work through this difficult time as a family.\"\n\nIn a statement released over the weekend, a family spokesperson expressed deep gratitude for the support received following the killing and said they hoped McKay's remains would be repatriated to New Zealand sometime next week.\n\nThe suspects\n\nLast week, Orange County prosecutors charged three men with capital murder in McKays' case, making them eligible for the death penalty. California has had a moratorium on carrying out the death penalty since 2019 and has not executed anyone since 2006.\n\nThe trio of McCrary, 26, of Los Angeles, Darnell, 18, also of Los Angeles, and Cunningham, 18, of Lancaster, made brief video appearances from their cells via video links after refusing to appear in court Monday as required. The judge scheduled a new arraignment and plea hearing for Wednesday and ordered the men to appear at that time.\n\nMcCrary is a third-time repeat offender who had not served time in prison for his last two felony convictions in Los Angeles County. He is also charged with attempted second-degree robbery and vehicular evasion. He was previously convicted of residential burglary in 2018, criminal threats in 2020 and theft in 2023, all in Los Angeles County, according to prosecutors.\n\nIn 2023, McCrary pleaded not guilty to charges of robbery and possession of a firearm by a drug addict. He was sentenced to two years of probation and a three-year suspended prison sentence.\n\nHe had previously been arrested for a nearly identical armed robbery. Santa Monica police said McCrary and another suspect put a gun to a man's head while stealing his Rolex in September 2022. He was arrested in January 2023 while in court on a separate charge, and it was that robbery case that resulted in a suspended sentence and two years of probation.\n\nWhen asked to explain the lack of prison time for McCrary, the Los Angeles County District Attorney's Office said in a statement: The case against [him] had significant evidentiary problems. Because of these problems, the airport court management team authorized a plea offer that allowed Mr. [McCrary] be placed on probation with a suspended state prison sentence.\n\nThe office called the latest crime McCrary was charged with reprehensible.\n\nIn addition to the murder charge, Darnell faces charges of attempted second-degree robbery, attempted murder and personal use of a firearm, as well as aggravated felony personal discharge of a firearm.\n\nCunningham is also charged with attempted second-degree robbery in addition to murder.\n\nOrange County District Attorney Todd Spitzer said he was particularly outraged that the crime took place at a landmark shopping mall.\n\n\"Our entire community extends our deepest condolences to Patricia McKay's loved ones and to the entire country of New Zealand as we mourn her senseless death in a crime that should never have happened,\" Spitzer said in a statement announcing the charges. \"Lawlessness and violence will not be

Gavin Newsom and state lawmakers for their \"soft-on-crime policies\" after a trio of thugs were charged murdering a 68-year-old woman at a posh mall in Newport Beach last week.\n\nThe DA's office said New Zealand tourist Patricia McKay and her husband were waiting for a ride after finishing shopping at the Fashion Island mall Tuesday when a white Toyota Camry pulled up next to the couple and two masked males jumped out and attacked McKay's 69-year-old husband, putting a gun to his head and demanding his watch as they forced him to the ground as bystanders ran away.\n\n'Our shopping centers and malls have become hunting grounds for criminals who are stalking innocent shoppers to rob them blind because our Governor and our Legislature refuse to hold anyone accountable for their actions.'\n\nWhen the suspects -- later identified as Malachi Darnell and Jaden Cunningham, both 18 -- couldn't get his property, Cunningham is accused of throwing McKay to the ground, stealing her shopping bags, and dragging her into the street in front of the getaway car, which 26-year-old Leroy Ernest Joseph McCrary was driving, the DA's office said.\n\nWith McKay lying in front of the Camry, McKay's husband jumped in front of the vehicle in an effort to stop his wife from being run over, but McCrary is accused of accelerating forward with Darnell in the vehicle, pushing McKay's husband out of the way, and running over McKay and dragging her body 65 feet, the DA's office said.\n\nWhile McCrary was dragging McKay under the car, Cunningham was running to try to catch up to the getaway car, the DA's office said, adding that a good Samaritan tried to stop Cunningham from getting back into the vehicle. Darnell is accused of shooting from the getaway car at the good Samaritan, the DA's office said, adding that McCrary is accused of slowing down to allow Cunningham to jump back into the getaway vehicle, after which McCrary drove away.\n\nCunningham was arrested after bailing out of the vehicle in Cypress, the DA's office said, adding that McCrary and Darnell were arrested in South Gate after a police pursuit; all three defendants were being held without bail.\n\nOrange County DA Todd Spitzer did not hold back in his comments against Newsom and state lawmakers.\n\n\"Our shopping centers and malls have become hunting grounds for criminals who are stalking innocent shoppers to rob them blind because our Governor and our Legislature refuse to hold anyone accountable for their actions,\" he said in a Friday statement. \"Actions have consequences, and it shouldn't have to result in the death of an elderly woman just enjoying a day of shopping with her husband for our elected leaders in Sacramento to realize that this is the product of their soft-on-crime policies which encourage criminality while sacrificing public safety. This is Orange County, and we refuse to accept this is the new normal. Criminals will be held accountable and violence will never be acceptable.\"\n\nThe DA's office said the three suspects are eligible for the death penalty if they are convicted of the special circumstances murder charges in the commission of a robbery with a felony enhancement for causing the death of an elder over the age of 65.\n\nMcCrary faces additional felony charges of attempted second-degree robbery and evading while driving recklessly, the DA's office said, adding that McCrary has prior felony convictions for residential burglary in 2018, criminal threats in 2020, and robbery in 2023, all in Los Angeles County.\n\nDarnell has also been charged with second-degree attempted robbery, attempted murder, and felony enhancements of personal use of a firearm and personal discharge of a firearm, the DA's office said, adding that Cunningham also been charged with one felony count of attempted second-degree robbery.\n\nYou can view a video report about the incident

Leroy McCrary, 26 and Malachi Darnell, 18, both of LA, plus Jaden Cunningham, 18, of Lancaster, CA were scheduled to appear at Orange County Superior Court in Santa Ana to be arraigned and enter guilty or not guilty pleas.\n\nBut none of them showed up in defiance of Judge Andre Manssourian who ordered them to appear after they pulled the same stunt for a scheduled hearing last Friday, refusing to budge from the jail where they're being held, just 200 yards away from the courtroom. The three - all shirtless - did make brief video appearances in court Monday after Orange County Sheriff's deputies managed to get iPads to their jail cells. None of them spoke and Judge Manssourian scheduled another arraignment and plea hearing Wednesday ordering the men - again - to show up. Pictured: Jaden Cunningham.\n\nThe judge seemed puzzled as to why the three were not to brought to court Monday, saying he heard 'something about a 24-hour psychiatric hold.' and asking deputies to give him a report 'in writing as to why they are not in court right now.' 'I need to know if it's a refusal or if it's a psychiatric hold,' he said. The men are all charged with murdering New Zealand tourist Patricia McKay, 68, by running her over with a car and dragging her 65 feet after trying to rob her and her husband Douglas outside a Barnes and Noble store at Fashion Island mall. The three - who could face the death penalty if convicted - are also accused of attempted second degree robbery. Pictured: Leroy McCrary.\n\nIn addition, Darnell (pictured) is charged with attempted murder and discharging a firearm after allegedly firing a gun at a Good Samaritan who was trying to help the McKays during the incident July 2. And McCrary - who cops say led them on a high-speed 30-mile plus chase while fleeing the scene of the botched robbery - was also charged with evading police while driving recklessly. Police say that Darnell and Cunningham, both wearing masks, jumped out of a white Toyota Camry driven by McCrary and accosted the McKays as they were walking outside the Barnes & Noble store.\n\nOne of the suspects allegedly put a gun to the head of Mr. McKay (pictured), 69, demanding his watch and forcing him to the ground. When they couldn't get the watch, say cops, the robbers turned on McKay, who was holding several shopping bags. As McKay fought to hang on to the bags, Cunningham allegedly dragged her into the street in front of the white Toyota getaway car with McCrary at the wheel. Prosecutors say Douglas McKay jumped in front of the vehicle to protect his wife, but McCrary, with Darnell back in the car, accelerated and forced the husband out of the way, then ran over McKay, trapping her under the vehicle and dragging her until she was dead.\n\nCunningham was was still running toward the moving escape vehicle, trying to jump in and a Good Samaritan was chasing him, trying to stop him. But, according to cops, the pursuer gave up the chase when Darnell fired three shots toward him from the Toyota and Cunningham got away with his two accomplices. Nobody was hit by gunfire. The men fled north toward Los Angeles with the Toyota reaching speeds of up to 110mph, say police, who eventually were able to pull the car over and arrest all three.\n\nThe victim's husband Douglas McKay - a prominent businessman and community leader in New Zealand's capital, Auckland - was not injured in the incident. Meanwhile Los Angeles County Sheriff George Gascon - and CA Democrat Governor Gavin Newsom - are facing a growing storm of anger over why one of the accused men - McCrary, 26, - was free on probation instead of behind bars for a string of earlier LA convictions, including one last year for a similar robbery.\n\nProsecutors say that before last week's robbery and killing, McCrary (pictured) had prior convictions for residential burglary in 2018, criminal threats in 2020, and robbery in 2023. He pleaded no congest last year to the robbery charge plus another of being a drug addict in possession of a firearm. Yet he was only sentenced to two years probation and a three-year prison sentence was suspended, leaving him free on the streets. 'Our shopping centers and malls have become hunting grounds for criminals who are stalking innocent shoppers to rob them blind because our Governor and our Legislature refuse to hold anyone accountable for their actions,' blasted Republican Orange County District Attorney Todd Spitzer when he announced the charges against the three men.\n\nHe said that McKay's murder was a crime 'that should have never happened,' adding, 'Lawlessness and violence will not be tolerated in our society.' Newport Beach Mayor Will O'Neill reacted with anger to the horrendous slaying of McKay, saying that McCrary 'shouldn't have been in free society' because of his past crimes. 'Frankly, to hell with these guys... These are thugs. Every community is now dealing with this. We have to do better as a society. We cannot tolerate this.' Asked to explain why McCrary didn't get jail time for his previous crimes, Gascon said in a statement that 'the case against him had significant problems with proof' so 'the management team at the court authorized a plea offer that allowed him to be placed on probation,' plus a prison sentence that was suspended.\n\nWant more stories like this from the Daily Mail?

Nobody was hit by gunfire.\n\nThe men then fled north toward Los Angeles with the Toyota reaching speeds of up to 110mph.\n\nAs it sped through Los Angeles County, Cunningham bolted out of the car and was arrested, according to police.\n\nMcCrary and Darnell were later arrested in a residential community in South Gate.\n\nAll three suspects are now facing murder charges with felony enhancements that make them eligible for the death penalty, as well as second-degree robbery.\n\nIn addition, Darnell is charged with attempted murder and discharging a firearm after allegedly firing at the Good Samaritan.\n\nAnd McCrary - who cops say acted as the driver - was also charged with evading police while driving recklessly.\n\nThey are all due back in court on Wednesday.\n\nIn the meantime, Los Angeles County Sheriff George Gascon is facing a growing storm of anger for his decision to allow McCrary to be free on probation instead of behind bars for a string of earlier LA convictions - including one last year for a similar robbery.\n\nProsecutors say that before last week's robbery and killing, McCrary had prior convictions for residential burglary in 2018, criminal threats in 2020, and robbery in 2023.\n\nHe pleaded no contest last year to the robbery charge plus another of being a drug addict in possession of a firearm. Yet he was only sentenced to two years probation and a three-year prison sentence was suspended, leaving him free on the streets.\n\n'Our shopping centers and malls have become hunting grounds for criminals who are stalking innocent shoppers to rob them blind because our Governor and our Legislature refuse to hold anyone accountable for their actions,' blasted Republican Orange County District Attorney Todd Spitzer when he announced the charges against the three men.\n\nHe said that McKay's murder was a crime 'that should have never happened,' adding, 'Lawlessness and violence will not be tolerated in our society.'\n\nNewport Beach Mayor Will O'Neill also reacted with anger to the horrendous slaying of McKay, saying that McCrary 'shouldn't have been in free society' because of his past crimes.\n\n'Frankly, to hell with these guys... These are thugs. Every community is now dealing with this. We have to do better as a society. We cannot tolerate this.'\n\nAsked to explain why McCrary didn't get jail time for his previous crimes, Gascon said in a statement that 'the case against him had significant problems with proof' so 'the management team at the court authorized a plea offer that allowed him to be placed on probation,' plus a prison sentence that was suspended.", "source": {"uri": "internewscast.com", "dataType":

Two masked men jumped out, and authorities say one put a gun to the businessman's head, demanding his watch and forcing him to the ground.\n\nThe other dragged Trish McKay into the street, in front of the Camry, while trying to wrest the shopping bags away from her.\n\nBy then, the Camry and its getaway driver were moving forward. Doug McKay jumped in front of the vehicle to try to save his wife. But authorities say the driver -- identified by police as Leroy Ernest Joseph McCrary -- ran over the woman, dragging her body 65 feet across the parking lot.\n\nA good Samaritan, Beau Bayless, chased after the fleeing car. But police say his efforts were cut short when one of the robbers fired three shots at him.\n\nEyewitnesses immediately called 911, and within minutes, police had begun a pursuit of the Camry as it raced north toward Los Angeles County, reaching speeds of up to 110 mph. A television news helicopter captured video of the car speeding on the left shoulder of the 105 Freeway and at one point grazing the concrete median.\n\nOne of the men -- later identified by police as Jaden Cunningham -- was arrested after he bailed out of the vehicle in the city of Cypress. McCrary and the other suspect -- identified as Malachi Eddward Darnell -- were arrested later in South Gate.\n\nDoug McKay, 69, is the former chair of the Bank of New Zealand and a prominent energy and business executive who served three years as the first chief executive of the Auckland Council, created in 2010 for the region's \"supercity.\"\n\nProsecutors say the couple were visiting Newport Beach, a hot spot for upscale tourists and deemed one of the region's safer cities.\n\nThe pair were friends with New Zealand Prime Minister Christopher Luxon, who described the death of Trish McKay, 68, as \"an absolute tragedy\" and extended condolences to family and friends in a message on X.\n\nMcKay's family is still reeling from her death. In a statement after the killing, the family said: \"No words can express our sadness as we try to come to terms with the loss of our mother, wife, and friend Patricia. We ask for privacy at this time as we work through this as a family.\"\n\nIn a statement issued over the weekend, a family spokesperson expressed \"deep gratitude\" for the support they had received in the wake of the killing and said they hoped to have McKay's remains returned to New Zealand within the next week.\n\nThe suspects\n\nOrange County prosecutors last week charged three men with murder with a felony enhancement in McKay's death, making them eligible for the death penalty. California has had a moratorium on carrying out the death penalty since 2019 and has not executed anyone since 2006.\n\nThe trio -- McCrary, 26, of Los Angeles; Darnell, 18, also of Los Angeles; and Cunningham, 18, of Lancaster -- were due in court Monday, but their arraignment was delayed.\n\nMcCrary is a third-striker who had not served prison time for his most recent two felony convictions in L.A. County. He also faces charges of felony attempted second-degree robbery and evading while driving recklessly. He was previously convicted of residential burglary in 2018, criminal threats in 2020 and robbery in 2023, all in L.A. County, according to prosecutors.\n\nIn 2023, McCrary pleaded no contest to charges of robbery and being a narcotics addict in possession of a firearm. He was sentenced to two years of probation with three years in state prison suspended.\n\nHe also was previously arrested in a nearly identical armed robbery. Santa Monica police said McCrary and another suspect placed a gun to the head of a man while stealing his Rolex in September 2022. He was arrested in January 2023 while in court on another case, and it was that robbery case that resulted in a suspended sentence and two years' probation.\n\nWhen asked to explain the lack of prison time for McCrary, the Los Angeles County district attorney's office said in a statement: \"The case against [him] had significant problems with proof. As a result of these issues, the management team at the Airport Court authorized a plea offer that allowed Mr. [McCrary] to be placed on probation with a suspended state prison sentence.\"\n\nThe office called the latest crime with which McCrary has been charged \"reprehensible.\"\n\nIn addition to the murder charge against him, Darnell faces charges of attempted second-degree robbery, attempted murder and personal use of a firearm, as well as a felony enhancement of personal discharge of a firearm.\n\nCunningham is also charged with attempted second-degree robbery in addition to murder.\n\nOrange County Dist. Atty. Todd Spitzer said he was particularly outraged because the crime occurred at a landmark shopping mall.\n\n\"Our entire community extends its deepest sympathies to the loved ones of Patricia McKay and to the entire country of New Zealand as we mourn her senseless death in the commission of a crime that should have never happened,\" Spitzer said in a statement announcing the charges. \"Lawlessness and violence will not be tolerated in our society.\"", "source": {"uri": "m.arcamax.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "m.arcamax.com"}, "authors": [{"uri": "arcamax_publishing@m.arcamax.com", "name":

Nobody was hit by gunfire.\n\nThe men then fled north toward Los Angeles with the Toyota reaching speeds of up to 110mph.\n\nAs it sped through Los Angeles County, Cunningham bolted out of the car and was arrested, according to police.\n\nMcCrary and Darnell were later arrested in a residential community in South Gate.\n\nPolice arrested Leroy McCrary McCrary, pictured, following a high-speed chase\n\nMcCrary and his accomplices are now facing murder and robbery charges\n\nAll three suspects are now facing murder charges with felony enhancements that make them eligible for the death penalty, as well as second-degree robbery.\n\nIn addition, Darnell is charged with attempted murder and discharging a firearm after allegedly firing at the Good Samaritan.\n\nAnd McCrary - who cops say acted as the driver - was also charged with evading police while driving recklessly.\n\nThey are all due back in court on Wednesday.\n\nIn the meantime, Los Angeles County Sheriff George Gascon is facing a growing storm of anger for his decision to allow McCrary to be free on probation instead of behind bars for a string of earlier LA convictions - including one last year for a similar robbery.\n\nProsecutors say that before last week's robbery and killing, McCrary had prior convictions for residential burglary in 2018, criminal threats in 2020, and robbery in 2023.\n\nHe pleaded no contest last year to the robbery charge plus another of being a drug addict in possession of a firearm. Yet he was only sentenced to two years probation and a three-year prison sentence was suspended, leaving him free on the streets.\n\n'Our shopping centers and malls have become hunting grounds for criminals who are stalking innocent shoppers to rob them blind because our Governor and our Legislature refuse to hold anyone accountable for their actions,' blasted Republican Orange County District Attorney Todd Spitzer when he announced the charges against the three men.\n\nHe said that McKay's murder was a crime 'that should have never happened,' adding, 'Lawlessness and violence will not be tolerated in our society.'\n\nMcCrary, pictured, has a criminal history including a chillingly similar hold up at a different upmarket beach community\n\nNewport Beach Mayor Will O'Neill also reacted with anger to the horrendous slaying of McKay, saying that McCrary 'shouldn't have been in free society' because of his past crimes.\n\n'Frankly, to hell with these guys... These are thugs. Every community is now dealing with this. We have to do better as a society. We cannot tolerate this.'\n\nAsked to explain why McCrary didn't get jail time for his previous crimes, Gascon said in a statement that 'the case against him had significant problems with proof' so 'the management team at the court authorized a plea offer that allowed him to be placed on probation,' plus a prison sentence that was suspended.", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk", "dataType":

Gavin Newsom and state lawmakers for their \"soft-on-crime policies\" after a trio of thugs were charged murdering a 68-year-old woman at a posh mall in Newport Beach last week.\n\nThe DA's office said New Zealand tourist Patricia McKay and her husband were waiting for a ride after finishing shopping at the Fashion Island mall Tuesday when a white Toyota Camry pulled up next to the couple and two masked males jumped out and attacked McKay's 69-year-old husband, putting a gun to his head and demanding his watch as they forced him to the ground as bystanders ran away.\n\n'Our shopping centers and malls have become hunting grounds for criminals who are stalking innocent shoppers to rob them blind because our Governor and our Legislature refuse to hold anyone accountable for their actions.'\n\nWhen the suspects -- later identified as Malachi Darnell and Jaden Cunningham, both 18 -- couldn't get his property, Cunningham is accused of throwing McKay to the ground, stealing her shopping bags, and dragging her into the street in front of the getaway car, which 26-year-old Leroy Ernest Joseph McCrary was driving, the DA's office said.\n\nWith McKay lying in front of the Camry, McKay's husband jumped in front of the vehicle in an effort to stop his wife from being run over, but McCrary is accused of accelerating forward with Darnell in the vehicle, pushing McKay's husband out of the way, and running over McKay and dragging her body 65 feet, the DA's office said.\n\nWhile McCrary was dragging McKay under the car, Cunningham was running to try to catch up to the getaway car, the DA's office said, adding that a good Samaritan tried to stop Cunningham from getting back into the vehicle. Darnell is accused of shooting from the getaway car at the good Samaritan, the DA's office said, adding that McCrary is accused of slowing down to allow Cunningham to jump back into the getaway vehicle, after which McCrary drove away.\n\nCunningham was arrested after bailing out of the vehicle in Cypress, the DA's office said, adding that McCrary and Darnell were arrested in South Gate after a police pursuit; all three defendants were being held without bail.\n\nOrange County DA Todd Spitzer did not hold back in his comments against Newsom and state lawmakers.\n\n\"Our shopping centers and malls have become hunting grounds for criminals who are stalking innocent shoppers to rob them blind because our Governor and our Legislature refuse to hold anyone accountable for their actions,\" he said in a Friday statement. \"Actions have consequences, and it shouldn't have to result in the death of an elderly woman just enjoying a day of shopping with her husband for our elected leaders in Sacramento to realize that this is the product of their soft-on-crime policies which encourage criminality while sacrificing public safety. This is Orange County, and we refuse to accept this is the new normal. Criminals will be held accountable and violence will never be acceptable.\"\n\nThe DA's office said the three suspects are eligible for the death penalty if they are convicted of the special circumstances murder charges in the commission of a robbery with a felony enhancement for causing the death of an elder over the age of 65.\n\nMcCrary faces additional felony charges of attempted second-degree robbery and evading while driving recklessly, the DA's office said, adding that McCrary has prior felony convictions for residential burglary in 2018, criminal threats in 2020, and robbery in 2023, all in Los Angeles County.\n\nDarnell has also been charged with second-degree attempted robbery, attempted murder, and felony enhancements of personal use of a firearm and personal discharge of a firearm, the DA's office said, adding that Cunningham also been charged with one felony count of attempted second-degree robbery.\n\nYou can view a video report about the incident here.\n\nLike Blaze News?

The Orange County District Attorney's Office will decide later whether to seek death sentences in the case, or life without the possibility of parole.\n\nThe trio were originally expected to be arraigned Friday in Santa Ana, but the hearing was delayed because all three defendants were on a \"medical hold\" in the jail, according to the District Attorney's Office. The hearing was delayed again Monday for the same reason.\n\nThe reason for the medical hold was not immediately known.\n\nThe defendants were charged Friday with murder, including a special circumstance allegation of murder during the commission of a robbery, along with a sentencing enhancement of killing a person over age 65.\n\nMcCrary -- who prosecutors said has prior convictions for residential burglary in 2018, criminal threats in 2020 and robbery in 2023 -- was also charged with felony counts of attempted second-degree robbery and evading while driving recklessly, according to the District Attorney's Office.\n\nDarnell was additionally charged with second-degree attempted robbery and attempted murder, along with a sentencing enhancement allegation of personal use of a firearm and personal discharge of a firearm.\n\nCunningham was also charged with attempted second-degree robbery.\n\nAll three are accused in connection with the robbery and killing that occurred around 3:30 p.m. July 2 outside the mall, leaving 68-year-old Patricia McKay dead in the parking lot.\n\nThe three defendants are being held without bail.\n\nAccording to police and prosecutors, Darnell and Cunningham, both wearing masks, approached McKay and her husband as they were walking outside the Barnes & Noble store.\n\nProsecutors said one of the suspects put a gun to the head of McKay's 69-year-old husband and demanded his watch as they forced him to the ground. When they were unable to get the watch, the suspects allegedly turned their attention to McKay, who was holding multiple shopping bags.\n\nCunningham allegedly dragged McKay into the street in front of a getaway car being driven by McCrary.\n\nProsecutors said McKay's husband jumped in front of the vehicle in an effort to protect his wife, but McCrary, with Darnell back in the vehicle, accelerated and forced the husband out of the way, then ran over McKay, trapping her under the vehicle and dragging her 65 feet.\n\nShe was pronounced dead at the scene.\n\nCunningham was still on foot and running toward the moving vehicle, chased by a good Samaritan, prompting Darnell to fire several shots from inside the car toward the pursuer. No one was struck by the gunfire.\n\nCunningham ultimately got into the vehicle, and the trio drove away.\n\nThe suspects led authorities on a pursuit north on the San Diego (405) Freeway. During the chase the driver pulled over in the Cypress area, and Cunningham jumped out of the car, but was later apprehended. The other two suspects continued the pursuit into South Gate, where they were both arrested.\n\nPolice said McKay's husband was not seriously injured during the robbery. He has not been identified.\n\n\"Our entire community extends its deepest sympathies to the loved ones of Patricia McKay and to the entire country of New Zealand as we mourn her senseless death in the commission of a crime that should have never happened.

The two were on vacation\n\nJudge Andre Manssourian speaks during a court hearing for Jaden Cunningham, Malachi Darnell, and Leroy McCrary. He was puzzled as to why none of them showed up, adding that he heard it may have been because of 'a 24-hour psychiatric hold.'\n\nAnd McCrary - who cops say led them on a high-speed 30-mile plus chase while fleeing the scene of the botched robbery - was also charged with evading police while driving recklessly.\n\nPolice say that Darnell and Cunningham, both wearing masks, jumped out of a white Toyota Camry driven by McCrary and accosted the McKays as they were walking outside the Barnes & Noble store.\n\nOne of the suspects allegedly put a gun to the head of Mr. McKay, 69, demanding his watch and forcing him to the ground.\n\nWhen they couldn't get the watch, say cops, the robbers turned on McKay, who was holding several shopping bags.\n\nAs McKay fought to hang on to the bags, Cunningham allegedly dragged her into the street in front of the white Toyota getaway car with McCrary at the wheel.\n\nProsecutors say Douglas McKay jumped in front of the vehicle to protect his wife, but McCrary, with Darnell back in the car, accelerated and forced the husband out of the way, then ran over McKay, trapping her under the vehicle and dragging her until she was dead.\n\nPolice arrested McCrary, pictured, after he was forced to hide behind trash cans between houses after the overweight narcotics addict ran out of puff fleeing cops following the fatal mall robbery\n\nTrish McKay and her husband had been outside a Barnes & Noble bookstore at the Fashion Island mall when they were approached by two men. McCrary (above) and two teenagers were taken into custody after the men fled the scene\n\nCunningham was was still running toward the moving escape vehicle, trying to jump in and a Good Samaritan was chasing him, trying to stop him.\n\nBut, according to cops, the pursuer gave up the chase when Darnell fired three shots toward him from the Toyota and Cunningham got away with his two accomplices. Nobody was hit by gunfire.\n\nThe men fled north toward Los Angeles with the Toyota reaching speeds of up to 110mph, say police, who eventually were able to pull the car over and arrest all three.\n\nThe victim's husband Douglas McKay - a prominent businessman and community leader in New Zealand's capital, Auckland - was not injured in the incident.\n\nMeanwhile Los Angeles County Sheriff George Gascon - and CA Democrat Governor Gavin Newsom - are facing a growing storm of anger over why one of the accused men - McCrary, 26, - was free on probation instead of behind bars for a string of earlier LA convictions, including one last year for a similar robbery.\n\nProsecutors say that before last week's robbery and killing, McCrary had prior convictions for residential burglary in 2018, criminal threats in 2020, and robbery in 2023.\n\nLeroy McCrary, pictured, has a criminal history including a chillingly similar hold up at a different upmarket beach community\n\nGeneral view of the Fashion Island Mall in Newport Beach, California where the the McKays were targeted for robbery. It is generally considered a safe location\n\nThe scene where the three men were pulled over after allegedly killing McKay. They were driving at speeds of up to 110mph, police say\n\nHe pleaded no congest last year to the robbery charge plus another of being a drug addict in possession of a firearm. Yet he was only sentenced to two years probation and a three-year prison sentence was suspended, leaving him free on the streets.\n\n'Our shopping centers and malls have become hunting grounds for criminals who are stalking innocent shoppers to rob them blind because our Governor and our Legislature refuse to hold anyone accountable for their actions,' blasted Republican Orange County District Attorney Todd Spitzer when he announced the charges against the three men.\n\nHe said that McKay's murder was a crime 'that should have never happened,' adding, 'Lawlessness and violence will not be tolerated in our society.'\n\nNewport Beach Mayor Will O'Neill reacted with anger to the horrendous slaying of McKay, saying that McCrary 'shouldn't have been in free society' because of his past crimes.\n\n'Frankly, to hell with these guys... These are thugs. Every community is now dealing with this. We have to do better as a society. We cannot tolerate this.'\n\nAsked to explain why McCrary didn't get jail time for his previous crimes, Gascon said in a statement that 'the case against him had significant problems with proof' so 'the management team at the court authorized a plea offer that allowed him to be placed on probation,' plus a prison sentence that was suspended.\n\nDailyMail.com asked a spokesman for Orange County Superior Court if a judge there is empowered to order a jail inmate to be physically compelled to come to court for a scheduled appearance if he refuses to leave his cell but we have not yet received

Two masked men jumped out, and authorities say one put a gun to the businessman's head, demanding his watch and forcing him to the ground.\n\nThe other dragged Trish McKay into the street, in front of the Camry, while trying to wrest the shopping bags away from her.\n\nBy then, the Camry and its getaway driver were moving forward. Doug McKay jumped in front of the vehicle to try to save his wife. But authorities say the driver -- identified by police as Leroy Ernest Joseph McCrary -- ran over the woman, dragging her body 65 feet across the parking lot.\n\nA good Samaritan, Beau Bayless, chased after the fleeing car. But police say his efforts were cut short when one of the robbers fired three shots at him.\n\nEyewitnesses immediately called 911, and within minutes, police had begun a pursuit of the Camry as it raced north toward Los Angeles County, reaching speeds of up to 110 mph. A television news helicopter captured video of the car speeding on the left shoulder of the 105 Freeway and at one point grazing the concrete median.\n\nOne of the men -- later identified by police as Jaden Cunningham -- was arrested after he bailed out of the vehicle in the city of Cypress. McCrary and the other suspect -- identified as Malachi Eddward Darnell -- were arrested later in South Gate.\n\nProsecutors have charged the men with murder.\n\nDoug McKay, 69, is the former chair of the Bank of New Zealand and a prominent energy and business executive who served three years as the first chief executive of the Auckland Council, created in 2010 for the region's \"supercity.\"\n\nProsecutors say the couple were visiting Newport Beach, a hot spot for upscale tourists and deemed one of the region's safer cities.\n\nThe pair were friends with New Zealand Prime Minister Christopher Luxon, who described the death of Trish McKay, 68, as \"an absolute tragedy\" and extended condolences to family and friends in a message on X.\n\nMcKay's family is still reeling from her death. In a statement after the killing, the family said: \"No words can express our sadness as we try to come to terms with the loss of our mother, wife, and friend Patricia. We ask for privacy at this time as we work through this as a family.\"\n\nIn a statement issued over the weekend, a family spokesperson expressed \"deep gratitude\" for the support they had received in the wake of the killing and said they hoped to have McKay's remains returned to New Zealand within the next week.\n\nOrange County prosecutors last week charged three men with murder with a felony enhancement in McKay's death, making them eligible for the death penalty. California has had a moratorium on carrying out the death penalty since 2019 and has not executed anyone since 2006.\n\nThe trio -- McCrary, 26, of Los Angeles; Darnell, 18, also of Los Angeles; and Cunningham, 18, of Lancaster -- were due in court Monday, but their arraignment was delayed.\n\nMcCrary is a third-striker who had not served prison time for his most recent two felony convictions in L.A. County. He also faces charges of felony attempted second-degree robbery and evading while driving recklessly. He was previously convicted of residential burglary in 2018, criminal threats in 2020 and robbery in 2023, all in L.A. County, according to prosecutors.\n\nIn 2023, McCrary pleaded no contest to charges of robbery and being a narcotics addict in possession of a firearm. He was sentenced to two years of probation with three years in state prison suspended.\n\nHe also was previously arrested in a nearly identical armed robbery. Santa Monica police said McCrary and another suspect placed a gun to the head of a man while stealing his Rolex in September 2022. He was arrested in January 2023 while in court on another case, and it was that robbery case that resulted in a suspended sentence and two years' probation.\n\nWhen asked to explain the lack of prison time for McCrary, the Los Angeles County district attorney's office said in a statement: \"The case against [him] had significant problems with proof. As a result of these issues, the management team at the Airport Court authorized a plea offer that allowed Mr. [McCrary] to be placed on probation with a suspended state prison sentence.\"\n\nThe office called the latest crime with which McCrary has been charged \"reprehensible.\"\n\nIn addition to the murder charge against him, Darnell faces charges of attempted second-degree robbery, attempted murder and personal use of a firearm, as well as a felony enhancement of personal discharge of a firearm.\n\nCunningham is also charged with attempted second-degree robbery in addition to murder.\n\nOrange County Dist. Atty. Todd Spitzer said he was particularly outraged because the crime occurred at a landmark shopping mall.\n\n\"Our entire community extends its deepest sympathies to the loved ones of Patricia McKay and to the entire country of New Zealand as we mourn her senseless death in the commission of a crime that should have never happened,\" Spitzer said in a statement announcing the charges. \"Lawlessness and violence will not be tolerated in our society.\"", "source": {"uri": "latimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Los Angeles Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

(KABC) -- The three men charged in the death of a tourist from New Zealand appeared in court Wednesday for the first time since a botched robbery attempt at Newport Beach's Fashion Island mall.\n\nThe arraignment of Leroy Ernest Joseph McCrary, 26, of Los Angeles, Malachi Eddward Darnell, 18, of Los Angeles, and Jaden Cunningham, 18, of Lancaster was postponed until Aug. 1.\n\nThey've been charged with murder and other offenses in the death of 68-year-old Patricia McKay.\n\nIn addition to a special circumstances murder charge, McCrary was charged with one felony count of attempted second-degree robbery, and one felony count of evading while driving recklessly. McCrary has prior felony convictions for residential burglary in 2018, criminal threats in 2020, and robbery in 2023, all in Los Angeles County, the statement said.\n\nDarnell was also charged with one felony count of second-degree attempted robbery, one felony count of attempted murder, and one felony enhancement of personal use of a firearm and one felony enhancement of personal discharge of a firearm, the DA's office said. Cunningham faces one felony count of attempted second-degree robbery.\n\nThey could face the death penalty if convicted as charged.\n\nAccording to police and prosecutors, Darnell and Cunningham, both wearing masks, approached McKay and her husband as they were walking outside the Barnes & Noble store at Fashion Island last week.\n\nOne of the suspects put a gun to the head of McKay's 69-year-old husband and demanded his watch as they forced him to the ground, prosecutors said.\n\nWhen they were unable to get the watch, the suspects allegedly turned their attention to McKay, who was holding multiple shopping bags.\n\nCunningham is accused of dragging McKay into the street in front of a getaway car being driven by McCrary.\n\nAccording to the DA's office, McKay's husband jumped in front of the vehicle in an effort to protect his wife, but McCrary, with Darnell back in the vehicle, accelerated and forced the husband out of the way, then ran over McKay, trapping her under the vehicle and dragging her 65 feet.\n\nShe was pronounced dead at the scene. McKay's husband was not seriously injured during the robbery, police said.\n\nThe suspects fled the scene and were eventually arrested after a police chase across the region.", "source": {"uri": "abc7.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ABC7"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Felony", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Felony"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robbery", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Robbery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Murder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_circumstances_(criminal_law)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Special circumstances (criminal law)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newport,_Wales", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Newport, Wales"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Newport, Wales"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fashion_Island", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fashion Island"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KABC-TV", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "KABC-TV"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newport_Beach,_California", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Newport Beach, California"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firearm", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Firearm"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arraignment", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Arraignment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lancaster,_Pennsylvania", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lancaster, Pennsylvania"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Lancaster, Pennsylvania"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New Zealand"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "New Zealand"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burglary", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Burglary"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_discharge", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Military discharge"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attempted_murder", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Attempted murder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capital_punishment", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Capital punishment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_County,_California", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles County, California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles County, California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Car_chase", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Car chase"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barnes_&_Noble", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Barnes & Noble"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Murder", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Murder", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Victims", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Victims", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Unsolved", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Unsolved", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 65}], "image": "https://cdn.abcotvs.com/dip/images/15049651_fashion-island-suspect-split-clean-TN-img.jpg?w=1600", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9716768", "eventUri": "eng-9716768", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-01", "textStart": 389, "textEnd": 395}], "sentiment": -0.6, "wgt": 206, "relevance": 1}

County prosecutors agreed to a three-year suspended sentence.\n\nThe Times added that Nathan Hochman -- Gasc\u00f3n's opponent in this November's election -- said Gasc\u00f3n's 'malpractice appears to have cost another life.'\n\nThe Orange County District Attorney's Office said McCrary on July 2 ran over New Zealander tourist Patricia McKay and dragged her body 65 feet amid a violent robbery of the victim and her 69-year-old husband at the Fashion Island mall, adding that McCrary is eligible for the death penalty if convicted of a special circumstances murder charge.\n\nMcCrary faces additional felony charges of attempted second-degree robbery and evading while driving recklessly, the Orange County DA's office said, adding that he has prior felony convictions for residential burglary, criminal threats, and robbery, all in Los Angeles County.\n\nThe Times noted the following in regard to the 2022 incident:\n\nSanta Monica Police Lt. Erika Aklufi said surveillance video in that case showed McCrary putting a handgun to the head of a man on Broadway. He and an accomplice demanded the man's watch, she said.\n\nMcCrary's DNA also was recovered from the victim's shirt, which he'd grabbed during the robbery, police said.\n\nProsecutors charged McCrary, who had been arrested by L.A. police a month later, and Donta Baker with robbery in the Santa Monica case based on the DNA evidence, according to court records reviewed by The Times.\n\nThe Times said McCrary pleaded no contest in 2023 to one count of robbery, after which L.A. County Superior Court Judge Cathryn Brougham sentenced him to three years. But the paper said Brougham suspended the sentence and placed McCrary on two years' probation, also ordering him to complete 200 hours of community service.\n\nThe Times added that McCrary's suspended sentence ran concurrent with another suspended sentence following a conviction for possessing a gun as a felon in a separate case the LAPD investigated.\n\nThe paper said that while Brougham ordered the completion of a probation report before McCrary's sentencing, courthouse clerks could find no report upon the Times' request. Probation reports typically provide sentencing recommendations along with defendants' probation suitability, the paper added.\n\nThe Times reported that L.A. County prosecutors defended their handling of the case related to stealing a Rolex at gunpoint, a case which officials said \"had significant problems with proof.\"\n\nMore from the paper:\n\nA spokesperson in the district attorney's office said an inability to identify the defendant in the surveillance video hampered the case. Two witnesses were unable to identify the suspects, the spokesperson said, noting that the robber's face was not shown in the video because he was wearing a mask.\n\nShe also said that prosecutors were unable to identify the item in the suspect's hands, and that a confirmatory DNA test was never conducted on the robbery victim's shirt, which called into question its accuracy.\n\n\"As a result of these issues, the management team ... authorized a plea offer that allowed [him] to be placed on probation with a suspended state prison sentence,\" the district attorney's office said in a statement, the Times reported.\n\nOpponents of Gasc\u00f3n told the paper that the handling of the case demonstrates how his office has been mismanaged. The Times added that Nathan Hochman -- Gasc\u00f3n's opponent in this November's election -- said Gasc\u00f3n's \"malpractice appears to have cost another life.\"\n\nThe two other suspects in last week's brutal killing in Newport Beach are Malachi Darnell and Jaden Cunningham, both 18, the Orange County DA's Office said.\n\nThe DA's office said McKay and her husband were waiting for a ride after finishing shopping at the mall when a white Toyota Camry pulled up next to the couple. The DA's office said two masked suspects -- later identified as Darnell and Cunningham -- jumped out and attacked McKay's husband, putting a gun to his head and demanding his watch as they forced him to the ground as bystanders ran away.\n\nWhen the pair couldn't get the husband's property, Cunningham is accused of throwing McKay to the ground, stealing her shopping bags, and dragging her into the street in front of the getaway car, which McCrary was driving, the DA's office said.\n\nWith McKay lying in front of the Camry, McKay's husband jumped in front of the vehicle in an effort to stop his wife from being run over, but McCrary is accused of accelerating forward with Darnell in the vehicle, pushing McKay's husband out of the way, and running over McKay and dragging her body 65 feet, the DA's office said.\n\nWhile McCrary was dragging McKay under the car, Cunningham was running to try to catch up to the getaway car, the DA's office said, adding that a good Samaritan tried to stop Cunningham from getting back into the vehicle. Darnell is accused of shooting from the getaway car at the good Samaritan, the DA's office said, adding that McCrary is accused of slowing down to allow Cunningham to jump back into the getaway vehicle, after which McCrary drove away.\n\nThe DA's office said Darnell and Cunningham also are eligible for the death penalty if they are convicted of the special circumstances murder charges. Darnell also has been charged with second-degree attempted robbery, attempted murder, and felony enhancements of personal use of a firearm and personal discharge of a firearm, the DA's office said, adding that Cunningham also has been charged with one felony count of attempted second-degree robbery.", "source": {"uri": "theblaze.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "TheBlaze"}, "authors": [],

The woman's husband, an Auckland businessman, was not injured.\n\nIn a news release issued Friday, prosecutors provided more details about the deadly timeline of events Tuesday outside the mall.\n\nDarnell and Cunningham, both wearing masks, approached McKay and her husband as they were walking outside the Barnes & Noble store, according to police and prosecutors. One of the suspects held a gun to the head of McKay's 69-year-old husband and demanded his watch as they forced him to the ground. When they were unable to get the watch, the suspects turned their attention to Patricia McKay, who was holding shopping bags, prosecutors said.\n\nCunningham allegedly dragged McKay into the street in front of a getaway car being driven by McCrary. Prosecutors said McKay's husband jumped in front of the vehicle in an effort to protect his wife, but McCrary, with Darnell back in the vehicle, accelerated and forced the husband out of the way, then ran over McKay, trapping her under the vehicle and dragging her 65 feet, according to the news release.\n\nCunningham was running toward the moving car with a witness chasing him when Darnell fired several shots from inside the car, prosecutors said. Cunningham eventually got into the car and the three suspect left the scene.\n\nNo one was struck by gunfire, police said.\n\nA chase ensued after the three men in the white sedan failed to yield for a traffic stop. One suspect got out of the car in Cypress, but was eventually taken into custody. The other two men were arrested after they abandoned the car in Los Angeles County.\n\nMcCrary, who prosecutors said has prior convictions for residential burglary in 2018, criminal threats in 2020 and robbery in 2023, also was charged with felony counts of attempted second-degree robbery and evading while driving recklessly, according to the District Attorney's Office. Darnell was additionally charged with second-degree attempted robbery and attempted murder, along with a sentencing enhancement allegation of personal use of a firearm and person discharge of a firearm.\n\nCunningham was also charged with attempted second-degree robbery.\n\nLeaders in New Zealand and others expressed grief after learning of McKay's death. The New Zealand Herald identified husband Doug McKay as a prominent Auckland businessman and published a statement from the grieving family.\n\n\"No words can express our sadness as we try to come to terms with the loss of our mother, wife, and friend Patricia,\" the family said in its statement. We ask for privacy at this time as we work through this as a family.\"\n\nThe country's prime minister called McKay's death a devastating loss.\n\n\"My thoughts are with the McKay family after the devastating loss of Trish,\" New Zealand Prime Minister Christopher Luxon said in a post on X. \"They're great people and my heart goes out to Doug, their family and all those who knew Trish.\"",

Two men wearing masks jumped out of a white Toyota Camry that pulled up next to the couple and they tried robbing her husband, putting a gun to his head as they demanded his watch, prosecutors said. They weren't able to get it so they then turned their attention to McKay.\n\nProsecutors say her 69-year-old husband tried rescuing her but she ended up getting killed. She was pronounced dead in the parking lot just outside the Barnes and Noble bookstore at the mall.\n\nMalachi Eddward Darnell, 18, and Jaden Cunningham, 18, are accused of being the two men who first approached and attacked the couple, according to the Orange County District Attorney's Office. Cunningham allegedly threw McKay to the ground and tried stealing her shopping bags. Then, he allegedly dragged her into the street and in front of a getaway car being driven by the third suspect: Leroy Ernest Joseph McCrary, 26.\n\nMcKay's husband jumped in front of the car to try saving her but prosecutors allege McCrary then accelerated forward -- pushing her husband to the side and running her over. The car dragged her body 65 feet, prosecutors said.\n\nAt the time, Darnell was allegedly inside the car with McCrary. As the car dragged McKay, prosecutors say, Cunningham was trying to catch up with the getaway car but a Good Samaritan tried stopping him. Darnell allegedly fired shots out of the vehicle at the Good Samaritan while McCrary allegedly slowed down so Cunningham could get back in the car before they all fled.\n\nWitnesses just outside the shopping center said everyone tried to take cover after hearing three to four gunshots.\n\nAfter fleeing the scene, the three suspects then led authorities on a chase that traveled into Los Angeles County, reaching speeds up to 110 mph on the westbound 105 Freeway, authorities said.\n\nWith the suspects jumping out of the car near Los Alamitos, and later South Gate, they were all eventually taken into custody.\n\nThey appeared in Orange County Superior Court Wednesday but their arraignment was postponed until Aug. 1.\n\nThey have all been charged with murder, with a special allegation of murder in the commission of a robbery with a potential felony sentencing enhancement for causing the death of an elder over the age of 65.", "source": {"uri": "cbsnews.com", "dataType": "news",

The suspects then were said to have forced him to the ground as bystanders ran away.\n\nWhen the suspects were unable to get his property, Cunningham allegedly attacked McKay, who had been carrying several shopping bags. He is accused of throwing McKay to the ground and dragging her into the street in front of the getaway car. Cunningham allegedly stole her shopping bags.\n\nWhen McKay was lying on the ground in front of the Camry, her husband jumped in front of the vehicle to try to prevent her from being run over. McCrary is accused of accelerating the Camry with Darnell in the vehicle, running over McKay and dragging her body 65 feet. Running to catch up to the car, Cunningham was pursued by an unidentified Good Samaritan, who attempted to stop him from getting back in the vehicle. Darnell is accused of firing shots.\n\nIn addition to the special circumstances murder charge, McCrary has been charged with one felony count of attempted second-degree robbery, and one felony count of evading while driving recklessly. McCrary has prior felony convictions for residential burglary in 2018, criminal threats in 2020, and robbery in 2023, all in Los Angeles County, according to Spitzer's office.\n\nDarnell has also been charged with one felony count of second-degree attempted robbery, one felony count of attempted murder, and one felony enhancement of personal use of a firearm and one felony enhancement of personal discharge of a firearm. Cunningham has also been charged with one felony count of attempted second-degree robbery.\n\nNew Zealand's Prime Minister Christoper Luxon shared his condolences with McKay's family \"after the devastating loss of Trish\" via the social media platform X. McKay's 69-year-old husband Doug was reportedly the former chairman of the Bank of New Zealand.\n\nMedia requests to Fashion Island and its owner the Irvine Co. were unreturned Wednesday, as were ones to Spitzer's spokesperson.\n\nOn Tuesday, Fashion Island's general manager Gerard Widder posted on the company's site, \"Fashion Island joins with the Newport Beach community to offer our heartfelt condolences to the McKay family. They will remain in our hearts and thoughts. We are also grateful to the Newport Beach Police Department's rapid response to this senseless crime and we will continue to support local authorities in their investigation.\" There was also an image of typed condolences for \"Mrs. Patricia McKay\" from Fashion Island and its merchant community that was displayed in a frame beside an all-white floral display placed outdoors near a planter.\n\nAs Orange County's leading shopping center, Fashion Island houses such retailers as Nordstrom, Bloomingdale's, Neiman Marcus, AG, Allbirds and Dick's Sporting Goods, as well as restaurants and other businesses.\n\nIn a press release, Spitzer said, \"Our shopping centers and malls have become hunting grounds for criminals who are stalking innocent shoppers to rob them blind because our governor [Gavin Newsom] and our legislature refuse to hold anyone accountable for their actions. Actions have consequences and it shouldn't have to result in the death of an elderly woman just enjoying a day of shopping with her husband for our elected leaders in Sacramento to realize that this is the product of their soft-on-crime policies which encourage criminality while sacrificing public safety. This is Orange County and we refuse to accept this is the new normal. Criminals will be held accountable and violence will never be acceptable.\"\n\nIn the past two months in New York City, there have been a handful of incidents where individuals have been targeted by robbers for their luxury watches while dining in restaurants like Carbone, Birds of a Feather and Marlow & Sons. Media inquiries to those businesses were unreturned Wednesday.", "source": {"uri": "wwd.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "WWD"}, "authors": [{"uri": "rosemary_feitelberg@wwd.com", "name": "Rosemary

They were both friends of Prime Minister Christopher Luxon.\n\nThe three accused made brief appearances via video links from their cells on Monday (local time) after refusing to appear in court as required, the Los Angeles Times is reporting.\n\nThe judge re-scheduled them to appear on Wednesday at a plea hearing, and ordered that they appear then.\n\nDaily Mail reported the three accused, who were to have appeared before Judge Andre Manssourian in Orange County Superior Court, had \"pulled the same stunt\" for a scheduled hearing last Friday, refusing to move from their cells just 200 metres from the courtroom.\n\nIn their brief video appearance on Monday - which happened after sheriff'' deputies got iPads to their jail cells - all three had been shirtless and none of them spoke, Daily Mail reported.\n\nThe judge on Monday had seemed puzzled as to why the three were not to brought to court, saying he heard \"something about a 24-hour psychiatric hold\", and asking deputies to give him a report \"in writing as to why they are not in court right now\".\n\nThe three accused could be eligible for the death penalty if convicted, but California has had a moratorium on carrying out the death penalty since 2019 and has not executed anyone since 2006.\n\nThe three murder accused are: Leroy Ernest Joseph McCrary, 26, the alleged driver of the car that hit McKay, also charged with attempted second-degree robbery, and evading while driving recklessly.\n\nJaden Cunningham, 18, also charged with attempted second-degree robbery.\n\nMalachi Eddward Darnell, 18, who allegedly fired three shots at someone who chased after the fleeing car, is also charged with attempted murder and discharging a firearm, as well as attempted second-degree robbery.\n\nLA Times described McCrary as a \"third-striker\" who had not served prison time for his most recent two convictions for felony crimes - more serious crimes in comparison to misdemeanours - in LA County.\n\nAmong his other previous convictions, McCrary had been given two years' probation for an armed robbery, in which he and another suspect placed a gun to the head of a man while taking his Rolex watch, LA Times reported.\n\nAsked to explain the lack of prison time for McCrary, the Los Angeles County district attorney's office said in a statement that the case against McCrary had significant problems with proof.", "source": {"uri": "rnz.co.nz", "dataType": "news", "title": "RNZ"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robbery", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Robbery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doug_McKay_(public_servant)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Doug McKay (public servant)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patricia_McKay", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Patricia McKay"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_Luxon", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Christopher Luxon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newport_Beach,_California", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Newport Beach, California"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Probation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daily_Mail", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Daily Mail"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newport,_California", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Newport, California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Newport, California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New Zealand"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "New Zealand"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California_superior_courts", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "California superior courts"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheriff", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sheriff"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPad", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "IPad"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Times", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Times"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capital_punishment", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Capital punishment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_County_District_Attorney", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles County District Attorney"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rolex", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rolex"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moratorium_(law)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Moratorium (law)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attempted_murder", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Attempted murder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Misdemeanor", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Misdemeanor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Felony", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Felony"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Murder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Murder", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Murder", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Unsolved", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Unsolved", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Trials", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Trials", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 53}], "image": "https://media.rnztools.nz/rnz/image/upload/s--lzCFO5Wo--/t_tohu-badge-twitter/v1720049073/4KZJJV9_Trish_and_Doug_McKay_jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9716768", "eventUri": "eng-9716768", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.2156862745098039, "wgt": 185, "relevance": 1}

Erika Aklufi, surveillance video from that case showed McCrary pointing a handgun at a man's head on Broadway. He and an accomplice demanded that the man wear a watch, she said.\n\nMcCrary's DNA was also recovered from the victim's shirt, which he had retrieved during the robbery, police said.\n\nProsecutors charged McCrary, who was arrested by Los Angeles police a month later, and Donta Baker with robbery in the Santa Monica case based on DNA evidence, according to court records reviewed by The Times.\n\nPrior to that, McCrary was convicted in 2020 of criminal threats, a felony.\n\nProsecutors agreed to a plea deal that spared him prison time in the Santa Monica case, according to court documents. McCrary pleaded not guilty on April 26, 2023, to one count of theft and was sentenced by Los Angeles County Superior Court Judge Cathryn Brougham to three years in prison. But Brougham suspended the sentence and placed McCrary on probation for two years. She also ordered him to perform 200 hours of community service.\n\nMcCrary's suspended sentence was concurrent with another suspended sentence for a conviction for felon possession of a firearm in a separate case investigated by the LAPD.\n\nBrougham ordered a probation report prepared before McCrary was sentenced. But court clerks could not find any reports when The Times asked for them. Such reports typically provide a recommendation on sentencing and whether defendants are fit for probation.\n\nMcCrary's co-defendant pleaded not guilty to receiving stolen property in exchange for prosecutors dropping the theft charge. Baker, who has three prior convictions for robbery, felonious possession of a firearm and escaping custody, was also sentenced to two years of probation.\n\nLos Angeles County prosecutors have defended their handling of the Santa Monica case, which officials said days ago presented significant evidentiary problems.\n\nA spokesman for the prosecutor's office said the inability to identify the accused in the surveillance video hampered the investigation. Two witnesses were unable to identify the suspects, the spokesman said, noting that the robber's face was not shown in the video because he was wearing a mask.\n\nShe also said prosecutors were unable to identify the item in the suspects' hands and that a confirmatory DNA test was never conducted on the robbery victim's shirt, calling into question its accuracy.\n\nBecause of these issues, the management team authorized a plea offer that allowed [him] be placed on probation with a suspended prison sentence, the district attorney's office said in a statement.\n\nLegal expert Louis Shapiro, a defense attorney not involved in the case, said that to be admissible in California, a confirmatory DNA test is required to demonstrate the likelihood that the results are reliable. Still, he added, the fact that Santa Monica police have DNA makes the robbery case stronger than most.\n\nIt's very rare to be able to collect DNA in a theft case before trial, Shapiro said. Quite frankly, the office usually gets that kind of confirmation later.\n\nDmitry Gorin, a former prosecutor, said that confirmatory DNA testing in a criminal case is a fundamental part of trial preparation and does not mean that a case has evidentiary problems.\n\nCody Green, president of the Santa Monica Police Association, said investigators had plenty of time to obtain confirmatory DNA testing and the plea deal was reached before any preliminary hearing.\n\n\"This case is as strong as you can imagine,\" Green said.\n\nCritics of Los Angeles District Attorney George Gascon say the way cases are being handled is further evidence of mismanagement at the nation's largest prosecutor's office. Gascon's opponent in the November election, Nathan Hochman, said the district attorney's misconduct appears to have cost another life.\n\nIn the Newport Beach case, Orange County prosecutors say McCrary, Malachi Eddward Darnell, 18, of Los Angeles, and Jaden Cunningham, 18, of Lancaster, targeted the McKays, who had just left the upscale Fashion Island mall.\n\nThree suspects pulled up to the McKays' home in a white Toyota Camry. Two masked robbers got out, one of whom pointed a gun at the New Zealand businessman's head and demanded his watch, authorities said.\n\nA third attacker dragged Trish McKay across the street, trying to grab grocery bags from her. The Camry was moving at the time. Doug McKay jumped in front of the vehicle to try to save his wife. But authorities say the driver, identified by police as McCrary, ran over the woman and dragged her to her death.", "source": {"uri": "exbulletin.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ExBulletin"},

Now, he's accused in Fashion Island killing", "body": "The alleged leader of an armed robbery crew charged with killing a New Zealand tourist last week outside Newport Beach's Fashion Island mall had been placed on probation for stealing a Rolex at gunpoint in Santa Monica.\n\nHe avoided prison time in that case after Los Angeles County prosecutors agreed to a three-year suspended sentence, according to interviews and records reviewed by The Times.\n\nLeroy Ernest McCrary, 26, now faces a special circumstances murder charge that could carry the death penalty after authorities allege he ran over Patricia \"Trish\" McKay, 68, during a July 2 robbery attempt.\n\nOrange County prosecutors say McCrary and two other men targeted McKay's husband, former chair of the Bank of New Zealand Douglas McKay, for his high-end watch.\n\nMcCrary and the other defendants have not yet entered pleas, and their attorneys could not immediately be reached for comment.\n\nThe Fashion Island slaying is renewing interest in the 2022 Rolex theft.\n\nSanta Monica Police Lt. Erika Aklufi said surveillance video in that case showed McCrary putting a handgun to the head of a man on Broadway. He and an accomplice demanded the man's watch, she said.\n\nMcCrary's DNA also was recovered from the victim's shirt, which he'd grabbed during the robbery, police said.\n\nProsecutors charged McCrary, who had been arrested by L.A. police a month later, and Donta Baker with robbery in the Santa Monica case based on the DNA evidence, according to court records reviewed by The Times.\n\nBefore that, McCrary had been convicted in a 2020 case of making criminal threats, a felony.\n\nProsecutors agreed to a plea deal that spared him prison time in the Santa Monica case, court records show. McCrary pleaded no contest on April 26, 2023, to one count of robbery and was sentenced by Los Angeles County Superior Court Judge Cathryn Brougham to three years. But Brougham suspended the sentence and placed McCrary on two years' probation. She also ordered him to complete 200 hours of community service.\n\nMcCrary's suspended sentence ran concurrent to another suspended sentence for a conviction for possessing a gun as a felon in a separate case the LAPD investigated.\n\nBrougham ordered a probation report be completed before McCrary's sentencing. But courthouse clerks could find no report when The Times requested it. Such reports usually give a recommendation on sentencing and the defendant's suitability for probation.\n\nMcCrary's co-defendant pleaded no contest to receiving stolen property in exchange for prosecutors dropping the robbery count. Baker, who had three prior felony convictions for grand theft, possessing a gun as a felon and escaping from custody, was also sentenced to two years' probation.\n\nLos Angeles County prosecutors defended their handling of the Santa Monica case, which officials several days ago said \"had significant problems with proof.\"\n\nA spokesperson in the district attorney's office said an inability to identify the defendant in the surveillance video hampered the case. Two witnesses were unable to identify the suspects, the spokesperson said, noting that the robber's face was not shown in the video because he was wearing a mask.\n\nShe also said that prosecutors were unable to identify the item in the suspect's hands, and that a confirmatory DNA test was never conducted on the robbery victim's shirt, which called into question its accuracy.\n\n\"As a result of these issues, the management team ... authorized a plea offer that allowed [him] to be placed on probation with a suspended state prison sentence,\" the district attorney's office said in a statement.\n\nLegal expert Louis Shapiro, a defense attorney not involved in the case, said to be admissible in California, a confirmatory DNA test is required to show the probability that the results are reliable. Still, he said, the fact that Santa Monica police had DNA made the robbery case stronger than most.\n\n\"It is very rare to pull DNA in a robbery case\" before the trial stage, Shapiro said. \"Quite frankly, the office usually gets that kind of confirmation down the road.\"\n\nDmitry Gorin, a former prosecutor, said confirmatory DNA testing in a criminal case is a basic part of preparing for trial and does not mean that a case has problems of proof.\n\nCody Green, president of the Santa Monica Police Officers Assn., said that investigators had plenty of time to get a confirmatory DNA test and that the plea deal was made before any preliminary hearings were conducted.\n\n\"This case was as solid a case as they come,\" Green said.\n\nDetractors of L.A. County Dist. Atty. George Gasc\u00f3n say the case's handling is further evidence of the mismanagement of the nation's largest prosecutor's office. Gasc\u00f3n's opponent in the November election, Nathan Hochman, said the district attorney's \"malpractice appears to have cost another life.\"\n\nIn the Newport Beach case, Orange County prosecutors say McCrary, Malachi Eddward Darnell, 18, of Los Angeles and Jaden Cunningham, 18, of Lancaster targeted the McKays, who had just left the upscale Fashion Island mall.\n\nThree suspects pulled up to the McKays in a white Toyota Camry. Two masked robbers jumped out, with one putting a gun to the New Zealand businessman's head and demanding his watch, authorities said.\n\nA third assailant dragged Trish McKay into the street while trying to wrest shopping bags away from her. By then, the Camry was moving forward. Doug McKay jumped in front of the vehicle to try to save his wife. But authorities say the driver -- identified by police as McCrary -- ran over the woman and dragged her to her death.", "source": {"uri": "latimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Los Angeles

Two masked men jumped out, and authorities say one put a gun to the businessman's head, demanding his watch and forcing him to the ground.\n\nThe other dragged Trish McKay into the street, in front of the Camry, while trying to wrest the shopping bags away from her.\n\nBy then, the Camry and its getaway driver were moving forward. Doug McKay jumped in front of the vehicle to try to save his wife. But authorities say the driver -- identified by police as Leroy Ernest Joseph McCrary -- ran over the woman, dragging her body 65 feet across the parking lot.\n\nA good Samaritan, Beau Bayless, chased after the fleeing car. But police say his efforts were cut short when one of the robbers fired three shots at him.\n\nEyewitnesses immediately called 911, and within minutes, police had begun a pursuit of the Camry as it raced north toward Los Angeles County, reaching speeds of up to 110 mph. A television news helicopter captured video of the car speeding on the left shoulder of the 105 Freeway and at one point grazing the concrete median.\n\nOne of the men -- later identified by police as Jaden Cunningham -- was arrested after he bailed out of the vehicle in the city of Cypress.

However, as reported byLA Times, California has had a moratorium on carrying out the death penalty since 2019 and has not executed anyone since 2006.\n\nMrs McKay and her business mogul husband, Doug McKay, were standing outside the Fashion Island shopping centre in Newport Beach on July 2 when two men allegedly approached them at gunpoint.\n\nIt is alleged that one of the men dragged Mrs McKay into the street, in front of their getaway car, while trying to grab her shopping bags.\n\nPolice allege the car's driver -- a third man -- was moving forward in the vehicle and ran over Mrs McKay, dragging her body around 20m across the carpark.\n\nFollowing the arrest of the three suspects -- Leroy Ernest Joseph McCrary, 26, of Los Angeles, Malachi Eddward Darnell, 18, of Los Angeles, and Jaden Cunningham, 18, of Lancaster -- Orange County District Attorney Todd Spitzer said the trio had been charged with \"special circumstance murder\".\n\nIn addition, Mr Spitzer's office said the suspects \"are eligible for the death penalty if they are convicted of the special circumstances murder of 68-year-old Patricia McKay in the commission of a robbery with a felony enhancement of causing the death of an elder over the age of 65\".\n\nEssentially, it means their murder charge comes with the possibility of a death penalty because of what prosecutors say are aggravating factors in the killing, including McKay's age and the fact she died during an attempted robbery, as reported by the New Zealand Herald.\n\nThe three suspects were due to appear at Orange County Superior Court and enter pleas this week, however, according to the Daily Mail -- none showed up.\n\nAccording to local media, it was the second time the suspects reportedly refused to show up to court from their jail cell to the courtroom.\n\nFollowing the sudden death of Mrs McKay, whose husband was a prominent Auckland businessman, family and authorities unleashed on the group of \"thugs\" responsible.\n\nIn statement released by those closed to Ms McKay, family said \"no words can express our sadness as we try to come to terms with the loss of our mother, wife, and friend Patricia\".\n\nNew Zealand's Prime Minister Christopher Luxon called Ms McKay's death \"an absolute tragedy\".\n\nIn an interview with Newstalk ZB's Kerre Woodham, Luxon revealed he knew her husband Mr McKay very well.\n\n\"He's a great man and it's a great family ... I think the family will be in huge shock and all our thoughts and prayers are with them,\" he said.\n\n\"They're top people.\"\n\nMr Spitzer also expressed condolences to McKay's loved ones \"and to the entire country of New Zealand as we mourn her senseless death in the commission of a crime that should have never happened.\"\n\nOver the weekend, family spokesman Nick Hern thanked US authorities, including Newport Beach Mayor Will O'Neill, for their assistance in returning Mrs McKay's body back to New Zealand.\n\n\"Once her return is confirmed we'll advise of plans for Trish's farewell,\" Hern said.\n\n\"The McKay family wishes to express their deep gratitude for the support they have received over the past few days. In particular, teams from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the New Zealand Embassy in Washington and the office of Consulate General in Los Angeles have been extraordinary in the work they are doing helping our family, including liaising with state and federal authorities in the US.\n\n\"Thanks to this heartfelt and expert support, along with the excellent work of all the US authorities including the team from Orange County, and especially Newport Beach Mayor Will O'Neill, great progress is being made to return Trish to New Zealand and we hope to have her home within the next week.\".",

In other words, this will almost certainly - especially in Orange County - a death penalty case.\n\nMcCrary specifically has prior felony convictions for residential burglary in 2018, criminal threats in 2020, and robbery in 2023, all in Los Angeles County. It is the last case that is drawing the fury of the public and the (publicly) understated ire Gascon's supposed law enforcement \"partners\" at the Santa Monica Police Department.\n\nIn 2023, the SMPD arrested McCrary for - again - trying to steal an expensive watch at gunpoint. There was video surveillance of the crime and McCrary even touched the victims shirt, making a DNA test possible and it came back as positively identifying McCrary as the robber.\n\nDNA testing in a robbery case, especially at such an early point in the process - is very rare, getting match even more so.\n\nBut Gascon's office thought the evidence may be weak and last week said publicly that McCrary got a plea deal that involved a three year suspended sentence, two years' probation and community service (the \"sentence\" also ran concurrent with his conviction for being a felon with a gun) in part because the case had \"had significant problems with proof.\"\n\nThe plea - also somewhat unusually - was negotiated even before McCrary's preliminary hearing on the charge.\n\nSanta Monica cops were not at all pleased with being thrown under the bus by Gascon, especially in light that saying the case had \"problems with proof\" is simply false.\n\nCody Green, president of the Santa Monica Police Officers Assn., told the Los Angeles Times that investigators had plenty of time to get a confirmatory DNA test and that the plea deal was made before any preliminary hearings were conducted.\n\n\"This case was as solid a case as they come,\" Green said.\n\nA note for Gascon: Never ever lie about something that is in writing...in someone else's office.\n\nRepeated attempts to reach Gascon's office for further comment were ignored.\n\nWhile it would not comment on whether it intentionally drew public attention to the McCrary plea, the SMPD did not agree with Gascon's office's assessment of the McCrary case:\n\n\"We stand by the work of our dedicated detectives and the impressive investigation of a 2022 robbery committed in Santa Monica by Leroy McCrary and Donta Baker. The SMPD Criminal Investigations Division is known for relentless, meticulous, and thorough work solving crimes in our city,\" said Lt. Erika Aklufi today. \"In this case, SMPD detectives conducted a comprehensive investigation that included: locating surveillance video that showed the crime in progress; tracking the getaway car; using social media to connect McCrary and Baker to one another and the crime; and collecting and testing DNA from the victim's clothing. Our detectives presented a solid case to the Deputy DA who was handling the prosecution. The DNA, which was a match for McCrary, was being confirmed at the crime lab when, prior to the preliminary hearing, the DA made the decision to settle the case without custody time.\"\n\nThat being said, the SMPD said it \"appreciates its long-standing, positive working relationship with the LA County District Attorney's Office.\"\n\nAklufi did add, though, that \"(T)his incident is a cogent reminder that when we collaborate and communicate better with our partners in the criminal justice system, all those who are affected by crime benefit. The SMPD has full faith that the Newport Beach Police Department and Orange County DA's office is working together to ensure the individuals responsible for Trish McKay's death are held accountable.\"\n\nThe plea in the case - a clear \"Gascon Special\" - is exactly why the public overwhelmingly - when polled - feels far less safe than it did before Gascon's 2020 election.\n\nThe specifics in this instance are especially tragic, but the decarceral ideology behind them is rife in Gascon's office and that is why they happen. While he did not sign off on the deal personally, it is Gascon's policies that are the driving force causing these deals to be made.\n\n\"He has policies that call for keeping as many people out of jail as possible,\" said one livid deputy district attorney. \"He has an agenda and has created an environment that makes clear that this is what he wants.\"\n\nAuthor Recent Posts Katy GrimesKaty Grimes, the Editor in Chief of the California Globe, is a long-time Investigative Journalist covering the California State Capitol, and the co-author of California's War Against Donald Trump: Who Wins?

The former Manchester United forward has been recruited as a columnist for the Sunday Times during the European Championships, enabling him to share his thoughts on the Three Lions and other talking points from the tournament in Germany. His first submission relates to his own experience competing at the Euros, looking back on his breakthrough tournament in 2004 and the extreme disappointment of 2016 after being knocked out by Iceland. Rooney will balance this with working as a pundit for the BBC during their coverage of Euro 2024, continuing a theme of media work for the ex-England after his recent appearances on Sky Sports towards the end of the season.

Such commitments will have to be balanced alongside the commitment of his coaching role at Plymouth Argyle, having been appointed as the new manager of the Championship club at the end of May. This is Rooney's first role back in the dugout since being sacked by Birmingham City in January after only 15 games in charge. Prior to this, the ex-United striker held coaching roles at DC United and Derby County. Describing the challenge ahead of him, he recently remarked: \"Taking this role at Plymouth Argyle feels like the perfect next step in my career \u2013 and I would like to thank the chairman and board for the faith they have shown in me. \"This is an opportunity to be part of an exciting project. I look forward to helping to build a squad of players to play expansive football \u2013 and to entertain the Green Army. \"I have experienced first-hand how talented the existing group of players is here \u2013 and also the incredible atmosphere at Home Park. The club is on an exciting long-term journey, with a progressive plan in place. I am grateful for the opportunity to be part of it.\"", "summary": "Former Manchester United striker Wayne Rooney is set for a busy summer as he balances working commitments", "url": "https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/wayne-rooney-lands-new-job-29321344", "image": "https://i2-prod.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/incoming/article29321358.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_GettyImages-2156628408.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-09 13:13:33", "author": "Tom Cavilla", "authors": ["Tom Cavilla"], "language": "en", "catgory": "sports", "source_country": "gb", "sentiment": 0.663}

This year, more than 600 people registered for the event, with two coming from Canada and 108 from other states.\n\nDuring the challenge, hunters will linger around designated areas spanning through western Broward County to the Tamiami Trail in the Big Cypress Wildlife Management Area, including other management areas like Southern Glades, Holey Land and Rotenberger.\n\nThe goal is to humanely kill as many pythons as possible, and prizes divide between three groups: professional hunters who work for the state, hunters who are active in the military or are veterans and novice hunters, which includes anyone who is not working as a state contracted python hunter.\n\nEach category has its own prizes, with $2,500 going to the person or team that kills the most pythons, $1,500 going to the runner-up for most kills and $1,000 going to whoever kills the longest python. The grand prize for the most kills in all categories gets a $10,000 prize.\n\nEach person can only win one prize, so if someone is tops in two categories, they will end up with the highest-valued prize and the next qualifying hunter gets the remaining prize.\n\nIn 2017, the South Florida Water Management District and the state began hiring contractors to handle its invasive python problem year round. According to the wildlife agency's website, through 2023, more than 11,000 pythons have been removed by these contractors.\n\nLast year's challenge brought in 209 pythons and the grand prize winner was Paul Hobbs, who bagged 20 pythons. Also during 2023, Florida wildlife agency and district contractors removed about 2,200 pythons.\n\nAmy Siewe, the self-named Python Huntress, won a prize last year for catching a Burmese python measuring 10 feet and 9 inches (327 centimeters). This year, she won't be participating in the challenge due to a knee surgery but said she's not a fan of the annual challenge.\n\nSiewe, who used to work as a state contractor catching invasive pythons, said she believed the initial intent of the challenge was to bring awareness to the issue. Now, it's drawing large crowds of hunters, potentially scaring off pythons and potentially killing native snakes they mistake as pythons, like corn snakes, brown water snakes or cottonmouths.\n\n\"Pythons don't take on their normal behavioral pattern because there's so much traffic and they'll come up and then they'll go back into the swamp,\" Siewe said. \"I feel for myself, it's counterproductive.\"\n\nParticipants are required to undergo an online training, including information on how to identify Burmese pythons versus other snakes, Funck said. She said there's also an additional optional in-person training participants can attend to properly identify Burmese pythons.\n\n\"That's a huge part of what we do, is try to get the word out on how to identify these pythons, how to safely and humanely capture it,\" Funck said.\n\n___\n\nRepublished with permission of The Associated Press.", "source": {"uri": "floridapolitics.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Florida Politics - Campaigns & Elections.

Participants can win more than $25,000 in prizes as they remove invasive Burmese pythons from South Florida.\n\nBurmese pythons, non-native to Florida, have a negative impact on native wildlife. This invasive species is primarily found in and around the Everglades ecosystem in South Florida, where they prey on birds, mammals, and other reptiles. Florida Python Challenge is a 10-day competition created by the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission that helps protect the Everglades habitat and all its native animals by removing the invasive Burmese pythons. Participants have nine days to kill as many Burmese pythons as possible.\n\nIn 2023, the Florida Python Challenge removed 209 invasive Burmese pythons from the Everglades. A total of 917 pythons have been removed during the challenge since it began. A total of 1,050 participants from 35 states (and Belgium) registered for the 10-day competition in 2023.\n\nWhere will the python challenge take place?\n\nThe Florida Python Challenge will take place on seven commission-managed lands in South Florida.\n\nWhat are the rules of the Florida Python Challenge?\n\n\u25fe Participants must carry a printed or digital copy of their Florida Python Challenge registration notification email while hunting.\n\n\u25fe Participants must complete required online training and receive a unique completion code.\n\n\u25fe Only Burmese pythons removed from competition locations are valid entries.\n\n\u25fe The use of firearms is prohibited during the competition.\n\n\u25fe The use of dogs or other animals to search, capture, or kill is prohibited.\n\n\u25fe Air guns and captive bolts are allowed.\n\n\u25fe Python carcasses must be kept chilled or frozen, then turned into the nearest Florida Python Challenge check station within 24 hours of capture.\n\nPrizes for the Florida Python Challenge\n\nPrizes will be issued by the Fish & Wildlife Foundation of Florida. There is a $10,000 Ultimate Grand Prize awarded to the participant who removes the most pythons. There are three categories of the competition: Professional, Novice, and Military. Each category has these awards within them.\n\nOriginally from Southeast Asia, the Burmese python has been introduced to southern Florida either through accidental escape or intentional release of captive animals.\n\nIn 1979, the first observation of a Burmese python in the wild in South Florida was recorded in Everglades National Park. The heaviest python ever caught in Florida was an 18-foot, 215-pound snake. It was caught by a biologist with the Conservancy of Southwest Florida in Naples in 2021.\n\nSize of the Burmese python\n\nThe Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission keeps track of the length and weight of Burmese pythons after sightings are reported. The longest Burmese python ever captured in Florida, in July 2023, measured more than 19 feet.\n\nWhat should you do if you see a Burmese python?\n\nSummer is the best time of year to see a Burmese python. During the summer months, Burmese pythons may remain sedentary when the sun is up, but at night they may become more active and more easily spotted crossing levees or roadways.\n\nA U.S. Geological Survey report last year shows that Burmese pythons are expanding their range so quickly that it can be marked in miles per year in some areas.\n\nIf you spot a Burmese python, take a photo, mark your location, and call the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission at 888-483-4681. You can humanely kill Burmese pythons on private land at any time with landowner permission. You don't need a permit to kill the invasive species. Live transport of pythons is not allowed.\n\nThere are multiple ways to humanely euthanize a python, but here are the basic guidelines from the fish and wildlife commission:\n\n\u25fe Step 1: Immediate loss of consciousness.\n\n\u25fe Use a captive bolt, firearm, or air gun to shoot directly to the brain.\n\n\u25fe Insert a small rod, like a screwdriver, spike, or pick, into the cranial cavity and twist it to ensure the entire brain is destroyed.", "source": {"uri": "usatoday.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "USA Today"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burmese_python", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Burmese python"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Everglades", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Everglades"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Florida", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "South Florida"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_(programming_language)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Python (programming language)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pythonidae", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pythonidae"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasive_species", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Invasive species"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida_Fish_and_Wildlife_Conservation_Commission", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Predation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Predation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mammal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mammal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reptile", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Reptile"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecosystem", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ecosystem"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bird"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wildlife", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wildlife"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carrion", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Carrion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southeast_Asia", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Southeast Asia"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firearm", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Firearm"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunting", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hunting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dog", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dog"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belgium", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Belgium"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Belgium"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Everglades_National_Park", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Everglades National Park"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southwest_Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Southwest Florida"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unconsciousness", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Unconsciousness"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skull", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Skull"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biologist", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Biologist"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Pets/Reptiles_and_Amphibians", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Pets/Reptiles and Amphibians", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Biodiversity", "label": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Biodiversity", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Pets/Reptiles_and_Amphibians", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Pets/Reptiles and Amphibians", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Animation/Contests", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Animation/Contests", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Open_Source/Employment", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Open Source/Employment", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "news/Environment", "label": "news/Environment", "wgt": 65}], "image": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/authoring/authoring-images/2024/08/07/USAT/74701915007-python-topper.png?auto=webp&crop=3799,2137,x0,y0&format=pjpg&width=1200", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9802746", "eventUri": "eng-9802746", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2018-08-", "textStart": 89, "textEnd": 96}], "sentiment": 0.05882352941176472, "wgt": 237, "relevance": 1}

They may even reach Georgia.\n\nLongest Burmese python on record was caught in Southwest Florida\n\nA group of python hunters caught the longest Burmese python ever measured on July 10, 2023, in the Big Cypress National Preserve in eastern Collier County.\n\nThe monster snake was 19 feet long.\n\n18-foot pythons captured in south Florida, Everglades\n\nThe previous record was held by python hunters Ryan Ausburn and Kevin Pavlidis who captured a python measuring a whopping 18-feet 9-inches in 2020.\n\nIn 2013, Jason Leon captured a then-record 18-foot python in southeastern Miami-Dade County. The massive snake weighed 128 pounds.\n\nConservancy of Southwest Florida biologists caught the heaviest Burmese python ever recorded in the Florida Everglades in 2022. The colossal female python weighed an eye-popping 215 pounds and was nearly 18 feet long.\n\nA 198-pound Burmese python was captured in November 2023 in the Big Cypress Preserve, making it the second-heaviest ever caught in the Sunshine State.

(AP) -- Friday marked the start of the annual Florida Python Challenge, where hunters head into the Everglades to track down invasive Burmese pythons in hopes of grabbing a share of $30,000 in prizes.\n\nThe annual 10-day hunt, which started more than a decade ago, promotes public awareness of issues with invasive species in Florida while engaging the public in Everglades conversation, said Sarah Funck, the wildlife impact management section leader with Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission.\n\n\"They are a well-established invasive species across much of South Florida, unfortunately, in our natural areas,\" Funck said of Burmese pythons. \"A huge part of this challenge is to make sure that people understand about this issue and understand that in general, when you have a non-native species present in the state for whatever purpose, don't let it loose, that can be really detrimental to our environment.\"\n\nOver the past decade, the python challenge has grabbed headlines for its incentive-based, only-in-Florida style of hunting as well as celebrity participation. This year, more than 600 people registered for the event, with two coming from Canada and 108 from other states.\n\nThe goal is to humanely kill as many pythons as possible, and prizes divide between three groups: professional hunters who work for the state, hunters who are active in the military or are veterans and novice hunters, which includes anyone who is not working as a state contracted python hunter.\n\nEach category has its own prizes, with $2,500 going to the person or team that kills the most pythons, $1,500 going to the runner-up for most kills and $1,000 going to whoever kills the longest python. The grand prize for the most kills in all categories gets a $10,000 prize.\n\nEach person can only win one prize, so if someone is tops in two categories, they will end up with the highest-valued prize and the next qualifying hunter gets the remaining prize.\n\nIn 2017, the South Florida Water Management District and the state began hiring contractors to handle its invasive python problem year round. According to the wildlife agency's website, through 2023, more than 11,000 pythons have been removed by these contractors.\n\nLast year's challenge brought in 209 pythons and the grand prize winner was Paul Hobbs, who bagged 20 pythons. Also during 2023, Florida wildlife agency and district contractors removed about 2,200 pythons.\n\nAmy Siewe, the self-named Python Huntress, won a prize last year for catching a Burmese python measuring 10 feet and 9 inches (327 centimeters). This year, she won't be participating in the challenge due to a knee surgery but said she's not a fan of the annual challenge.\n\nSiewe, who used to work as a state contractor catching invasive pythons, said she believed the initial intent of the challenge was to bring awareness to the issue. Now, it's drawing large crowds of hunters, potentially scaring off pythons and potentially killing native snakes they mistake as pythons, like corn snakes, brown water snakes or cottonmouths.\n\n\"Pythons don't take on their normal behavioral pattern because there's so much traffic and they'll come up and then they'll go back into the swamp,\" Siewe said. \"I feel for myself, it's counterproductive.\"\n\nParticipants are required to undergo an online training, including information on how to identify Burmese pythons versus other snakes, Funck said. She said there's also an additional optional in-person training participants can attend to properly identify Burmese pythons.\n\n\"That's a huge part of what we do, is try to get the word out on how to identify these pythons, how to safely and humanely capture it,\" Funck said.", "source": {"uri": "wbrz.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "WBRZ"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Everglades", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Everglades"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pythonidae", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pythonidae"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasive_species", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Invasive species"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burmese_python", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Burmese python"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wildlife", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Wildlife"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_(genus)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Python (genus)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida_Fish_and_Wildlife_Conservation_Commission", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Introduced_species", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Introduced species"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Florida", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "South Florida"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Palm_Beach,_Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "West Palm Beach, Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "West Palm Beach, Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Florida_Water_Management_District", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "South Florida Water Management District"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunting", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hunting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agkistrodon_piscivorus", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Agkistrodon piscivorus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corn_snake", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Corn snake"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swamp", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Swamp"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Associated Press"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snake", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Snake"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Philanthropy/Cheer_and_Support", "label": "dmoz/Society/Philanthropy/Cheer and Support", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Theft", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Theft", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Pets/Free_Services", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Pets/Free Services", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Philanthropy/Free_Donations", "label": "dmoz/Society/Philanthropy/Free Donations", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Environment", "label": "news/Environment", "wgt": 72}], "image": "https://dcer237tfveol.cloudfront.net/v2/pgzWGc5CStl5RFr4dt_npw0tUtTGMfEepq5jtey1kNVj8ZjvQwl_gJhMlppkt2nwiaPTLXuk9CfeSDyoR8AR8XNM6TBHMuJ4mvT8_lzkkRFHa6WmfrhOHHXjq1vN40wYc", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9802746", "eventUri": "eng-9802746", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "West Palm Beach, Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3568627450980393, "wgt": 229, "relevance": 1}

This year, more than 600 people registered for the event, with two coming from Canada and 108 from other states.\n\nDuring the challenge, hunters will linger around designated areas spanning through western Broward County to the Tamiami Trail in the Big Cypress Wildlife Management Area, including other management areas like Southern Glades, Holey Land and Rotenberger.\n\nThe goal is to humanely kill as many pythons as possible, and prizes divide between three groups: professional hunters who work for the state, hunters who are active in the military or are veterans and novice hunters, which includes anyone who is not working as a state contracted python hunter.\n\nEach category has its own prizes, with $2,500 going to the person or team that kills the most pythons, $1,500 going to the runner-up for most kills and $1,000 going to whoever kills the longest python. The grand prize for the most kills in all categories gets a $10,000 prize.\n\nEach person can only win one prize, so if someone is tops in two categories, they will end up with the highest-valued prize and the next qualifying hunter gets the remaining prize.\n\nIn 2017, the South Florida Water Management District and the state began hiring contractors to handle its invasive python problem year round. According to the wildlife agency's website, through 2023, more than 11,000 pythons were removed by these contractors.\n\nLast year's challenge brought in 209 pythons and the grand prize winner was Paul Hobbs, who bagged 20 pythons.

Up to $25,000 in prizes are up for grabs during this annual 10-day challenge from the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission.\n\nIn 2000, Burmese pythons were first identified in Everglades National Park. According to the United States Geological Survey (USGS), they were either intentionally or accidentally released by people who owned them as pets.\n\nSince then, the enormous reptiles have quickly become one of the most destructive foreign species in the park's history. The population has only continued to grow and it now occupies most of southern Florida. Burmese pythons can grow to over 18 feet long and weigh over 200 pounds. A female Burmese python can lay up to 50 to 100 eggs at a time, and they have thrived in the Everglades' humid tropical to subtropical climate.\n\n[Related: Scientists propose eating more python.]\n\nSince they eat a wide range of animals, they have greatly altered the food web and ecosystems across the Greater Everglades. A 2023 review from the USGS, found that the snakes have contributed to the declines of possums, bobcats, foxes, cottontail rabbits, and raccoons. The odds of eradicating them once they spread across a large area are very low.\n\n\"The iconic Everglades is a national treasure and the Florida Python Challenge is a great way to get the public involved in understanding the unique Everglades ecosystem. Removing invasive pythons from across the Greater Everglades Ecosystem is critical, and we must do everything we can to combat this invasive species,\" South Florida Water Management District Governing Board Member \"Alligator Ron\" Bergeron said in a statement.\n\nThe hunt begins today and ends at 5 p.m. local time on Sunday, August 18. The goal is to humanely kill as many Burmese pythons as possible. The species is not protected in Florida, but anti-cruelty law still applies in this situation. Firearms are not allowed in the challenge. The Florida Python Challenge outlines an approved two-step process for killing the snakes, which includes using a captive bolt and ensuring that the snakes remain unconscious during the procedure.\n\nThe 2023 challenge brought in 209 pythons. Over the next 10 days, hunters will use designated areas that span western Broward County to the Tamiami Trail in the Big Cypress Wildlife Management Area. Other spots include Southern Glades, Holey Land, and Rotenberger. There is both in-person and online training on how to identify these snakes.\n\nThe top prize of $10,000 will be awarded to the individual who catches the most pythons. There are three general categories-Novice, Professional, and Military. The person who catches the most pythons in each of these categories will win $2,500, with the runners-up receiving $1,500, The person who catches the longest python will win $1,000.\n\nThe South Florida Water Management District and the state began hiring contractors to handle the issue year round in 2017. Since then, more than 11,000 pythons have been removed, with 2,200 removed in 2023 alone. The heaviest python contractors have caught was a female that weighed 215 pounds and was close to 18-feet-long. It was caught by Conservancy of Southwest Florida biologists in 2022.\n\n[Related: Why are there so many snakes?]\n\nFormer state contractor and self-named \"Python Huntress\" Amy Siewe won the 2023 prize for longest python. She caught a snake that was 10 feet and 9 inches long. She will not be participating this year due to a knee surgery. She told the Associated Press that she is not a fan of this annual challenge, as it has started to draw large crowds that are possibly scaring off pythons and hunters may be killing native snakes-including cottonmouths, corn snakes, and brown water snakes-that they mistake for pythons.\n\n\"Pythons don't take on their normal behavioral pattern because there's so much traffic and they'll come up and then they'll go back into the swamp,\" Siewe told AP. \"I feel for myself, it's counterproductive.\"", "source": {"uri": "popsci.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Popular Science"},

This year, more than 600 people registered for the event, with two coming from Canada and 108 from other states.\n\nDuring the challenge, hunters will linger around designated areas spanning through western Broward County to the Tamiami Trail in the Big Cypress Wildlife Management Area, including other management areas like Southern Glades, Holey Land and Rotenberger.\n\nThe goal is to humanely kill as many pythons as possible, and prizes divide between three groups: professional hunters who work for the state, hunters who are active in the military or are veterans and novice hunters, which includes anyone who is not working as a state contracted python hunter.\n\nEach category has its own prizes, with $2,500 going to the person or team that kills the most pythons, $1,500 going to the runner-up for most kills and $1,000 going to whoever kills the longest python. The grand prize for the most kills in all categories gets a $10,000 prize.\n\nEach person can only win one prize, so if someone is tops in two categories, they will end up with the highest-valued prize and the next qualifying hunter gets the remaining prize.\n\nIn 2017, the South Florida Water Management District and the state began hiring contractors to handle its invasive python problem year round. According to the wildlife agency's website, through 2023, more than 11,000 pythons were removed by these contractors.\n\nLast year's challenge brought in 209 pythons and the grand prize winner was Paul Hobbs, who bagged 20 pythons. Also during 2023, Florida wildlife agency and district contractors removed about 2,200 pythons.\n\nAmy Siewe, the self-named Python Huntress, won a prize last year for catching a Burmese python measuring 10 feet and 9 inches. This year, she won't participate in the challenge due to a knee surgery but said she's not a fan of the annual challenge.\n\nSiewe, who used to work as a state contractor catching invasive pythons, said she believed the initial intent of the challenge was to bring awareness to the issue. Now, it's drawing large crowds of hunters, potentially scaring off pythons and killing native snakes they mistake as pythons, like corn snakes, brown water snakes or cottonmouths.\n\n\"Pythons don't take on their normal behavioral pattern because there's so much traffic and they'll come up and then they'll go back into the swamp,\" Siewe said.\n\nParticipants are required to undergo an online training, including information on how to identify Burmese pythons versus other snakes, Funck said. She said there's also an additional optional in-person training participants can attend to properly identify Burmese pythons.\n\n\"That's a huge part of what we do, is try to get the word out on how to identify these pythons, how to safely and humanely capture it,\" Funck said.\n\nCoastal Areas That Saw the Largest Increase in Water Temps\n\nCoastal Areas That Saw the Largest Increase in Water

See heaviest, longest Burmese pythons ever caught", "body": "The Florida Python Challenge, a Florida Fish and Wildlife conservation effort to help protect the Everglades ecosystem from invasive Burmese pythons, starts this week.\n\nFirst identified in Everglades National Park in 2000, the Burmese python may be the most destructive foreign animal in the park's history.\n\nBurmese pythons have put a stranglehold on Florida's wildlife, contributing to the decline of raccoons, opossums, bobcats, foxes, and marsh and cottontail rabbits, according to a USGS study.\n\nThe annual Everglades python hunt starts at 12:01 a.m. Friday, August 9 and ends at 5 p.m. Sunday, August 18.\n\n$25,000 in prizes are up for grabs for this year's hunt.\n\nThe top prize of $10,000 goes to the person who catches the most pythons. Those with the most catches in the Novice, Professional and Military categories win $2,500, while runners-up in each group receive $1,500, and $1,000 is awarded for the longest pythons caught.\n\nBurmese pythons captured in Florida must be humanely killed. While they are not protected in Florida, anti-cruelty law still applies.\n\nThe invasive snakes are distributed across more than a thousand square miles in the Everglades and southern Florida Burmese pythons have been found across the state and are slithering north. They may even reach Georgia.\n\nA group of python hunters caught the longest Burmese python ever measured on July 10, 2023, in the Big Cypress National Preserve in eastern Collier County.\n\nIn 2013, Jason Leon captured a then-record 18-foot python in southeastern Miami-Dade County.

The prizes are divided into three groups: professional hunters working for the state, hunters who are active in the military or are veterans, and novice hunters, which includes anyone who is not a state-contracted python hunter.\n\nEach category has its own prizes, with $2,500 awarded to the person or team that kills the most pythons, $1,500 to the runner-up for the most kills, and $1,000 to the person who kills the longest python. The top prize for the most kills in all categories is $10,000.\n\nEach person can win only one prize. If someone is the best in two categories, he gets the prize with the highest value. The next hunter who qualifies gets the remaining prize.\n\nIn 2017, the South Florida Water Management District and the state began hiring contractors to deal with the invasive python problem year-round. According to the wildlife agency's website, more than 11,000 pythons have been removed by these contractors through 2023.\n\nLast year's challenge netted 209 pythons, with the grand prize winner being Paul Hobbs, who captured 20 pythons. In 2023, the Florida Wildlife Agency and county contractors will remove approximately 2,200 pythons.\n\nAmy Siewe, the self-proclaimed Python Huntress, won a prize last year for capturing a 10-foot, 9-inch (327-centimeter) Burmese python. She won't be competing in this year's challenge due to knee surgery, but she said she's not a fan of the annual challenge.\n\nSiewe, who used to work as a government contractor trapping invasive pythons, said she believes the original intent of the challenge was to raise awareness of the problem. Now it draws large groups of hunters, potentially scaring off pythons and potentially killing native snakes they mistake for pythons, such as corn snakes, brown water snakes or water moccasins.\n\n\"Pythons don't go into their normal behavior patterns because there's so much traffic and they come up and then go back into the swamp,\" Siewe said. \"I personally find it counterproductive.\"\n\nParticipants will be required to complete an online training course, including information on how to identify Burmese pythons from other snakes, Funck said. She said there is also an additional optional in-person training course that participants can attend to help them correctly identify Burmese pythons.\n\n\"That's a big part of what we're doing: trying to get the word out about how to identify these pythons and how to capture them safely and humanely,\" Funck said.", "source": {"uri": "nybreaking.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NY Breaking News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Everglades", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Everglades"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pythonidae", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pythonidae"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasive_species", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Invasive species"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burmese_python", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Burmese python"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida_Fish_and_Wildlife_Conservation_Commission", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Florida", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "South Florida"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Palm_Beach,_Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "West Palm Beach, Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "West Palm Beach, Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tamiami_Trail", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tamiami Trail"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Cypress_National_Preserve", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Big Cypress National Preserve"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunting", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hunting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glades_County,_Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Glades County, Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Glades County, Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broward_County,_Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Broward County, Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Broward County, Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Canada"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nerodia", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nerodia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agkistrodon_piscivorus", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Agkistrodon piscivorus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corn_snake", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Corn snake"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Florida_Water_Management_District", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "South Florida Water Management District"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swamp", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Swamp"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/County_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "County (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wildlife", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wildlife"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snake", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Snake"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Philanthropy/Cheer_and_Support", "label": "dmoz/Society/Philanthropy/Cheer and Support", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Theft", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Theft", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Pets/Free_Services", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Pets/Free Services", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Philanthropy/Free_Donations", "label": "dmoz/Society/Philanthropy/Free Donations", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Environment", "label": "news/Environment", "wgt": 95}], "image": "https://nybreaking.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Snake-hunters-will-wrangle-invasive-Burmese-pythons-in-Everglades-during.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9802746", "eventUri": "eng-9802746", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "West Palm Beach, Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1450980392156862, "wgt": 218, "relevance": 1}

Burmese pythons are one of Florida's most notorious invasive species, and the hunting challenge also helps curb the havoc that this species wreaks on the Everglades.\n\n\"They are a well-established invasive species across much of South Florida, unfortunately, in our natural areas,\" Sarah Funck, the wildlife impact management section leader with Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission, told The Associated Press (AP).\n\nFunck continued: \"A huge part of this challenge is to make sure that people understand about this issue and understand that in general, when you have a non-native species present in the state for whatever purpose, don't let it loose, that can be really detrimental to our environment.\"\n\nThe AP reported that this year's python challenge has over 600 registered participants coming from all over the United States and two coming from Canada. These participants will humanely kill as many pythons as possible in designated areas from western Broward County to the Tamiami Trail in the Big Cypress Wildlife Management Area, as well as other management areas such as Southern Glades, Holey Land and Rotenberger.\n\nWhat Are the Prizes?\n\nThere is a grand prize of $10,000 for the hunter who removes the most pythons in the competition, and there are also smaller prizes dished out in three categories -- professional, novice and military.\n\nThe professional category is made up of professional hunters who work for the state. The novice category covers anyone who is not working as a state hunter. There is also a separate military category for hunters who are active in the military or are veterans.\n\nEach category has three prizes -- one for the hunter who catches the most pythons ($2,500), one for the runner-up for the most kills ($1,500), and one for the hunter who catches the longest python ($1,000).\n\nHow Many Pythons Have Been Caught So Far?\n\nSince the South Florida Water Management District and the state began hiring contractors to curb the number of invasive pythons year round in 2017, over 11,000 pythons have been removed through 2023, according to the wildlife agency's website.\n\nA total of 209 pythons were removed in last year's Florida Python Challenge with grand prize winner Paul Hobbs bringing in 20 pythons.\n\nIs the Challenge 'Counterproductive?'\n\nAmy Siewe, who won a prize for catching a 10-foot by 9-inch Burmese python last year, voiced her concerns about the challenge. Siewe will not be participating in the challenge this year due to a knee surgery.\n\nShe said that the large crowds of hunters that the challenge brings in are potentially scaring off pythons and native snakes that are mistaken for pythons could possibly be killed.\n\n\"Pythons don't take on their normal behavioral pattern because there's so much traffic, and they'll come up and then they'll go back into the swamp,\" Siewe, who used to work as a state contractor catching invasive pythons, told the AP. \"I feel for myself, it's counterproductive.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Funck said participants must complete online training, which includes how to identify Burmese pythons. An additional in-person training is also provided, but optional.\n\n\"That's a huge part of what we do, is try to get the word out on how to identify these pythons, how to safely and humanely capture it,\" Funck told the AP.", "source": {"uri": "newsweek.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Newsweek"}, "authors": [{"uri": "rachel_dobkin@newsweek.com", "name": "Rachel Dobkin", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burmese_python", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Burmese python"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pythonidae", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pythonidae"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasive_species", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Invasive species"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunting", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hunting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Associated Press"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida_Fish_and_Wildlife_Conservation_Commission", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Everglades", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Everglades"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Florida", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "South Florida"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wildlife", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wildlife"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snake", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Snake"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tamiami_Trail", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tamiami Trail"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Cypress_National_Preserve", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Big Cypress National Preserve"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glades_County,_Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Glades County, Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Glades County, Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broward_County,_Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Broward County, Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Broward County, Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Canada"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Florida_Water_Management_District", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "South Florida Water Management District"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swamp", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Swamp"}, "location": null}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Pets/Reptiles_and_Amphibians", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Pets/Reptiles and Amphibians", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Writers_Resources/Contests", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Writers Resources/Contests", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Pets/Reptiles_and_Amphibians", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Pets/Reptiles and Amphibians", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Open_Source/Employment", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Open Source/Employment", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Math/Reference", "label": "dmoz/Science/Math/Reference", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "news/Environment", "label": "news/Environment", "wgt": 92}], "image": "https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2446859/python.webp?w=1600&h=900&q=88&f=65c4faac82c4ca420d7171d43ca7df86", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9802746", "eventUri": "eng-9802746", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2784313725490195, "wgt": 218, "relevance": 1}

(AP) -- Friday marked the start of the annual Florida Python Challenge, where hunters head into the Everglades to track down invasive Burmese pythons in hopes of grabbing a share of $30,000 in prizes.\n\nThe annual 10-day hunt, which started more than a decade ago, promotes public awareness of issues with invasive species in Florida while engaging the public in Everglades conversation, said Sarah Funck, the wildlife impact management section leader with Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission.\n\n\"They are a well-established invasive species across much of South Florida, unfortunately, in our natural areas,\" Funck said of Burmese pythons. \"A huge part of this challenge is to make sure that people understand about this issue and understand that in general, when you have a non-native species present in the state for whatever purpose, don't let it loose, that can be really detrimental to our environment.\"\n\nOver the past decade, the python challenge has grabbed headlines for it's incentive-based, only-in-Florida style of hunting as well as celebrity participation. This year, more than 600 people registered for the event, with two coming from Canada and 108 from other states.\n\nDuring the challenge, hunters will linger around designated areas spanning through western Broward County to the Tamiami Trail in the Big Cypress Wildlife Management Area, including other management areas like Southern Glades, Holey Land and Rotenberger.\n\nThe goal is to humanely kill as many pythons as possible, and prizes divide between three groups: professional hunters who work for the state, hunters who are active in the military or are veterans and novice hunters, which includes anyone who is not working as a state contracted python hunter.\n\nEach category has its own prizes, with $2,500 going to the person or team that kills the most pythons, $1,500 going to the runner-up for most kills and $1,000 going to whoever kills the longest python. The grand prize for the most kills in all categories gets a $10,000 prize.\n\nEach person can only win one prize, so if someone is tops in two categories, they will end up with the highest-valued prize and the next qualifying hunter gets the remaining prize.\n\nIn 2017, the South Florida Water Management District and the state began hiring contractors to handle its invasive python problem year round. According to the wildlife agency's website, through 2023, more than 11,000 pythons have been removed by these contractors.\n\nLast year's challenge brought in 209 pythons and the grand prize winner was Paul Hobbs, who bagged 20 pythons. Also during 2023, Florida wildlife agency and district contractors removed about 2,200 pythons.\n\nAmy Siewe, the self-named Python Huntress, won a prize last year for catching a Burmese python measuring 10 feet and 9 inches (327 centimeters). This year, she won't be participating in the challenge due to a knee surgery but said she's not a fan of the annual challenge.\n\nSiewe, who used to work as a state contractor catching invasive pythons, said she believed the initial intent of the challenge was to bring awareness to the issue. Now, it's drawing large crowds of hunters, potentially scaring off pythons and potentially killing native snakes they mistake as pythons, like corn snakes, brown water snakes or cottonmouths.\n\n\"Pythons don't take on their normal behavioral pattern because there's so much traffic and they'll come up and then they'll go back into the swamp,\" Siewe said. \"I feel for myself, it's counterproductive.\"\n\nParticipants are required to undergo an online training, including information on how to identify Burmese pythons versus other snakes, Funck said. She said there's also an additional optional in-person training participants can attend to properly identify Burmese pythons.\n\n\"That's a huge part of what we do, is try to get the word out on how to identify these pythons, how to safely and humanely capture it,\" Funck said.\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

They camp in tents, bring their RVs, all to catch one of these elusive slithering monsters.\"\n\nJones will act as a guide this year to hunters participating in the challenge. He has 17 people signed up, and they will hunt in multiple teams.\n\n\"They are coming here specifically to hunt pythons. That is the only reason they are here,\" Jones said. \"During the day, we'll do airboat rides and bass fishing. At nighttime, we hunt.\"\n\nWhen is the 2024 Python Challenge?\n\nThis year's Python Challenge begins at 12:01 am Friday and ends at 5 p.m. Sunday, Aug. 18.\n\nParticipants can hunt in designated areas that stretch from western Palm Beach County to the Tamiami Trail in the Big Cypress Wildlife Management Area. Other management areas included in the Python Challenge are Holey Land, Rotenberger and Southern Glades.\n\nWhat are the prizes for the 2024 Python Challenge?\n\nThe $10,000 grand prize is awarded to the participant who removes the most snakes as part of the competition. There are also three competition categories including professional, novice and military. Each category includes a $2,500 price for most pythons caught, $1,500 for the second-highest number of pythons caught and $1,000 for the longest python.\n\nParticipants may only win one prize, so if someone wins two, the person will be awarded the prize of the highest value and the next qualifying hunter will win the remaining prize.\n\nWhy hunt Burmese pythons?\n\nFlorida earnestly began hunting pythons in about 2012. It was the first year of the challenge and the same year a study in Everglades National Park suggested pythons were responsible for a decline of 85% to 100% of the population of medium-sized furry animals, such as raccoons and rabbits.\n\nThe Burmese python invasion started with releases -- intentional or not -- that allowed them to gain a foothold in the park by the mid-1980s, according to the 2021 Florida Python Control plan. By 2000, multiple generations of pythons were living in the park, which is noted in a more than 100-page 2023 report that summarized decades of python research.\n\nHow many pythons have been killed by hunters?\n\nIn 2017, the South Florida Water Management District started hiring python hunters. They are paid an hourly wage and can earn bonuses based on snake length. The Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission also began a paid hunter program. Both organizations now have 50 hunters each.\n\n'Main concern is not blacking out':Python hunter alone in Everglades suffers bloody bite, brings home behemoth\n\nMore than 14,500 pythons have been removed since the FWC and the district teamed up to combat this invasive species, according to a statement this week from the district. The most pythons removed in a single year was 2,629 in 2020.\n\nDuring the 2023 Python Challenge, 209 snakes were removed. The $10,000 winner that year killed 20 snakes.\n\nAre Burmese pythons migrating north?\n\nThere is some evidence to suggest that pythons may be able to survive as far north as Georgia if specific conditions are met. Warming temperatures because of climate change and snakes evolving to be more cold-tolerant could help them expand their territory north.\n\nAccording to a 2023 United States Geological Survey report, pythons that learn to burrow during cold snaps can also survive in colder temperatures.\n\nHow to register for the 2024 Python Challenge\n\nHunters interested in participating in the Python Challenge can register until the last day of the competition at flpythonchallenge.org. As of Tuesday, there were 622 people registered for this year's Python Challenge. That included 106 people from other states and two from Ontario, Canada.\n\nParticipants must take an online training course to learn how to identify pythons. It also has information on the humane way to kill a snake.\n\nFirearms are not allowed to be used during the event, but air guns and captive bolts can be used to humanely kill pythons.\n\nPython Challenge hype may be hokey but raises awareness\n\nWhile the hype around Florida's unique Burmese python hunts can take on a Disneyesque air -- in 2020, it was tied to the Super Bowl in Miami Gardens and included a python skin football -- it has raised awareness.\n\nRocker Ozzy Osbourne and celebrity chef Gordon Ramsey have been on python hunts. Politicians, including former Florida Lt. Gov. Carlos Lopez-Cantera, have also joined hunts.\n\nJones said hunters should temper their expectations on what they will find.\n\n\"Everyone thinks they are going to trip over a 15-foot-long snake out there,\" Jones said. \"The truth of the matter is they are exceedingly rare to see or capture.\"\n\nJones said he believes the annual Python Challenge and the paid hunters have reduced the population.\n\n\"There is a glimmer of hope,\" he said. \"As far as rodents and marsh rats and rabbits, we have not seen a resurgence, but there's been a small population gain the last two years.\"",

Cash prizes are awarded for the biggest haul. This year's challenge concludes at 5 p.m. on Aug. 18.\n\nThe News-Press and Naples Daily News have reported on this subject of norther migration by pythons in recent years. Here are some of the things we have learned and reported:\n\nMore: Python Q&A: How many pythons have been removed since the first Florida Python Challenge?\n\nWhat is the furthest north a python has been located?\n\nOn Nov. 9, 2012, a Burmese python was removed on the outskirts of the state, just outside of the Okefenokee National Wildlife Refuge.\n\nIn a story reported by our environment reporter Chad Gillis in June, a 2023 United States Geological Survey, or USGS, report shows that Burmese pythons are expanding their range so quickly that it can be marked in miles per year in some areas.\n\nJust six years ago the snakes were found as far north as south Fort Myers and Labelle, but in recent years they've been found across the Caloosahatchee River and in the Port Charlotte area and further north into the heart of Okeechobee. They're also in Cape Coral and on Pine Island now, according to the report.\n\nMore: Python purge: What you need to know about the Python Challenge in Florida\n\nIt's unknown just how far north and west the snakes will make it but, some reports have suggested they'll get well beyond Florida's state line.\n\nSeveral snakes in that range have been caught in recent years by amateur and professional hunters.\n\nHere is a portion of a Q&A trending reporter Samantha Neely produced in 2023:\n\nWhat is a python's typical range?\n\nBurmese pythons are currently considered established from just south of Lake Okeechobee to Key Largo and from western Broward County west to Collier County.\n\nPer the Florida Fish & Wildlife Conservation Commission, officials said they are currently trying to learn more about Burmese pythons removed from the Charlotte County area, as the source of these animals is not known and there is not enough evidence to support that these pythons are connected to the established population in south Florida.\n\nCould pythons tolerate the colder weather up north?\n\nColder weather does limit the range of the Burmese python.\n\nIn their native habitat of India, lower China, the Malay Peninsula, and some islands of the East Indies, they need to see a tropical and warm temperate climate. Burmese pythons experience temperatures of around 88 degrees in the sun, similar to the climate seen in South Florida.\n\nMore: Warmer temperatures, cold-tolerant adaptations means Burmese pythons may reach Georgia\n\nWhat is a python's habitat?\n\nThe large snakes typically live in rainforests near streams, although they have been known to survive in a variety of habitats, such as grasslands,

This year, more than 600 people registered for the event, with two coming from Canada and 108 from other states.\n\nDuring the challenge, hunters will linger around designated areas spanning through western Broward County to the Tamiami Trail in the Big Cypress Wildlife Management Area, including other management areas like Southern Glades, Holey Land and Rotenberger.\n\nThe goal is to humanely kill as many pythons as possible, and prizes divide between three groups: professional hunters who work for the state, hunters who are active in the military or are veterans and novice hunters, which includes anyone who is not working as a state contracted python hunter.\n\nEach category has its own prizes, with $2,500 going to the person or team that kills the most pythons, $1,500 going to the runner-up for most kills and $1,000 going to whoever kills the longest python. The grand prize for the most kills in all categories gets a $10,000 prize.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\nEach person can only win one prize, so if someone is tops in two categories, they will end up with the highest-valued prize and the next qualifying hunter gets the remaining prize.\n\nIn 2017, the South Florida Water Management District and the state began hiring contractors to handle its invasive python problem year round. According to the wildlife agency's website, through 2023, more than 11,000 pythons were removed by these contractors.\n\nLast year's challenge brought in 209 pythons and the grand prize winner was Paul Hobbs, who bagged 20 pythons. Also during 2023, Florida wildlife agency and district contractors removed about 2,200 pythons.\n\nAmy Siewe, the self-named Python Huntress, won a prize last year for catching a Burmese python measuring 10 feet and 9 inches. This year, she won't participate in the challenge due to a knee surgery but said she's not a fan of the annual challenge.\n\nSiewe, who used to work as a state contractor catching invasive pythons, said she believed the initial intent of the challenge was to bring awareness to the issue.

B-N Convention and Visitors Bureau CEO Crystal Howard to step down\n\nOver the past decade, the python challenge has grabbed headlines for its incentive-based, only-in-Florida style of hunting as well as celebrity participation. This year, more than 600 people registered for the event, with two coming from Canada and 108 from other states.\n\nDuring the challenge, hunters will linger around designated areas spanning through western Broward County to the Tamiami Trail in the Big Cypress Wildlife Management Area, including other management areas like Southern Glades, Holey Land and Rotenberger.\n\nThe goal is to humanely kill as many pythons as possible, and prizes divide between three groups: professional hunters who work for the state, hunters who are active in the military or are veterans and novice hunters, which includes anyone who is not working as a state contracted python hunter.\n\nEach category has its own prizes, with $2,500 going to the person or team that kills the most pythons, $1,500 going to the runner-up for most kills and $1,000 going to whoever kills the longest python. The grand prize for the most kills in all categories gets a $10,000 prize.\n\nEach person can only win one prize, so if someone is tops in two categories, they will end up with the highest-valued prize and the next qualifying hunter gets the remaining prize.\n\nIn 2017, the South Florida Water Management District and the state began hiring contractors to handle its invasive python problem year round. According to the wildlife agency's website, through 2023, more than 11,000 pythons were removed by these contractors.\n\nLast year's challenge brought in 209 pythons and the grand prize winner was Paul Hobbs, who bagged 20 pythons. Also during 2023, Florida wildlife agency and district contractors removed about 2,200 pythons.\n\nAmy Siewe, the self-named Python Huntress, won a prize last year for catching a Burmese python measuring 10 feet and 9 inches. This year, she won't participate in the challenge due to a knee surgery but said she's not a fan of the annual challenge.\n\nSiewe, who used to work as a state contractor catching invasive pythons, said she believed the initial intent of the challenge was to bring awareness to the issue. Now, it's drawing large crowds of hunters, potentially scaring off pythons and killing native snakes they mistake as pythons, like corn snakes, brown water snakes or cottonmouths.\n\n\"Pythons don't take on their normal behavioral pattern because there's so much traffic and they'll come up and then they'll go back into the swamp,\" Siewe said.\n\nParticipants are required to undergo an online training, including information on how to identify Burmese pythons versus other snakes, Funck said. She said there's also an additional optional in-person training participants can attend to properly identify Burmese pythons.\n\n\"That's a huge part of what we do, is try to get the word out on how to identify these pythons, how to safely and humanely capture it,\" Funck said.\n\nCoastal Areas That Saw the Largest Increase in Water Temps Coastal Areas That Saw the Largest Increase in Water Temps Changes in Global Sea Water Temperature Over Time Changes in Coastal Water Temperature by Location Atlantic Coast Metros That Saw the Biggest Increase in Water Temperature Gulf Coast Metros That Saw the Biggest Increase in Water Temperature Great Lakes Metros That Saw the Biggest Increase in Water Temperature Pacific Coast Metros That Saw the Biggest Increase in Water Temperature Methodology & Detailed Findings Love 0 Funny 0 Wow 0 Sad 0 Angry 0\n\nBe the first to know\n\nGet local news delivered to your inbox!\n\nSign up! * I understand and agree that registration on or use of this site constitutes agreement to its user agreement and privacy policy.", "source": {"uri": "pantagraph.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "pantagraph.com"}, "authors": [{"uri": "associated_press@pantagraph.com", "name": "Associated Press", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "orlando_sentinel@pantagraph.com", "name": "Orlando Sentinel", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "lynne_sladky@pantagraph.com", "name": "Lynne Sladky", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burmese_python", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Burmese python"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Everglades", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Everglades"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pythonidae", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pythonidae"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasive_species", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Invasive species"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illinois", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Illinois"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Illinois"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloomington,_Indiana", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bloomington, Indiana"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Bloomington, Indiana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interstate_55", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Interstate 55"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wildlife", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Wildlife"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._B._Pritzker", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "J.

This year, more than 600 people registered for the event, with two coming from Canada and 108 from other states.\n\nDuring the challenge, hunters will linger around designated areas spanning through western Broward County to the Tamiami Trail in the Big Cypress Wildlife Management Area, including other management areas like Southern Glades, Holey Land and Rotenberger.\n\nThe goal is to humanely kill as many pythons as possible, and prizes divide between three groups: professional hunters who work for the state, hunters who are active in the military or are veterans and novice hunters, which includes anyone who is not working as a state contracted python hunter.\n\nEach category has its own prizes, with $2,500 going to the person or team that kills the most pythons, $1,500 going to the runner-up for most kills and $1,000 going to whoever kills the longest python. The grand prize for the most kills in all categories gets a $10,000 prize.\n\nEach person can only win one prize, so if someone is tops in two categories, they will end up with the highest-valued prize and the next qualifying hunter gets the remaining prize.\n\nIn 2017, the South Florida Water Management District and the state began hiring contractors to handle its invasive python problem year round. According to the wildlife agency's website, through 2023, more than 11,000 pythons were removed by these contractors.\n\nLast year's challenge brought in 209 pythons and the grand prize winner was Paul Hobbs, who bagged 20 pythons.

Bickel, Chad Gillis and Samantha Neely, Fort Myers News-Press\n\nThe invasive Burmese python continues to plague the South Florida ecosystem, most notably in the Everglades. The snake established its presence there years ago with no one knowing exactly how many pythons are slithering around in the swamp land.\n\nAs the 2024 Florida Python Challenge begins on Friday at 12:01 a.m., one of many efforts underway to curtail the python population, a new question is being asked more frequently.\n\nWill more and more of these intimidating snakes start showing their faces further north in Florida?\n\nThe Florida Python Challenge encourages people once year to collectively go out and remove as many snakes as possible over a 10-day stretch. Cash prizes are awarded for the biggest haul. This year's challenge concludes at 5 p.m. on Aug. 18.\n\nThe News-Press and Naples Daily News have reported on this subject of norther migration by pythons in recent years. Here are some of the things we have learned and reported:\n\nMore: Python Q&A: How many pythons have been removed since the first Florida Python Challenge?\n\nOn Nov. 9, 2012, a Burmese python was removed on the outskirts of the state, just outside of the Okefenokee National Wildlife Refuge.\n\nIn a story reported by our environment reporter Chad Gillis in June, a 2023 United States Geological Survey, or USGS, report shows that Burmese pythons are expanding their range so quickly that it can be marked in miles per year in some areas.\n\nJust six years ago the snakes were found as far north as south Fort Myers and Labelle, but in recent years they've been found across the Caloosahatchee River and in the Port Charlotte area and further north into the heart of Okeechobee. They're also in Cape Coral and on Pine Island now, according to the report.\n\nMore: Python purge: What you need to know about the Python Challenge in Florida\n\nIt's unknown just how far north and west the snakes will make it but, some reports have suggested they'll get well beyond Florida's state line.\n\nSeveral snakes in that range have been caught in recent years by amateur and professional hunters.\n\nHere is a portion of a Q&A trending reporter Samantha Neely produced in 2023:\n\nBurmese pythons are currently considered established from just south of Lake Okeechobee to Key Largo and from western Broward County west to Collier County.\n\nPer the Florida Fish & Wildlife Conservation Commission, officials said they are currently trying to learn more about Burmese pythons removed from the Charlotte County area, as the source of these animals is not known and there is not enough evidence to support that these pythons are connected to the established population in south Florida.\n\nColder weather does limit the range of the Burmese python.\n\nIn their native habitat of India, lower China, the Malay Peninsula, and some islands of the East Indies, they need to see a tropical and warm temperate climate. Burmese pythons experience temperatures of around 88 degrees in the sun, similar to the climate seen in South Florida.\n\nMore: Warmer temperatures, cold-tolerant adaptations means Burmese pythons may reach Georgia\n\nThe large snakes typically live in rainforests near streams, although they have been known to survive in a variety of habitats, such as grasslands, swamps and rocky foothills.\n\nIn Florida, the FWC notes that Burmese pythons are semi-aquatic and are often found near or in water.", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts":

This year, more than 600 people registered for the event, with two coming from Canada and 108 from other states.\n\nDuring the challenge, hunters will linger around designated areas spanning through western Broward County to the Tamiami Trail in the Big Cypress Wildlife Management Area, including other management areas like Southern Glades, Holey Land and Rotenberger.\n\nThe goal is to humanely kill as many pythons as possible, and prizes divide between three groups: professional hunters who work for the state, hunters who are active in the military or are veterans and novice hunters, which includes anyone who is not working as a state contracted python hunter.\n\nEach category has its own prizes, with $2,500 going to the person or team that kills the most pythons, $1,500 going to the runner-up for most kills and $1,000 going to whoever kills the longest python. The grand prize for the most kills in all categories gets a $10,000 prize.\n\nEach person can only win one prize, so if someone is tops in two categories, they will end up with the highest-valued prize and the next qualifying hunter gets the remaining prize.\n\nIn 2017, the South Florida Water Management District and the state began hiring contractors to handle its invasive python problem year round. According to the wildlife agency's website, through 2023, more than 11,000 pythons were removed by these contractors.\n\nLast year's challenge brought in 209 pythons and the grand prize winner was Paul Hobbs, who bagged 20 pythons. Also during 2023, Florida wildlife agency and district contractors removed about 2,200 pythons.\n\nAmy Siewe, the self-named Python Huntress, won a prize last year for catching a Burmese python measuring 10 feet and 9 inches. This year, she won't participate in the challenge due to a knee surgery but said she's not a fan of the annual challenge.\n\nSiewe, who used to work as a state contractor catching invasive pythons, said she believed the initial intent of the challenge was to bring awareness to the issue. Now, it's drawing large crowds of hunters, potentially scaring off pythons and killing native snakes they mistake as pythons, like corn snakes, brown water snakes or cottonmouths.\n\n\"Pythons don't take on their normal behavioral pattern because there's so much traffic and they'll come up and then they'll go back into the swamp,\" Siewe said.\n\nParticipants are required to undergo an online training, including information on how to identify Burmese pythons versus other snakes, Funck said. She said there's also an additional optional in-person training participants can attend to properly identify Burmese pythons.\n\n\"That's a huge part of what we do, is try to get the word out on how to identify these pythons, how to safely and humanely capture it,\" Funck said.\n\nCoastal Areas That Saw the Largest Increase in Water Temps Coastal Areas That Saw the Largest Increase in Water Temps

This year's event kicked off at midnight Friday, with hundreds registered to compete for $25,000 in cash prizes by wrangling snakes. Professional and novice hunters have until 5 p.m. on Aug. 18 to get to work.\n\nBut why do Burmese pythons need to be removed from the state, and what makes them such a danger to our environment?\n\nHere's everything you need to know about the slithery invaders:\n\nAn easy way to tell Burmese pythons apart from other snakes is by their size alone, according to McKayla Spencer, the FWC's Nonnative Fish and Wildlife Program Coordinator.\n\nAdult pythons caught in Florida average between six and nine feet long, but Spencer says it's not uncommon to find pythons much longer than that.\n\n\"The largest any of the native snakes in the United States get are below 10 feet,\" said Spencer. \"And we are regularly pulling pythons out of the Everglades that are over 10 feet long.\"\n\nJust as recently as July, a Florida hunter caught the longest Burmese python the state has ever seen.\n\nAt 19 feet and 125 pounds, the female snake is said to be the longest of its species to have ever been recorded, according to the Conservancy of Southwest Florida.\n\nAnother way to identify a Burmese python is by its unique markings.\n\nBurmese pythons are tan in color with dark blotches along the back and sides. The FWC describes the blotches as resembling puzzle pieces or the markings on a giraffe.\n\nThese pythons also have a pyramid or diamond-shaped head with a blunt nose.\n\nThe top of the head is marked by a dark, arrowhead-shaped wedge extending toward the nose with a tan-colored line through the middle.\n\nIn South Florida, Burmese pythons are found primarily in and around the Everglades ecosystem, where the snake represents a major threat to native wildlife.\n\nNatively, however, these pythons are found in India, lower China, the Malay Peninsula and some islands of the East Indies.\n\nBecause Burmese pythons are semi-aquatic, they are also often found near or in water.\n\n\"They're moving across that landscape with ease,\" said Spencer. \"Whereas in humans, we're terrestrial, so it makes it a lot more difficult for us to get out to these locations where a lot of these pythons are breeding.\"\n\nBurmese pythons are what scientists call \"generalist predators,\" meaning that they feed on a wide variety of species.\n\n\"That means they're not picky,\" says Spencer. \"They're eating our native mammals and birds and reptiles, which are obviously causing vast negative impacts in our Everglades ecosystem.\"\n\nBy preying upon native species, invasive Burmese pythons are creating a \"trophic cascade\" in the Everglades.\n\nA trophic cascade is an ecological phenomenon triggered by the addition (or removal) of a top predator -- in this case, the Burmese python.\n\nIt refers to the changes in the populations of predator and prey through the food chain, which often results in dramatic changes in the ecosystem.\n\nWhile pythons sometimes eat non-native species such as Norway rats, they also consume common native species, as well as threatened or endangered native species.\n\nFor instance, pythons have been known to feast on the federally threatened wood stork and the federally endangered Key Largo wood rats.\n\nThey have even been known to eat alligators, which are also federally protected by the Endangered Species Act.\n\n\"We imagine based on other systems where we've seen something similar, that when you essentially hit one level of a trophic cascade as hard as the Burmese pythons have -- especially in regards to mammals -- there's likely other cascading effects happening,\" said Spencer.\n\nResearch is currently underway to determine the impacts pythons have on native mammal species, according to the FWC.\n\nBurmese pythons can also pose a threat to human safety and may prey upon pets such as cats and dogs.\n\nBecause of their large size, adult Burmese pythons have few predators, with humans being an exception.\n\nSpencer says that Burmese pythons have a higher mortality rate when they are young and small. They come out of the egg at approximately two feet long.\n\nBecause this is still within the size class of many native species of snakes, Spencer says there are some animals that will prey upon them when they're that young.\n\nHowever, there is no evidence of a predator that is regularly preying upon a full-grown Burmese python, which Spencer says \"isn't much of a surprise\" considering how big they are.\n\nPythons arrived in Florida through the captive animal trade, and they were introduced through the accidental and/or purposeful release of these captive animals.\n\n\"1979 is when we had our first actual python data point,\" said Spencer. \"And in the 1990s is when we really started to see an uptick. That's when I think people started to realize there was a problem.\"\n\nAt this point, most experts consider pythons to be established in Florida from the southern tip of Lake Okeechobee to the northern part of the Keys.\n\n\"Some of that is because these animals are so hard to detect,\" said Spencer. \"By the time we're detecting them, there's a high likelihood that there's more than the single individual we're detecting.\"\n\nLike many of Florida's native snake species, Burmese pythons are semi-aquatic.\n\nHowever, Burmese pythons being semi-aquatic is a problem because it makes them harder for humans to remove.\n\nWith South Florida being a mostly semi-aquatic ecosystem, pythons can move across the landscape much easier than humans, because humans are terrestrial.\n\nThat limits our ability to get out to the locations where a lot of pythons are breeding.\n\nAdditionally, one of their main defenses is to camouflage. When these snakes try to hide themselves, they become very difficult to detect.\n\n\"You will be standing next to what you know is a 14, 15-foot python and you can't see it,\" said Spencer.\n\nThere is an ethical and legal obligation to ensure nonnative reptiles, such as Burmese pythons, are killed in a humane manner.\n\nNonnative reptiles are not protected in Florida except by the anti-cruelty law, which applies to all living animals in the state.\n\n\"They are terrible for the environment,\" said Spencer. \"We have got to be removing them. But, there are safe ways to capture them and there are humane ways to kill them.\"\n\n\"At this point, we're removing over 2,000 to 4,000 pythons a year,\" said Spencer. \"There's not a lot of options on what to do when you're removing that many animals.\"\n\nBecause Burmese pythons are wild snakes, they behave like wild animals would. This makes them difficult -- and dangerous -- to remove.\n\n\"When you go to capture a wild animal, they're going to defend themselves,\" Spencer said. \"They're going to strike, they're going to try to get away from you, they constrict, they musk.\"\n\nThe FWC works with partners to manage Burmese pythons in a variety of ways. Once these pythons are found, the primary method of removal is humane killing.\n\nThe American Veterinary Medical Association (AVMA) recommends a two-step process to prevent suffering and destroy the brain completely for humane killing of reptiles.\n\nThe first step should result in the animal losing consciousness immediately.\n\nThe second step, which immediately follows the first, should destroy the animal's brain by doing something called \"pithing,\" which prevents the animal from regaining consciousness.\n\n\"It's a very serious issue, and it's something that we want people taking seriously so that they understand the gravity of: you need to do this correctly and this is why,\" said Spencer.", "source": {"uri": "nbcmiami.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NBC 6 South

This year, more than 600 people registered for the event, with two coming from Canada and 108 from other states.\n\nDuring the challenge, hunters will linger around designated areas spanning through western Broward County to the Tamiami Trail in the Big Cypress Wildlife Management Area, including other management areas like Southern Glades, Holey Land and Rotenberger.\n\nThe goal is to humanely kill as many pythons as possible, and prizes divide between three groups: professional hunters who work for the state, hunters who are active in the military or are veterans and novice hunters, which includes anyone who is not working as a state contracted python hunter.\n\nEach category has its own prizes, with $2,500 going to the person or team that kills the most pythons, $1,500 going to the runner-up for most kills and $1,000 going to whoever kills the longest python. The grand prize for the most kills in all categories gets a $10,000 prize.\n\nEach person can only win one prize, so if someone is tops in two categories, they will end up with the highest-valued prize and the next qualifying hunter gets the remaining prize.\n\nIn 2017, the South Florida Water Management District and the state began hiring contractors to handle its invasive python problem year round. According to the wildlife agency's website, through 2023, more than 11,000 pythons were removed by these contractors.\n\nLast year's challenge brought in 209 pythons and the grand prize winner was Paul Hobbs, who bagged 20 pythons.

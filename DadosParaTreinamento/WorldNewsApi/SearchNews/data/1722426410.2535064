Resuming the final day at Stormont facing an uphill battle to save the contest, on 148 for three in their second innings and still trailing by 93 runs, the Caribbean side were dismissed for 268 with the left-handed Auguste stretching his overnight 70 to 93 before being dismissed. Wicketkeeper/batsman Carlon Bowen-Tuckett, unbeaten on two at the start, made 41 as be combined with 20-year-old Auguste in a 71-run fourth wicket partnership. Set 28 to win, the hosts needed only 23 deliveries to overhaul their target and complete a sweep of the series. There was hope of extending the game deep into the day when Auguste picked up where he left off on Thursday\u2019s penultimate day. All told, he struck 14 fours in a knock lasting 154 balls in a shade over three-and-a-half hours while Bowen-Tuckett faced 73 balls in 96 minutes and punched half-dozen fours. Left-arm spinner Matthew Humphreys, who finished with five for 44, broke the stand when he bowled Bowen-Tuckett and then removed Auguste in the following over, as West Indies Academy lost their last seven wickets for 60 runs. Number nine Johann Layne chipped in with 23 to delay the inevitable.", "summary": "<a href=\"https://www.stabroeknews.com/2024/06/29/sports/wi-academy-suffer-clean-sweep-after-heavy-defeat/\" title=\"WI Academy suffer clean sweep after heavy defeat\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img width=\"945\" height=\"607\" src=\"https://s1.stabroeknews.com/images/2024/06/Tuckett.jpg\" class=\"webfeedsFeaturedVisual wp-post-image\" alt=\"\" style=\"display: block; margin: auto; margin-bottom: 15px;max-width: 100%;\" link_thumbnail=\"1\" decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://s1.stabroeknews.com/images/2024/06/Tuckett.jpg 945w, https://s1.stabroeknews.com/images/2024/06/Tuckett-750x482.jpg 750w, https://s1.stabroeknews.com/images/2024/06/Tuckett-768x493.jpg 768w, https://s1.stabroeknews.com/images/2024/06/Tuckett-150x96.jpg 150w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 945px) 100vw, 945px\" /></a><p>BELFAST, Ireland,&#xA0; CMC &#x2013; Ackeem Auguste missed out on a hundred as West Indies Academy crashed to a ten wicket loss to Emerging Ireland, to suffer a 2-0 whitewash in their four-day &#x201C;Test&#x201D; series here yesterday.</p>\n<p>The arti", "url": "https://www.stabroeknews.com/2024/06/29/sports/wi-academy-suffer-clean-sweep-after-heavy-defeat/", "image": "https://s1.stabroeknews.com/images/2024/06/Tuckett.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-29 06:01:07", "author": "Stabroek News", "authors": ["Stabroek News"], "language": "en", "source_country": "gy", "sentiment": -0.435}

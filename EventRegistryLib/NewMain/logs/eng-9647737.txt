Whitaker emphasized the need for increased in-person inspections and proactive oversight. Multiple investigations into Boeing are underway, and the FAA is reinforcing its regulatory approach to ensure compliance.\n\nThe head of the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) said Thursday the agency was \"too hands off\" in oversight of Boeing before a January mid-air emergency in a new Alaska Airlines 737 MAX 9, as it pursued multiple investigations into the planemaker. FAA Administrator Mike Whitaker's comments at a Senate Commerce Committee hearing mark the first time the U.S. aviation regulator has acknowledged inadequate oversight in the Jan. 5 incident, in which a door panel blew out during the flight.\n\n\"The FAA should have had much better visibility into what was happening at Boeing before Jan. 5,\" Whitaker said. He said the agency had permanently boosted the use of in-person inspectors and that he would visit a Boeing factory in South Carolina on Friday.\n\nThe FAA's approach before the mid-air incident \"was too hands off, too focused on paperwork audits and not focused enough on inspections,\" Whitaker added. \"We will utilize the full extent of our enforcement authority to ensure Boeing is held accountable for any noncompliance. We currently have multiple active investigations into Boeing and are processing a number of reports filed by whistle-blowers.\"\n\nAsked if the FAA shared responsibility or some blame for the Jan. 5 incident, Whitaker said: \"Boeing makes the airplane so Boeing is responsible, but we're also responsible for oversight, so we should have had a better handle on what was going on.\" Boeing did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nWhitaker in February barred Boeing from boosting production of its best-selling plane. He said last month he did not expect Boeing to win approval to increase production of the MAX \"in the next few months.\" Senator Ted Cruz, the top Republican on the Commerce Committee, said he remained concerned about the FAA's failed Boeing oversight.\n\n\"The FAA must guarantee that not only are they certifying an aircraft is safely designed but that the manufacturer is building them to that safe design. Clearly, that was not happening at Boeing.\" Whitaker also said the agency will continue increased on-site presence at Boeing and its supplier Spirit AeroSystems for the foreseeable future.\n\nHe added there must be a fundamental shift in Boeing's safety culture and \"has been a shift in tone\" on quality. \"We have been too much in reactive mode, waiting for some event to occur and analyzing the event to find out what to do differently,\" Whitaker said. \"So we're shifting to a much more proactive approach. On the manufacturing side, it's introducing inspectors and coming up with clear indices to monitor performance.\"\n\nOn May 30, Boeing delivered a comprehensive quality improvement plan to the FAA after Whitaker in late February gave Boeing 90 days to develop a comprehensive plan to address \"systemic quality-control issues.\" Outgoing Boeing CEO Dave Calhoun will testify on Tuesday before another Senate committee. Senate Commerce Committee chair Maria Cantwell said she could also call Calhoun to appear at a future hearing.\n\nThe National Transportation Safety Board said earlier the door panel that flew off a Boeing 737 MAX 9 jet mid-flight was missing four key bolts and no paperwork exists for the removal of those bolts. Whitaker confirmed no paperwork exists. The Justice Department has opened a criminal probe into the MAX 9 incident.\n\n(This story has not been edited by Devdiscourse staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)", "source": {"uri": "devdiscourse.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Devdiscourse"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alaska_Airlines", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Alaska Airlines"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boeing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Aviation_Administration", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Federal Aviation Administration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_737_MAX", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Boeing 737 MAX"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate_Committee_on_Commerce,_Science,_and_Transportation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aviation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Aviation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_Everett_Factory", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Boeing Everett Factory"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whistleblower", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Whistleblower"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ted_Cruz", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ted Cruz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airplane", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Airplane"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Carolina", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "South Carolina"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "South Carolina"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dave_Calhoun", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dave Calhoun"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maria_Cantwell", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Maria Cantwell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spirit_AeroSystems", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Spirit AeroSystems"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jet_aircraft", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jet aircraft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Justice", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of Justice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Transportation_Safety_Board", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "National Transportation Safety Board"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Transportation", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Transportation", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Aerospace", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Aerospace", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Military/Aviation", "label": "dmoz/Society/Military/Aviation", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Aviation/Regulations", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Aviation/Regulations", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Telecommunications/Regulation", "label": "dmoz/Business/Telecommunications/Regulation", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 63}], "image": "https://www.devdiscourse.com/remote.axd?https://devdiscourse.blob.core.windows.net/aiimagegallery/13_06_2024_17_17_53_7597725.png?width=920&format=jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9647737", "eventUri": "eng-9647737", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-01-05", "textStart": 813, "textEnd": 819, "freq": 3}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-30", "textStart": 2972, "textEnd": 2978}], "sentiment": 0.1764705882352942, "wgt": 235, "relevance": 1}

He said it will continue to push Boeing to improve its safety culture in the wake of the January 5 incident in which a door plug blew off during an Alaksa Airlines flight, leaving a gaping hole in the side of the Boeing 737 Max.\n\nBut he also said that the FAA was not blameless in that incident.\n\n\"Let me also acknowledge the FAA should have had much better visibility into what was happening at Boeing before January 5,\" he said in his opening remarks to the committee.\n\n\"The FAA's approach was too hands off, too focused on paperwork audits and not focused enough on inspections. We have changed that approach over the last several months. And those changes are permanent,\" he said. \"We have now moved to a more active, comprehensive oversight model - the audit plus inspection approach.\"\n\nWhitaker, who was confirmed to his job heading the nation's primary aviation regulator in October, said he will be visiting Boeing's South Carolina factory himself tomorrow, and its plant that makes the 737 Max in Renton, Washington in September.\n\nWhitaker said that the FAA previously had 24 inspectors at Boeing and Spirit and that the number was in the low 30s now. Its target is 55 inspectors, although he did not give a date for when that would be in place. And he said that number could change over time.\n\n\"We can no longer afford to remain reactive,\" he said.\n\nA preliminary report by the National Transportation Safety Board has found that bolts necessary to keep the door plug on the Alaska Air plane in place were missing from the plane at the time it left the Boeing factory in Washington roughly two months before the flight. Under questions at Thursday's hearing, Whitaker said the FAA did not have any inspectors in the factories at that time when the piece was put in.\n\nInstead the FAA staff was focused on paperwork audits instead of actual inspections.\n\n\"We clearly did not have enough folks to see what was going on in that factory,\" he said.\n\nBut Whitaker said that Boeing needs to make changes as well to improve the safety of its planes.\n\n\"There must be a fundamental shift in the company's safety culture in order to holistically address its quality and safety challenges,\" he said. \"This is about systemic change and there's a lot of work to be done.\"\n\nHe said there has been a shift in tone in discussions between the FAA and Boeing executives since the January incident.\n\n\"My focus has been on making it clear this is a very long-term journey. You don't change the culture of an organization. We've seen an increasing recognition that this is a long journey ahead.\"\n\n- This is a developing story.

He said it will continue to push Boeing to improve its safety culture in the wake of the January 5 incident in which a door plug blew off during an Alaksa Airlines flight, leaving a gaping hole in the side of the Boeing 737 Max.\n\nBut he also said that the FAA was not blameless in that incident.\n\n\"Let me also acknowledge the FAA should have had much better visibility into what was happening at Boeing before January 5,\" he said in his opening remarks to the committee.\n\n\"The FAA's approach was too hands off, too focused on paperwork audits and not focused enough on inspections. We have changed that approach over the last several months. And those changes are permanent,\" he said. \"We have now moved to a more active, comprehensive oversight model - the audit plus inspection approach.\"\n\nWhitaker, who was confirmed to his job heading the nation's primary aviation regulator in October, said he will be visiting Boeing's South Carolina factory himself tomorrow, and its plant that makes the 737 Max in Renton, Washington in September.\n\nWhitaker said that the FAA previously had 24 inspectors at Boeing and Spirit and that the number was in the low 30s now. Its target is 55 inspectors, although he did not give a date for when that would be in place. And he said that number could change over time.\n\n\"We can no longer afford to remain reactive,\" he said.\n\nA preliminary report by the National Transportation Safety Board has found that bolts necessary to keep the door plug on the Alaska Air plane in place were missing from the plane at the time it left the Boeing factory in Washington roughly two months before the flight. Under questions at Thursday's hearing, Whitaker said the FAA did not have any inspectors in the factories at that time when the piece was put in.\n\nInstead the FAA staff was focused on paperwork audits instead of actual inspections.\n\n\"We clearly did not have enough folks to see what was going on in that factory,\" he said.\n\nBut Whitaker said that Boeing needs to make changes as well to improve the safety of its planes.\n\n\"There must be a fundamental shift in the company's safety culture in order to holistically address its quality and safety challenges,\" he said. \"This is about systemic change and there's a lot of work to be done.\"\n\nHe said there has been a shift in tone in discussions between the FAA and Boeing executives since the January incident.\n\n\"My focus has been on making it clear this is a very long-term journey. You don't change the culture of an organization. We've seen an increasing recognition that this is a long journey ahead.\"\n\n- This is a developing story.

The agency has increased on-site inspectors and will implement other oversight practices. FAA transitions to a proactive approach, aiming to improve data analysis and bring systemic change to Boeing. SIMPLEFLYING VIDEO OF THE DAY SCROLL TO CONTINUE WITH CONTENT\n\nThe Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) will continue its oversight of Boeing after admitting it had been too lax on the manufacturer. The agency has boosted its on-site presence at Boeing and supplier Spirit AeroSystems facilities and will maintain this enhanced oversight \"for the foreseeable future\".\n\nFAA chief lays out Boeing oversight plans\n\nFAA Administrator Mike Whitaker said in a Senate Commerce Committee hearing on Thursday that the agency had been \"too hands off\" with the planemaker prior to the highly-publicized Alaska Airlines plug door blowout incident in January. Until this point, much of its oversight had been \"too focused on paperwork audits\" rather than inspections.\n\nPhoto: Boeing\n\nStressing the need for a \"fundamental shift\" in Boeing's safety culture, Whitaker said that FAA inspectors will continue to maintain an increased presence on the factory floor, along with other enhanced oversight activities, including:\n\nOverseeing more critical points of the planemaker's manufacturing process Direct engagement of company employees Ongoing audits of quality and build Boeing plan only the beginning\n\nAfter it was ordered to come up with a comprehensive quality improvement plan within 90 days, Boeing delivered its plan of action to the FAA on May 30th. According to Whitaker,\n\n\"This plan does not mark the end of the FAA's increased oversight of Boeing and its suppliers. In fact, it's the beginning of a long journey.\"\n\nPhoto: Jeremy Elson l Wikimedia Commons\n\nThe FAA head confirmed that the agency was dealing with several active investigations into Boeing while also \"processing a number of reports filed by whistleblowers and through our safety hotline.\" The ultimate goal is to bring about long-term \"systemic change\" at Boeing, a key part of which will be utilizing data effectively. The agency is already taking steps to improve its data analysis and will establish a better system for employee reporting.\n\nReactive to proactive oversight\n\nAfter admitting the agency had been too reactive and hands-off in its oversight of Boeing's process, Whitaker said it will now adopt a more proactive approach to ensuring the planemaker's standards are up to scratch.\n\nPhoto: VDB Photos | Shutterstock\n\nWhitaker said,\n\n\"We have now moved to a more active, comprehensive oversight model, the 'audit-plus' inspection approach, which allows the FAA to have much better insight into Boeing's operations.\"\n\nWhitaker confirmed that the comprehensive oversight plan will apply to Boeing's entire commercial range, adding that he would visit Boeing's facility in Charleston tomorrow. Since capping Boeing's production of the 737 MAX 9 to 38 planes per month (it is currently producing around 32 each month), the FAA will not permit an increase in production for at least the next few months.\n\nRelated Head Of FAA Says Boeing Is Not Clear To Increase Production Of The 737 Max Boeing leaders met FAA officials on May 30 to present their quality improvement plan.\n\nSpeaking at a joint FAA and European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) Safety Conference earlier this week, Whitaker said that the lessons learned from cooperating with European counterparts EASA would be extended to its Boeing audit.

He said the FAA has lost valuable experience in the ranks of its inspectors with its current, younger workforce.

Maria Cantwell (D-Wash.) cited news reports suggesting that there were dozens of instances at Boeing and its fuselage contractor Spirit AeroSystems where procedures and products didn't meet FAA standards. But Cantwell also dinged the FAA on its overreliance on audits -- and what she suggested has been a tendency not to take steps to change things even when those audits revealed problems.\n\n\"In 2022 and 2023, as part of individualized FAA conducted audits of Boeing and Spirit AeroSystems, production lines required Boeing to correct any identified problems,\" Cantwell said. Spirit Aero has also been in the spotlight for shoddy work resulting in planes with deficiencies being transferred to Boeing's Renton production facility.\n\n\"Yet, your new special audit still found problems. It begs the question about the audit process itself at the FAA,\" she said.\n\nA substantial portion of the law Congress enacted shortly after the 2018 and 2019 MAX crashes focused on ensuring that the FAA doesn't delegate too much authority to certify airplanes to manufacturers like Boeing. But on Thursday Cantwell said for Boeing to rectify its issues, \"we need both\" certification and production oversight moving forward.\n\nSpeaking to suggestions that FAA has had too light a touch, Whitaker said Boeing's problems are likely the result of a \"long evolution\" exacerbated by workforce challenges wrought from the pandemic, where too few eyes were reinforcing the need for workmanship and quality.\n\nBut he couldn't speak to exact root causes: He noted he wasn't FAA chief until last fall.\n\nThe agency rotated through a couple of acting administrators for 18 months until he was confirmed; but his predecessor, former Delta Air Lines executive Steve Dickson, also had to manage the fallout from Boeing's last crisis in which two MAX crashes claimed the lives of 346 onboard foreign carriers.\n\nSince the Alaska incident, the FAA has a little over two dozen inspectors surveying Boeing's work, while simultaneously grading how Boeing implements its action plan -- a requirement FAA set for Boeing that covers a range of improvements to internal audits, employee training, quality control and manufacturing processes at the company.\n\nWith inspectors anticipated on Boeing's plant floors for the foreseeable future, Cantwell also said she expects Whitaker to assess whether the agency will need more boots on the ground down the line. Whitaker said the FAA's estimated target is to have 55 inspectors at some point.\n\n\"We have now moved to a more active model plus the audit inspection approach which allows the FAA to have better insight into the operations,\" Whitaker said. \"I will personally remain engaged to make sure that they execute the necessary changes to transform the safety culture and address production quality issues.\"", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maria_Cantwell", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Maria Cantwell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boeing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Aviation_Administration", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Federal Aviation Administration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audit", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Audit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate_Committee_on_Commerce,_Science,_and_Transportation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spirit_AeroSystems", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Spirit AeroSystems"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alaska_Airlines", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Alaska Airlines"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_737_MAX", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Boeing 737 MAX"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indonesia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Indonesia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Indonesia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fuselage", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fuselage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airplane", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Airplane"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renton,_Washington", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Renton, Washington"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Renton, Washington"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethiopia", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ethiopia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ethiopia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_certificate", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Type certificate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surveying", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Surveying"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delta_Air_Lines", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Delta Air Lines"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alaska", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Alaska"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Alaska"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Military/Aviation", "label": "dmoz/Society/Military/Aviation", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Aviation/Regulations", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Aviation/Regulations", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Real_Estate/Inspection", "label": "dmoz/Business/Real Estate/Inspection", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Telecommunications/Cost_Management", "label": "dmoz/Business/Telecommunications/Cost Management", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Accounting/Business-to-Business", "label": "dmoz/Business/Accounting/Business-to-Business", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 75}], "image": "https://s.yimg.com/cv/apiv2/social/images/yahoo_default_logo-1200x1200.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9647737", "eventUri": "eng-9647737", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2705882352941176, "wgt": 209, "relevance": 1}

And those changes are permanent,\" he said. \"We have now moved to a more active, comprehensive oversight model - the audit plus inspection approach.\"\n\nWhitaker, who was confirmed to his job heading the nation's primary aviation regulator in October, said he will be visiting Boeing's South Carolina factory himself tomorrow, and its plant that makes the 737 Max in Renton, Washington in September.\n\nWhitaker said that the FAA previously had 24 inspectors at Boeing and Spirit and that the number was in the low 30s now. Its target is 55 inspectors, although he did not give a date for when that would be in place. And he said that number could change over time.\n\n\"We can no longer afford to remain reactive,\" he said.\n\nBut Whitaker said that Boeing needs to make changes as well to improve the safety of its planes.\n\n\"There must be a fundamental shift in the company's safety culture in order to holistically address its quality and safety challenges,\" he said. \"This is about systemic change and there's a lot of work to be done.\"\n\nHe said there has been a shift in tone in discussions between the FAA and Boeing executives since the January incident.\n\n\"My focus has been on making it clear this is a very long-term journey.

This includes stationing more inspectors in factories of both Boeing and its primary supplier, Spirit AeroSystems.\n\nWhitaker's comments come as the FAA, the Justice Department, and the National Transportation Safety Board continue to investigate the aerospace giant. The FAA has capped Boeing's monthly production of 737 Max jets at 38, although the company is producing far fewer while addressing quality-control issues.\n\nInvestigators revealed that the door plug that blew out of the Alaska jet lacked four essential bolts, which were missing due to lapses at a Boeing factory. The company had no records of the personnel who performed the task or the omission of the bolts.\n\n\"If Boeing claims, 'We don't have the documentation, we don't know who removed it,' then where was the FAA safety inspector?\" Senator Maria Cantwell, D-Wash., questioned Whitaker.\n\n\"At that moment, inspectors were not stationed there,\" Whitaker replied.\n\n\"And why, not?\" Cantwell pressed further.\n\n\"Because the agency was then focusing on auditing Boeing's internal quality programs,\" Whitaker explained. \"Clearly, we lacked sufficient ground presence to monitor factory activities.\" Whitaker added that the FAA is recruiting more air traffic controllers and safety inspectors, though it faces competition for talent from the aerospace industry.

So I'm very concerned that your oversight is not strong enough.\"\n\nWhile Boeing is under scrutiny for the door plug incident involving one of its 737 Max aircraft, it is seeking to acquire Spirit, a supplier that was previously spun off from the company.\n\nAlthough many senators have lauded Whitaker's response to the January door plug incident, some whistleblowers claim that the FAA hasn't done enough to address the company's issues since crashes involving 737 Max aircraft in 2018 and 2019 that killed 346 people.\n\nCantwell said that in 2022 and 2023, the FAA completed 298 individualized audits on Boeing and Spirit Aerosystems that found various problems that Boeing was required to correct. But she said she is concerned that the most recent audit still found similar problems.\n\n\"So the question about the audit process itself at the FAA becomes ... what do we need to fix in our audit process?\" Cantwell said. \"Can we really have a new day in creating a safety culture that is so critical for the United States to be the leaders in manufacturing?\"\n\nWhitaker told senators that FAA oversight of Boeing will improve, citing specific problems documented at the company.\n\nOne was an audit following the January incident, which found the company \"allegedly failed to comply with manufacturing quality control requirements,\" and another was a report from an independent panel commissioned by the FAA that found a disconnected safety culture at Boeing and a safety management system that \"causes confusion\" among employees at different levels.\n\nThe FAA also required Boeing to complete a comprehensive action plan to address issues, which the company submitted on May 30. Whitaker said that the plan \"does not mark the end\" of FAA's oversight of Boeing and its suppliers.\n\n\"In fact, it's the beginning of a long journey,\" he said. \"There must be a fundamental shift in the company's safety culture in order to holistically address its quality and safety challenges. This is about systemic change, and there's a lot of work to be done.\"\n\nWhitaker noted the FAA has capped production of new 737 Max airplanes, added safety inspectors on the ground at Boeing facilities and has launched multiple active investigations following reports by whistleblowers.\n\n\"We have been too much in reactive mode, waiting for an event to occur and analyzing the events to find out what to do differently,\" he said. \"We're shifting to a much more proactive approach.\"\n\nClay Foushee, a former director of the FAA's Office of Audit and Evaluation who has been critical of its past oversight of Boeing, said in an email Thursday that more on-the-ground inspectors is a \"great start.\" FAA had some inspectors prior to January, but they were \"not for in-depth checks,\" Foushee said.\n\nWhitaker said during the hearing that the FAA now has three dozen inspectors at the company's facilities. Foushee said that is \"exponentially more\" than standard.\n\nDespite the assurances, senators said sharp scrutiny of the FAA will remain in place.\n\nCantwell focused much of her questioning on the FAA's safety management system, which she noted is voluntary, and raised concerns about qualification standards for FAA's aviation safety inspectors. She said she has heard reports that there aren't enough trained personnel, and not enough of the experienced inspectors are able to train new ones.\n\nCantwell and Sen. Edward J. Markey, D-Mass., also pressed Whitaker on implementing a strong employee reporting system. Sen. Jacky Rosen, D-Nev., added she was worried about reports that Boeing retaliates against employees who report safety issues, which Whitaker said FAA is working to address.\n\nCantwell said after the hearing that Whitaker seems to be committing to a better system for employees to report issues.\n\n\"But we have to see the oversight of how he implements that,\" she said. \"Because when you think about 'How did we get into the situation,' the FAA wasn't playing as aggressively an oversight role ... The inspectors are part of that too, because they'll be a key part of making sure that that system works that way.\"\n\nCantwell said she intends to have Boeing CEO Dave Calhoun testify before the committee soon.

That incident, which rocked the airline industry, involved a door plug blowing out of an Alaska 737 Max 9 during a flight. An ensuing investigation revealed that Boeing workers removed the Alaska jet's door plug during the assembly process to allow workers for fuselage supplier Spirit AeroSystems to address a riveting issue. Boeing employees replaced the plug but apparently failed to bolt it back in place.\n\nSince the beginning of January, the US aircraft manufacturer has significantly slowed production as it grapples with outstanding quality and safety problems, with 737 production capped by the FAA at 38 aircraft monthly - but Boeing's actually production being much slower.\n\nBoeing recently presented the FAA with a \"roadmap for continuous improvement\" detailing how it plans to remedy its ailing production lines.\n\nThe plan addresses findings from the FAA's audits and recommendations from an FAA-convened review panel, in addition to feedback from Boeing employees, and covers increased workforce training, simplifying production processes, eliminating defects and shoring up the safety culture.\n\n\"Many of these actions are underway, and our team is committed to executing on each element of the plan,\" Dave Calhoun, Boeing's CEO, said in late May. \"It is through this continuous learning and improvement process that our industry has made commercial aviation the safest mode of transportation. The actions we are taking today will further strengthen that foundation.\"\n\nMaria Cantwell, a senator from Washington who chairs the committee, pressed Whitaker during the 13 June hearing, asking if Boeing's safety culture is shifting in a positive direction.\n\n\"The question is, what can you do to change this culture? You were overwhelmingly confirmed to be the agent in charge of the FAA. You had an overwhelming vote in the United States Senate. So, we're counting on you to be that agent of change. We know that this begins with taking a hard look a the agency itself.\"\n\nWhitaker, confirmed by Congress in October 2023, acknowledges FAA shortcomings.\n\n\"We have now moved to a more-active, comprehensive oversight model - the audit-plus-inspection approach - which allows the FAA to have much better insight into Boeing's operations,\" he says. \"I will personally remain engaged to ensure that Boeing executes the necessary changes to transform its culture and address its production quality issues.\"\n\nCantwell points to the FAA-convened panel's review, which found a \"disconnect\" between senior leadership and factory workers, as an area of specific concern.\n\n\"The safety management systems have to have a culture where employees are free to speak up, identify risks and have those risks taken seriously,\" Whitaker responds. \"It allows you to find risks that might not be obvious, and one way you get that is by hearing from your employees who are on the front lines.\"\n\nSenator Ted Cruz of Texas focused on the lack of documentation regarding the 737 Max 9 that operated as Alaska flight 1282 on 5 January. An investigation by the National Transportation Safety Board revealed earlier this year that no paperwork related to the door plug exists, and security camera footage was apparently overwritten.\n\n\"Boeing doesn't know who performed work on the door plug and no paperwork exists - is that right?\" he asks.\n\n\"That is my understanding,\" Whitaker responds.\n\n\"That seems remarkable and shocking,\" Cruz says. \"Is there concern at the FAA that an employee at Boeing is hiding key information about this?\"\n\nBoth the FAA and the US Department of Justice are investigating the matter, Whitaker responds, adding that it is \"too early to have an opinion on that\".\n\nPledging to personally meet with Boeing's senior leadership on at least a quarterly basis, Whitaker says there is no timeline for lifting the production cap on Boeing's 737 programme, as the FAA's discussions with the company remain focused on safety metrics.", "source": {"uri":

Read FAA Administrator Michael Whitaker's testimony and watch the hearing here.\n\nChair Senator Cantwell's Opening Statement As Delivered:\n\nWe are having the hearing this morning with FAA Administrator Michael Whitaker to discuss the FAA's oversight of aviation manufacturing, including the FAA's plans to ensure that Boeing follows through on the commitments made in its 90-day action plan.\n\nWhat this Committee and the flying public want to know is, what is the FAA doing to strengthen its oversight of the planes that we fly on every day and to make sure that they are safely built.\n\nWe need to know what change under your watch, Administrator Whitaker, will restore the proper oversight to manufacturing to achieve the excellence that we want to see at Boeing and other manufacturers, and ensure the FAA is setting the gold standard for safety oversight.\n\nA week after the door plug incident, I sent the FAA a letter reiterating my request from a previous FAA Administrator a year before for the FAA to conduct a special audit to determine if Boeing was in compliance with FAA safety requirements for aircraft production.\n\nThe next day, Mr. Whitaker, you did start a process. The FAA conducted 100 plus audits in January and February of things like employee training, quality control procedures, and records retention both at Boeing and its suppliers. [This] is what we are here to discuss.\n\nI have to say, Mr. Whitaker, the results found major safety concerns and are very concerning to me and I think to the flying public.\n\nYou've identified, according to news reports, 97 instances at Boeing and 21 instances at Spirit of where the procedures and products didn't meet FAA standards. We will get into this in the Q&A. Also, in part of the information, is that the engineers themselves had trouble responding to most basic questions about quality control policies and quality management systems.\n\nWe find these challenges frustrating. We need to have an FAA who is going to implement the very recommendations we heard from the ODA Expert Review Panel, who testified before this Committee in April.\n\nThe panel's report observed a disconnect between senior leadership and frontline employees on building a safety culture and found that the overall system didn't demonstrate a foundational commitment to safety.\n\nTo your credit, Administrator Whitaker, you told Boeing that they needed to give you a plan to reform its production quality and you gave them 90 days to do so.\n\nBoeing has now delivered that plan to you. We want to ask questions and get comments from you on where we are.\n\nI am struck by a sense of, is this deja vu? Are we just back here? Or, can we really have a new day in creating a safety culture that is so critical for the United States to be the leaders in manufacturing?\n\nIn 2022 and 2023, as part of individualized FAA conducted audits of Boeing and Spirit AeroSystems, production lines required Boeing to correct any identified problems.\n\nYet, your new special audit still found problems.\n\nIt begs the question about the audit process itself at the FAA. I know that is a past Administrator, but still, what do we need to fix in our audit process if in 2022 and 2023 we already did 298 individualized audits?\n\nWhen I sent the letter to the previous Acting Administrator, he said, \"We don't need to do an audit because we have specialized audits.\"\n\nAnd yet, we did this audit and found out that the specialized audits didn't help us correct the problems that we see today.\n\nThe FAA settled an agreement requiring Boeing to adopt a safety management system, yet they are still not quite there on that commitment.\n\nThis same settlement agreement required Boeing to create a regulatory compliance plan to correct all safety failings, and yet we know that we have this plug door incident.\n\nThe question is, what can you do to change this culture?\n\nYou were overwhelmingly confirmed to be the agent in charge of the FAA in the system. We know that you had an overwhelming vote in the United States Senate, so we are counting on you to be that agent of change. We know that this begins by taking a hard look at the agency itself.\n\nIn January of 2024, the former NTSB Chairman wrote in an op-ed to The Seattle Times, titled \"The FAA's Safety Culture Hasn't Changed, Either.\" He wrote, \"While both Boeing and the FAA issued words of assurances that they would use investigations to find and correct flaws and the assurances of the industry, past pronouncements we heard about changing their safety culture appear to have been lip service.\"\n\nAdministrator Whitaker, we must prove Mr. Hall wrong.

Cruz: FAA Must Guarantee Boeing Aircraft Safely Designed and Built", "body": "WASHINGTON, D.C. - In his opening statement at today's Senate Commerce Committee hearing titled \"FAA Oversight of Aviation Manufacturing,\" Ranking Member Ted Cruz (R-Texas) highlighted how the recently passed FAA Reauthorization Act directs the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) to conduct risk-based inspections of aircraft manufacturers in the aftermath of concerning accidents with Boeing aircraft, like the decompression of Alaska Airlines flight 1282. Sen. Cruz also discussed how FAA Administrator Michael Whitaker will ensure their oversight of Boeing production is sufficient to prevent future incidents and assess Boeing's plan in response to FAA's audit. Lastly, Sen. Cruz reiterated his calls for Boeing CEO Dave Calhoun to testify before the Commerce Committee, the committee of jurisdiction for civil aviation and oversight.\n\nHere are Sen. Cruz's remarks prepared for delivery:\n\n\"Thank you, Chairwoman. I appreciate you holding today's hearing on this critically important topic: FAA's oversight of aviation manufacturers.\n\n\"I'd like to thank Administrator Whitaker for appearing before us today, especially as his agency is busy implementing the bipartisan, bicameral FAA Reauthorization Act that we authored and passed last month. Our crucial bipartisan legislation gives the FAA much-needed long-term stability and allows it to refocus on its primary mission: the safety of our national aviation system. It directs the FAA to conduct risk-based inspections of manufacturers, like Boeing, to ensure there is no repeat of the Alaska Airlines incident. Further, it provides FAA with important tools for developing a workforce with the technical know-how necessary to overseeing complex aircraft manufacturers, and it includes key protections for whistleblowers who play an important role in the aviation system, so that employees can speak out freely when raising safety concerns.\n\n\"On January 5th of this year, minutes into its trip, Alaska Airlines flight 1282 experienced a rapid cabin decompression at 16,000 feet when a plug door flew off the plane. Thankfully, the pilots landed the plane safely with no critical injuries. We are fortunate no passengers were seated near the plug door, and the plane was still climbing to its cruising altitude. Had either of these factors been different, the results would have been catastrophic.\n\n\"The aircraft in question was a Boeing 737 MAX 9, delivered to Alaska Airlines just a few months prior. For many of us it raised concerns once again of the safety of Boeing aircraft. In the weeks that followed, the NTSB accident investigation and the FAA's audit discovered unsettling details about Boeing's production lines.\n\n\"Reports from airlines of untightened bolts or overtightened bolts on Boeing 737 MAX aircraft have born the phrase from passengers of 'if it's a Boeing, I ain't going.' Even more alarming, NTSB stated the reason the plug door flew off the aircraft was because an employee at the Boeing facility opened the plug door and forgot to put the bolts back in. Such a fundamental lapse in the production line is inexcusable and should never have happened.\n\n\"I was glad to see the FAA took swift action to ground the 737 MAX after the accident. However, I remain concerned that FAA's oversight of Boeing failed to spot serious production gaps. The FAA, through their oversight of manufacturers, is responsible for ensuring that when a passenger gets on a plane, they can have the utmost confidence in that plane's safety. The FAA must guarantee that not only are they certifying an aircraft is safely designed but that the manufacturer is building them to that safe design. Clearly, that was not happening at Boeing.\n\n\"Today, we are going to hear from Administrator Whitaker on what actions the FAA is taking to ensure their oversight of Boeing's production prevents further mishaps. I am interested in hearing his impressions of Boeing's actions in response to FAA's audits of the Boeing production line.\n\n\"It is clear the safety culture at Boeing needs to be reinforced, something that does not happen overnight. I look forward to hearing on FAA's long-term efforts to ensure that Boeing is following through on its improvement plan. The safety of the flying public is vital, and it is our job to ensure the FAA and Boeing are taking their safety responsibilities seriously.\n\n\"I hope we will soon hear directly from Boeing on how they are going to address production failures. I understand that Boeing's CEO Dave Calhoun will be appearing soon before the U.S. Senate, but I am disappointed it won't be this Committee. We have a responsibility as the Committee of jurisdiction for civil aviation to conduct oversight on these matters and trust will soon hear from Boeing execs.", "source": {"uri": "commerce.senate.gov", "dataType": "news", "title": "U.S. Senate Committee On Commerce, Science, & Transportation"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate_Committee_on_Commerce,_Science,_and_Transportation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alaska_Airlines", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Alaska Airlines"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ted_Cruz", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ted Cruz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boeing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Aviation_Administration", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Federal Aviation Administration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aviation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Aviation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plug_door", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Plug door"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncontrolled_decompression", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Uncontrolled decompression"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chairperson", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chairperson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bicameralism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bicameralism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_737_MAX", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Boeing 737 MAX"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manufacturing", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Manufacturing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/City_manager", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "City manager"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington,_D.C.", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dave_Calhoun", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dave Calhoun"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_aviation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Civil aviation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jurisdiction", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jurisdiction"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whistleblower", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Whistleblower"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Transportation_Safety_Board", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "National Transportation Safety Board"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assembly_line", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Assembly line"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace_and_Defense", "label": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace and Defense", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace_and_Defense/Aeronautical", "label": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace and Defense/Aeronautical", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Military/Aviation", "label": "dmoz/Society/Military/Aviation", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Aviation/Multimedia", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Aviation/Multimedia", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Aviation/Regulations", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Aviation/Regulations", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 55}], "image": "https://www.commerce.senate.gov/themes/commerce/assets/img/social/default.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9647737", "eventUri": "eng-9647737", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-01-05", "textStart": 1903, "textEnd": 1914}], "sentiment": 0.3647058823529412, "wgt": 188, "relevance": 1}

It said 787 \"Dreamliners\" currently in service are safe to operate, though it plans to determine if airlines with planes in operation need to take any action.\n\nThe company made its disclosure as Michael Whitaker, head of the Federal Aviation Administration, was preparing for a Friday visit to the South Carolina factory where the 787 is built, part of the agency's stepped up oversight of Boeing.\n\nWhile a midair door panel blowout aboard an Alaska Airlines' jet earlier this year brought scrutiny of Boeing's manufacturing practices, it also renewed long standing questions of the FAA's oversight of the company.\n\nWhitaker has been praised for his quick decision to ground 737 Max 9 aircraft in the wake of the Jan. 5 blowout until inspections could be completed. But on Thursday, in an appearance before the Senate's Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee, he was grilled about the FAA's response to the crisis.\n\n\"We are counting on you to be that agent of change. We know that this begins by taking a hard look at the agency itself,\" Sen. Maria Cantwell (D-Wash.), chair of the committee said, noting that Whitaker was overwhelmingly confirmed to lead FAA by the Senate last October.\n\nAdded Sen. Ted Cruz (Tex.), the committee's ranking Republican: \"The FAA must guarantee that not only are they certifying an aircraft is safely designed but that the manufacturer is building them to that safe design. Clearly, that was not happening at Boeing.\"\n\nWhitaker told members of the panel that the door panel blowout made it clear that the agency's oversight of Boeing has been \"too hands off,\" and that a more aggressive approach was needed. The agency has put more inspectors on Boeing factory floors where they can interact with front-line employees, he said.\n\nThursday's hearing took place just weeks after Boeing submitted a plan to the FAA to address shortcomings identified by the agency. The company's chief executive David Calhoun is expected to testify next week before the Senate's permanent subcommittee on investigations.\n\nIn a statement, Boeing said Thursday the latest issue involving its 787 jets, first reported by Reuters, was identified as part of the company's quality management system. The company found that some fasteners were torqued incorrectly and are being studied to determine whether they will require repairs.\n\n\"We are taking the time necessary to ensure all airplanes meet our delivery standards before delivery,\" Boeing said in a statement. \"We are working closely with our customers and the FAA and keeping them updated.\"\n\nThis is only the latest issue to impact production of the 787 jetliner. Last month, the FAA said it had launched an investigation into whether Boeing employees skipped key inspection of certain 787 aircraft and falsified reports to say the work was completed.", "source": {"uri": "washingtonpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Washington Post"}, "authors": [{"uri": "lori_aratani@washingtonpost.com", "name": "Lori Aratani", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boeing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Aviation_Administration", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Federal Aviation Administration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alaska_Airlines", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Alaska Airlines"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jet_aircraft", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jet aircraft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ted_Cruz", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ted Cruz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Carolina", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "South Carolina"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "South Carolina"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate_Committee_on_Commerce,_Science,_and_Transportation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maria_Cantwell", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Maria Cantwell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_737_MAX", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Boeing 737 MAX"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_Everett_Factory", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Boeing Everett Factory"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jet_airliner", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jet airliner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airplane", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Airplane"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reuters", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Reuters"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calhoun_County,_Alabama", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Calhoun County, Alabama"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Calhoun County, Alabama"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Aerospace", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Aerospace", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace_and_Defense", "label": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace and Defense", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace_and_Defense/Aeronautical", "label": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace and Defense/Aeronautical", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Military/Aviation", "label": "dmoz/Society/Military/Aviation", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Classifieds/Aviation", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Classifieds/Aviation", "wgt": 12}], "image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/XGJYMQ2YOJY2TH74J6UOUJAUSQ_size-normalized.jpg&w=1440", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9647737", "eventUri": "eng-9647737", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-01-05", "textStart": 800, "textEnd": 806}], "sentiment": 0.09019607843137245, "wgt": 187, "relevance": 1}

Rather, he said, \"production\" was Boeing's focus.\n\nThe FAA chief said he found the word choice \"revealing\" about how Boeing ran its production lines -- a concern that was reinforced through other conversations with Boeing employees, its unions and even FAA's own inspectors. (It also echoes criticisms Boeing whistleblowers have made alleging that the company has had more of a focus on hitting production and profit targets, instead of on quality.)\n\nBoeing had no comment on Whitaker's remarks, but referred back to previous statements, including one from Stephanie Pope, CEO of Boeing's commercial division, noting the investments the company has made in expanding training, simplifying manufacturing processes, rooting out the source of defects and other items.\n\n\"We are confident in the plan that we have put forward and are committed to continuously improving. We will work under the FAA's oversight and uphold our responsibility to the flying public to continue delivering safe, high-quality airplanes,\" she said in a statement.\n\nThe FAA and Boeing have created an action plan intended to guide Boeing's steps to clean house, along with metrics the agency will use to judge their success. But Whitaker stressed that there is a long road ahead.\n\n\"That's a very long-term, culture change project,\" Whitaker said Wednesday, adding this is the first stage of Boeing's journey that will adjust with time.\n\nFAA has \"a lot of tools\" at its disposal to ensure Boeing is improving -- and the FAA plans to keep a sharp eye on the manufacturer, Whitaker said.\n\n\"That's going to be the job for the next couple months. 'How do we make sure this is permanent?'\" he said.\n\nThat said, there \"a lot of eyes on this\" -- meaning pressure for Boeing to get it right this time, said Hassan Shahidi, head of the Flight Safety Foundation, during a separate panel at POLITICO's event.\n\nBoeing had a framework in place following two 2018 and 2019 MAX 8 crashes on foreign carriers that claimed the lives of 346 on board. But in the latest case, FAA has \"clearly increased its oversight\" when it comes to inspections, and with the increased government scrutiny, Boeing can institute better production measures, Shahidi said.\n\nThe FAA has to step it up when it comes to shoring up its overrun air traffic controller workforce, which Whitaker said will continue to lag for at least another 18 months.\n\nThe agency has been making strides to hire up, with 1,500 hired in 2023, 1,800 expected in 2024 and 2,000 for 2025 -- but net gains won't begin to be felt until 2025, Whitaker said. The controller workforce is understaffed by about 3,000 people nationwide, according to the latest FAA controller staffing plan submitted to lawmakers in May.\n\nTo facilitate more workers, the FAA is making it easier for military veterans to get controller jobs and standing up college controller training programs that will allow more direct hires.\n\nAnd the FAA reauthorization law that Congress enacted in May also requires an overhaul of the way the agency calculates staffing levels at air traffic control towers -- a change that Rich Santa, president of the National Air Traffic Controllers Association, said is monumentally important.\n\nThe shortfalls in staffing have been \"finance and budget driven for the last 15 years,\" the union leader said, resulting in 1,000 fewer certified controllers than 10 years prior.\n\nNow, the agency must hire the maximum number of people that can be trained at the FAA Academy while also requiring an FAA study on hiring practices and speeding up the controller pipeline.\n\nThis \"is the start line of the health of the system,\" Santa said.\n\nSen. Jerry Moran of Kansas, the top Republican on the Senate Commerce Subcommittee on Aviation, said he was happy that there was a \"significant focus on more personnel and more training\" among the overworked air traffic controllers, a component of the FAA reauthorization bill that he called a big win for safety.\n\nWhitaker said congressional dysfunction is also an impediment to the way the FAA operates, with uncertainty around its budgets and programs because of political gamesmanship over shutdowns and strings of stopgap funding.\n\nThe $105 billion, five-year FAA reauthorization bill was a significant bipartisan accomplishment -- but that came only after four short-term extensions. And that's just the most recent example.\n\n\"The FAA, as an agency, suffers from a lack of certainty on funding,\" Whitaker said.\n\nWhitaker's sentiment is backed up by independent experts, who in November found that subpar funding efforts for the FAA, along with threats of the government shutting down, have set the stage for some of the conditions that allowed for several near misses between commercial aircraft on runaways.\n\nAnd he hinted that the aviation industry should come together in a \"collaborative fashion\" on a solution that could take Congress out of the equation, though he didn't elaborate on how.\n\nThe FAA reauthorization took a pass on the divisive topic of regulating seat sizes. Instead, the legislation directs the FAA to either craft a rule on minimum dimensions for passenger seat sizes or decide a rule is superfluous.\n\nErin Witte, the director of consumer protection for the Consumer Federation of America, said this was a mistake.\n\n\"Sizes are increasingly shrinking,\" Witte said. \"We're cramming more people onto smaller airplanes.\"\n\nNot only is that uncomfortable, but \"when you cram that many people into an [airplane] and make it more difficult for them to evacuate off of a plane -- that's something we should really be paying attention to,\" she said.\n\nSharon Pinkerton, senior vice president of legislative and regulatory policy at the airline industry trade group Airlines for America, countered that the FAA has already studied seat sizes and how they affect evacuation standards. (Some Democratic lawmakers, however, have criticized prior studies for using only younger, fit people, which does not simulate real world conditions, including the very young and very old, or those with disabilities.)\n\nPinkerton noted that the FAA continues to be the \"arbitrator for safety\" and that the agency has yet to sound an alarm over the issue. In regulatory filings, the airline industry also regularly points out that the FAA's duty is to ensure that people are safe -- not comfortable.", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boeing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Aviation_Administration", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Federal Aviation Administration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_travel", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Air travel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_737_MAX", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Boeing 737 MAX"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whistleblower", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Whistleblower"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airport", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Airport"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Runway", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Runway"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flight_Safety_Foundation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Flight Safety Foundation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_traffic_controller", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Air traffic controller"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Veteran", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Veteran"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airplane", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Airplane"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate_Committee_on_Commerce,_Science,_and_Transportation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_politician", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Independent politician"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Air_Traffic_Controllers_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "National Air Traffic Controllers Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerry_Moran", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jerry Moran"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airlines_for_America", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Airlines for America"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trade_association", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Trade association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_traffic_control", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Air traffic control"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arbitration", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Arbitration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pipeline_transport", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pipeline transport"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finance", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Finance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kansas", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kansas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Kansas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Transportation", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Transportation", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Aerospace", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Aerospace", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Transportation_and_Logistics/Traffic_Control", "label": "dmoz/Business/Transportation and Logistics/Traffic Control", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace_and_Defense/Aeronautical", "label": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace and Defense/Aeronautical", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Aviation/Regulations", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Aviation/Regulations", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 62}], "image": "https://s.yimg.com/cv/apiv2/social/images/yahoo_default_logo-1200x1200.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9647737", "eventUri": "eng-9647737", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.01960784313725494, "wgt": 185, "relevance": 1}

Boeing notified the FAA about the issue after an employee reported what appeared to be an \"irregularity\" during required safety tests. Scott Stocker, general manager of Boeing's 787 program, said in a memo the company determined the skipped inspections didn't create a safety issue, according to The Washington Post.\n\nFederal regulators have increasingly scrutinized Boeing, after a metal door plug flew off an Alaska Airlines Boeing 737 during the middle of a flight in January. A subsequent probe by the National Transportation Safety Board found the aircraft was missing several key bolts, suggesting the plane had flown without the bolts for three months before the incident. The NTSB also said paperwork for the removal of the bolts did not exist. Earlier this week, Boeing reported only receiving four orders for new planes in May, a month after the company reported just seven sales for its aircraft. Last month, Boeing gave the FAA a new comprehensive plan to address the company's \"systemic quality control issues\" in manufacturing, following a warning by the agency indicating it would have increased oversight at the company.\n\nFAA Administrator Mike Whitaker said during a Senate hearing Thursday the agency has \"multiple active investigations\" into Boeing, adding the FAA is \"processing a number of reports filed by whistleblowers,\" according to Bloomberg.

Cantwell: \"We want to know that the workforce is being listened to and that they are backed up. When you have enough FAA oversight and they are there and communicating and double checking that, it's a reinforcement\"\n\nWASHINGTON, D.C. - Today, U.S. Senator Maria Cantwell (D-WA), chair of the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation, pressed Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Administrator Michael Whitaker on how he plans to strengthen the agency's safety oversight at Boeing and other aviation manufacturers, after a series of accidents and failed audits.\n\n\"What is the FAA doing to strengthen its oversight of the planes that we fly on every day and to make sure that they are safely built? We need to know what change under your watch, Administrator Whitaker, will restore the proper oversight to manufacturing to achieve the excellence that we want to see at Boeing and other manufacturers, and ensure the FAA is setting the gold standard for safety oversight,\" Sen. Cantwell said in her opening statement of the committee hearing.\n\n\"I am struck by a sense of, is this deja vu?\" Sen. Cantwell continued. \"In 2022 and 2023, as part of individualized FAA conducted audits of Boeing and Spirit AeroSystems, production lines required Boeing to correct any identified problems. Yet, your new special audit still found problems. It begs the question about the audit process itself at the FAA [...] The question is, what can you do to change this culture? \"\n\nDuring the Q&A portion, Sen. Cantwell went on to press Administrator Whitaker on the FAA's plan to increase the number of inspectors who regularly review practices on Boeing and Spirit factory floors.\n\n\"A large part of the FAA's oversight is making sure there are enough safety inspectors,\" Sen. Cantwell said. \"That's why, enacted in the recent law, we basically authorized $66.7 billion over five years to help boost the FAA's workforce and to make sure that we have an increase in the number of aviation safety inspectors. This is to be done across all shifts, obviously, at manufacturing sites. How does the FAA know what the right number of safety inspectors are? How do we use metrics to measure their success?\"\n\n\"Well, the interaction between what the inspectors are finding and what the staffing needs are is sort of a continuous feedback loop,\" Administrator Whitaker responded. \"We initially deployed 24 inspectors, I think we are up in the low 30s now to Boeing and Spirit, and our target is 55, so we are continuing to increase, train and increase inspectors to deploy.\"\n\nSen. Cantwell also asked Administrator Whitaker why an FAA safety inspector didn't catch the improperly installed door plug that resulted in a blowout at 16,000 feet above Portland International Airport last January and stressed the importance of FAA listening and communicating directly with the frontline manufacturing workforce:\n\nSen. Cantwell: \"In this instance of a door plug issue, you would have had a safety inspector from FAA on the ground that would have been monitoring these processes? I just want to get a little granular here about what the inspector is. They would be verifying compliance to the specifications of what someone on production should be doing? They are not doing the production work but are verifying something has been done the way it was supposed to be done and that it meets the requirements of design and certification?\"\n\nAdministrator Whitaker: \"Correct. In the case of the door plug, it would identify as a critical safety component. Inspectors would focus on those more critical aspects of production to make sure those are done properly.\"\n\nSen. Cantwell: \"If Boeing is saying we don't have documentation and we don't know who removed it, where was the aviation safety inspector?\"\n\nAdministrator Whitaker: \"We wouldn't have had them on the ground at that point.\"\n\nSen. Cantwell: \"Why not?\"\n\nAdministrator Whitaker: \"At that point the agency was focusing on auditing internal quality programs at Boeing.\"\n\nSen. Cantwell: \"So, what role did FAA having a lighter touch do to create this kind of system with a lack of safety culture?\"\n\nAdministrator Whitaker: \"I think this has been a long evolution at Boeing. Not having been there, I can speculate. I think it was a long evolution and was exacerbated by workforce challenges of COVID. We clearly didn't have enough folks on the ground to see what was going on in that factory.\"\n\nSen. Cantwell: \"...We want to know that the workforce is being listened to and that they are backed up. And so, when you have enough FAA oversight and they are there and communicating and double checking that, it's a reinforcement.\"\n\nLast month, Sen. Cantwell led the passage of the FAA Reauthorization Act of 2024. The new law includes comprehensive measures to improve aviation safety, including updating the FAA's safety inspector staffing model and putting more safety inspectors on factory floors, addressing the nation's shortage of air traffic controllers, deploying new runway technology to prevent close calls, mandating new 25-hour cockpit recording systems to assist in investigations, and enhancing aircraft certification reforms.\n\nThe FAA Reauthorization Act builds upon the Aircraft Certification, Safety, and Accountability Act of 2020, spearheaded by Sen. Cantwell in the aftermath of the Boeing 737 Max crashes in 2018 and 2019. The law strengthened the FAA's direct oversight of aircraft certification, implemented new integrated systems analyses of new and derivative aircraft, required aircraft manufacturers to disclose safety critical technological changes to their aircraft, and implemented new safety reporting requirements and whistleblower protections.\n\nSen. Cantwell is a longtime proponent of working to strengthen the aviation and aerospace workforce in Washington state and nationwide. In March 2023, she held a hearing focused on strengthening the aviation workforce and highlighting the anticipated shortages in the industry over the next two decades: \"We will need 128,000 pilots, 134,000 maintenance technicians and 173,000 crew members in North America alone,\" she said.\n\nIn April 2024, Sen. Cantwell convened a roundtable at Kent-based aerospace company Blue Origin with stakeholders from across the industry including manufacturers, researchers, and aviation apprenticeship instructors to discuss the Biden Administration's designation of Spokane as a national hub for aerospace material manufacturing; video of that roundtable is available HERE.\n\nSen. Cantwell first introduced the Senate FAA Reauthorization bill on June 12, 2023, along with Sens. Cruz, Duckworth, and Moran, and the Committee passed the legislation with bipartisan support on February 8, 2024. The Committee held eight hearings to inform the bill's drafting, including: Integrating new entrants into the National Airspace System on September 28, 2022, strengthening airline operations and consumer protections following the Southwest and holiday cancellations on February 9, 2023, modernizing the FAA's NOTAM system following failures on February 15, 2023, overseeing aviation safety and the Aircraft Certification, Safety, and Accountability Act on March 8, 2023, strengthening the aviation workforce on March 16, 2023, enhancing consumer protections and connectivity in air transportation on March 23, 2023, advancing the next generation aviation technologies on March 29, 2023, and addressing close calls to improve aviation safety on November 9, 2023.\n\nVideo of today's hearing is available HERE, audio HERE, and a transcript of Sen. Cantwell's remarks is HERE.", "source": {"uri": "foreignaffairs.co.nz", "dataType": "news", "title": "foreignaffairs.co.nz"}, "authors": [{"uri": "mil_osi_publisher@foreignaffairs.co.nz", "name":

Here's how it's doing", "body": "When a Boeing 737 MAX that had rolled off a Renton assembly line just months earlier plummeted into the Java Sea off Indonesia in October 2018, aviation regulators were initially mystified.\n\nHow did a new airliner by an American company widely credited with making air travel safe and commonplace plunge into the sea?\n\nBut after it happened again 132 days later -- another new MAX crashing outside Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, in March 2019 -- it became clear that Boeing's newest version of the 737 was catastrophically flawed and a glaring problem had eluded American air safety regulators.\n\nCongress held exhaustive hearings focused on the crashes and the design flaws that enabled them, resulting in ambitious, far-reaching legislation that was adopted in December 2020.\n\nThe law, known as the Aircraft Certification, Safety and Accountability Act, represents a sweeping legislative overhaul of safety standards in the Federal Aviation Administration's aircraft certification process. It aimed to tighten FAA oversight of the troubled processes at Boeing that investigators determined contributed to the crashes.\n\nThe FAA, faulted at times for its cozy, deferential relationship with Boeing, controls the process for implementing the law. Headway has been plodding but steady.\n\n\"We're continuing to make progress addressing the ACSAA requirements,\" FAA spokesperson Ian Gregor said. The deadline for fully implementing the law remains a year away.\n\nAmong other things, the ACSAA seeks to reset the relationship between Boeing and the FAA, which the congressional hearings following the MAX crashes revealed to be ineffective because the regulator so often bent to the whims of the manufacturer.\n\n\"ACSAA was about getting the FAA to do its right oversight job,\" U.S. Sen. Maria Cantwell, D-Wash., who chairs the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation, said in a statement. \"It says the FAA can't delegate to manufacturers safety-critical design features.\"\n\nMeanwhile, the dramatic midflight blowout of a fuselage panel on a Boeing MAX 9 airplane in January triggered a fresh round of scrutiny in Congress, which immediately began holding hearings focused on the quality of work at Boeing and the FAA. Unlike the last wave of congressional hearings that focused on design flaws, the latest zeroed in on oversight of work on the factory floor, where the manufacturing mistakes that resulted in the blowout occurred.\n\nSince it was adopted in December 2020, the ACSAA added more than 325 staff to the FAA, the fruits of a three-year, $75 million campaign to beef up the regulator's ranks. The FAA told Congress it closed out 2019 with 7,017 employees in its Aviation Safety division, which includes aviation safety inspectors and safety engineers among other positions. As of last September, the division employed approximately 7,600, according to the FAA's latest report to Congress on staffing.\n\nThe law's most visible impact to date has been the work of an expert panel created to review the FAA's reliance on Boeing employees delegated to work on the FAA's behalf in a process known as organization delegation authorization. In essence, the FAA for two decades has deputized employees of manufacturers such as Boeing to act as the regulator's eyes on the factory floor. The result, according to Congress' findings in 2020, was diminished oversight of Boeing's work quality that resulted in flawed products reaching the flying public.\n\nIn the ACSAA, Congress required the FAA to overhaul its reliance on outsourced regulatory authority to manufacturers. The resulting policy that requires the FAA to approve the designated manufacturing employees for these jobs was issued in fall 2021.\n\nA year later, the FAA published an associated policy that requires those deputies to watch for and report interference with whistleblowers, and in spring 2023, the FAA completed a review of those manufacturer designees who act on the regulator's behalf, according to FAA's Gregor.\n\nThe expert panel delivered a report in February that said Boeing's safety culture fell short of \"the public interest in aviation safety.\" Some of the panel's experts appeared at a congressional hearing in April, where they testified to a \"disconnect\" between the words of Boeing senior management about safety and the lack of attention that Boeing employees observed.\n\nBut much work remains to fully implement the law's provisions. And that process was complicated by the January fuselage blowout that revealed some of the same problems exposed after the MAX tragedies persisted even after the ACSAA.\n\nCantwell said her committee continues to monitor and work on ACSAA implementation, even as it strives to unravel the factors that led to the January fuselage blowout. FAA Administrator Mike Whitaker will testify before Cantwell's committee during a hearing Thursday, and so will aviation workers in the coming weeks, to \"get the view from the top and the view from the factory floor.\"", "source": {"uri": "seattletimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Seattle Times"}, "authors": [{"uri": "patrick_malone@seattletimes.com", "name": "Patrick Malone", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boeing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Aviation_Administration", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Federal Aviation Administration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_Sea", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Java Sea"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_certificate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Type certificate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aviation_safety", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Aviation safety"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_travel", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Air travel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assembly_line", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Assembly line"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_737_MAX", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Boeing 737 MAX"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airliner", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Airliner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aviation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Aviation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renton,_Washington", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Renton, Washington"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Renton, Washington"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Addis_Ababa", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Addis Ababa"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Addis Ababa"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ethiopia"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indonesia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Indonesia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Indonesia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate_Committee_on_Commerce,_Science,_and_Transportation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maria_Cantwell", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Maria Cantwell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Headway", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Headway"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fuselage", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fuselage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airplane", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Airplane"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulatory_agency", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Regulatory agency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outsourcing", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Outsourcing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whistleblower", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Whistleblower"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legislator", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Legislator"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Transportation", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Transportation", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace_and_Defense/Aeronautical", "label": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace and Defense/Aeronautical", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Safety_Engineering", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Safety Engineering", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Occupational_Health_and_Safety", "label": "dmoz/Health/Occupational Health and Safety", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Aviation/Regulations", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Aviation/Regulations", "wgt": 23}], "image": "https://images.seattletimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/06122024_tzr_tzr_124754.jpg?d=1020x655", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9647737", "eventUri": "eng-9647737", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2018-10-", "textStart": 130, "textEnd": 142}, {"amb": false, "date": "2019-03-", "textStart": 424, "textEnd": 434}, {"amb": false, "date": "2020-12-", "textStart": 754, "textEnd": 767, "freq": 2}], "sentiment": 0.2313725490196079, "wgt": 159, "relevance": 1}

In his opening remarks, Mike Whitaker, the Administrator of the FAA, stated that the FAA and EASA could cooperate on three areas, including safety. The two regulators and other industry stakeholders discussed wide-ranging topics during the event, according to the conference's agenda. SIMPLEFLYING VIDEO OF THE DAY SCROLL TO CONTINUE WITH CONTENT\n\nSpeaking during the joint Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) Safety Conference, Mike Whitaker, the Administrator of the FAA, emphasized that the lessons learned from the Alaska Airlines mid-air door plug blowout can form the basis of discussions between the two regulators.\n\nWorking together with EASA\n\nWhitaker remarked that the event made him think that there was a huge opportunity for the FAA and EASA to work together, remarking that he already had time to spend time with Florian Guillermet, the Executive Director of EASA. According to the head of the FAA, the two had already worked together, making it like a reunion between two friends.\n\n\"Since we're in the U.S., I feel I have to quote an American philosopher instead of a French philosopher. I'm going to go with Yogi Bear who famously said, \"When you come to a fork in the road, take it.\" So, we're at a fork in the road, and I think there's a lot of opportunity. We're really excited about that.\"\n\nPhoto : Chad Robertson Media | Shutterstock\n\nThe US regulator's Administrator added that there were three areas where the FAA and EASA could cooperate, namely safety, cooperating regarding regulations, and international engagement, namely driving the agenda at the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO).\n\nRelated Michael Whitaker: Who Is Biden's New FAA Administer Nominee? Whitaker has previously served as the Deputy Administrator of the FAA. Lessons from the mid-air door plug blowout\n\nWhile Patrick Ky, the predecessor of Guillermet worked with Boeing and the FAA during the 737 MAX groundings as well as on the initial certification processes of the 777X, Whitaker said that the lessons the FAA had learned from the Alaska Airlines mid-air door plug blowout could act as the foundation for discussions about safety between the two regulators.\n\n\"We've taken the learnings from January 5th and also applied them to other areas in the system, whether it's operators, maintainers, controllers, pilots, or with workforce performance, writ large.\"\n\nPhoto: BlueBarronPhoto | Shutterstock.com\n\nWhitaker explained that since he began working as the Administrator of the FAA, his focus has been safety, as well as pilot mental health, fatigue, and controller hiring. Still, the Alaska Airlines incident on January 5, when a Boeing 737 MAX 9 lost its door plug while it was climbing out of Portland International Airport (PDX), helped clarify that the FAA was in the right mode, looking at operational safety in the system.\n\nRelated Head Of FAA Says Boeing Is Not Clear To Increase Production Of The 737 Max Boeing leaders met FAA officials on May 30 to present their quality improvement plan. Improving regulation cooperation\n\nWhitaker noted that regulatory issues could also be another area where the two regulators could cooperate. The Administrator said that rhyming the FAA's and EASA's regulatory structure would be a good goal, adding that while the two cannot have identical regulations, they should be as compatible as possible.\n\nPhoto: Ian Dewar Photography | Shutterstock\n\nWhitaker's comments came as he opened the joint FAA-EASA Safety Conference on June 11. However, EASA did not publish Guillermet's opening remarks. The event's agenda showed that the regulators are looking to tackle many issues, including sustainability, runway safety, mental health, manufacturing quality and safety, cybersecurity, safety management systems (SMS), and other topics.\n\nRelated EASA Will Stop Indirect Boeing 737 MAX Production Approval If Needed If such a decision were to be made, it could lead to significant

In October, JetBlue announced that it would terminate service between\u202fthe Patrick Leahy Burlington International Airport (Leahy BTV) and New York's JFK International Airport -- which accounts for 10% of all passengers flying into Burlington monthly -- due to an ongoing shortage of air traffic control personnel at JFK. \"My last question is about the FAA's efforts to try to improve the availability of air traffic control, and that's important to us -- it's important to everybody. But we lost our flight to New York City, which is -- we've got to correct that. And my understanding is that the lack of air traffic controllers is relevant to that. With respect to the changes that were made in the [FAA] Reauthorization Act, what is your assessment of where we're going to be on addressing that shortage of air traffic controllers?\" asked Senator Welch. In response to questioning, FAA Administrator Whitaker said the agency has, \"increased our efforts to hire across the board by making it easier for military controllers to hire directly into the agency; by putting together a program to allow aeronautical universities to train students to the same standards as the academy so they can come after taking the exam -- come directly into facilities. So, we've been able to really open up the pipeline for new controllers. It takes a long time to make a controller, so there's a little bit of a lag, but we're making really good progress.\" FAA Administrator Whitaker addressed service in Burlington: \"I think that was largely a reduction because we've reduced capacity on the east coast corridor by 10% because of staffing problems specifically in New York. We are in the process of moving some of that airspace to Philadelphia. That's been a long process, but we're hoping to cut over in July -- end of July...It's going to take some time to get that elephant through the boa, but we think it's going to be a solution to this problem.\" Sen. Welch also asked Administrator Whitaker about the FAA's support of a new five-year electric aircraft infrastructure pilot program and the agency's ongoing efforts to bolster the electric aviation industry. Watch the Senator's full remarks below:\n\nAt the hearing, Sen. Welch also discussed Boeing's level of cooperation with the FAA amidst ongoing safety investigations. Earlier this year, Sen. Welch joined Senators Edward Markey (D-Mass.) and JD Vance (R-Ohio) in sending a letter to Boeing CEO Dave Calhoun demanding answers about the company's manufacturing quality control, oversight of contractors, and communications after a Boeing 737 Max 9 door plug blew off the side of an airplane while in-flight. He also questioned safety experts about Boeing's recent safety lapses in a Commerce Committee hearing in April, emphasizing the importance of holding Boeing to the highest standard of safety. In the Senate, Senator Welch has worked to support rural airports, and increase aviation safety and quality. Following JetBlue's announcement that it would terminate service from Leahy BTV to JFK, the Vermont Congressional Delegation sent a letter to JetBlue CEO Robin Hayes urging the airline to reinstate service between the airports and to compensate all passengers impacted by the service termination.\u202f Senator Welch has also led efforts in the Senate to strengthen safety protections for travelers in the wake of mechanical failures on Boeing's 737 Max 9 aircrafts.", "source": {"uri": "foreignaffairs.co.nz", "dataType": "news", "title": "foreignaffairs.co.nz"}, "authors": [{"uri": "mil_osi_publisher@foreignaffairs.co.nz", "name": "Mil-Osi Publisher", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Welch", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Peter Welch"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_traffic_controller", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Air traffic controller"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Aviation_Administration", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Federal Aviation Administration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patrick_Leahy", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Patrick Leahy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_traffic_control", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Air traffic control"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_F._Kennedy_International_Airport", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "John F.

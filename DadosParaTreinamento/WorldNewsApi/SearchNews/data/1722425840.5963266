{"id": 243224780, "title": "Skin Condition Medications Added to Pharmacy Trial", "text": "A trial program allowing pharmacies to provide certain medications, saving patients a trip to the doctor, has been expanded to include some common skin conditions. Eczema, shingles, school sores, and mild plaque psoriasis are now covered by the New South Wales (NSW) trial, which general practitioners have criticised, claiming it overlooks the patient\u2019s overall care. Treatment for urinary tract infections (UTI) and the oral contraceptive pill are already available through pharmacies via the program. Health Minister Ryan Park said the trial\u2019s findings would shape what role pharmacists could play in making healthcare more accessible. \u201cWe know how difficult it is to access a GP\u2014there were fewer GPs in NSW in 2023 than there were in 2018\u2014that\u2019s why we\u2019re making it easier for people to gain access to simple treatments and the medications they need for non-complex conditions,\u201d he said. \u201cThousands of people in NSW experience common skin conditions and anyone who has had or cared for someone with one of these conditions knows how uncomfortable they can be.\u201d It saves patients the cost of a trip to the doctor, instead simply paying for their medication. During the trial, pharmacies are paid for each skin condition consultation to cover the patient fee. Pharmacy Guild NSW branch president David Heffernan said the UTI trial success clearly showed the system could work for other medications. \u201cThis trial will mean more accessible everyday healthcare, taking pressure off hospital emergency departments and freeing up GPs to treat more complex conditions,\u201d he said. \u201cCommunity pharmacies across NSW are ready to do more to help provide patients with primary health care they need.\u201d Doctors are worried about patient safety when GPs are cut out of the process, suggesting people need a medical expert monitoring their overall health. \u201cPharmacists are brilliant at what they do, but they aren\u2019t as trained to diagnose\u2014GPs spend 10 years being trained to diagnose problems so they can rule out a whole raft of weird and wonderful things,\u201d Royal Australian College of General Practitioners NSW chair Rebekah Hoffman told AAP in May. The skin condition trial starts on July 12.", "summary": "A trial program allowing pharmacies to provide certain medications, saving patients a trip to the doctor, has been expanded to include some common skin conditions.

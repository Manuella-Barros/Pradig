His body was discovered in a rocky area beside Agia Marina on Symi on Sunday after an extensive search led by emergency workers, around a 30-minute walk from the village of Pedi where Mosley was last seen on CCTV. The 67-year-old TV personality was with his wife and friends at Agios Nikolaos beach on Wednesday, before going alone for a walk to the centre of the island. In a statement from his agent to the PA news agency, Dr. Clare Bailey Mosley said: \u201cI don\u2019t know quite where to begin with this. It\u2019s devastating to have lost Michael, my wonderful, funny, kind, and brilliant husband. \u201cWe had an incredibly lucky life together. We loved each other very much and were so happy together. I am incredibly proud of our children, their resilience and support over the past days. \u201cMy family and I have been hugely comforted by the outpouring of love from people from around the world. It\u2019s clear that Michael meant a huge amount to so many of you. \u201cWe\u2019re taking comfort in the fact that he so very nearly made it. He did an incredible climb, took the wrong route and collapsed where he couldn\u2019t be easily seen by the extensive search team. Michael was an adventurous man, it\u2019s part of what made him so special.\u201d She said the family are also \u201cso grateful to the extraordinary people on Symi\u201d who worked \u201ctirelessly\u201d to help find Mosley, with some working from dawn until dusk unasked. Dr. Bailey Mosley added: \u201cI feel so lucky to have our children and my amazing friends. Most of all, I feel so lucky to have had this life with Michael. Thank-you all.\u201d Mosley\u2019s four children joined their mother, a GP and cookery book writer, on Symi earlier this week to help with the search effort. His body was discovered around mid-morning on Sunday beneath a fence that runs around a bar on Agia Marina beach, which is surrounded by hilly, rocky terrain. Police arrived at Agia Marina around 20 minutes after the body was discovered about 90 metres from the coastline. Firefighters arrived at the marina just after 2 p.m. local time and took the body away from the island on a stretcher on a boat. On Saturday, an emergency services helicopter spent hours flying across the mountainous search site on Symi between Pedi bay and Agia Marina, and hovered over the spot where the body was later found. Agia Marina bar manager Ilias Tsavaris, 38, first saw the body alongside journalists after the island\u2019s mayor \u201csaw something\u201d by the fence of the bar and alerted staff. He said: \u201cThey saw it with the boat. The mayor came and saw something so that is when they called me and said \u2018Hey they saw something go and check there.\u2019 \u201cThey called me, they said \u2018You know what we saw something from far away, can you go and check,\u2019 so I went there. \u201cWhen I walked up I saw something like a body to make sure. You don\u2019t see a dead body everyday, it is not a warzone, it\u2019s summer, you are supposed to have fun and swimming. \u201cHe came from Pedi OK, and he walked not through the restaurant. If he had walked through there [the bar] we would have checked the cameras.\u201d The search effort had been widespread, operating in dangerous conditions and high temperatures, and included police, firefighters with drones, Greek Red Cross workers, divers, a search dog, and a helicopter. Greek authorities shifted their focus on Saturday after CCTV footage from a house at the edge of a small marina in Pedi showed the presenter walking towards a mountainous path at about 2 p.m. local time on Wednesday. New footage released on Saturday also appeared to show Mosley walking unimpeded with an umbrella near to the marina. Mosley first trained as a doctor in London before moving into the world of media, becoming a presenter, documentary maker, author, and columnist. During his career he presented a host of science programmes and films including the series Trust Me, I\u2019m A Doctor, which looked at healthcare in Britain, and hosted Radio 4 podcast Just One Thing, where he revealed tips to help improve your health. The managing editor of Mosley\u2019s publisher, Octopus Publishing Group, remembered him as a \u201cbrilliant, warm, funny, and kind man.\u201d Anna Bond added: \u201cHe dedicated his time to educating and empowering millions across the world to live longer, healthier lives and his powerful legacy is a gift that will live on as viewers, listeners, and readers continue to enjoy a better quality of life via his books and his journalism, TV programmes, the Fast 800 community, and his BBC podcast Just One Thing.\u201d", "summary": "His body was discovered in a rocky area beside Agia Marina on the Greek island of Symi on Sunday.", "url": "https://www.theepochtimes.com/world/michael-mosleys-wife-devastated-as-she-confirms-death-of-tv-doctor-5665400", "image": "https://img.theepochtimes.com/assets/uploads/2024/06/09/id5665401-embedded9805170-300x180.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-09 14:41:17", "author": "Pa Media", "authors": ["Pa Media"], "language": "en", "source_country": "us", "sentiment": 0.208}

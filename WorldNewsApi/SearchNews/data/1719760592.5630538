{"id": 225005088, "title": "UK tourists using cashpoints abroad warned to avoid ATMs in 'busy locations", "text": "UK tourists who are getting Euros out in the European Union this summer at cashpoints and ATMs have been issued a warning. Brits abroad in countries like France, Italy, Spain and Portugal have been warned over a scam designed to \"steal\" data and information. Will Bolsover, founder & CEO of Natural World Safaris, warned: \"When travelling abroad, it's crucial to be aware of the threat posed by card skimmers, devices designed to steal your card information. Skimmers are often installed on ATMs and card readers in tourist areas or busy locations. \"They can capture your card details and even record your PIN, allowing the scammer to make unwanted transactions.\" He advised: \"To avoid card skimmers, make sure to look at the reviews of the ATM you want to use on Google Maps. Often, if someone has had a bad experience of being scammed, they'll leave a review to warn others. \"You should also look for any signs of tampering on ATMs and card readers such as unusual attachments and loose or misaligned components, which could indicate the presence of a skimming device.\" He continued: \"One of the more unusual instances of card fraud is when your information has been compromised in a data breach. \"Frustratingly, this can happen at any time, even months after you've given your card details, but especially if you're using websites in countries that don't have as strict cybersecurity. Drop your bank a quick note before you go on a trip - that way, they can keep an eye out for any dodgy transactions while you're away.\" The warning comes ahead of the busy spring and summer getaway season for scores of Brit holidaymakers who'll be leaving the country in search of some much-needed sunshine. The expert went on to say: \"You could also use a secondary card for those random buys abroad.\"", "summary": "Brits abroad in countries like France, Italy, Spain and Portugal have been warned over a scam designed to &quot;steal&quot; data and information.", "url": "https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/travel/uk-tourists-using-cashpoints-abroad-29257657", "image": "https://i2-prod.birminghammail.co.uk/travel/article29257658.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_euros.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-05-29 12:17:08", "author": "James Rodger", "authors": ["James Rodger"], "language": "en", "source_country": "gb", "sentiment": 0.142}

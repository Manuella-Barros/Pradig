We don't want them in our base, they shouldn't be in a base, they shouldn't be claimed as part of a base, and it has to be made crystal clear,\" he continued.\n\nHe's right.\n\nWe will not easily wash this stain from the resume of Republicans or conservatives, who will be lumped into one pile with these evil wretches, whether we support them or not. The leadership of the GOP, including (and especially) the president need to call it out by name, condemn it, and turn their backs on it, completely - not just for political expediency, but because it's the right thing to do.\n\n\"He should use this opportunity today to say this is terrorism, this is domestic terrorism, this is white nationalism and it has to stop, and I encourage the president to do so,\" he said.\n\nAnd if you want to know what it is that the president should be standing against, or how his role in this is viewed, look no further than this tweet from the hatemonger known as David Duke:\n\nI would recommend you take a good look in the mirror & remember it was White Americans who put you in the presidency, not radical leftists. https://t.co/Rkfs7O2Ykr\n\n-- David Duke (@DrDavidDuke) August 12, 2017\n\nTrump wasn't elected to be the \"white\" president. He's supposed to be our nation's president, and because this element has attached itself like a parasite to his campaign, and his presidency that is all the more reason he should rebuke it completely, openly, and now.", "time": "16:53:00"}

These were white supremacists,\" tweeted Sen. Cory Gardner, a Colorado Republican.\n\nOn Sunday morning, the Trump administration tried to mollify its critics with appearances by a handful of senior administration officials on news programs.\n\nOn NBC's \"Meet the Press,\" national security adviser H.R. McMaster called the Charlottesville clashes an act of \"domestic terrorism.\" This echoed the words of Republican lawmakers such as Sens. Gardner and Marco Rubio, who made such pronouncements on Twitter in an effort to put distance between themselves and the president.\n\nThe president's daughter Ivanka Trump also weighed in via Twitter. \"There should be no place in society for racism, white supremacy and neo-nazis,\" her post read.\n\nHomeland Security Adviser Tom Bossert also condemned Nazis and white supremacists after CNN journalist Jake Tapper pressed him. But this came after he first doubled down on the president's Saturday address, also blaming \"many sides\" for the violence -- which critics say equates the actions of the white supremacists with the counter-protesters.", "time": "17:29:00"}

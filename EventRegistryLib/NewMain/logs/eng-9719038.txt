Kennedy Jr. and several other long-shot candidates, Trump leads Biden by 6 points, at 44 percent support to 38 percent. A separate 9 percent of respondents said they backed Kennedy. Five percent in that poll said they were undecided.\n\nThe AARP poll shows that Trump has a lead over Biden with both younger voters (those aged 18 to 49 years old) and older voters (aged 50 years and up). But Trump enjoys a greater lead over Biden among older voters (a 7-point lead on the full ballot, which includes Kennedy) than among younger voters, where Trump has a 4-point lead.\n\nAt the same, the AARP poll showed Sen. Tammy Baldwin (D-Wis.) outpacing Republican Senate candidate Eric Hovde, underscoring a long-running trend of swing-state Senate Democrats outperforming Biden on their respective ballots.\n\nThe poll showed Baldwin leading Hovde 50 percent support to 45 percent. Another 5 percent of respondents said they were undecided, while 1 percent said \"other.\"\n\nThe survey is another warning sign for Biden, particularly in Wisconsin, given the president has polled better in the Badger State compared to other swing states. But the survey suggests that his performance during the debate may have taken a hit with voters in the critical battleground state.\n\nThe AARP poll was conducted between June 28 and July 2 with 600 likely voters sampled. The margin of error for the full sample is plus or minus 4 percentage points.

Eighty-five percent of voters ages 50 and older say they are \"extremely motivated\" to vote in this election, compared to just 64% of voters ages 18-49.\n\nFormer President Donald Trump (R) leads President Joe Biden (D) among voters ages 18 and older, 44% - 38%, with Robert Kennedy Jr. polling at 9%. Trump also leads among voters ages 50 and older, 48% - 41%; the candidates are tied at 45% among voters ages 65 and older, while Trump leads by 15-points among those ages 50-64. Biden is ahead by 8-points among women overall and by 6-points among women ages 50 and older, while men of all ages favor Trump by 22-points.\n\nSenator Tammy Baldwin (D) holds the lead over Eric Hovde (R), 50% - 45%, in the U.S. Senate race among voters overall. Among voters 50 and older, Hovde has a narrow advantage over Sen. Baldwin, 50% - 47%. The cohort of 50-64-year-olds favor Hovde by 7-points, while Baldwin has a 2-point lead among those ages 65 and older. Women strongly favor Baldwin, with leads of 18-points among women overall and 12-points among women 50 and older.\n\nAny candidate that hopes to woo older voters ought to pay attention to the issues that matter most to this group. Eighty-three percent of voters ages 50 and older report that candidates' positions on Social Security are very important in deciding whom to vote for in November, followed by Medicare (72%), helping people stay in their homes as they age (63%), and the cost of prescription drugs (62%). And the vast majority (84%) of older Wisconsin voters prefer a member of Congress who wants Medicare to continue negotiations for lower drug prices.\n\nWisconsin residents ages 50 and older make up an outsized portion of the electorate: in the 2020 elections, older voters accounted for 55% of all Wisconsin voters and in the 2022 mid-terms, they made up 61% of the state's voters.\n\n\"Wisconsin voters over age 50 are the biggest voting bloc and could tip the scale for any candidate in this election,\" said Martha Cranley, State Director, AARP Wisconsin. \"If candidates want to win, they should pay attention to the issues that matter to voters over age 50, from protecting Social Security to supporting family caregivers.\"\n\nOther key takeaways from the poll voters among older voters include:\n\nNearly two-thirds (64%) say Social Security is or will be a major source of their income.Immigration and border security (37%) is the most important issue when deciding who to vote for in November, followed by inflation and rising prices (29%), and threats to democracy (21%).58 percent of these voters cite personal economic issues - inflation and rising prices, the economy and jobs, and Social Security - as most important. Notably, both Trump are Hovde are leading among older voters who prioritize these issues.Fifty-six percent of older voters say they are worried about their personal financial situation, compared to 65% of voters ages 18-49. Twenty-four percent of voters over 50 identify as family caregivers, with 27% of older women and 29% of GOP voters over 50 saying the same. Family caregivers make up 21% of Wisconsin voters overall.Swing voters over 50 make up 19% of older voters overall, and they are more likely to be Independents and moderates.\n\nAARP commissioned the bipartisan polling team of Fabrizio Ward (R) & Impact Research (D) to conduct a survey of voters in Wisconsin. The firms interviewed 1,052 likely voters, which includes a statewide representative sample of 600 likely voters, an oversample of 452 likely voters ages 50 and older. The survey was done between June 28-July 2, 2024. The interviews were conducted via live interviewer on landline (20%) and cellphone (35%), as well as SMS-to-web (46%). The sample was randomly drawn from the Wisconsin voter list. The margin of sampling error at the 95% confidence level for the 600 statewide sample is \u00b14.0%; for the 800 total sample of voters 50+ is \u00b13.5%.\n\nView the full survey results at aarp.org/WIpolling.\n\nFor more information on how, when, and where to vote in Wisconsin, visit aarp.org/WIvotes.\n\nAbout AARP\n\nAARP is the nation's largest nonprofit, nonpartisan organization dedicated to empowering Americans 50 and older to choose how they live as they age.

Tammy Baldwin, who leads GOP challenger Eric Hovde in their crucial Senate race.\n\nAccording to the poll, which was conducted by Republican pollsters Fabrizio Ward and Democratic pollsters Impact Research on behalf of AARP, Trump tops Biden 50%-45% among likely voters in Wisconsin.\n\nWhen third party and independent presidential candidates are included, Trump leads Biden 44%-38%, with Democrat turned independent Robert F.

A handful of national polls conducted entirely after the debate and released last week contained plenty of red flags for the president -- including Trump widening his single-digit edge over Biden and deepening concerns of Americans about whether Biden was up to the task of running the country.\n\nFollowing his extremely rough debate performance a week and a half ago in his first face-to-face showdown Trump, Biden has been attempting to prove that he still has the stamina and acuity to handle the toughest and most demanding job in the world. And he's trying to prove that he has the fortitude to defeat Trump.\n\nThe debate was a major setback for Biden, who at 81 is the oldest president in the nation's history. His halting delivery and stumbling answers at the showdown in Atlanta sparked widespread panic in the Democratic Party and a rising tide of public and private calls from within his own party for him to step aside as its 2024 standard-bearer.", "source": {"uri": "foxnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Fox News"}, "authors": [{"uri": "paul_steinhauser@foxnews.com", "name": "Paul Steinhauser", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AARP", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "AARP"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wisconsin", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Wisconsin"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Wisconsin"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_politician", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Independent politician"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tammy_Baldwin", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Tammy Baldwin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox_News", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fox News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incumbent", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Incumbent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swing_state", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Swing state"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midwestern_United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Midwestern United States"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "White House"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opinion_poll", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Opinion poll"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_Party_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Green Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_F._Kennedy_Jr.", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Robert F.

I'm sure the debate had something to do with it,\" said Bob Ward, with Fabrizio Ward, which conducted the AARP poll with Impact Research. From June 28 to July 2, the team interviewed 1,052 likely voters, including a statewide representative sample of 600 likely voters and an oversample of 452 likely voters 50 and older.\n\nRepublican Eric Hovde leads Sen. Tammy Baldwin, D-Madison, 50% to 47% among voters 50 and older, within the poll's margin of error, which is 3.5% for older voters and 4% for all voters. But overall, Baldwin is ahead of Hovde 50% to 45%.\n\nVoter turnout among various age groups in the closely watched swing state of Wisconsin could have a significant impact, Ward said. Some 85% of people 50 and older said they are extremely motivated to vote, compared with 64% of those ages 18 to 49. About 75% of older adults watched the debate, compared with 54% of younger adults. Among those who watched, Trump is winning by 17 percentage points.\n\n\"Given where Tammy Baldwin is (overall), this is not a Democratic party problem. It's a Joe Biden problem,\" Ward said. \"But it becomes a Tammy Baldwin problem if younger voters don't show up.\"\n\nAmong people 65 and older, the race between Biden and Trump is tied, at 45%, with third-party candidates included. That's why the parties are talking about protecting Social Security and Medicare, and adding tax credits for caregivers, Ward said.\n\n\"Seniors are up for grabs, and campaigns are going to be fighting over them,\" he said.\n\nSome 83% of voters 50 and older report candidates' positions on Social Security are very important in deciding whom to vote for, followed by Medicare, with 72%, helping people stay in their homes as they age, with 63%, and the cost of prescription drugs, with 62%.\n\nSome 84% of older Wisconsin voters want Medicare to continue negotiating for lower drug prices.\n\nOverall, among those 50 and older, immigration and border security is the most important issue when deciding whom to vote for in November, with 37% of respondents ranking it first or second among 13 issues. That was followed by inflation and rising prices, with 29%, and threats to democracy, with 21%.\n\nSome 56% of older voters say they are worried about their personal financial situation, compared to 65% of voters 18 to 49.\n\nLove 0 Funny 0 Wow 0 Sad 0 Angry 0\n\nLocations Madison Be the first to know\n\nGet local news delivered to your inbox!\n\nSign up! * I understand and agree that registration on or use of this site constitutes agreement to its user agreement and privacy policy.", "source": {"uri": "lacrossetribune.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "La Crosse Tribune"}, "authors": [{"uri": "david_wahlberg_dwahlberg@lacrossetribune.com", "name": "David Wahlberg Dwahlberg", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wisconsin", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Wisconsin"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Wisconsin"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Onalaska,_Wisconsin", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Onalaska, Wisconsin"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AARP", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "AARP"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fireworks", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Fireworks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/La_Crosse,_Wisconsin", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "La Crosse, Wisconsin"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "La Crosse, Wisconsin"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scripps_News", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Scripps News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_politician", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Independent politician"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marquette_University_Law_School", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Marquette University Law School"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tammy_Baldwin", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tammy Baldwin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Republican_(Springfield,_Massachusetts)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Republican (Springfield, Massachusetts)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_F._Kennedy_Jr.", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Robert F.

Wisconsin was one of the critical battleground states to deliver the former president's win in 2016 by roughly 22,000 votes. It also constructed the \"Blue Wall\" that flipped for Biden four years later.\n\nBut Biden's disastrous debate performance in Atlanta has raised concerns that the event could jeopardize his path back to the White House in key states like Wisconsin.\n\nAn aggregate of polls from The Hill and Decision Desk HQ shows Biden leading Trump by a hair, 47 percent to 46 percent. Meanwhile, Democrats are also looking to hold onto Sen. Tammy Baldwin's (D) seat in the upper chamber, making Wisconsin one of the crucial states in an election that will likely hinge on just a handful of battlegrounds.\n\nRecent polling has shown the president faring better in Wisconsin compared to the other battleground states. An aggregate of Pennsylvania polls from The Hill and Decision Desk HQ shows Trump leading in Biden's birth state by 4 points; in Arizona, the aggregate shows Trump leading Biden 4 points and in Georgia, by roughly 3 points.\n\nThe only state where Biden appears to be faring just as competitively as Wisconsin is Michigan, where the polling average between Biden and Trump shows the two essentially tied at 47 percent.\n\nThough it's too soon to tell whether Biden's first debate performance against Trump about two weeks ago may have damaged his standing in the race long term, some surveys have started to suggest the president will see a dip in the state.\n\nAn AARP Wisconsin poll, conducted by Fabrizio Ward and Impact Research and released on Tuesday, showed Trump leading Biden in a head-to-head matchup 50 percent to 45 percent. When they're placed on the full ballot with several other long-shot candidates, Trump leads the president 44 percent to 38 percent.\n\nBurden said there wasn't an easy explanation for why Biden seemed to fare better in Wisconsin polling versus other battleground states.\n\nStill, the president still had his work cut out for him in the Badger State.\n\n\"...It seems to me as though Trump ... has his arms around the Republican electorate more convincingly than Biden does around Democrats, and that's even before the debate performance from a couple of weeks ago,\" the Wisconsin political science professor explained.\n\nBoth candidates are keenly aware of the importance of Wisconsin in the race to the White House. Trump has traveled to the Badger State three times alone this year; Biden has traveled to Wisconsin five times, most recently last week, when he held a rally in Madison.\n\nWisconsin, too, will play an important role in the road to the Senate majority with Baldwin up for reelection. For now, the seat is favored to remain in Democratic hands, with the nonpartisan election handicapper Cook Political Report rating her seat \"lean Democrat.\"\n\nBaldwin was notably absent from the president's rally in Madison last week due to a preplanned statewide tour conflict, according to the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel.\n\nThe Wisconsin Democrat declined to weigh in on Biden's candidacy during a campaign event on Sunday, saying \"I'm focused on my own campaign right now\" and \"it's his decision,\" WKOW reported.\n\nShe noted she would be \"fighting for the entire Democratic ticket.\"\n\nSome Democrats say the bedwetting is nothing new but feel still feel confident with Biden in the race.\n\n\"Both sides, frankly, have work to do because both sides have challenges unique to their candidacy. And all of that said I would still rather be Joe Biden than Donald Trump, because Democrats have won 14 of the last 17 statewide races here,\" said Democratic strategist Joe Zepecki. \"[Tammy] Baldwin was an incredibly strong candidate who I think will help Joe Biden, in the same way that [Sen.] Ron Johnson helped Donald Trump in 2016.\"\n\nAt the same time, a not insignificant portion of voters cast ballots for somebody other than Trump during the GOP primary in April, with roughly 20 percent voting for Nikki Haley, Ron DeSantis, Chris Christie or the option of \"uninstructed delegate.\"\n\nRepublicans suggest many of those Wisconsin voters will eventually come back to the base. Trump was aided by the fact that Haley endorsed the former president and urged for her delegates to recommit to Trump during the RNC.\n\n\"If you're motivated enough to go vote in a presidential primary, you're probably likely to come home to your ... party's candidates, but not all of it will,\" said GOP strategist Mark Graul.\n\n\"I think there are more options for the dissatisfied Democrats than there are for dissatisfied Republicans to be honest,\" he added.\n\nCopyright 2024 Nexstar Media, Inc.

Tammy Baldwin says she conveyed voters' concerns about Biden to the White House", "body": "MADISON - U.S. Sen. Tammy Baldwin on Wednesday said she passed along Wisconsin voters' concerns to the White House regarding President Joe Biden's ability to lead the country for another four years but continued to decline to say whether she thinks he should stay in the race.\n\nA spokesman for her opponent responded by saying \"Wisconsin taxpayers deserve actual answers\" from the two-term senator.\n\n\"I traveled all around the state last weekend and I heard concerns from Wisconsinites about whether or not the President has what it takes to do the job for four more years,\" Baldwin said in a statement. \"I have passed on those concerns to the White House but at the end of the day, that is the President's decision, and my focus is on working hard for the people of Wisconsin.\"\n\nBaldwin's statement comes as the Democratic president, who is fending off a challenge from Republican former President Donald Trump, faces growing calls from Democratic lawmakers, candidates and donors to drop out of the race following a rocky debate performance on June 27.\n\nThe Democratic senator, who is seeking a third term, has not appeared with the embattled president in recent visits to Wisconsin and had already scheduled a campaign stop in northern Wisconsin when Biden visited Madison last Friday. She faces a challenge from Republican banking and real estate mogul Eric Hovde.\n\n\"It would be nice if Sen. Baldwin acknowledged whether she had the same concerns about President Biden's mental faculties as her constituents or if she has concerns about his abilities to finish four more years in the White House,\" said Hovde spokesman Ben Voelkel. \"But instead she cowardly passes the buck and refuses to take a stand because at her core she is nothing more than a self-interested career politician.\"\n\nBaldwin has been polling stronger than Biden in Wisconsin. According to the most recent Marquette University Law School poll, released June 26, the presidential race was a virtual tossup between Biden and Trump, while in the Senate race, Baldwin led Hovde by 5 points.\n\nAn AARP poll of Wisconsin voters released this week showed Baldwin leading Hovde by 5 points overall, but among voters 50 and older, Hovde had a 3-point advantage. The same poll had Trump leading Biden by 6 points overall, and by 7 points among voters ages 50 and older.\n\nMore: With Tammy Baldwin polling stronger than Joe Biden, could Wisconsin see a split outcome?\n\nSpeaking to reporters last Friday in a coffee shop after a campaign event about 200 miles from Madison in Marinette, Baldwin repeatedly declined to say even if she thought Biden should remain on the ballot in November.\n\n\"I will tell you that I am focused on my own campaign,\" Baldwin said.\n\nThe last time Baldwin appeared with Biden was at the State of the Union address in Washington, D.C. in March, when she was among a group of lawmakers who walked the president into the House chamber.\n\nAiming to shore up support, Biden's campaign is expected to make another effort Thursday by sending three senior campaign advisors to meet with Senate Democrats. Although several House Democrats have said publicly Biden should end his campaign, no Democratic senators have gone as far.\n\nActor George Clooney -- a major Democratic donor who just last month co-hosted a lucrative Hollywood fundraiser for Biden -- on Wednesday called for a new Democratic nominee in a New York Times opinion piece. He said the Biden he saw at the fundraiser was not the same man he's known for years, writing that the one battle Biden can't win is the \"fight against time.\"\n\nActor and filmmaker Rob Reiner, another deep-pocketed Democratic donor, agreed. \"We acknowledge all he has done for our country. But Democracy is facing an existential threat. We need someone younger to fight back. Joe Biden must step aside,\" Reiner wrote on X, formerly known as Twitter.\n\nBiden did not address his party's unrest during a brief stop at AFL-CIO headquarters in Washington, where he spoke to union leaders. \"I've never been more optimistic about America's chances, not because of me, but because of what we're doing together,\" Biden told the group.\n\nBiden campaign spokesman Ammar Moussa declined to comment to USA TODAY on the new calls for Biden to withdraw. He instead pointed to Biden's past remarks emphatically affirming he's staying in the race, including in a letter Monday to congressional Democrats.\n\nJessie Opoien can be reached at

Sixty-one percent say he doesn't, according to the poll, which was first shared with Politico.\n\nAll told, 33 percent said Biden should carry on as the Democratic nominee and 52 percent said he should bow out.\n\nThe poll found that a Clinton-Harris ticket has more support than the current Biden-Harris ticket, beating Trump 43 to 40 percent, four points ahead of the Biden ticket.\n\nWhile voters have strong concerns about Biden's age and ability to do the job, those worries still haven't led to a massive lead for Trump, who is saddled with a mountain of political and legal baggage.\n\nThe survey appears to show that voters are open to Clinton returning to the national stage even as she's been largely dismissed as a serious presidential contender following her loss to Trump in 2016. She has also said publicly that she has no plans to run for president again and is backing Biden. At 76, she's younger than both Biden, 81, and Trump, 78.\n\nOther possible Democratic candidates were also tested in the poll, but it found them behind both Harris and Trump. California Governor Gavin Newsom trails Trump 37 to 40 percent, while Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer fell behind the former president 36 to 40 percent.\n\nThe poll, which included 1,000 likely voters and was conducted between July 2 and 6, appears to show a willingness from voters to support a candidate who has been tested on the national and international stage. The survey comes as Democratic elected officials, donors, and activists are pushing Biden to step aside with increasing force.\n\nThe president has made clear that he's not going anywhere, even going so far as to urge any other candidates to announce their campaigns and challenge him at the convention in August.\n\nThe poll also found that a ticket with Harris as the presidential nominee and Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro as her running mate beats Trump 42 to 40 percent. If Whitmer steps in as the VP pick, the poll found the Harris-led ticket losing by 39 to 41 percent.\n\nAnother question included in the survey was whether voters would back Biden even if he was unlikely to finish his next term because of an age-related impairment simply to stop Trump from winning. Forty-eight percent of respondents said they wouldn't back Biden for that reason while 44 percent said they would. Seventy-five percent of Democrats said they would back Biden even under those circumstances.\n\nBoth Biden and White House officials have pointed to Biden's busy travel schedule and a cold as reasons for his poor performance in the recent debate against Trump. The administration has said that there's no reason for the president to undergo a cognitive exam.\n\nIn the poll, 53 percent said they view Trump as a danger to democracy, with 37 percent stating that such comments are partisan.", "source": {"uri": "aol.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Aol"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hillary_Clinton", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hillary Clinton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_United_States_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "2024 United States presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Atlanta, Georgia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Atlanta, Georgia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gretchen_Whitmer", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gretchen Whitmer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor_of_California", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Governor of California"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politico", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Politico"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "White House"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josh_Shapiro", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Josh Shapiro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor_of_Michigan", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Governor of Michigan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gavin_Newsom", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gavin Newsom"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Vice President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Running_mate", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Running mate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pennsylvania", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pennsylvania"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Pennsylvania"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns_and_Elections", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns and Elections", "wgt": 7}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Entertainment/Tickets", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Entertainment/Tickets", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Television/Tickets_For_Shows", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Television/Tickets For Shows", "wgt": 7}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Democracy", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Democracy", "wgt": 6}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Online_Issues_Polls", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Online Issues Polls", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 94}], "image": "https://media.zenfs.com/en/aol_the_independent_us_877/4122af0d7a1cfef59cdf4e0b49ea7246", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9719038", "eventUri": "eng-9719038", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-02", "dateEnd": "2024-07-06", "textStart": 2304, "textEnd": 2316}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-27", "textStart": 894, "textEnd": 901}], "sentiment": 0.05882352941176472, "wgt": 156, "relevance": 1}

Wisconsin was one of the critical battleground states to deliver the former president's win in 2016 by roughly 22,000 votes. It also constructed the \"Blue Wall\" that flipped for Biden four years later.\n\nBut Biden's disastrous debate performance in Atlanta has raised concerns that the event could jeopardize his path back to the White House in key states like Wisconsin.\n\nAn aggregate of polls from The Hill and Decision Desk HQ shows Biden leading Trump by a hair, 47 percent to 46 percent. Meanwhile, Democrats are also looking to hold onto Sen. Tammy Baldwin's (D) seat in the upper chamber, making Wisconsin one of the crucial states in an election that will likely hinge on just a handful of battlegrounds.\n\nRecent polling has shown the president faring better in Wisconsin compared to the other battleground states. An aggregate of Pennsylvania polls from The Hill and Decision Desk HQ shows Trump leading in Biden's birth state by 4 points; in Arizona, the aggregate shows Trump leading Biden 4 points and in Georgia, by roughly 3 points.\n\nThe only state where Biden appears to be faring just as competitively as Wisconsin is Michigan, where the polling average between Biden and Trump shows the two essentially tied at 47 percent.\n\nThough it's too soon to tell whether Biden's first debate performance against Trump about two weeks ago may have damaged his standing in the race long term, some surveys have started to suggest the president will see a dip in the state.\n\nAn AARP Wisconsin poll, conducted by Fabrizio Ward and Impact Research and released on Tuesday, showed Trump leading Biden in a head-to-head matchup 50 percent to 45 percent. When they're placed on the full ballot with several other long-shot candidates, Trump leads the president 44 percent to 38 percent.\n\nBurden said there wasn't an easy explanation for why Biden seemed to fare better in Wisconsin polling versus other battleground states.\n\nStill, the president still had his work cut out for him in the Badger State.\n\n\"...It seems to me as though Trump ... has his arms around the Republican electorate more convincingly than Biden does around Democrats, and that's even before the debate performance from a couple of weeks ago,\" the Wisconsin political science professor explained.\n\nBoth candidates are keenly aware of the importance of Wisconsin in the race to the White House. Trump has traveled to the Badger State three times alone this year; Biden has traveled to Wisconsin five times, most recently last week, when he held a rally in Madison.\n\nWisconsin, too, will play an important role in the road to the Senate majority with Baldwin up for reelection. For now, the seat is favored to remain in Democratic hands, with the nonpartisan election handicapper Cook Political Report rating her seat \"lean Democrat.\"\n\nBaldwin was notably absent from the president's rally in Madison last week due to a preplanned statewide tour conflict, according to the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel.\n\nThe Wisconsin Democrat declined to weigh in on Biden's candidacy during a campaign event on Sunday, saying \"I'm focused on my own campaign right now\" and \"it's his decision,\" WKOW reported.\n\nShe noted she would be \"fighting for the entire Democratic ticket.\"\n\nSome Democrats say the bedwetting is nothing new but feel still feel confident with Biden in the race.\n\n\"Both sides, frankly, have work to do because both sides have challenges unique to their candidacy. And all of that said I would still rather be Joe Biden than Donald Trump, because Democrats have won 14 of the last 17 statewide races here,\" said Democratic strategist Joe Zepecki. \"[Tammy] Baldwin was an incredibly strong candidate who I think will help Joe Biden, in the same way that [Sen.] Ron Johnson helped Donald Trump in 2016.\"\n\nAt the same time, a not insignificant portion of voters cast ballots for somebody other than Trump during the GOP primary in April, with roughly 20 percent voting for Nikki Haley, Ron DeSantis, Chris Christie or the option of \"uninstructed delegate.\"\n\nRepublicans suggest many of those Wisconsin voters will eventually come back to the base. Trump was aided by the fact that Haley endorsed the former president and urged for her delegates to recommit to Trump during the RNC.\n\n\"If you're motivated enough to go vote in a presidential primary, you're probably likely to come home to your ... party's candidates, but not all of it will,\" said GOP strategist Mark Graul.\n\n\"I think there are more options for the dissatisfied Democrats than there are for dissatisfied Republicans to be honest,\" he added.", "source": {"uri": "thehill.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Hill"}, "authors": [{"uri":

The Democrat's halting speech and confused looks sent members of the party spiraling as they began publicly speculating whether the 81-year-old president could serve a second term.\n\nThe calls for Biden to step aside as the party nominee have also come from wealthy Democrat donors, who even the president pushed back on in a nationally broadcast interview on Monday when he expressed his frustration with the \"elites\" and said bluntly, \"I don't care what the millionaires think.\"\n\nNone of that, however, seems to have changed where voters stand on Biden.\n\n\"I spent time in Pennsylvania the weekend after the debate. Not a lot of folks were worried,\" Democratic Senator Chris Coons told Newsweek.\n\nFellow Senate Democrat John Fetterman echoed Coons remarks.\n\n\"I spent a day with the president all across Pennsylvania, and people were excited to see him. They were excited to [take] a selfie with them,\" Fetterman told Newsweek. \"He had interaction with people from small children all the way up to elderly union members. It was it was a great day for the president. And that's the Joe Biden that I know, and that's the Joe Biden that's going to win.\"\n\nNew polls show that Biden has even managed to improve his odds among Democrats and voters who supported him in 2020 after the presidential debate.\n\nA USA Today/Suffolk University survey released Monday found that 85 percent of Democrats would vote for Biden in the 2024 election were held today, a four-point increase from the 81 percent who said the same in March.\n\nThe president did see a slight drop in support from voters who backed him in the last election. Of those, 78 percent said they would vote for him in the July poll. In March, Biden saw 79 percent support among his 2020 voters.\n\nThe July poll was conducted among 1,000 registered voters between July 28 and 30, days after the first presidential debate was held on July 27. The March poll included the same sample size and was conducted between March 8 and 11. Both polls have a margin of error of +/-3.1 percentage points.\n\nDemocrats and Biden 2020 voters also seem more sure of their vote than they did three months ago.\n\nIn the July poll, 82 percent of Democrats and 82 percent of Biden 2020 voters said they firmly made up their minds about who to vote for in November, with only 11 percent of Democrats and 16 percent of Biden 2020 voters saying that might change.\n\nIn March, 78 percent of Democrats and 76 percent of Biden 2020 voters had their minds firmly made up. However, a larger share of Democrats and Biden 2020 voters, 23 percent and 21 percent, respectively, said their vote could still change before the election.\n\nThe July survey also showed that next month's Democratic National Convention is unlikely to sway voters. Only 25 percent of Democrats said the convention might change their mind, and 56 percent said neither the DNC nor the Republican nominating convention would influence their vote.\n\nIn March, 60 percent of Democrats said they would be satisfied with Biden being nominated at the convention, while only 7 percent said they would be dissatisfied. Another 22 percent said they would be excited, 6 percent said they would feel fearful, and 4 percent were undecided on how they felt about Biden as nominee.\n\nThese figures come as reports from battleground states suggest that most Democrats want Biden to stay in the race. Robert Costa, CBS News' chief election and campaign correspondent, reported Tuesday that while New Hampshire Democrats may have concerns about Biden's candidacy, they don't want him to withdraw from the race.\n\n\"I spent Monday talking to Democratic voters in battleground NH. Many of them told me they want Biden to stay in race,\" Acosta wrote on X, formerly Twitter. \"Heard some warnings to DC leaders to not cause 'civil war' in party. Many also had advice for Biden about how to improve. Concern but no new ticket, most said.\"\n\nAcosta said voters also told him that some of them, even highly engaged voters, didn't watch the debate because of summer plans and trips that had kept them busy. They did, however, say that they had seen clips of the debate on TV or social media.\n\nPolls show that Biden's approval rating continues to be underwater, but not as a result of the debate. Even before he stepped on stage, Biden's approval has long been an issue for his campaign. The president's approval hasn't been above 47 percent since August 2021.\n\nAs of Tuesday, only 37 percent of Americans approve of Biden's job as president, while nearly 57 percent disapprove, FiveThirtyEight's calculations show. The day before the debate, Biden had a 39 percent approval rating.\n\nThough these numbers suggest a slight dip, they follow a larger trend where Biden's ratings have continued to decline for years. The president hasn't seen an approval rating above 40 percent since September 2023, and his rating was already hovering around 38 percent in July 2022.\n\nCoons said he thinks Biden has been taking all the right steps to quell worries that he should not be the Democratic nominee.\n\n\"The best antidote to worry is to get to work, is to get out there and do grassroots events and do what the president's been doing,\" the Delaware Democrat said. \"To listen to voters, listen to local communities. The weekend after the debate, I did four local events in Pennsylvania for the [Biden] campaign and was really encouraged by the voices I heard of support -- strong support -- for our president.\"\n\nFetterman said he didn't know why Biden's debate performance was still being talked about, conceding that it had already been confirmed that it was a \"rough debate\" that was also \"terrible\" for Trump. Instead of focusing on the debate, Fetterman said the party would do best to move on and figure out how to help Biden defeat Trump.\n\n\"Here we are: Joe Biden is the guy. Next week, he will [be the guy], and three weeks from now and through til November, he's gonna be the guy,\" the Pennsylvania Democrat said.", "source": {"uri": "newsweek.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Newsweek"}, "authors": [{"uri": "katherine_fung@newsweek.com", "name": "Katherine Fung", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "alex_j_rouhandeh@newsweek.com", "name": "Alex J.

During that debate, Biden often failed to answer questions coherently, prompting some members of his party and progressive political voices to suggest that he should voluntarily step aside.\n\nBiden has repeatedly justified staying in the race by noting that he won the Democratic primaries, and thus, replacing him as the nominee would violate the tenets of democracy that the Democratic party is attempting to promote in their campaign against Trump.\n\nIn a letter to Congress this past week, Biden sought to quell calls for him to drop out from the race, stating, \"the voters -- and the voters alone -- decide the nominee of the Democratic Party.\"\n\n\"How can we stand for democracy in our nation if we ignore it in our own party?\" Biden added.\n\nIn an interview on MSNBC's \"Morning Joe\" program, Biden claimed that it was \"elites\" who were trying to replace him as a candidate, despite the fact that he himself has been a Democratic Party elite for several decades.\n\nBiden's arguments for staying in the race don't stand up to scrutiny -- notably, Biden ran virtually unopposed in the primaries, without a viable Democratic Party challenger. Indeed, months before the start of the caucus and primary election season, Democratic leaders urged potential challengers to refrain from entering the intraparty presidential nominating contest against him.\n\nAs a result, Biden won almost every primary election that was held over the past year, with \"uncommitted\" coming in second place.\n\nBeyond not facing any real competition, significantly fewer voters participated in the Democratic primaries this year than in 2020. In that year, more than 19 million voters selected Biden out of a slew of other Democratic Party contenders. Nearly 37 million voters took part in those primaries altogether.\n\nBut in 2024, that number was more than halved, with only 16.6 million voters taking part in the primaries, likely due to the lack of options. Even though Biden ran virtually unopposed, he saw his total number of votes shrink down to around 14.5 million voters.\n\nNotably, two states -- Florida and Biden's home state of Delaware -- didn't hold primaries at all, with both rewarding all of their delegates to the incumbent president as a result.\n\nThe legitimacy of Biden's claims about \"democracy\" is even more questionable when considering polling data over the past year.\n\nA Quinnipiac University survey in November, for example, found that more than half of American voters wanted options in the presidential race besides Trump and Biden. Among Democratic-leaning voters, around 6 in 10 said they wanted options besides Biden.\n\nIn a CBS News/YouGov poll conducted shortly after the debate, nearly three-quarters of voters, 72 percent, said they didn't want Biden to run for president again -- up from 63 percent who had said the same thing in February, indicating that nearly 1 in 10 voters moved away from Biden after the debate had aired.\n\nBiden has repeatedly rejected calls for him to step aside and allow another candidate to run -- and barring any more gaffes from him this week and into the rest of the month, it's likely that he will remain in the race.\n\nHowever, that doesn't mean that Biden doesn't have to play \"catch up\" to deal with the aftermath of his debate performance. Although Biden and Trump were nearly tied before the debate, an aggregate of polling data from FiveThirtyEight examining various swing states in this year's race shows that Biden has ceded significant ground to Trump since the end of June.\n\nIn Wisconsin, for example, Biden was leading Trump by 0.3 points in the average of polls conducted prior to the debate. As of Monday afternoon, however, Trump led Biden by an average of 1.5 points, indicating a 1.8-point shift in Trump's favor following the debate.\n\nThe same kind of shift in polls held true in Nevada, another swing state, where Trump increased his lead by 1.9 points. And in Pennsylvania, Trump, who had led Biden by just 0.8 points before the debate, led him by 3.3 points as of Monday afternoon, on average.", "source": {"uri": "truthout.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "Truthout"}, "authors": [{"uri": "chris_walker@truthout.org", "name": "Chris Walker", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Primary election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democracy", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Democracy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressivism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Progressivism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morning_Joe", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Morning Joe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MSNBC", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "MSNBC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quinnipiac_University", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Quinnipiac University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FiveThirtyEight", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "FiveThirtyEight"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incumbent", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Incumbent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CBS_News", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "CBS News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YouGov", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "YouGov"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swing_state", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Swing state"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pennsylvania", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pennsylvania"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Pennsylvania"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nevada", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nevada"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Nevada"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wisconsin", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wisconsin"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Wisconsin"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delaware", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Delaware"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Delaware"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns_and_Elections", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns and Elections", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Democracy", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Democracy", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Online_Issues_Polls", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Online Issues Polls", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://truthout.org/app/uploads/2024/07/2024_0710-biden-scaled.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9719038", "eventUri": "eng-9719038", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.06666666666666665, "wgt": 138, "relevance": 1}

But while Biden in particular may yet be shuffled aside to make room for somebody else, they currently exist in a state of political symbiosis. Biden and Trump may hate each other, but each owes a strong measure of his political viability to the failings of his opponent.\n\nIn April, AP-NORC polling found \"the public generally says the presidencies of both Joe Biden and Donald Trump did more harm than good, but each president is viewed negatively on different issues.\" Specifically, about half of respondents said Biden hurt the U.S. on cost of living, immigration, and foreign relations. A similar proportion thought Trump did harm to voting rights, election security, foreign relations, abortion, and climate change.\n\nUnsurprisingly, the same month, Pew Research reported that \"voters overall have little confidence in either candidate across a range of key traits, including fitness for office, personal ethics and respect for democratic values.\" Forty-nine percent favored replacing both Biden and Trump as the major parties' presidential nominees.\n\nAs of Tuesday, Trump has a 38.6 percent approval rating, according to ABC News/FiveThirtyEight (57.9 percent disapprove). That's miserable, but it's higher than Biden's 37.4 percent (56.8 percent disapprove). These are two political candidates who seemingly threaten to be dead weight for their respective political parties, dragging down prospects for ballot box victory. But in truth, each has a secret weapon: his much-loathed opponent.\n\n\"Biden likely can only win going up against a candidate as unpopular as Trump,\" Harry Enten, CNN's senior data reporter, commented last September. \"Trump likely can only win going up against a candidate as unpopular as Biden.\"\n\nSurveys bear out the weakness of both men. With Biden trailing Trump by a widening margin after a disastrous debate performance put his cognitive decline on public display, voters (barely) prefer Vice President Kamala Harris over the former president by 42 percent to 41 percent, and one-time presidential hopeful Hillary Clinton by 43 percent to 41 percent in a recent Bendixen & Amandi poll.\n\nOn the same note, January CBS News/YouGov polling found Trump beating Biden by 50 percent to 48 percent. But Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis out-did Biden by 51 percent to 48 percent, and former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley led the incumbent by 53 percent to 45 percent.\n\nEach of the major parties' primary voters have selected relatively weak candidates propped up by the similarly questionable decisions of their counterparts across the political divide.\n\nOf course, matters have changed in recent weeks after the presidential debate that was supposed to put Joe Biden's dynamism on display did exactly the opposite. The incumbent president's incoherent word salad and flat affect not only raised questions about his ability to campaign for another four years in the White House, but serious concerns that, whoever has been making presidential decisions, it hasn't been the guy behind the podium that night.\n\n\"It's unclear even to some inside the West Wing policy process which policy issues reach the president, and how,\" Semafor's Ben Smith reports he was told by an anonymous government official. \"Major decisions go into an opaque circle that includes White House chief of staff, Jeff Zients (who talks to the president regularly) and return concluded.\"\n\nThe fallout from that debate debacle, and subsequent not-very-reassuring interviews has upset the symbiotic political relationship that previously balanced Biden's obvious failings with Trump's glaring flaws. Both national and swing-state polls show Donald Trump pulling ahead of Joe Biden by a growing margin, with averages putting the Republican's national advantage anywhere from 2 percent to over 3 percent. That has prominent Democrats battling one another over whether and how Biden should be replaced as the party's standard-bearer going into the election.\n\nA new candidate without Biden's cognitive deficits and political baggage could well erase Trump's advantage. Voters resigned to casting a vote for the GOP candidate just because he's not Biden might decide differently if Democrats put forward a different option. Well, they might if it's a less-bad option.\n\nRight now, the likeliest replacement is Vice President Kamala Harris, who would inherit the Biden-Harris campaign apparatus and, importantly, cash. But despite a small advantage in the Bendixen & Amandi poll, she's not well-liked (37.1 percent approve, 51.2 percent disapprove). Harris has a reputation as a formerly authoritarian prosecutor who abuses staff until they quit in droves, and as an intellectual lightweight who just isn't up the limited demands of the vice presidency, let alone the White House.\n\nReplacing Biden with Harris could just trade one hobbled candidate for another who would have no obvious advantage going into the race -- other than a greater likelihood to live until Election Day, that is.\n\nFor his part, Biden (or somebody acting on his behalf) insists he is \"firmly committed to staying in this race, to running this race to the end\" and that he \"wouldn't be running again if I did not absolutely believe I was the best person to beat Donald Trump in 2024.\"\n\nUnless Biden, or those around him, changes his mind, it looks like he'll get a chance to try. With a lock on the Republican party and a lead in the polls, Trump is the certain GOP nominee. No matter what so many Americans want, the two mutually dependent rivals appear destined to once again present the voters with a choice between damaged and unpopular candidates.\n\nOf course, the real problem here isn't just the candidates, but parties and a political system that deliver such flawed options to a nation of 330 million people. If the best they can come up with are people who are viable political contenders only because they balance each other's awfulness, a better means of winnowing political hopefuls is in order, as is wider access to the ballot for potential contenders.\n\nUntil then, we're stuck with options that few want. May the less terrible choice, if such one is, win.", "source": {"uri": "reason.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Reason"}, "authors": [{"uri": "j_d_tuccille@reason.com", "name": "J.D.

Voters in Wisconsin beg to differ.", "body": "MILWAUKEE, Wisconsin -- Voters and local candidates in Wisconsin have a message for President Joe Biden: It's not just Democratic elites who are freaking out about your mental acuity.\n\nBiden on Monday suggested it was simply the \"the elites in the party\" raising doubts about his political viability after a halting, incoherent debate performance last month. In fact, questions about his age are dominating the political conversation in and around Milwaukee and Madison, crucial turf for Democrats in November, according to conversations with roughly two dozen Democrats and independent voters over the course of the past four days. The concerns come as a new AARP poll has Biden down five points to former president Donald Trump in the critically important swing state, and as Republicans prepare to formally nominate Trump in Milwaukee next week.\n\nEven the president's most loyal supporters -- voters, local party activists and candidates alike -- say that the debate fall-out has made it tough to focus on anything else. As a result, it's become much harder for Democrats on the ground to deliver what they hoped would be a winning message in the swing state -- on the Biden administration's success reviving the local manufacturing economy and commitment to protecting abortion rights.\n\nThere's little consensus, however, that Biden dropping out of the presidential race would improve the party's odds in November.\n\nAvery Renk, a Democratic candidate for a Wisconsin Assembly seat outside of Madison, said in an interview Sunday that it was too late for Democrats to pick another candidate and that they should \"stick with Joe.\" Still, the debate \"definitely had an impact,\" Renk said, as he mingled with prospective voters at a picnic hosted by a local farmer in his district.\n\nWhile Biden's age has long been a concern for voters nationally, \"before the debate there was a lot of chat about me, about my opponents in the Democratic primary for the Assembly,\" said Renk. \"Since the debate there's been a lot of chat at [voters'] doorsteps about Biden, and everything I hear is, 'he's too old.'\"\n\nThat was certainly what Wisconsin Assembly candidate LuAnn Bird encountered as she went door-to-door in the middle class neighborhood of Highwood Estates, in the suburbs of Milwaukee, on Monday.\n\n\"After the debate, everyone is saying 'oh my gosh he's in cognitive decline, we didn't see this,'\" Brandon, a middle-aged real estate salesman who would only share his first name, told Bird as he stood at his front door. \"I'm like, how can't you see [the decline]? It's obvious.\"\n\n\"We know Joe is old,\" Bird told the man, who said he's undecided on his presidential vote, despite supporting abortion rights and socialized health care.\n\nAs she would do many more times that afternoon, Bird tried to reassure Brandon with a story about meeting Biden at a labor event in Milwaukee, before steering the conversation away from Biden's performance to the threat Trump poses to abortion rights and the democratic process.\n\n\"If Trump gets elected, [women's rights are] only going to go backwards,\" she told voters again and again, finding herself repeatedly drawn into the national political debate despite the local nature of her own neck-and-neck Assembly race, in southeastern Milwaukee and the surrounding suburbs.\n\nBiden's age and visible frailty have overwhelmed the policy arguments that he and his advisers hoped would drive the campaign in places like Wisconsin. The president and his congressional allies -- like Democratic Wisconsin Sen. Tammy Baldwin, who is also running for reelection this year -- tailored much of their economic agenda to win back industrial states in the upper Midwest. Wisconsin, Pennsylvania and Michigan all swung to Trump in 2016 on a wave of discontent against global trade deals that shifted many factory jobs overseas.\n\nBiden flipped those states -- narrowly -- in 2020, while largely echoing Trump's protectionist trade rhetoric. As president, he expanded Trump-era tariffs on China, came out against the sale of iconic U.S. Steel to a Japanese rival, and abandoned the trade elements of his core economic proposal for Asia, the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework -- all at the urging of Baldwin and other at-risk Senate Democrats from the Rust Belt.\n\nBut even voters who say Biden's economic policies are working say that the debate performance is muddying the waters.\n\n\"Our production floor is full and we're always hiring new people, all year. So I think it's going a lot better than it was,\" said one Milwaukee voter who works for a manufacturer making cereal packaging machines, and was granted anonymity in order to speak freely. Many of her colleagues \"are blind\" to that economic reality, she added, because \"they want to follow whoever is loudest.\"\n\nThe debate performance has been so damaging that it's even distracting voters at factories funded by Biden's Inflation Reduction Act, including one that the president himself visited just last year.\n\n\"I thought [the debate] was a joke, to be honest,\" said Paul Hawver, a wind turbine repair technician in training at Ingeteam, a Milwaukee manufacturer of renewable energy technologies, adding with a laugh that he \"needed a beer\" to watch it.\n\nThe anxiety over Biden was highlighted -- perhaps inadvertently -- by Baldwin's campaign events over the past week. The senator skipped Biden's campaign stop in Madison on Friday, citing a \"scheduling conflict,\" and barely acknowledged the president in her stump speeches, even as she touted the administration's industrial policies, like manufacturing subsidies in the Inflation Reduction Act and Buy American rules she got inserted into the bipartisan infrastructure bill.\n\n\"In the Biden administration, I got permanent Buy American language in the bipartisan infrastructure bill in the Chips and Science Act and the Inflation Reduction Act,\" she said to applause from a crowd of about 40 at the 2nd District Democratic picnic outside Madison on Sunday.\n\nThat was the closest Baldwin came to mentioning the president by name at two separate campaign events over the weekend -- the other one north of Milwaukee -- even as she touted a visit with Secretary of Commerce Gina Raimondo. And at the latter event Sunday, as many establishment Democrats in Washington scrambled to prop up Biden's candidacy, Baldwin refused to say whether she thought the party should switch Biden out for someone else.\n\n\"We don't know what the future holds,\" she told reporters, \"but I am definitely focused on, first of all, winning my own reelection.\"\n\nThe Baldwin and Biden campaigns downplay the senator's moves to distance herself from Biden, with the senator pointing to campaign ads in the past that mentioned the president by name. A Biden campaign official, meanwhile, said that Baldwin was more than 100 miles away on a separate campaign visit and has pledged to appear with the president in the future. But to local Democrats the message of her absence was clear.\n\n\"It's really unfortunate\" that Baldwin skipped out on the Biden event, said Renk, the Assembly candidate outside of Madison. \"But Tammy's got a race to win and she's got to get the vote out here and it's going to be really tough because that excitement is just not there right now with the top of the ticket.\"\n\nStill, Renk and nearly all the Democrats who expressed concern about Biden over the weekend also appear resigned to the fact that he will hang on as the nominee, with many concerned about the chaos that could ensue if the party tried to switch him out so close to the election.\n\n\"It's almost too late for that,\" said Jim Steffens, a retired union letter carrier and Democratic voter outside Madison. Vice President Kamala Harris \"would be the likely next person up and I don't know if she would do any better,\" he added.\n\nSome Biden loyalists, meanwhile, have internalized the campaign's narrative that he just \"had a bad day\" due to fatigue and illness.\n\n\"It broke our heart to see it,\" Assembly candidate Maureen McCarville said of Biden's debate performance at the Sunday picnic outside of Madison. \"I get sinus infections and there are days when I can't crawl out of bed, and I'm not anywhere near his age.\"\n\nMany Biden loyalists were eager to turn the conversation back to Trump, who they feel has escaped scrutiny from the media amid the anxiety of Biden's debate performance.\n\n\"They're both old men,\" said Magnolia Taylor, a wind turbine assembly finisher at Ingeteam, noting that Biden has \"been through a lot\" in recent weeks, like the conviction of his son, Hunter, on gun charges. \"Everybody has a bad day,\" she concluded.\n\nAnd most Democrats in the state pledged to fight on for Biden through November, saying that after the debate performance, their best hope is for a reverse-coattails effect, where the activism of down-ballot candidates convinces voters to hold their nose and vote for Biden as well. With a new legislative map making more state-level seats competitive, that's the strategy candidates like Bird and Renk are clinging to amid the electoral anxiety this summer.\n\n\"Voting for anyone else but Biden -- regardless of how you feel about him -- is a vote for Trump,\" Bird cajoled one undecided voter on Monday, who said she is a Democrat but remained \"indifferent\" about the presidential election. \"So we just have to roll with this for this year, that's how I'm looking at it.\"", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [],

Voters in Wisconsin beg to differ.", "body": "Even the president's most loyal supporters -- voters, local party activists and candidates alike -- say that the debate fall-out has made it tough to focus on anything else. As a result, it's become much harder for Democrats on the ground to deliver what they hoped would be a winning message in the swing state -- on the Biden administration's success reviving the local manufacturing economy and commitment to protecting abortion rights.\n\nThere's little consensus, however, that Biden dropping out of the presidential race would improve the party's odds in November.\n\nAvery Renk, a Democratic candidate for a Wisconsin Assembly seat outside of Madison, said in an interview Sunday that it was too late for Democrats to pick another candidate and that they should \"stick with Joe.\" Still, the debate \"definitely had an impact,\" Renk said, as he mingled with prospective voters at a picnic hosted by a local farmer in his district.\n\nWhile Biden's age has long been a concern for voters nationally, \"before the debate there was a lot of chat about me, about my opponents in the Democratic primary for the Assembly,\" said Renk. \"Since the debate there's been a lot of chat at [voters'] doorsteps about Biden, and everything I hear is, 'he's too old.'\"\n\nThat was certainly what Wisconsin Assembly candidate LuAnn Bird encountered as she went door-to-door in the middle class neighborhood of Highwood Estates, in the suburbs of Milwaukee, on Monday.\n\n\"After the debate, everyone is saying 'oh my gosh he's in cognitive decline, we didn't see this,'\" Brandon, a middle-aged real estate salesman who would only share his first name, told Bird as he stood at his front door. \"I'm like, how can't you see [the decline]? It's obvious.\"\n\n\"We know Joe is old,\" Bird told the man, who said he's undecided on his presidential vote, despite supporting abortion rights and socialized health care.\n\nAs she would do many more times that afternoon, Bird tried to reassure Brandon with a story about meeting Biden at a labor event in Milwaukee, before steering the conversation away from Biden's performance to the threat Trump poses to abortion rights and the democratic process.\n\n\"If Trump gets elected, [women's rights are] only going to go backwards,\" she told voters again and again, finding herself repeatedly drawn into the national political debate despite the local nature of her own neck-and-neck Assembly race, in southeastern Milwaukee and the surrounding suburbs.\n\nBiden's age and visible frailty have overwhelmed the policy arguments that he and his advisers hoped would drive the campaign in places like Wisconsin. The president and his congressional allies -- like Democratic Wisconsin Sen. Tammy Baldwin, who is also running for reelection this year -- tailored much of their economic agenda to win back industrial states in the upper Midwest. Wisconsin, Pennsylvania and Michigan all swung to Trump in 2016 on a wave of discontent against global trade deals that shifted many factory jobs overseas.\n\nBiden flipped those states -- narrowly -- in 2020, while largely echoing Trump's protectionist trade rhetoric. As president, he expanded Trump-era tariffs on China, came out against the sale of iconic U.S. Steel to a Japanese rival, and abandoned the trade elements of his core economic proposal for Asia, the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework -- all at the urging of Baldwin and other at-risk Senate Democrats from the Rust Belt.\n\nBut even voters who say Biden's economic policies are working say that the debate performance is muddying the waters.\n\n\"Our production floor is full and we're always hiring new people, all year. So I think it's going a lot better than it was,\" said one Milwaukee voter who works for a manufacturer making cereal packaging machines, and was granted anonymity in order to speak freely. Many of her colleagues \"are blind\" to that economic reality, she added, because \"they want to follow whoever is loudest.\"\n\nThe debate performance has been so damaging that it's even distracting voters at factories funded by Biden's Inflation Reduction Act, including one that the president himself visited just last year.\n\n\"I thought [the debate] was a joke, to be honest,\" said Paul Hawver, a wind turbine repair technician in training at Ingeteam, a Milwaukee manufacturer of renewable energy technologies, adding with a laugh that he \"needed a beer\" to watch it.\n\nThe anxiety over Biden was highlighted -- perhaps inadvertently -- by Baldwin's campaign events over the past week. The senator skipped Biden's campaign stop in Madison on Friday, citing a \"scheduling conflict,\" and barely acknowledged the president in her stump speeches, even as she touted the administration's industrial policies, like manufacturing subsidies in the Inflation Reduction Act and Buy American rules she got inserted into the bipartisan infrastructure bill.\n\n\"In the Biden administration, I got permanent Buy American language in the bipartisan infrastructure bill in the Chips and Science Act and the Inflation Reduction Act,\" she said to applause from a crowd of about 40 at the 2nd District Democratic picnic outside Madison on Sunday.\n\nThat was the closest Baldwin came to mentioning the president by name at two separate campaign events over the weekend -- the other one north of Milwaukee -- even as she touted a visit with Secretary of Commerce Gina Raimondo. And at the latter event Sunday, as many establishment Democrats in Washington scrambled to prop up Biden's candidacy, Baldwin refused to say whether she thought the party should switch Biden out for someone else.\n\n\"We don't know what the future holds,\" she told reporters, \"but I am definitely focused on, first of all, winning my own reelection.\"\n\nThe Baldwin and Biden campaigns downplay the senator's moves to distance herself from Biden, with the senator pointing to campaign ads in the past that mentioned the president by name. A Biden campaign official, meanwhile, said that Baldwin was more than 100 miles away on a separate campaign visit and has pledged to appear with the president in the future. But to local Democrats the message of her absence was clear.\n\n\"It's really unfortunate\" that Baldwin skipped out on the Biden event, said Renk, the Assembly candidate outside of Madison. \"But Tammy's got a race to win and she's got to get the vote out here and it's going to be really tough because that excitement is just not there right now with the top of the ticket.\"\n\nStill, Renk and nearly all the Democrats who expressed concern about Biden over the weekend also appear resigned to the fact that he will hang on as the nominee, with many concerned about the chaos that could ensue if the party tried to switch him out so close to the election.\n\n\"It's almost too late for that,\" said Jim Steffens, a retired union letter carrier and Democratic voter outside Madison. Vice President Kamala Harris \"would be the likely next person up and I don't know if she would do any better,\" he added.\n\nSome Biden loyalists, meanwhile, have internalized the campaign's narrative that he just \"had a bad day\" due to fatigue and illness.\n\n\"It broke our heart to see it,\" Assembly candidate Maureen McCarville said of Biden's debate performance at the Sunday picnic outside of Madison. \"I get sinus infections and there are days when I can't crawl out of bed, and I'm not anywhere near his age.\"\n\nMany Biden loyalists were eager to turn the conversation back to Trump, who they feel has escaped scrutiny from the media amid the anxiety of Biden's debate performance.\n\n\"They're both old men,\" said Magnolia Taylor, a wind turbine assembly finisher at Ingeteam, noting that Biden has \"been through a lot\" in recent weeks, like the conviction of his son, Hunter, on gun charges. \"Everybody has a bad day,\" she concluded.\n\nAnd most Democrats in the state pledged to fight on for Biden through November, saying that after the debate performance, their best hope is for a reverse-coattails effect, where the activism of down-ballot candidates convinces voters to hold their nose and vote for Biden as well. With a new legislative map making more state-level seats competitive, that's the strategy candidates like Bird and Renk are clinging to amid the electoral anxiety this summer.\n\n\"Voting for anyone else but Biden -- regardless of how you feel about him -- is a vote for Trump,\" Bird cajoled one undecided voter on Monday, who said she is a Democrat but remained \"indifferent\" about the presidential election. \"So we just have to roll with this for this year, that's how I'm looking at it.\"", "source": {"uri": "politico.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "POLITICO"}, "authors": [],

They had all died within a few days or weeks of Election Day, and so their names stayed on the ballot.\n\nWhat they had in common, apart from being dead, was the partisan tilt of the local electorate. If you lived in Wyoming, you tended to vote Republican, so in this case you reflexively voted for good old Roy Edwards for state rep, who turned out to be deceased. If you lived in Pittsburgh, you voted for longtime Democratic state rep Tony DeLuca, even though he died a month before the election.\n\nIt's a cruel analogy: Joe Biden is alive, but his candidacy is moribund. For now at least, the effort to induce him to step aside in favor of a stronger candidate has been blocked.\n\nSo if Biden is the candidate for president, does the institutional Democratic Party, especially in swing states, have enough energy to turn out voters to support Senate, House, and other down-ballot candidates -- and hope that nearly all will also vote for Joe Biden, however unenthusiastically?\n\nMore from Robert Kuttner\n\nThink of it as reverse coattails. One impressive feat, especially since Trump's election in 2016, has been a massive effort to increase the size and turnout of potential Democratic voters. Most of this has been done outside the institutional Democratic Party, though in a few states such as Wisconsin the party has been a major force.\n\nA model is the New Georgia Project, created by Stacey Abrams in 2013. There are similar efforts in dozens of states, as well as national ones such as the Movement Voter Project. Better turnout on the Democratic side, especially among \"low-propensity\" groups, such as young people and voters of color, far more than winning over swing voters, was key to helping Biden win in 2020 and allowing Democrats to do better than usual in the midterm elections of 2018 and 2022.\n\nThe problem is that it is precisely these voters who are deserting Biden now. \"When people who are not frequent voters are feeling grumpy, they stay home,\" says Michael Podhorzer, former political director of the AFL-CIO. \"But if they decide that Trump is a real threat, maybe they will vote anyway.\" This conclusion is based on detailed analysis that Podhorzer regularly circulates.\n\nEven in states with energizing Senate races, however, such as Arizona, Nevada, Montana, Michigan, and Pennsylvania, the risk remains that Biden will drag down viable Democratic Senate candidates, rather than them pulling him up.\n\nIn the cases where voters elected a dead candidate, most such candidates were obscure. Many voters cast their ballots for them, unaware that they had died.\n\nIn Biden's case, anyone who pays attention to politics is aware of his frailty. In a sense, given the increasing sense that he might not be able to complete a second term, voting for Biden is almost like voting for Kamala Harris.\n\nYet Trump is so odious that voters still might vote for an impaired Biden.

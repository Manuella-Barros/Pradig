DAILY POST reports that Lamorde died on Sunday morning in Egypt, where he had travelled for medical treatment. He was the third Executive Chairman of the anti-graft agency. Lai Mohammed, the immediate past Minister of Information, expressed deep sorrow over the passing of the graft fighter. \"Our paths crossed when as the Minister of Information and Culture, I, along with other top functionaries of government, embarked on an advocacy to the international media, think-tanks and other influential groups, in the wake of the legal tussle between the Federal Government of Nigeria and P&ID in London. \"Even though he wasn\u2019t the EFCC Chairman then, Lamorde displayed an enormous institutional memory that greatly benefited the nation during that unfortunate incident. \"Lamorde was clearheaded and shared the same vision with me that the P&ID saga would not only be won in the court of law but also in the court of public opinion. \"His immense contributions in drafting our talking points and articulating our positions, were instrumental whenever we engaged with the media or various think-tanks in London on the P&ID case. \"His keen insights, deep institutional knowledge, and strategic acumen ensured that our messages were clear, impactful, and aligned with national interests. \"His death is indeed a huge loss not only to his family and colleagues but to the nation in general. He will be profoundly missed. \"Let me express my sincere condolences to the family of Ibrahim Lamorde and colleagues both in the Nigeria Police Force and the EFCC and also pray to God to grant them the fortitude to bear this very huge loss. \"Our thoughts and prayers are with his loved ones. May his soul rest in perfect peace,\" Mohammed said in a statement he personally signed.", "summary": "<img width=\"1280\" height=\"720\" src=\"https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Lai-Mohammed.jpg\" class=\"webfeedsFeaturedVisual wp-post-image\" alt=\"\" style=\"display: block; margin: auto; margin-bottom: 5px;max-width: 100%;\" link_thumbnail=\"\" decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Lai-Mohammed.jpg 1280w, https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Lai-Mohammed-300x169.jpg 300w, https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Lai-Mohammed-1024x576.jpg 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px\" /><p>Former Minister of Information and Culture, Alhaji Lai Mohammed has reacted to the passing of former Chairman of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission, EFCC, Ibrahim Lamorde.

Kiara Advani told the portal that, like many others, she has been there too. There were days she didn't feel like getting out of bed and wanted to stay in. Her friends advised her to leave the bed and refrain from crying over anyone. Advani added that it is okay to cry and let it out, but one should move on and allow other people in.\n\nIn the same interview, Kiara Advani opened up about being in love only once back then. The MS Dhoni actress said that it was the only proper and long relationship she had as they grew up together. At that time, Kiara revealed that she was still friends with the person. At that time, Kiara also dismissed the reports that she was dating Sidharth Malhotra. However, when quizzed if she would date an actor, Kiara answered 'never say never'. The actress didn't want to say anything because she believed she might meet someone in the industry later.\n\nWell, what Kiara Advani said became true, and she is now married to Sidharth Malhotra. The duo tied the knot in a lavish wedding ceremony in 2023 at Rajasthan's Suryagarh Palace. Before their marriage, the couple worked together in Shershaah (2021).\n\nWatch a video on Kiara Advani\n\nOn the work front, Kiara Advani is all set to star in the Telugu film Game Changer.

Kiara is known for her versatility and has demonstrated her acting abilities in films like as Satyaprem Ki Katha and Good News.\n\nShe made her film debut in 2014 with the film Fugly, and she rose to prominence with a minor role in the biopic MS Dhoni: The Untold Story. Kiara is well-known not only for her professional achievements but also for her personal life. She is an active social media user who frequently shares lovely photos and videos with her husband, actor Sidharth Malhotra.\n\nDuring the filming of Shershaah, Kiara fell in love with Sidharth Malhotra. Shershaah is based on the life of Captain Vikram Batra, whose courage and determination were instrumental in winning the Kargil War. In the film, Kiara played Dimple, Vikram Batra's girlfriend.\n\nBhool Bhulaiyaa! 2\n\nKiara demonstrated versatility in this horror-comedy film. Anees Bazmee directed the film, which stars Kartik Aaryan and Tabu in prominent roles and was a hit. Kiara played Reet, a girl from Rajasthan who falls in love with Kartik's character Ruhaan.\n\nSatyaprem Ki Katha\n\nThis is hands down Kiara's best performance to date. In the musical romance drama film, Kiara plays Katha, a Gujarati girl who marries Sattu (played by Kartik Aaryan). Sattu uncovers dark truths about Katha's past, which strains their marriage. Rather than abandoning her, Sattu resolves to do everything in his power to have Katha fall in love with him.\n\nJug Jugg Jeeyo\n\nThe romantic drama film, produced by Karan Johar, follows the lives of Kukkoo (Varun Dhawan) and Naina (Kiara) as they try to inform their parents (Anil Kapoor and Neetu Kapoor) about their difficult relationship and plan to split. The film was directed by Raj Mehta.\n\nGood news.\n\nKiara's comedy-drama is regarded as one of her best works. It follows the lives of two couples with the same surname who attempt in-vitro fertilisation (IVF) and await the arrival of their child.

A few months back, she tied the nuptial knot with Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) leader Raghav Chadha.\n\nDuring an appearance on Raj Shamani's podcast, Parineeti Chopra reflected on her first encounter with her now beau Raghav Chadha. She said, \"We met at an event in London, and usually, I'd just say hi and move on, but this time, I said, 'Let's meet for breakfast'. Including our teams, it was around 8-10 of us, and we met at breakfast the next day. I had no idea who he was or what he did. I literally looked him up after breakfast. I learned about all the work he's done, and we realized, not even in weeks, but in days, that we would get married.\"", "source": {"uri": "news18.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "News18"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_Changer_(film)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Game Changer (film)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kiara_Advani", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kiara Advani"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parineeti_Chopra", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Parineeti Chopra"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_producer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Film producer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Instagram"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dil_Raju", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dil Raju"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ram_Charan", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ram Charan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amar_Singh_Chamkila", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Amar Singh Chamkila"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raghav_Chadha", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Raghav Chadha"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ranveer_Singh", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ranveer Singh"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aam_Aadmi_Party", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Aam Aadmi Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "London"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "London"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Genres", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Genres", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Action-Adventure", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Action-Adventure", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Adventure", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Adventure", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 99}], "image": null, "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9777531", "eventUri": "eng-9777531", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3960784313725489, "wgt": 196, "relevance": 1}

Kiara stated that before she worked with him, she thought he was a 'good-looking boy' and a 'fun person'.\n\nShe added, \"As an actor I liked his work in Hassee Toh Phassee, Kapoor And Sons and a couple of his films. But working with him I realised that there is a side of him which he doesn't show to a lot of people or even if he does, I think that is yet to be explored by people who have not worked with him. He is not someone faffing about behind the monitor, chatting and chilling. He's fun on the set but he constantly likes to have an acting coach with him. I really thought he was just a pretty face before.\"\n\nSidharth also admitted in the same interview that he found Kiara 'interesting' because of her 'non-filmy vibe'. \"I find that refreshing. Maybe because I don't come from this background myself. I come from a working class, middle class Punjabi household in Delhi. So, I find that refreshing and endearing at the same time. Which is where we actually bonded - our attitude towards our work is quite similar. If you meet us travelling the world, people won't be able to guess what our job is.\"\n\nSidharth and Kiara first met at the wrap-up party of her 2018 film Lust Stories. While the pair kept it hush-hush, they were first spotted vacationing together in 2019 in South Africa.

Apart from her amazing acting skills on the silver screen where Kiara is known to portray the girl next door, Kiara Advani has flawless, glowing skin that we can't stop wishing for. If you are also looking for ideas to revamp your beauty routine and get skin just like her, you're in luck! We have compiled a list of 5 hacks and secrets that Kiara has shared about her beauty and skincare routine over the years.\n\nKiara Advani follows a very simple beauty routine in the morning, at the heart of which is knowing the products that work for her skin type. She starts by washing her face with a gentle cleanser that efficiently washes off dirt and grime but at the same time does not strip her skin. Followed by locking that hydration in with a moisturiser. For Kiara, it's a lightweight water-based one that leaves her skin glowing.\n\nIn multiple interviews over the years, Kiara Advani has emphasized the importance of never skipping this crucial step. She always makes sure to add sunblock after her moisturizer or if she does not want to layer too many products on her skin she opts for a moisturizer which has SPF in it.\n\nPinterest\n\nWhen asked about a beauty secret that she absolutely swears by during an interview with an entertainment magazine, Kiara said, \"Take off your makeup, no matter how late it is. It's the most important thing!\" And how right she is! Taking your makeup off at the end of the day is one of the most important steps in your skincare routine to prevent clogging of pores and breakouts.\n\nSharing her favourite beauty hack Kiara said, \"This is a recipe that's come down from my grandmom, and its just one of those home remedies where they mix a couple of things, like a little bit of honey, with a little bit of besan, and milk/cream and lemon and make a paste out of it. I just put on the paste on my face which is quite nice and always makes me feel extremely refreshed after.\" She further went on to suggest everyone to try it sometime.\n\nPinterest\n\nIf you pay attention you'll realise Kiara has always been known to favour the no-makeup makeup look. While yes, she sometimes opts for bright colours, admittedly so she doesn't experiment too much with her makeup.

The actress had shared the story on an episode of Koffee With Karan\n\nKiara Advani and Sidharth Malhotra are one of the most loved couples in Bollywood. As the actress turns a year older on July 31, we revisit her beautiful proposal story in Rome. The actress had appeared on one episode of Koffee With Karan season 8 alongside Vicky Kaushal when she shared the story of how her then-boyfriend and now-husband Sidharth proposed to her. While talking to host Karan Johar on the chat show, Kiara had described how Sidharth had planned a romantic proposal for her in Rome before their wedding.\n\nThe actress said on the show, \"You know when Sid came to that episode (last year's Koffee With Karan episode), we had just come back from Rome where he proposed to me. My parents weren't there. It was our first family holiday with me and his family.\"\n\nKiara added that she had some idea that Sidharth might propose to her on the trip, but she had no clue that it would be at the beginning of the trip.\n\nRecalling the incident, Kiara said, \"I had a little bit of inclination that he would propose. I told him that you have to speak to my parents, and he said, are you kidding me? I said, yeah, you first ask them and take their permission, let's do it the right way. They will be happy. My mom unfortunately had COVID so she couldn't travel with us. So I went with his parents.\"\n\nShershaah dialogues to the rescue\n\nShe added, \"It did come as a surprise because I did not know where on this trip and also in my head, I was like I hope he does propose, because now I've built it up... So it was the first destination we went to on that trip. He took us to this Michelin star restaurant and his nephew was with us who was supposed to take the photos and capture the moment. I was sleepy because I had just landed and joined them on this trip. So, I was really tired. And he has planned the works. He has done this candle-light dinner on top. We go back after dinner. He takes me up for a walk and suddenly a violinist comes out of the bushes playing and sweetly his nephew taking our video from the bushes and Sid goes on one knee and proposes.\"\n\nIt was a quite a filmi proposal as Sidharth used dialogues from their film Shershaah to propose to Kiara. \"I was so overwhelmed. Then he starts saying the lines of Shershaah He's like, Dilli ka seedha saadha launda hun (I am a simple boy from Delhi) with the full dialogues of Shershaah and I burst out laughing,\" Kiara said recalling the incident.", "source": {"uri": "mid-day.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "mid-day"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Koffee_with_Karan", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Koffee with Karan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kiara_Advani", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kiara Advani"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sidharth_Malhotra", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sidharth Malhotra"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rome", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rome"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Rome"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romance_film", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Romance film"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindi_cinema", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hindi cinema"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vicky_Kaushal", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Vicky Kaushal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karan_Johar", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Karan Johar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shershaah", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Shershaah"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filmi", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Filmi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delhi", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Delhi"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Delhi"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Romance", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Romance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://images.mid-day.com/images/images/2024/jul/sidkiara-enttop_d.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9777531", "eventUri": "eng-9777531", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-31", "textStart": 273, "textEnd": 280}], "sentiment": 0.2470588235294118, "wgt": 174, "relevance": 1}

Later, she sipped from a Cinderella cup while posing for the camera.\n\nThe video has garnered immense love from netizens. \"Aww, so cute,\" commented a social media user. Another wrote, \"Baby Kiara is adorable.\" Have a look:\n\nSatyaprem Ki Katha, also starring actor Kartik Aaryan, marked Kiara's last silver screen outing. Directed by Sameer Vidwans, the film performed moderately well at the Box Office. It was produced by Nadiadwala Grandson Entertainment and Namah Pictures. Kiara was nominated for Best Actress at the 69th Filmfare Awards for her role as Katha Kapadia in the romantic drama.\n\nShe will next take cinemas by storm with Game Changer, featuring Ram Charan in triple roles. The political action thriller is directed by S Shankar and is scheduled to be released in December 2024. The ensemble cast includes Anjali, SJ Suryah, Srikanth, Jayaram, Sunil, Samuthirakani and Nassar. The storyline of the flick reportedly revolves around an IAS officer who is on a mission against corrupt politicians by batting for fair elections. He leaves no stone unturned to transform the working ways of the government.", "source": {"uri": "news9live.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "News9live"}, "authors": [{"uri": "raghav_jaitly@news9live.com", "name": "Raghav Jaitly", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindi_cinema", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hindi cinema"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shershaah", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Shershaah"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kiara_Advani", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kiara Advani"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Film"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Delhi", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New Delhi"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New Delhi"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satyaprem_Ki_Katha", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Satyaprem Ki Katha"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kartik_Aaryan", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kartik Aaryan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cinderella", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cinderella"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_Changer_(film)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Game Changer (film)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S._J._Suryah", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "S.

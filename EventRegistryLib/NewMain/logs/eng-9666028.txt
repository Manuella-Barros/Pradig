After getting outscored 13-1 from late in Game 3 to basically midway through Game 5, after losing 8-1 in their last trip to Edmonton and falling at home on Tuesday night, the Panthers still lead the series. Nobody, if offered the chance to be in this spot on the first day of camp back in the fall, would have declined.\n\n\"It's still 3-2,\" Maurice said.\n\nSure, Edmonton has done what it must do. It has fended off elimination twice. It has sent the series back to Alberta and will have a chance in front of its own rowdy, delirious, Cup-starved fans to try to force the ultimate -- a Game 7 -- in Florida that would be played Monday night. The Panthers are tipping their caps, yet they still believe they can make the change they need to finish this thing off.\n\n\"I think we were gripping the sticks a little tight,\" Panthers forward Sam Bennett acknowledged after Game 5. \"We wanted it a little too bad tonight. ... We've just got to win one game. It's as simple as that.\"\n\nThere are most certainly things for the Panthers to clean up. Nobody was pleased with how, on the heels of losing 8-1, they got into a 3-0 hole to start things in Game 5. They have been outscored on their own power plays 2-1, which is inexcusable on a number of levels.\n\nThere's also things to like.

(AP) -- Florida coach Paul Maurice sat behind a microphone again on Wednesday, giving his daily news conference even though basically nothing new had happened in the 13 hours between then and the last time he spoke to reporters.\n\nHe took a bunch of questions. He also had one to ask.\n\n\"How can I be the only person in a decent mood here today?\" Maurice asked, sort of rhetorically, sort of seriously.\n\nYes, the Panthers have lost their last two games and gotten embarrassed in one of them. Yes, they've wasted two chances to win the Stanley Cup. Yes, a 3-0 lead in the title series against the Edmonton Oilers is down to 3-2, after the Panthers lost Game 5 on home ice 5-3 on Tuesday night. Yes, Game 6 is in Edmonton on Friday night and, yes, Oilers star Connor McDavid just had back-to-back games the likes of which have never been seen in the Cup final before.\n\nNo, that doesn't mean the Panthers are worried about wilting under pressure.\n\n\"You're going to think I'm lying to you,\" Maurice said. \"I'm more comfortable. I understand the feeling of 3-2 because most series are like that; 3-0 is more of an aberration, isn't it? Pressure. I think we think about these things possibly differently and I'm not sure I would agree with the assessment that the pressure has shifted so heavily to us.\"\n\nForget the on-ice matters for a moment. Just about every historical stat that Maurice can show his team before it boards another flight to Edmonton on Thursday says the trends over time show that Florida should be liking its chances:\n\n-- The Panthers won Game 1. Game 1 winners win the Cup 76% of the time.\n\n-- They led the series 2-0. Teams in that situation win the Cup at a 91% rate.\n\n-- They led the series 3-0. The Cup rate there: 96%.\n\n-- They led 3-1. Cup rate in that situation: 97%.\n\n-- They lead 3-2. Cup rate in that situation: 81%. After getting outscored 13-1 from late in Game 3 to basically midway through Game 5, after losing 8-1 in their last trip to Edmonton and falling at home on Tuesday night, the Panthers still lead the series. Nobody, if offered the chance to be in this spot on the first day of camp back in the fall, would have declined.\n\n\"It's still 3-2,\" Maurice said.\n\nSure, Edmonton has done what it must do. It has fended off elimination twice. It has sent the series back to Alberta and will have a chance in front of its own rowdy, delirious, Cup-starved fans to try to force the ultimate -- a Game 7 -- in Florida that would be played Monday night. The Panthers are tipping their caps, yet they still believe they can make the change they need to finish this thing off.\n\n\"I think we were gripping the sticks a little tight,\" Panthers forward Sam Bennett acknowledged after Game 5. \"We wanted it a little too bad tonight. ... We've just got to win one game. It's as simple as that.\"\n\nThere are most certainly things for the Panthers to clean up. Nobody was pleased with how, on the heels of losing 8-1, they got into a 3-0 hole to start things in Game 5.

(AP) - Florida coach Paul Maurice sat behind a microphone again on Wednesday, giving his daily news conference even though basically nothing new had happened in the 13 hours between then and the last time he spoke to reporters.\n\nHe took a bunch of questions. He also had one to ask.\n\n\"How can I be the only person in a decent mood here today?\" Maurice asked, sort of rhetorically, sort of seriously.\n\nYes, the Panthers have lost their last two games and gotten embarrassed in one of them. Yes, they've wasted two chances to win the Stanley Cup. Yes, a 3-0 lead in the title series against the Edmonton Oilers is down to 3-2, after the Panthers lost Game 5 on home ice 5-3 on Tuesday night. Yes, Game 6 is in Edmonton on Friday night and, yes, Oilers star Connor McDavid just had back-to-back games the likes of which have never been seen in the Cup final before.\n\nNo, that doesn't mean the Panthers are worried about wilting under pressure.\n\n\"You're going to think I'm lying to you,\" Maurice said. \"I'm more comfortable. I understand the feeling of 3-2 because most series are like that; 3-0 is more of an aberration, isn't it? Pressure. I think we think about these things possibly differently and I'm not sure I would agree with the assessment that the pressure has shifted so heavily to us.\"\n\nFlorida Panthers head coach Paul Maurice leaves a news conference following Game 5 of the NHL hockey Stanley Cup Finals against the Edmonton Oilers, Tuesday, June 18, 2024, in Sunrise, Fla. The Oilers defeated the Panthers 5-3. (AP Photo/Rebecca Blackwell)\n\nForget the on-ice matters for a moment. Just about every historical stat that Maurice can show his team before it boards another flight to Edmonton on Thursday says the trends over time show that Florida should be liking its chances:\n\n- The Panthers won Game 1. Game 1 winners win the Cup 76% of the time.\n\n- They led the series 2-0. Teams in that situation win the Cup at a 91% rate.\n\n- They led the series 3-0. The Cup rate there: 96%.\n\n- They led 3-1. Cup rate in that situation: 97%.\n\n- They lead 3-2. Cup rate in that situation: 81%. After getting outscored 13-1 from late in Game 3 to basically midway through Game 5, after losing 8-1 in their last trip to Edmonton and falling at home on Tuesday night, the Panthers still lead the series. Nobody, if offered the chance to be in this spot on the first day of camp back in the fall, would have declined.\n\n\"It's still 3-2,\" Maurice said.\n\nSure, Edmonton has done what it must do. It has fended off elimination twice. It has sent the series back to Alberta and will have a chance in front of its own rowdy, delirious, Cup-starved fans to try to force the ultimate - a Game 7 - in Florida that would be played Monday night. The Panthers are tipping their caps, yet they still believe they can make the change they need to finish this thing off.\n\n\"I think we were gripping the sticks a little tight,\" Panthers forward Sam Bennett acknowledged after Game 5. \"We wanted it a little too bad tonight. ... We've just got to win one game. It's as simple as that.\"\n\nThere are most certainly things for the Panthers to clean up. Nobody was pleased with how, on the heels of losing 8-1, they got into a 3-0 hole to start things in Game 5. They have been outscored on their own power plays 2-1, which is inexcusable on a number of levels.\n\nThere's also things to like. That's what Maurice is preaching now, with only one or two games left in the season.\n\n\"Our 5-on-5 game was as good last night as it's been all series,\" Maurice said. \"That gets you out of bed and gets you ready for Game 6.\"\n\nAP NHL playoffs: https://apnews.com/hub/stanley-cup and https://www.apnews.com/hub/NHL\n\nFlorida Panthers head coach Paul Maurice stands during the first period of Game 5 of the NHL hockey Stanley Cup Finals against the Edmonton Oilers, Tuesday, June 18, 2024, in Sunrise, Fla.

I'm not rubbing backs. I don't think we need that at all. Everybody feels probably exactly the way I do right now. I'm not feeling deflated, neither is the hockey team. They're not feeling deflated. A little grumpy.\"\n\nAfter going up 3-0 in the series, the Panthers lost Game 4 on the road in Edmonton by the score of 8-1. That game was not very competitive from the start. There was not much panic, as the Panthers had a chance to clinch the Stanley Cup on home ice with a win in Game 5. That did not happen, as Florida's comeback attempt in Game 5 fell short and the Oilers came away with a 5-3 win to force Game 6.\n\nThe Panthers as a team do not seem worried about losing two straight, but confidence is building with the Oilers, and there is some nervousness beginning to rise for Florida's fans. After the Oilers scored an empty net goal to seal Game 5, frustration boiled over for Panthers general manager Bill Zito, as he threw a water bottle when the puck went into the net. His team hopes to stop those frustrations in Game 6 with a win that clinches the first Stanley Cup in franchise history.\n\nPanthers going in with same mindset as before\n\nAlthough the Oilers have closed the gap in the series to 3-2, the Panthers are still going into Game 6 with the same mindset that they did going into Game 3. Matthew Tkachuk admitted that the comeback falling short in Game 5 was frustrating, but confirmed that the mindset does not change for his team.\n\n\"We've got another crack at it on Friday,\" Matthew Tkachuk said, via Wyshynski. \"We did a really good job at the beginning of the series of building that lead, so really nothing changes from tonight's mindset. We're up 3-2 going back to Edmonton. Couple days to get ready to go for that and get back healthy and rested and ready to go.\"\n\nThe Panthers identified that they have to be better when it comes to the power play and not allowing short-handed goals. The Oilers got on the board with short-handed goals in Games 4 and 5. It was a tone setter in both games.\n\nStarting off better in Game 6 will be key. Another bad start from the Panthers would have the Oilers fans fired up, and pressure would mount even more as the team tries to avoid blowing a 3-0 series lead in the Stanley Cup Final.", "source": {"uri": "clutchpoints.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ClutchPoints"}, "authors": [{"uri": "ryan_bologna@clutchpoints.com", "name": "Ryan Bologna", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Maurice", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Paul Maurice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanley_Cup_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Stanley Cup Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edmonton", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Edmonton"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Edmonton"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida_Panthers", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Florida Panthers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanley_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stanley Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edmonton_Oilers", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Edmonton Oilers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "ESPN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_coach", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Head coach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Zito", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bill Zito"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matthew_Tkachuk", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Matthew Tkachuk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hockey_puck", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hockey puck"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_manager", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "General manager"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Short-handed", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Short-handed"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Browser_Based", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Browser Based", "wgt": 30}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Downloads", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Downloads", "wgt": 28}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Computer_Platforms", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Computer Platforms", "wgt": 28}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Developers_and_Publishers", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Developers and Publishers", "wgt": 30}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Resources", "label": "dmoz/Games/Resources", "wgt": 28}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://wp.clutchpoints.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Panthers-news-Paul-Maurice-drops-grumpy-truth-bomb-after-Game-5-defeat.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9666028", "eventUri": "eng-9666028", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.05882352941176472, "wgt": 188, "relevance": 1}

It will be a rare team for all seasons, too.\n\nLet's explain: Summer began in the Northern Hemisphere on Thursday. That makes this the fourth time in the last five years that the NHL season has stretched into the summer months and the sixth time that it\u00b4s happened in league history.\n\nBut the Panthers or Oilers - or both - will join a very short list of teams to win games in fall, winter, spring and summer in the same NHL season.\n\n\"We\u00b4re incredibly lucky, for sure,\" Panthers forward Ryan Lomberg said. \"We were talking about the other day, that teams that haven't made the playoffs have been at home for a couple months now.\"\n\nThe first two instances of Cup final games getting played in summer - 1995 and 2013 - were because those seasons started late due to labor strife and no games were played in the fall. The 2019-20 season started in the fall 2019 and ended in the fall 2020, but saw no games played in spring 2020 because of the COVID-19 pandemic. The 2020-21 season stretched into summer but didn\u00b4t start until mid-January so, again, no fall games were played.\n\nEdmonton Oilers fans react to a goal as they watch coverage of Game 5 of the NHL hockey Stanley Cup Final between the Oilers and the Florida Panthers, Tuesday, June 18, 2024, in Edmonton, Alberta. (Jason Franson/The Canadian Press via AP)\n\nThere have been two teams in NHL history - the 2021-22 Colorado Avalanche and Tampa Bay Lightning - to win games in fall, winter, spring and summer in the same season. That year's schedule saw a slew of postponements because of the pandemic and the Stanley Cup Final stretched into the summer. Colorado went 2-1, Tampa Bay 1-2 following the June solstice that year.\n\nThe winner of Friday's Game 6 of this year's Cup final in Edmonton will become the third team in NHL history to win a game in fall, winter, spring and summer in the same hockey season. (And if it's the Oilers, that means the Panthers will have another chance to join that list in Sunrise, Florida, on Monday night in Game 7.)\n\nFor the record, if we look at the actual meteorological seasons within this hockey season, the Panthers and Oilers have been relatively close record-wise all year:\n\nGames played in the fall - Florida 18-12-3, Edmonton 14-15-1.\n\nGames played in the winter - Edmonton 27-6-4, Florida 27-7-2. (No team had a better record in the winter months this season than the Oilers and Panthers did.)\n\nGames played in the spring, including playoffs - Florida 22-12-3, Edmonton 22-15-2.\n\n\"Incredibly lucky and fortunate to be in this position,\" Lomberg said.\n\nThe only time the Stanley Cup has been handed out later in the calendar year has been seasons affected by a strike, lockout or the pandemic. The last time the Oilers won it, in 1990, it was May 24.\n\nEvander Kane, who has been scratched the past three games because of the sports hernia he had been playing through, took part in Oilers practice on a fifth line, which would indicate he is not penciled in to play in Game 6.\n\nCoach Kris Knoblauch was not ready to make any declarations, consistent with his behavior throughout the series, saying he had not yet talked to athletic trainer T.D. Forss to see how Kane was feeling.\n\n\"We have got some things to think about,\" Knoblauch said. \"But we have possibilities.\"\n\nBoth teams are 2-0 in Game 6 so far in these playoffs. Edmonton beat Vancouver 5-1 and Dallas 2-1; Florida beat Boston and the New York Rangers, each time by a score of 2-1.\n\nAll-time, Edmonton is 17-9 in Game 6 and 10-7 at home in Game 6s. Florida is 6-3 all-time in the sixth game of a series, 2-3 when that contest is on the road.\n\nOne team will set a record, the other will tie a record on Friday.\n\nGame 6 of the Stanley Cup Final is Edmonton's 106th contest of the season, tying the 2005-06 Oilers for the most in a season (including playoffs) in franchise history.\n\nIt will be the 105th of the season for the Panthers. That's a Florida single-season record; the 1995-96 Panthers played 104 games.\n\nThe NHL record for games in a season is 108, done on six occasions, most recently by the St. Louis Blues in their 2018-19 Stanley Cup title season.\n\nReynolds reported from Fort Lauderdale, Florida.\n\nAP NHL playoffs: https://apnews.com/hub/stanley-cup and https://www.apnews.com/hub/NHL\n\nFlorida Panthers fans Jessyca and Joseph Grella of Hollywood, Fla., arrive at the arena before Game 5 of the NHL hockey Stanley Cup Finals against the Edmonton Oilers, Tuesday, June 18, 2024, in Sunrise, Fla.

Game 6 of Oilers vs Panthers goes Friday night at Rogers Place. The puck drops at 8:00 pm ET on ABC and ESPN.\n\nWith Florida leading the series 3-2, we've locked in our Oilers vs Panthers prediction for Friday night. We're taking advantage of the underdog value on the road team despite Connor McDavid's individual brilliance.\n\nBelow, find our Oilers vs Panthers prediction, plus a breakdown of the betting odds.\n\nOur Oilers vs Panthers prediction takes into account the entire series to date as well as Florida's remarkable performance on the road this postseason.\n\nThe Stanley Cup Final initially looked like it would be a blowout, but the Oilers have rallied from a 3-0 series deficit to make it 3-2. Edmonton won 5-3 in Florida on Tuesday night to stave off elimination for the second straight game.\n\nThe major Cup Final storyline right now is the play of Connor McDavid, who is heavily favored in the Conn Smythe odds after recording consecutive 4-point games. The Panthers need to slow him down to have any chance of closing this series out in six games.\n\nPart of the reason why McDavid is torching Florida is the regression of Cats goalie Sergei Bobrovsky. After a strong start to the series, the former Vezina winner has allowed 13 goals in his past two starts, getting pulled in the second period of Game 4.\n\nAlthough they've allowed at least five goals in consecutive games, the Panthers typically bounce back well after defensive showings. They are 5-1 in their last six when their opponent nets 5+ goals in the previous game. We think they get the job done in Game 6.\n\nThe atmosphere in Edmonton will be electric, as the Oilers look to become the fourth team in NHL history to force a Game 7 after being down 3-0. The Oilers are 4-0 when facing elimination this postseason and have won the last two Game 6s at Rogers Place.\n\nStill, this is far from a guaranteed victory considering the Panthers are 7-3 on the road this postseason. While Edmonton has picked up some clutch victories at home, they are still only 7-4 overall at Rogers Place in these playoffs.\n\nWith the public hammering Edmonton in the NHL public betting trends, we're taking advantage of Florida's plus-money value. The Panthers had a 24-10 edge in scoring chances last game and outshot Edmonton 10-3 in the final frame. The team has garnered some momentum and won't be intimidated by the road environment.\n\nMatthew Tkachuk had his best game of the Final in Game 5, and we project the team's other veterans, Sasha Barkov, Sam Reinhart, and Bobrovsky to step up in a big way to deliver the Cats the Cup. This veteran-laden team is too experienced and talented to lose a third straight game.\n\nOilers vs Panthers Pick:\n\nThe Oilers are the favorites to win Game 6 at home, with a moneyline of -120. This means you would need to bet $120 on Edmonton to win $100 if they come out on top. The -120 odds give the Oilers an implied probability of 54.55% to win the game.\n\nOn the flip side, the Panthers are the underdogs at +100 odds (even money). A $100 bet on Florida would net you a $100 profit if they pull off the road upset. The Panthers' moneyline odds translate to a 50% implied probability of winning.\n\nPart of the reason we are backing Florida in this game is due to their plus-money value. The Cats have only been available at plus-money three times all postseason, going 2-1 in those contests. Cash is already coming in on them Friday, with some sportsbooks now listing Florida with negative odds.\n\nIf you're looking at the puck line, the Oilers are favored by 1.5 goals. They're +215 to win by 2 or more, while the Panthers are -265 to keep it within a goal. Betting the puck line is riskier but offers a bigger payout if you're confident in the Oilers.\n\nThe over/under for total goals is set at 5.5, with the over at -105 odds and the under at -115. With the way these two teams have been scoring lately, the over might be tempting. Games 3-5 all had 7 or more goals.\n\nThe Florida Panthers vs Edmonton Oilers injury report is light, with Evander Kane the only active player listed. The Oilers' forward missed the last game with an abdomen injury and is questionable for Friday's Game 6.\n\nThe Panthers, meanwhile, don't have any injuries but will be inserting Nick Cousins into the Game 6 lineup in favor of veteran Kyle Okposo. In 11 games this postseason, the 30-year-old Cousins has one assist.", "source": {"uri": "sportsbettingdime.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sports Betting Dime"}, "authors": [{"uri": "brady_trettenero@sportsbettingdime.com", "name": "Brady Trettenero", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rogers_Place", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rogers Place"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connor_McDavid", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Connor McDavid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanley_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Stanley Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edmonton", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Edmonton"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Edmonton"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanley_Cup_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stanley Cup Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sergei_Bobrovsky", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sergei Bobrovsky"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conn_Smythe", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Conn Smythe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida_Panthers", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Florida Panthers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edmonton_Oilers", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Edmonton Oilers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Hockey_League", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National Hockey League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Broadcasting_Company", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "American Broadcasting Company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "ESPN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vezina_Trophy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Vezina Trophy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aleksander_Barkov", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Aleksander Barkov"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sam_Reinhart", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sam Reinhart"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nick_Cousins", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nick Cousins"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matthew_Tkachuk", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Matthew Tkachuk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyle_Okposo", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kyle Okposo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evander_Kane", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Evander Kane"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forward_(ice_hockey)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Forward (ice hockey)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Browser_Based", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Browser Based", "wgt": 26}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Downloads", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Downloads", "wgt": 24}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Computer_Platforms", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Computer Platforms", "wgt": 24}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Developers_and_Publishers", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Developers and Publishers", "wgt": 25}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Resources", "label": "dmoz/Games/Resources", "wgt": 24}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://cdn.sportsbettingdime.com/app/uploads/media/4/USATSI_23577142.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9666028", "eventUri": "eng-9666028", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2627450980392156, "wgt": 186, "relevance": 1}

It will be a rare team for all seasons, too.\n\nLet's explain: Summer began in the Northern Hemisphere on Thursday. That makes this the fourth time in the last five years that the NHL season has stretched into the summer months and the sixth time that it's happened in league history.\n\nBut the Panthers or Oilers -- or both -- will join a very short list of teams to win games in fall, winter, spring and summer in the same NHL season.\n\n\"We're incredibly lucky, for sure,\" Panthers forward Ryan Lomberg said. \"We were talking about the other day, that teams that haven't made the playoffs have been at home for a couple months now.\"\n\nThe first two instances of Cup final games getting played in summer -- 1995 and 2013 -- were because those seasons started late due to labor strife and no games were played in the fall. The 2019-20 season started in the fall 2019 and ended in the fall 2020, but saw no games played in spring 2020 because of the COVID-19 pandemic. The 2020-21 season stretched into summer but didn't start until mid-January so, again, no fall games were played.\n\nThere have been two teams in NHL history -- the 2021-22 Colorado Avalanche and Tampa Bay Lightning -- to win games in fall, winter, spring and summer in the same season. That year's schedule saw a slew of postponements because of the pandemic and the Stanley Cup Final stretched into the summer. Colorado went 2-1, Tampa Bay 1-2 following the June solstice that year.\n\nThe winner of Friday's Game 6 of this year's Cup final in Edmonton will become the third team in NHL history to win a game in fall, winter, spring and summer in the same hockey season. (And if it's the Oilers, that means the Panthers will have another chance to join that list in Sunrise, Florida, on Monday night in Game 7.)\n\nFor the record, if we look at the actual meteorological seasons within this hockey season, the Panthers and Oilers have been relatively close record-wise all year:\n\nGames played in the fall -- Florida 18-12-3, Edmonton 14-15-1.\n\nGames played in the winter -- Edmonton 27-6-4, Florida 27-7-2. (No team had a better record in the winter months this season than the Oilers and Panthers did.)\n\nGames played in the spring, including playoffs -- Florida 22-12-3, Edmonton 22-15-2.\n\n\"Incredibly lucky and fortunate to be in this position,\" Lomberg said.\n\nThe only time the Stanley Cup has been handed out later in the calendar year has been seasons affected by a strike, lockout or the pandemic. The last time the Oilers won it, in 1990, it was May 24.\n\nKane skates\n\nEvander Kane, who has been scratched the past three games because of the sports hernia he had been playing through, took part in Oilers practice on a fifth line, which would indicate he is not penciled in to play in Game 6.\n\nCoach Kris Knoblauch was not ready to make any declarations, consistent with his behavior throughout the series, saying he had not yet talked to athletic trainer T.D. Forss to see how Kane was feeling.\n\n\"We have got some things to think about,\" Knoblauch said. \"But we have possibilities.\"\n\nGame 6 History\n\nBoth teams are 2-0 in Game 6 so far in these playoffs. Edmonton beat Vancouver 5-1 and Dallas 2-1; Florida beat Boston and the New York Rangers, each time by a score of 2-1.\n\nAll-time, Edmonton is 17-9 in Game 6 and 10-7 at home in Game 6s. Florida is 6-3 all-time in the sixth game of a series, 2-3 when that contest is on the road.\n\nLong Season\n\nOne team will set a record, the other will tie a record on Friday.\n\nGame 6 of the Stanley Cup Final is Edmonton's 106th contest of the season, tying the 2005-06 Oilers for the most in a season (including playoffs) in franchise history.\n\nIt will be the 105th of the season for the Panthers. That's a Florida single-season record; the 1995-96 Panthers played 104 games.\n\nThe NHL record for games in a season is 108, done on six occasions, most recently by the St. Louis Blues in their 2018-19 Stanley Cup title season.\n\nReynolds reported from Fort Lauderdale, Florida.", "source": {"uri": "nj.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NJ.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

It will be a rare team for all seasons, too.\n\nLet's explain: Summer began in the Northern Hemisphere on Thursday. That makes this the fourth time in the last five years that the NHL season has stretched into the summer months and the sixth time that it's happened in league history.\n\nBut the Panthers or Oilers -- or both -- will join a very short list of teams to win games in fall, winter, spring and summer in the same NHL season.\n\n\"We're incredibly lucky, for sure,\" Panthers forward Ryan Lomberg said. \"We were talking about the other day, that teams that haven't made the playoffs have been at home for a couple months now.\"\n\nThe first two instances of Cup final games getting played in summer -- 1995 and 2013 -- were because those seasons started late due to labor strife and no games were played in the fall. The 2019-20 season started in the fall 2019 and ended in the fall 2020, but saw no games played in spring 2020 because of the COVID-19 pandemic. The 2020-21 season stretched into summer but didn't start until mid-January so, again, no fall games were played.\n\nThere have been two teams in NHL history -- the 2021-22 Colorado Avalanche and Tampa Bay Lightning -- to win games in fall, winter, spring and summer in the same season. That year's schedule saw a slew of postponements because of the pandemic and the Stanley Cup Final stretched into the summer. Colorado went 2-1, Tampa Bay 1-2 following the June solstice that year.\n\nThe winner of Friday's Game 6 of this year's Cup final in Edmonton will become the third team in NHL history to win a game in fall, winter, spring and summer in the same hockey season. (And if it's the Oilers, that means the Panthers will have another chance to join that list in Sunrise, Florida, on Monday night in Game 7.)\n\nFor the record, if we look at the actual meteorological seasons within this hockey season, the Panthers and Oilers have been relatively close record-wise all year:\n\nGames played in the fall -- Florida 18-12-3, Edmonton 14-15-1.\n\nGames played in the winter -- Edmonton 27-6-4, Florida 27-7-2. (No team had a better record in the winter months this season than the Oilers and Panthers did.)\n\nGames played in the spring, including playoffs -- Florida 22-12-3, Edmonton 22-15-2.\n\n\"Incredibly lucky and fortunate to be in this position,\" Lomberg said.\n\nThe only time the Stanley Cup has been handed out later in the calendar year has been seasons affected by a strike, lockout or the pandemic. The last time the Oilers won it, in 1990, it was May 24.\n\nEvander Kane, who has been scratched the past three games because of the sports hernia he had been playing through, took part in Oilers practice on a fifth line, which would indicate he is not penciled in to play in Game 6.\n\nCoach Kris Knoblauch was not ready to make any declarations, consistent with his behavior throughout the series, saying he had not yet talked to athletic trainer T.D. Forss to see how Kane was feeling.\n\n\"We have got some things to think about,\" Knoblauch said. \"But we have possibilities.\"\n\nBoth teams are 2-0 in Game 6 so far in these playoffs. Edmonton beat Vancouver 5-1 and Dallas 2-1; Florida beat Boston and the New York Rangers, each time by a score of 2-1.\n\nAll-time, Edmonton is 17-9 in Game 6 and 10-7 at home in Game 6s. Florida is 6-3 all-time in the sixth game of a series, 2-3 when that contest is on the road.\n\nOne team will set a record, the other will tie a record on Friday.\n\nGame 6 of the Stanley Cup Final is Edmonton's 106th contest of the season, tying the 2005-06 Oilers for the most in a season (including playoffs) in franchise history.\n\nIt will be the 105th of the season for the Panthers. That's a Florida single-season record; the 1995-96 Panthers played 104 games.\n\nThe NHL record for games in a season is 108, done on six occasions, most recently by the St. Louis Blues in their 2018-19 Stanley Cup title season.\n\nReynolds reported from Fort Lauderdale, Florida.\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2024 The Associated Press.

Edmonton lost the first three games of the series but have posted back-to-back victories to become just the fourth team in NHL history to force a Game 6 when down 0-3 in the Stanely Cup Final. The Oilers are 4-0 when facing elimination this postseason and won Game 6 at home in each of their previous two series. The Panthers haven't lost three straight contests since enduring a four-game slide from March 14-23.\n\nOpening faceoff at Rogers Place is set for 8 p.m. ET. Edmonton is a -120 favorite (risk $120 to win $100) in the latest Oilers vs. Panthers odds, while the over/under for total goals scored is 5.5. Before making any Panthers vs. Oilers picks, you need to check out the NHL predictions from the SportsLine Projection Model.\n\nSportsLine's model simulates every NHL game 10,000 times, taking into account factors like current form, individual matchups, injuries and short- and long-term trends when making NHL picks. It entered the 2024 Stanley Cup Final on a 7-4 run on top-rated puck-line picks.\n\nNow, the model has set its sights on Oilers vs. Panthers and just locked in its NHL picks and Stanley Cup Final predictions. You can visit SportsLine now to see the picks. Here are the latest NHL odds and trends for Panthers vs. Oilers:\n\nOilers vs. Panthers money line: Edmonton -120, Florida +100Oilers vs. Panthers over/under: 5.5 goalsOilers vs. Panthers puck line: Edmonton -1.5 (+212)EDM: The Oilers have outscored Florida 15-4 over the last seven periods\n\nFLA: The Panthers have allowed 13 goals in the last two games after yielding 12 over six contests against the New York Rangers\n\nOilers vs. Panthers picks: See picks at SportsLineWhy you should back the Oilers\n\nSuperstar Connor McDavid has taken over the Stanley Cup Final, recording back-to-back four-point performances after notching a total of three points over the first three games of the series. The 27-year-old center registered a goal and two assists in the second period of Game 5 to become the first in history with two three-point sessions in one Stanley Cup Final. He joined Bernie Geoffrion and Stan Mikita as the only players with multiple three-point periods in the Stanley Cup Final over their careers. McDavid has 11 points in this series, the most in a Stanley Cup Final since Daniel Briere amassed 12 for the Philadelphia Flyers in 2010 and two shy of the record set in 1988 by legendary former Oiler Wayne Gretzky.\n\nMcDavid is the top scorer this postseason with 42 points and needs five to the mark established by Gretzky in 1985. Edmonton's captain already has set the record for most assists in one playoff year with 34. With the Oilers facing elimination this postseason, McDavid has produced three goals and eight assists in four contests. Defenseman Evan Bouchard also has set a playoff record as he notched three assists in Game 5 to increase his total to 26 and pass former Oiler Paul Coffey (25 in 1985) for most in one postseason. See who to back at SportsLine.\n\nWhy you should back the Panthers\n\nFlorida has won each of the previous four playoff series in which it took a 3-0 lead. Evan Rodrigues has been the Panthers' top offensive player in this series with four goals and two assists. The 30-year-old center, who netted only three tallies in 17 games over the first three rounds of the playoffs, has landed on the scoresheet in five of his last six contests dating back to Game 6 of the Eastern Conference Final against the New York Rangers.\n\nMatthew Tkachuk leads the Panthers with 22 points, two shy of the franchise record he set last postseason. The 26-year-old left wing is coming off a two-point effort after having amassed the same amount over his previous seven contests. Captain Aleksander Barkov is right behind Tkachuk with 21 points and has posted eight two-point performances, the most by a Panther in one postseason.

The biggest thing the Panthers have going against them is they don't possess Connor McDavid, who has completely taken over this final round with back-to-back four-point games.\n\nThe danger now is if the Panthers start thinking about history. Teams with a 3-0 series lead in a best-of-seven Stanley Cup Final own an all-time record of 27-1. The only team in NHL history to choke away a 3-0 Cup Final series lead was the 1942 Detroit Red Wings at the hands of the Toronto Maple Leafs.\n\n\"The Oilers are thinking about history, and that's a good thing, but if the Panthers start thinking about it, it's a very bad thing,\" said ABC color analyst Ray Ferraro, who played 1,258 games in his NHL career, after Tuesday's 5-3 Oilers win. \"I'm no coach. But I would say, 'Guys, whatever we hear, let's not hear it. Let's not listen to it. Let's not evaluate it. We're going to look at the film. We'll talk about what we need to fix.'\n\n\"But I think you have to almost pull in tight and go, 'It is us against everybody.'\"\n\nEverything that was going right for the Panthers in the first three games of this series has completely turned upside down.\n\nThey're taking undisciplined, momentum-stopping penalties and then are unable to kill them, which happened twice on Tuesday. They're giving up short-handed goals, which happened almost immediately in Game 5 for the second consecutive game. They're unable to stymie the sport's most electrifying player in McDavid, who has gone into video-game mode and now has a ridiculous 42 points in the playoffs. And Sergei Bobrovsky, their impenetrable goaltender in the first eight periods of this series, has now given up 11 goals in the last five and a half periods he has played.\n\nWalking around a quiet Panthers locker room after the team couldn't complete a comeback from a pair of three-goal deficits Tuesday, it was clear there's an uptightness and an uneasiness about what is going on here -- the prospect of not getting this done Friday night in Edmonton and potentially blowing all their hard work throughout the postseason and in the beginning of this series, which now feels like it started two months ago.\n\n\"It's tough, especially at this stage of where you're at in the series,\" said Matthew Tkachuk, who scored for the first time since May 22. \"We've got another crack at it on Friday. We did a really good job at the beginning of the series of building that lead, so really nothing changes from tonight's mindset. We're up 3-2 going back to Edmonton.\"\n\nFor the Panthers to win, Maurice said they must stay out of the box.\n\nEvery time they pushed in Game 5, they took a penalty. The Panthers went the final 14:01 of the first period without a shot but were so close to getting out of the period down only a goal after Connor Brown scored short-handed, then Niko Mikkola took an interference penalty and gave Edmonton's vaunted power play two minutes of man-advantage time on fresh ice to open the second.\n\nZach Hyman scored with two seconds left in the power play. Then the Panthers pulled within two and were all over the Oilers when Kyle Okposo took a hooking penalty. Corey Perry scored with eight seconds left in the power play as Edmonton reclaimed its three-goal lead.\n\nEven in the third period after Oliver Ekman-Larsson cut the deficit to one, Dmitry Kulikov's tripping penalty with 7:32 left ate up two valuable minutes.\n\n\"We've got to find a way to stay out of the penalty box. That's about it,\" Maurice said.\n\nMaurice was tight after the game and wasn't in his normal talkative mood. He said he didn't mind the Panthers' game and thought they were strong five-on-five. But the two power-play goals against, the short-handed goal and McDavid did them in.\n\n\"We should be intensely interested in the next one,\" Maurice said. \"I'm not pumping tires. I'm not rubbing backs. I don't think we need that at all. Everybody feels probably exactly the way I do right now. I'm not feeling deflated. Neither is the hockey team. They're not feeling deflated. A little grumpy.\"\n\nThe Panthers took the positives from the game, like how they played in the second half when they spent several shifts trying to mount a comeback. It's something to build off of, they said, as was Tkachuk's performance.\n\nTkachuk spoiled us last postseason with big goal after big goal. He hasn't been remotely the same this postseason. He scored only his second goal in the past 16 games in the second period, he set up Ekman-Larsson's goal, he was constantly going to the inside and playing physically and even saved an empty-net goal by Hyman with a desperation dive to swipe the puck from the goal line before McDavid buried the dagger.\n\n\"That goal seemed to ignite him,\" Ferraro said. \"That's Tkachuk. He'd been playing, in my opinion, a little bit conservatively. He's been trying to be so disciplined and conservative, but he's got to get up closer to the edge. He's such an emotional bellwether for them and they need that, and I thought he was awesome in the second half.\"\n\nThe Panthers seemed to get a spark in the second period when Maurice flipped Carter Verhaeghe and Evan Rodrigues, reuniting Verhaeghe with Aleksander Barkov and Sam Reinhart and Rodrigues with Sam Bennett and Tkachuk. What was weird is Maurice made the initial switch in the third period of Game 3 before anything went haywire in the series. The Panthers were then dominated, so he flipped it back and they looked more like themselves.\n\nThe other thing he did in the third was elevate Ekman-Larsson, who was outstanding. Perhaps this is more stuff to build on for Game 6.\n\n\"We're a good road team, so we're going to go in there and play with confidence and play our game and go for it,\" said Ekman-Larsson.\n\nAdded Rodrigues, \"We've got to win one game, simple as that. Go out there, got to win one game. That's our mindset and that's what we're going to go do.\"\n\n\"It's not an elimination game for us,\" Tkachuk said. \"We're going up there with a 3-2 series lead. Just got to take care of business like we did in Game 3.\"\n\nMaurice doesn't believe in momentum from game to game in the playoffs.\n\nBut there's no doubt the Oilers, who have spent this entire season rallying back from the dead, are feeling capable of doing it again.\n\nAnd that has to be a concern for the Panthers.\n\n\"I don't know if this is just me or not, but again, this group has just believed in this the whole way,\" Oilers defenseman Mattias Ekholm said. \"I don't know that there's been any pressure on us or whatnot. ... We believe we're going to pull this off.\"", "source": {"uri": "spokesman.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Spokesman Review"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

His Florida Panthers have been knocked down the past couple games with history on the horizon, but the optimism around the team hasn't wavered.\n\n\"They're not feeling deflated,\" the veteran coach said. \"A little grumpy.\"\n\nAs should be the case when another opportunity to clinch the Stanley Cup went awry.\n\nThe Panthers had a 3-0 stranglehold in the best-of-7 series. So close to winning it all yet the job still far from being done.\n\nA desperate Edmonton Oilers team took advantage.\n\nFirst an 8-1 rout in Game 4 on Saturday in Edmonton, Alberta.\n\nAnd then a 5-3 win in Game 5 on Tuesday in Sunrise, Fla.\n\nJust like that, we have a series.\n\nGame 6 is on Friday at Edmonton's Rogers Place. The Panthers are still just one win away, but should the Oilers win on home ice, a winner-take-all Game 7 takes place at Amerant Bank Arena on Monday.\n\n\"We've just got to win one game,\" center Sam Bennett said. \"It's as simple as that.\"\n\nIt's simple in theory, yes, but the Panthers haven't been able to produce in the closeout game yet. Is the pressure mounting on this Panthers team with so much on the line?\n\n\"No. No. No,\" star winger Matthew Tkachuk insisted postgame. \"It's not an elimination game for us. We're going up there with a 3-2 series lead. Just got to take care of business.\"\n\nHow do they do that?\n\nThere are a few things to clean up. Among them:\n\n-- Slow starts: Edmonton, playing desperate with its season on the line, pounced early in both Games 4 and 5 and never looked back.\n\nIn Game 4, Edmonton had a 5-1 lead through the first five minutes of the second period, which prompted Paul Maurice to pull starting goaltender Sergei Bobrovsky from the net for the first time this postseason.\n\nIn Game 5, the Oilers were up 3-0 25 minutes into the game.\n\nFeatured Local Savings\n\n\"The last couple games, our start wasn't good enough,\" Bennett said.\n\n-- Special teams: Of Edmonton's 13 goals the past two games, five have come on special teams -- three on the power play, two shorthanded.\n\nOn Tuesday, Edmonton opened scoring with a Connor Brown shorthanded goal when he intercepted a Brandon Montour pass at the blue line and rushed down the ice for an uncontested breakaway. Zach Hyman and Corey Perry both scored on the power play in the second period.\n\nThe Panthers held Edmonton scoreless on 10 power-play opportunities through the first three games.\n\n\"We just have to keep battling, keep doing what we do,\" defenseman Oliver Ekman-Larsson said. \"Obviously, we believe in our kill. It's been good all year, [but] they have a good power play.\"\n\n-- Containing Connor McDavid: After Florida held the superstar center to just three points through the first three games, McDavid has erupted for eight points (three goals, five assists) in Games 4 and 5. He now has a staggering 42 points this postseason (eight goals, 34 assists).\n\n\"Yeah,\" Ekman-Larsson said, \"he's good.\"\n\nNow that said, the Panthers showed signs of life late that they will need to build on as they head into Game 6.\n\nAfter Edmonton went up 3-0, the Panthers held the Oilers to just 11 shots on goal over the final 35 minutes -- including a mere four shots in the third period -- as they mounted their comeback bid.\n\nTkachuk cut the deficit to 3-1 6:53 into the second period with a snap shot from the slot after Evan Rodrigues won a board battle to keep the puck in the offensive zone.\n\nEdmonton and Florida then swapped goals over a 12-second span later in the period -- Corey Perry scoring for the Oilers on the power play before Rodrigues poked a puck past Stuart Skinner following a Brandon Montour shot on the following shift -- to make the score 4-2 after two periods.\n\nEkman-Larsson got Florida within one goal 4:04 into the third period when he buried a behind-the-net feed from Tkachuk but the Panthers couldn't get that final goal to tie the game and Edmonton sealed the win with a McDavid empty-netter in the final seconds of regulation.\n\n\"We were down in that game and we kept pushing, kept coming back and gave ourselves a chance to come back in that game,\" Ekman-Larsson said.\n\nAdded Maurice: \"We gave up [four] shots in the third period. We were pretty good,\" Maurice said. \"Momentum's not an issue. We played a helluva game. We gave up a shorthanded goal. That's gotta stop. That's two [in the series]. We got some sticks on some hands there for the first time and ended up in the penalty box for it. So we're going to have to be real mindful of that because we know that's going to lead to a penalty. And then after that our five-on-five game was pretty good. ... I didn't mind our game. I thought we were all right. We should be intensely interested in the next one and see how that's played.\"\n\n\u00a92024 Miami Herald. Visit miamiherald.com.

(AP Photo/Wilfredo Lee)EDMONTON, Alberta (AP) - It's officially summer, and the best two teams in hockey during the winter months of the 2023-24 NHL season are still playing. Whichever team wins Game 6 - and Game 7, if necessary - of the Stanley Cup Final between the Edmonton Oilers and Florida Panthers that resumes in Alberta on Friday night will not only be a team for all time as hockey's champion. It will be a rare team for all seasons, too. Let's explain: Summer began in the Northern Hemisphere on Thursday. That makes this the fourth time in the last five years that the NHL season has stretched into the summer months and the sixth time that it's happened in league history. But the Panthers or Oilers - or both - will join a very short list of teams to win games in fall, winter, spring and summer in the same NHL season. \"We're incredibly lucky, for sure,\" Panthers forward Ryan Lomberg said. \"We were talking about the other day, that teams that haven't made the playoffs have been at home for a couple months now.\"\u009d The first two instances of Cup final games getting played in summer - 1995 and 2013 - were because those seasons started late due to labor strife and no games were played in the fall. The 2019-20 season started in the fall 2019 and ended in the fall 2020, but saw no games played in spring 2020 because of the COVID-19 pandemic. The 2020-21 season stretched into summer but didn't start until mid-January so, again, no fall games were played. There have been two teams in NHL history - the 2021-22 Colorado Avalanche and Tampa Bay Lightning - to win games in fall, winter, spring and summer in the same season. That year's schedule saw a slew of postponements because of the pandemic and the Stanley Cup Final stretched into the summer. Colorado went 2-1, Tampa Bay 1-2 following the June solstice that year. The winner of Friday's Game 6 of this year's Cup final in Edmonton will become the third team in NHL history to win a game in fall, winter, spring and summer in the same hockey season. (And if it's the Oilers, that means the Panthers will have another chance to join that list in Sunrise, Florida, on Monday night in Game 7.) For the record, if we look at the actual meteorological seasons within this hockey season, the Panthers and Oilers have been relatively close record-wise all year: Games played in the fall - Florida 18-12-3, Edmonton 14-15-1. Games played in the winter - Edmonton 27-6-4, Florida 27-7-2. (No team had a better record in the winter months this season than the Oilers and Panthers did.) Games played in the spring, including playoffs - Florida 22-12-3, Edmonton 22-15-2. \"Incredibly lucky and fortunate to be in this position,\"\u009d Lomberg said. The only time the Stanley Cup has been handed out later in the calendar year has been seasons affected by a strike, lockout or the pandemic. The last time the Oilers won it, in 1990, it was May 24. Kane skates Evander Kane, who has been scratched the past three games because of the sports hernia he had been playing through, took part in Oilers practice on a fifth line, which would indicate he is not penciled in to play in Game 6. Coach Kris Knoblauch was not ready to make any declarations, consistent with his behavior throughout the series, saying he had not yet talked to athletic trainer T.D. Forss to see how Kane was feeling. \"We have got some things to think about,\" Knoblauch said. \"But we have possibilities.\"\u009d Game 6 History Both teams are 2-0 in Game 6 so far in these playoffs. Edmonton beat Vancouver 5-1 and Dallas 2-1; Florida beat Boston and the New York Rangers, each time by a score of 2-1. All-time, Edmonton is 17-9 in Game 6 and 10-7 at home in Game 6s. Florida is 6-3 all-time in the sixth game of a series, 2-3 when that contest is on the road. Long Season One team will set a record, the other will tie a record on Friday. Game 6 of the Stanley Cup Final is Edmonton's 106th contest of the season, tying the 2005-06 Oilers for the most in a season (including playoffs) in franchise history. It will be the 105th of the season for the Panthers. That's a Florida single-season record; the 1995-96 Panthers played 104 games. The NHL record for games in a season is 108, done on six occasions, most recently by the St. Louis Blues in their 2018-19 Stanley Cup title season. ___ Reynolds reported from Fort Lauderdale, Florida.

Mandatory Credit: Sam Navarro-USA TODAY Sports / Sam Navarro-USA TODAY Sports\n\nGoing up 3-0 in a best-of-seven series is supposed to make it feel like a series victory is inevitable. Only four teams have ever won four straight to overcome such a deficit, and only the 1942 Toronto Maple Leafs have ever done it in the Stanley Cup Final. The Florida Panthers seemed to be in the driver's seat, with their first Stanley Cup victory approaching on the horizon.\n\nHowever, after Edmonton won Game 5 5-3 in Sunrise on Tuesday night, the outlook for the Panthers is looking a little murkier. What looked like a near-certain victory for Florida has suddenly become shrouded in uncertainty. The series is moving back to Edmonton on Friday night, with the momentum squarely in Oil Country.\n\nFor six straight periods, the Florida Panthers were outplayed\n\nWhile Florida won Game 3, the beginning of this run for Edmonton began during the third period of that game. The Panthers entered the final frame up 4-1, looking to seal another multi-goal victory over the Oilers. Instead, Philip Broberg and Ryan McLeod scored to give Edmonton hope with 5:17 left. Florida held on to win the game, but it only got worse in Game 4. Edmonton ran laps around Florida to avoid the sweep, winning 8-1 to send the series back to Sunrise.\n\nThe Oilers played a fantastic road period to begin Game 5, opening the scoring for the second straight game with a short-handed marker. Florida pushed back well in the second period, but Edmonton outscored them 3-2 in the middle frame to make it 4-2 going into the third. For these six periods, the Oilers dominated the Panthers 14-3, seemingly turning the series back in their favor despite being in a significant hole.\n\nOutside of the other-worldly performance of Connor McDavid, the two biggest aspects of this momentum shift are special teams and goaltending. Over the last two games, the Panthers have allowed three power-play goals and two short-handed goals while failing to score on their seven power-play attempts. While their power play has consistently been disappointing, their penalty kill was a perfect 10-for-10 in Games 1-3.\n\nSergei Bobrovsky's performances in Games 4 and 5 have also been placed under a microscope. After looking unbeatable for most of the first three games, Bobrovsky allowed five goals before being yanked in Game 4 and then allowed four more goals in Game 5. The real sign that things were dire was the sharp-angle goal he allowed to McDavid in the second period on Tuesday. It was a goal that we haven't seen Bobrovsky allow much recently.\n\nThere is a silver lining for the Panthers ahead of Game 6\n\nThough the Panthers struggled to find an answer for the Oilers for those six periods, the third period on Tuesday night saw them finally start putting the pieces back together. They were the more aggressive team for the entire third period as they fought to come back. Oliver Ekman-Larsson scored early to help them get within a goal, and while they weren't able to tie the game, it looked like the same team that had built up their series lead.\n\nIf the Panthers want to be the first visiting team to win the Stanley Cup in Edmonton, it's going to take bigger efforts from some of their stars. Only Evan Rodrigues and Vladimir Tarasenko have more than one goal in the series. Carter Verhaeghe has just one point. Sam Reinhart and Brandon Montour need to be more noticeable. Most importantly, Sergei Bobrovsky needs to get back on the horse and play like he had before this past weekend. If not, we'll be back in Sunrise for a winner-take-all game on Monday night, with history guaranteed to be made.", "source": {"uri": "puckprose.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Puck Prose"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanley_Cup_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Stanley Cup Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida_Panthers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Florida Panthers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edmonton", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Edmonton"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Edmonton"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunrise,_Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sunrise, Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Sunrise, Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sergei_Bobrovsky", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Sergei Bobrovsky"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connor_McDavid", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Connor McDavid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goaltender", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Goaltender"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Short-handed", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Short-handed"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toronto_Maple_Leafs", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Toronto Maple Leafs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forward_(ice_hockey)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Forward (ice hockey)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edmonton_Oilers", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Edmonton Oilers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryan_McLeod", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ryan McLeod"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanley_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Stanley Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carter_Verhaeghe", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Carter Verhaeghe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sam_Reinhart", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sam Reinhart"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brandon_Montour", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Brandon Montour"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oliver_Ekman-Larsson", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Oliver Ekman-Larsson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evan_Rodrigues", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Evan Rodrigues"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vladimir_Tarasenko", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Vladimir Tarasenko"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Browser_Based", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Browser Based", "wgt": 28}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Downloads", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Downloads", "wgt": 27}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Play_Groups", "label": "dmoz/Games/Play Groups", "wgt": 27}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Play_Groups/Europe", "label": "dmoz/Games/Play Groups/Europe", "wgt": 26}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Developers_and_Publishers", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Developers and Publishers", "wgt": 28}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_crop,w_3875,h_2179,x_0,y_177/c_fill,w_1440,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/images/ImagnImages/mmsport/142/01j0rqs8emvebhr35wra.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9666028", "eventUri": "eng-9666028", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2018-06-", "textStart": 0, "textEnd": 6}], "sentiment": 0.2549019607843137, "wgt": 163, "relevance": 1}

The best hockey player in the world, Connor McDavid, has carried the Edmonton Oilers back from a 3-0 series deficit against the Florida Panthers.\n\nThe Men of Oil won twice to bring the series back to Edmonton for Game 6. With the NBA postseason complete, the NHL can claim center stage for American sports fans.\n\nThis series is building the sort of drama that draws in casual observers. Can McDavid and Co. complete a comeback for the ages? Can the ultra-talented Florida Panthers avoid an historic collapse?\n\nOilers fans are feeling hopeful. Once their team broke through for an 8-1 rout in Game 4, it regained its swagger.\n\n\"If anything, Edmonton might now have the edge with momentum,\" former Oilers and Blues goaltender Grant Fuhr told NHL.com. \"They're riding the wave, and they have the home crowd behind them. I'd guess they're just focused on 20 minutes at a time and trying to win each period.

Your wife and kids are there. Your brothers are all there. They're all sitting around, so excited for you to have this opportunity to win the Stanley Cup. And then all of sudden, you don't win and pressure just keeps building and building.\n\nThe great thing for the Panthers is they actually have four chances to play for the Stanley Cup. The Oilers are not even playing for the Cup yet. They're just playing for one opportunity to win the Cup, and Florida has four opportunities to win the Cup. The Panthers haven't done it in two, but they still have two more opportunities to do it.\n\nIt's still advantage Panthers. They only have to win one game, and the Oilers are going game by game.\n\nPressure can't hit Edmonton until Game 7. That's the only time the Oilers can play for the trophy and have all the same pressure that's on the Panthers. Now, all the family has to get on the plane and go all the way back to Alberta, and their nervousness and anxiety can get passed along to the players.\n\nTipsheet is still pulling for the Panthers, as a nod to Our Town's Matthew Tkachuk and former Blues star Vladimir Tarasenko. But if the Oilers can force a Game 7, that would be spectacular.\n\nHere is what folks are writing about the Cup Final:\n\nLauren Theisen, The Defector: \"Thanks to their 3-2 series lead, the Florida Panthers remain the favorites to hoist the Stanley Cup on either Friday or Monday. But for the Edmonton Oilers, getting to Game 6 feels like a cathartic reward in itself. With a 5-3 victory in a hazardously stressful Game 5 down south, the Oilers have earned an ultimate game for their home fans -- a game that, unlike the bizarre and seemingly futile 8-1 beatdown last Saturday, feels like a clash of unmatched importance between a pair of worthy would-be champions. After the disasters of their first three games in the Final, a 3-2 deficit has Edmonton looking like heroes already . . . . What once looked like a rote path to a conclusion twinning this year's NBA Finals is now as tense and thrilling as any series can be. Heading into Game 6, everyone -- even Florida -- has to be feeling pretty good. The Panthers are just one win away from immortality. The Oilers can pull level with just one more triumph at home. The neutrals get at least one more night watching McDavid try to tear apart the year's most impressive team (so far). Eat your heart out, Adam Silver. This is hockey time.\"\n\nRyan Lambert, EP Rinkside: \"The Edmonton Oilers looked cooked. Dead in the water. Ready to be a footnote in history as the only team in the cap era to get swept in a Cup Final. But then Edmonton dropped eight on Florida in Game 4, and that was nice. Gave the hometown fans a fun atmosphere that just a few days earlier had been funereal. At least gave the Panthers something to think about. But the opinion was still largely that, okay, the Panthers got smoked but would probably put it behind them, pull it together to close it out on home ice. Didn't happen. For the second game in a row, Florida drew an early power play, almost immediately gave up a shorthanded goal, and got womped for the remainder of the period. It at least got a little interesting for a minute there, but the 3-0 deficit was too great to overcome, and so they are indeed dragged -- kicking, screaming and probably crying a little -- back to Alberta. You gotta love the intrigue. Even though this one got interesting in the third, one had to wonder what do the Panthers do. Connor McDavid is frying their defenders. Sergei Bobrovsky is giving up goals we can most politely term 'regrettable.' The Florida offense spent long stretches of the last two games looking lifeless. Do they change anything? Do they stay the course with the understanding that they probably have a 55 percent chance to win each of the next two games? Do they try, for once, not to give up a 3-1 lead?\"\n\nFrank Seravelli, Daily Faceoff: \"Maybe one day, when their hair is grey and their bellies are bigger and the Edmonton Oilers are sitting around with cocktails in-hand, they'll reminisce and tell stories about the time Connor McDavid started to author the greatest comeback hockey has ever seen. The story is still only half written for the Oilers. It's a tale that not even Zach Hyman could have cooked up for one of his children's books, and one that won't make it to press without two more wins. But it doesn't seem so far-fetched now. Trailing 3-0 in this best-of-seven series, McDavid did something Tuesday no one in the 106-year history of the Stanley Cup Final had before him: Post a second consecutive four-point game. Not Wayne. Not Mario. Not Mr. Hockey, nor the Roadrunner. Nope, not Kurri, Anderson nor Bossy and the dynastic Islanders.\"\n\nKen Campbell, The Hockey News: \"Think about this for a minute: Brandon Saad had in 82 regular-season games the same number of points that Connor McDavid has in 23 playoff games, and Saad makes $4.5 million. What McDavid is doing for the Edmonton Oilers in this playoff in general, and this Stanley Cup final in specific, is mind-boggling. And he's leading anyone on either the Oilers or the Florida Panthers who had designs on the Conn Smythe Trophy in his dust, regardless of how this thing plays out over the next one or two games. Aleksander Barkov? You mean the guy who has half as many playoff points as McDavid and has gone missing? Sergei Bobrovsky? You mean the guy McDavid is currently shredding as he drags the Oilers back into this thing? It's what you call a no-brainer at this point. McDavid is destined to add another trophy to his collection. Whether it collects dust in his attic or whether he prominently displays it will depend on whether or not he and the Oilers can finish the job in Games 6 and 7.\"\n\nMark Spector, Sportsnet: \"What really matters today, with Game 6 of this Stanley Cup Final set for the hearing loss depot that is a Friday night at Rogers Place, is how Knoblauch and staff have taken control of the pace and style of this series. Remember how Florida controlled the bluelines in Games 1-3? Do you recall how good Dmitry Kulikov and Niko Mikkola looked while pressuring down from their offensive blueline to win battles against stationary Oilers forwards? Well, in Games 5 and 6, the Florida defense corps has been forced into a skating game by a revised Oilers game plan that employs a style we watched the Dallas Stars play in Rd. 3. Remember how that weak-side winger flees the zone early, curling across the middle in wait of a stretch pass or high flip out of the zone? It's hard for a defenseman to hold his blueline the way Florida's D-corps likes to, when there's an opposing winger skating around behind him stretching the neutral zone, opening up the middle of the ice that the Panthers used to control. And where the Oilers defensemen struggled with execution early in the series, they're better now that a high flip -- or 'punt,' as they're calling it now -- is the preferred break-out option.\"\n\nMEGAPHONE\n\n\"It's still 3-2, I think. I've got to check when I get back to the office . . . You guys are all in a bad [expletive] mood. How can I be the only person in a decent mood here today?\"\n\nPanthers coach Paul Maurice, playfully parrying with reporters.\n\n0 Comments", "source": {"uri": "stltoday.com", "dataType": "news",

The Florida Panthers need just one victory in the next two games to clinch their first NHL championship, but the Oilers are in position to tie the series if they win Friday's home game.\n\n\"We're playing on house money,\" coach Kris Knoblauch told reporters on Wednesday. \"Nobody's expected us to be here right now. Nobody gave us an opportunity to maybe even be in the Stanley Cup Final, let alone give us an opportunity to claw our way back in this series. We're just having fun. There's always been a lot of belief in this room.\"\n\nWhat has brought about a change in the course of the Stanley Cup Final?\n\nConnor McDavid is on fire\n\nHe already broke Wayne Gretzky's record for assists in a postseason and he set another Stanley Cup Final record by totaling eight points in the last two games. With 42 points, he's five points behind Gretzky's record for points in a single postseason.\n\nMcDavid has always had the ability to make slick moves at speed, but he raised his level in Game 5. He scored from a sharp angle and later weaved his way through traffic to set up Corey Perry's goal.\n\nOilers were playing well previously, now are getting results\n\nThey carried play in Game 1 only to be thwarted by Panthers goalie Sergei Bobrovsky. They were done in by mistakes in Game 3 and nearly fought back. They put it all together in the past two games, solving Bobrovsky and taking advantage of the Panthers' mistakes. Stymied early in the series by the Panthers' forecheck, they've helped counteract that with quick up-ice passes.\n\nStuart Skinner gets better later in series\n\nAccording to Sportsnet, the Oilers goalie is 9-0 in Games 4-7 in this year's playoffs with a 1.56 goals-against average and .938 save percentage. He had a big save in Game 4 against Carter Verhaeghe and in Game 5 against Aaron Ekblad with the game tight.\n\nOilers' special teams are clicking\n\nNeither team was able to get much going on the power play early in this series. The Oilers have continued to stymie the Panthers' power play and scored twice short-handed in the past two games. Its power play finally connected on a 5-on-3 advantage in Game 4 and scored twice in Game 5. Evan Bouchard set up one goal with a blast from the point that deflected off Zach Hyman.\n\nOilers' depth players scoring\n\nThe Oilers have put out their third line to start the last two games and it has connected in the first period. Mattias Janmark, Adam Henrique and Connor Brown each has a goal. Brown's health is key. He took a while to recover from last season's knee surgery and his speed is noticeable.\n\nThis article originally appeared on USA TODAY: Stanley Cup Finals: How Oilers turned around series vs. Panthers", "source": {"uri": "aol.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Aol"}, "authors": [{"uri": "mike_brehm@aol.com", "name": "Mike Brehm", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanley_Cup_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Stanley Cup Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connor_McDavid", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Connor McDavid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wayne_Gretzky", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wayne Gretzky"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida_Panthers", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Florida Panthers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanley_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stanley Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edmonton_Oilers", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Edmonton Oilers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sergei_Bobrovsky", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sergei Bobrovsky"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assist_(ice_hockey)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Assist (ice hockey)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USA_Today", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "USA Today"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stuart_Skinner", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Stuart Skinner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mattias_Janmark", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mattias Janmark"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carter_Verhaeghe", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Carter Verhaeghe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evan_Bouchard", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Evan Bouchard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zach_Hyman", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Zach Hyman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connor_Brown_(ice_hockey)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Connor Brown (ice hockey)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adam_Henrique", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Adam Henrique"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Ekblad", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Aaron Ekblad"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Short-handed", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Short-handed"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sportsnet", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sportsnet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goals_against_average", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Goals against average"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Browser_Based", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Browser Based", "wgt": 31}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Play_Groups", "label": "dmoz/Games/Play Groups", "wgt": 31}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Play_Groups/North_America", "label": "dmoz/Games/Play Groups/North America", "wgt": 30}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Play_Groups/Europe", "label": "dmoz/Games/Play Groups/Europe", "wgt": 30}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Developers_and_Publishers", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Developers and Publishers", "wgt": 30}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/v6tHTGx_IZyvR6m8oitXog--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD04MDA-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/aol_usatoday_us_articles_590/75691c8add2c6ca3ebae02798666fac7", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9666028", "eventUri": "eng-9666028", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-01", "dateEnd": "2024-05-03", "textStart": 545, "textEnd": 556}, {"amb": false, "date": "2020-06-", "textStart": 101, "textEnd": 108}], "sentiment": 0.4588235294117646, "wgt": 149, "relevance": 1}

They only allowed four goals in the first three games of this series. But Edmonton has the best offensive player in the world. Connor McDavid has posted back-to-back four-point games, unheard of in Stanley Cup Final. The Panthers need all five players on the ice to do the job collectively against McDavid. In addition, uncharacteristic mistakes, such as the power play turnover that gave the Oilers the opening goal in game five, must be cleaned up.\n\nAfter shutting down the Rangers in the east Final and holding the Oilers to just four goals in the first three games of this series goalie Sergei Bobrovsky has allowed 9 goals in the last 2 games. Many were not his \"fault\" as the Oilers had grade A chances, mostly on the power play and off the rush. But with one win needed to win it all, against a great offensive team, good isn't good enough. The goalie must make all the saves he should and add a handful more that he shouldn't be able to make. Bobrovsky did that in games one and three. He is a true pro and always shakes off goals allowed. The Panthers need him to do all that and more in game six.\n\nMatthew Tkachuk has played well but it wasn't until game five that he instilled his will and offensive game on the series. He nearly led the Panthers all the way back from a three goal deficit. Tkachuk was the Panthers' best player in game five and that bodes well for his line with Sam Bennett and the hot Evan Rodrigues.\n\nNeeding 60 strong minutes to win the cup means Aleksander Barkov must play his best game. Along with Sam Reinhart and Carter Verhaeghe the trio needs to improve their play in game six. If matched up against McDavid or Leon Draisaitl they must be tight defensively and not allow the Oilers out of their own zone cleanly and with speed. If on the ice against Edmonton's third line they must have a strong forecheck (as all lines do), get zone time and produce offensively. With all the money on the line now, the stars need to step up.\n\nTop players will decide big games. That said, with Ryan Lomberg now back in the lineup and Nick Cousins entering for game six the Panthers can use a boost from their depth. They are playoff-tested players, fresh and can inject energy, and physicality and spend some time in the offensive zone.", "source": {"uri": "cbsnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CBS News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connor_McDavid", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Connor McDavid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edmonton", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Edmonton"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Edmonton"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sergei_Bobrovsky", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sergei Bobrovsky"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanley_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stanley Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanley_Cup_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Stanley Cup Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Rangers", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "New York Rangers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aleksander_Barkov", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Aleksander Barkov"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carter_Verhaeghe", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Carter Verhaeghe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryan_Lomberg", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ryan Lomberg"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sam_Reinhart", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sam Reinhart"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nick_Cousins", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nick Cousins"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matthew_Tkachuk", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Matthew Tkachuk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leon_Draisaitl", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Leon Draisaitl"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evan_Rodrigues", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Evan Rodrigues"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sam_Bennett_(ice_hockey)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sam Bennett (ice hockey)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Browser_Based", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Browser Based", "wgt": 36}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Downloads", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Downloads", "wgt": 34}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Play_Groups", "label": "dmoz/Games/Play Groups", "wgt": 35}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Play_Groups/Europe", "label": "dmoz/Games/Play Groups/Europe", "wgt": 34}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Developers_and_Publishers", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Developers and Publishers", "wgt": 35}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 68}], "image": "https://assets3.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2024/06/20/9cb9c02c-b329-48eb-9024-f6b0e9da46f1/thumbnail/1200x630/6a4a2dc7f6b593c1adb7a34cd580ff8a/ap24171077255291.jpg?v=5842509bb796a146f9b20d3e8b03dac6", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9666028", "eventUri": "eng-9666028", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2549019607843137, "wgt": 148, "relevance": 1}

He takes pride in his versatility, knowing that his value can extend beyond his individual production.\n\n\"I try to give my linemates sort of the freedom to play their game,\" Rodrigues said. \"I adjust my game a little bit and just try to bring a little bit of energy.\"\n\nThat has been on display all postseason, and he has been reaping the benefits of it especially in the Stanley Cup Final.\n\nRodrigues leads the Panthers with four goals and six points entering Game 6 against the Edmonton Oilers on Friday. Both marks are franchise records in the Cup Final.\n\nIn fact, he's just the ninth player in franchise history to have four goals in a playoffs series in any round of the postseason. The others: Carter Verhaeghe (first round of both 2022 and 2024), Matthew Tkachuk (first round and Eastern Conference final of 2023), Sam Bennett (2024 Eastern Conference final), Sam Reinhart (2023 first round), Brandon Montour (2023 first round), Reilly Smith (2016 first round), Ray Sheppard (1996 first round) and Dave Lowry (1996 second round).\n\nAnd this came after he had just eight total points (three goals, five assists) through the first three rounds of the playoffs and 39 points (12 goals, 27 assists) in the regular season.\n\n\"You probably go back six, seven weeks into the regular season -- maybe even longer than that, but then the last month and a half for sure -- [and] his game he just became more and more impactful in everything that he did,\" Panthers coach Paul Maurice said. \"And he's continued. We have moved him around and now as much wherever he goes, he seems to get the people going that he's playing with. He's become that kind of player for us.\"\n\nTwo moments stand out in particular with Rodrigues so far this series.\n\nThe first was Game 2. With the game tied in the third period, Rodrigues scored the go-ahead goal 3:11 into the final period with a snap shot from the left circle after the Panthers cycled the puck around the offensive zone. About 10 minutes later, he scored Florida's only power-play goal of the series to give the Panthers an insurance goal in their eventual 4-1 win.\n\nThe second came in Game 5. After the Panthers fell behind by three goals in the opening 25 minutes, Rodrigues was integral in both of Florida's first two goals of the game. He won a board battle in the offensive zone and sent the puck to Matthew Tkachuk for Florida's first goal of the game. Rodrigues then scored himself later in the second period by crashing the net and sending in a rebound from a Brandon Montour shot one shift after Edmonton potted a power-play goal to keep Florida's deficit at just two goals. The Panthers got within one goal early in the third period before ultimately losing 5-3.\n\n\"Roddy's been great,\" Panthers center Sam Bennett said. \"Every time we've gotten to play with him, he's made some great plays. He's battling hard and gave us a little spark. That was great to see from him.\"\n\nAdded Rodrigues: \"Sometimes, when you get down in games, you try to make you know too cute of plays or you try to spread the game open. I think the reason why we've had so much success this year, especially when we get down, is that we don't change our game.\"\n\nWhile Rodrigues' efforts in Game 5 on Tuesday weren't enough to clinch the series -- and Florida's first-ever Stanley Cup -- he helped the Panthers maintain momentum down the stretch of the game, momentum they look to carry into Game 6 on Friday in Edmonton.\n\n\"He's been really good this series and not only because he's scoring goals,\" Panthers center Anton Lundell said. \"He works hard. He does a lot of small things that helps the team win. He's a leader. He's been stepping up a lot.\"", "source": {"uri": "miamiherald.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Miami Herald"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jordan_mcpherson@miamiherald.com", "name": "Jordan McPherson", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanley_Cup_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Stanley Cup Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evan_Rodrigues", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Evan Rodrigues"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Conference_(NHL)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Eastern Conference (NHL)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Maurice", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Paul Maurice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matthew_Tkachuk", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Matthew Tkachuk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forward_(ice_hockey)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Forward (ice hockey)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida_Panthers", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Florida Panthers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assist_(ice_hockey)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Assist (ice hockey)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edmonton_Oilers", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Edmonton Oilers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carter_Verhaeghe", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Carter Verhaeghe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sam_Reinhart", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sam Reinhart"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brandon_Montour", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Brandon Montour"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ray_Sheppard", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ray Sheppard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dave_Lowry", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dave Lowry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reilly_Smith", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Reilly Smith"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanley_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Stanley Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sam_Bennett_(ice_hockey)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sam Bennett (ice hockey)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anton_Lundell", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Anton Lundell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edmonton", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Edmonton"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Edmonton"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Browser_Based", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Browser Based", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Play_Groups", "label": "dmoz/Games/Play Groups", "wgt": 24}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Play_Groups/North_America", "label": "dmoz/Games/Play Groups/North America", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Play_Groups/Europe", "label": "dmoz/Games/Play Groups/Europe", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Developers_and_Publishers", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Developers and Publishers", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://www.miamiherald.com/latest-news/iz0yrd/picture289392228/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1140/Photo_Gallery_04.JPG", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9666028", "eventUri": "eng-9666028", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2549019607843137, "wgt": 131, "relevance": 1}

After a dominant start that saw them win the first three games of the series against the Edmonton Oilers, the Panthers now find themselves in a precarious position. The Oilers, once on the brink of elimination, have started to mount a comeback with consecutive victories in game 4 and game 5, reshaping the dynamics of the championship battle.\n\nHeading into game 4, skepticism surrounded the Oilers. Down three games, the odds seemed insurmountable. Yet, fueled by resilience and tactical adjustments, Edmonton has defied expectations. Their victories have not only breathed new life into their championship aspirations but have also cast doubts on the Panthers' ability to secure that elusive fourth win.\n\nThe pressure now squarely rests on the Florida Panthers. After their initial commanding lead in the series, they must recalibrate their strategy and mindset. What was once a comfortable advantage has dwindled into a critical test of their resolve and adaptability. Key questions loom: Can the Panthers adjust their game plan to counteract Edmonton's resurgence? Will they regain their momentum and composure in time to secure the championship?\n\nFor Florida, the path forward demands a blend of strategic finesse and mental fortitude. They must analyze the reasons behind their recent setbacks and make necessary tactical adjustments. Defensive strategies, offensive tactics, and player rotations will all come under intense scrutiny as they seek to stave off Edmonton's momentum and reclaim control of the series.\n\nThe psychological aspect cannot be overlooked. The Panthers must navigate the pressures of expectation and the emotional rollercoaster of a high-stakes playoff series. Bringing back confidence and unity within the team will be essential to weathering the storm brought on by Edmonton's resurgence.\n\nAs the hockey world watches, the upcoming game 6 will be pivotal. It represents not only a chance for the Oilers to complete a historic comeback but also a critical opportunity for the Panthers to demonstrate their championship pedigree.\n\nWhile the Oilers were looking at the eyes of a sweep, they are now starting to build up momentum and confidence to keep this series going.

The Florida Panthers need just one victory in the next two games to clinch their first NHL championship, but the Oilers are in position to tie the series if they win Friday's home game.\n\n\"We're playing on house money,\" coach Kris Knoblauch told reporters on Wednesday. \"Nobody's expected us to be here right now. Nobody gave us an opportunity to maybe even be in the Stanley Cup Final, let alone give us an opportunity to claw our way back in this series. We're just having fun. There's always been a lot of belief in this room.\"\n\nWhat has brought about a change in the course of the Stanley Cup Final?\n\nHe already broke Wayne Gretzky's record for assists in a postseason and he set another Stanley Cup Final record by totaling eight points in the last two games. With 42 points, he's five points behind Gretzky's record for points in a single postseason.\n\nMcDavid has always had the ability to make slick moves at speed, but he raised his level in Game 5. He scored from a sharp angle and later weaved his way through traffic to set up Corey Perry's goal.\n\nThey carried play in Game 1 only to be thwarted by Panthers goalie Sergei Bobrovsky. They were done in by mistakes in Game 3 and nearly fought back. They put it all together in the past two games, solving Bobrovsky and taking advantage of the Panthers' mistakes. Stymied early in the series by the Panthers' forecheck, they've helped counteract that with quick up-ice passes.\n\nAccording to Sportsnet, the Oilers goalie is 9-0 in Games 4-7 in this year's playoffs with a 1.56 goals-against average and .938 save percentage. He had a big save in Game 4 against Carter Verhaeghe and in Game 5 against Aaron Ekblad with the game tight.\n\nNeither team was able to get much going on the power play early in this series. The Oilers have continued to stymie the Panthers' power play and scored twice short-handed in the past two games. Its power play finally connected on a 5-on-3 advantage in Game 4 and scored twice in Game 5. Evan Bouchard set up one goal with a blast from the point that deflected off Zach Hyman.\n\nThe Oilers have put out their third line to start the last two games and it has connected in the first period. Mattias Janmark, Adam Henrique and Connor Brown each has a goal. Brown's health is key. He took a while to recover from last season's knee surgery and his speed is noticeable.", "source": {"uri": "sports.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo Sports"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanley_Cup_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Stanley Cup Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kris_Knoblauch", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kris Knoblauch"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wayne_Gretzky", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wayne Gretzky"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida_Panthers", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Florida Panthers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanley_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stanley Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edmonton_Oilers", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Edmonton Oilers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sergei_Bobrovsky", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sergei Bobrovsky"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connor_McDavid", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Connor McDavid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assist_(ice_hockey)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Assist (ice hockey)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carter_Verhaeghe", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Carter Verhaeghe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evan_Bouchard", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Evan Bouchard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zach_Hyman", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Zach Hyman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connor_Brown_(ice_hockey)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Connor Brown (ice hockey)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adam_Henrique", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Adam Henrique"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Ekblad", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Aaron Ekblad"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Short-handed", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Short-handed"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sportsnet", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sportsnet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goals_against_average", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Goals against average"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Browser_Based", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Browser Based", "wgt": 38}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Play_Groups", "label": "dmoz/Games/Play Groups", "wgt": 38}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Play_Groups/North_America", "label": "dmoz/Games/Play Groups/North America", "wgt": 37}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Play_Groups/Europe", "label": "dmoz/Games/Play Groups/Europe", "wgt": 37}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Developers_and_Publishers", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Developers and Publishers", "wgt": 38}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/nPJw7AO8G7drZDJtmzNyoA--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD04MDA7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/usa_today_sports_articles_558/75691c8add2c6ca3ebae02798666fac7", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9666028", "eventUri": "eng-9666028", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-01", "dateEnd": "2024-05-03", "textStart": 417, "textEnd": 428}], "sentiment": 0.411764705882353, "wgt": 130, "relevance": 1}

What pressure?\n\nThat is the attitude of the Florida Panthers are they prepare for their third chance to close out the Stanley Cup Final on Friday at the Edmonton Oilers.\n\nThe Panthers appeared well on their way to claiming the first championship in franchise history while winning the first three games of the best-of-seven series, but have dropped the last two games, the latest Tuesday's 5-3 loss in Sunrise, Fla.\n\nThe Panthers are doing their best to remain calm about the moment, knowing full well the screws will tighten if they drop this game and head to a deciding Game 7 at home.\n\n\"Go up there and we've got to win one game,\" forward Evan Rodrigues said. \"That's our mindset and that's what we're going to do.\"\n\nThat said, the Panthers are not sticking with status quo. Coach Paul Maurice appears set to make a couple of changes based on Thursday's practice. Left winger Carter Verhaeghe, in need of an offensive jolt, skated on the top line while fellow left winger Rodrigues switched spots and was moved to the second line.\n\nAs well, forward Nick Cousins received a present on his 31st birthday with news he will be back in the lineup in place of Kyle Okposo on the fourth line. Cousins had been a healthy scratch for the past eight postseason games.\n\n\"Those guys that have kind of come in and out of the lineup, you can just tell that it's not easy for them,\" Maurice said. \"But in their off-time, and being under less game intensity, they come back in and they're jacked.\"\n\nWhether those roster moves and the reset after last game are the tonic for the Panthers remains to be seen, but the Oilers have pulled back from the brink with a couple of outstanding performances.\n\nThey are looking to join only the 1942 Toronto Maple Leafs to win the Stanley Cup after losing the first three games of the finals.\n\n\"We feel very fortunate to be in this situation, but I know I have a team full of guys who are hungry to make sure they get to play two more games and not just one,\" coach Kris Knoblauch said.\n\nThe Oilers have executed the game plan perfectly to turn the tide. Not only have they won the last two games, but the victories came in emphatic fashion by a combined 13-4 score. Holding the Panthers in check while showing their high-octane offense has been an impressive feat.\n\n\"It's been lovely to see,\" goaltender Stuart Skinner said. \"I think we've got a lot of guys fully committed to playing both ends of the ice, which is an absolute need, especially at this time of the year.\"\n\nOf course it helps when the Oilers have Connor McDavid leading the way. McDavid, who is only the third player in NHL history to collect 40 points in a single postseason, posted consecutive four-point performances to elevate his team to this point in their comeback. He is at 42, only behind Wayne Gretzky with 47 in 1985, Mario Lemiuex with 44 in 1991 and Gretzky with 43 in 1988.\n\nThis year's playoff run has shown McDavid's ability to embrace the biggest of moments and excel during them.\n\n\"You spend your life working to get into a position like this. When you're here, you think there's going to be some magic feeling, but it's all been pretty normal,\" McDavid said. \"This has always been part of the plan for our group.

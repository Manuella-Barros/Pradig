This has been a highly touted quarterback class for years now with as many as six quarterbacks potentially being selected in the first round on Thursday night. And when there are that many talented signal-callers in the mix, things can always get crazy and a franchise's fortunes can change overnight -- though that applies to the good and bad.\n\nWith the potential historic number of quarterbacks being drafted and a number of other wild storylines in play, you won't want to miss a second of the draft. But what time will the NFL Draft start? We have that and everything else you need to know for Thursday night.\n\nWhat time does the NFL Draft start tonight, April 25?\n\nThe 2024 NFL Draft will start at 8 p.m. ET on Thursday night with the full first round -- 32 selections -- taking place on the first night of the draft. We always see the most spectacles and sights in the first round of the draft as NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell announces every pick made on the night and the majority of the prospects who are in attendance (if not all of them) hear their names called and get to take the stage with their new team's jersey.\n\nWhere is the 2024 NFL Draft?\n\nDetroit, Michigan is hosting the 2024 NFL Draft for all three rounds. This is the first time in league history that Detroit has hosted the draft and is part of a new tradition for this event wherein it's held at different NFL host cities throughout the country, which began as a concerted effort in 2017 when it was held in Philadelphia. The draft will take place at Campus Meritus Park in Detroit, part of the city's downtown area, and not at Ford Field, the home of the Lions.\n\nWho is going to be the No. 1 pick in the 2024 NFL Draft?\n\nThe Chicago Bears hold the No. 1 pick in the 2024 NFL Draft and are widely expected to select USC quarterback Caleb Williams. Williams has drawn lofty comparisons since winning the Heisman Trophy for the Trojans as a sophomore, including being mentioned as the \"next Patrick Mahomes\" on numerous occasions. His combination of athleticism, improvisational skills as a passer and runner, and elite arm, among other traits, make him one of the best overall quarterback prospects in the draft since Andrew Luck came out of Stanford.\n\nThe first round of the 2024 NFL Draft will be widely broadcast on the major NFL networks with live coverage from Detroit airing on NFL Network as well as on ABC and ESPN. There will be expert analysis on both networks -- Daniel Jeremiah, Bucky Brooks, Rich Eisen and more on NFL Network; Mel Kiper Jr., Matt Miller, Jordan Reid and more on ESPN and ABC -- breaking down every pick and giving you all of the scenes from the draft.\n\nThe NFL Draft can also be streamed on NFL.com and the NFL app once you log in with a paid cable or satellite subscription that includes NFL Network. The same is also true for Watch ESPN or watching on the ESPN app. Fans can also stream exclusive content on NFL+ and ESPN+ with a paid subscription to either service.", "source": {"uri": "fansided.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "FanSided"}, "authors": [{"uri": "cody_williams@fansided.com", "name": "Cody Williams", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draft_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Draft (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Quarterback"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "American football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detroit", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Detroit"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Detroit"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USC_Trojans_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "USC Trojans football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roger_Goodell", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Roger Goodell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caleb_Williams", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Caleb Williams"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patrick_Mahomes", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Patrick Mahomes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN+", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "ESPN+"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mel_Kiper_Jr.", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mel Kiper Jr."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanford_Cardinal_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Stanford Cardinal football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Jeremiah", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Daniel Jeremiah"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bucky_Brooks", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bucky Brooks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ford_Field", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ford Field"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rich_Eisen", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rich Eisen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Bears", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chicago Bears"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satellite_television", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Satellite television"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cable_television", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cable television"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Luck", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Andrew Luck"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NFL_Network", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NFL Network"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heisman_Trophy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Heisman Trophy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Broadcasting_Company", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "American Broadcasting Company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "ESPN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_app", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mobile app"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philadelphia", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian/Buzkashi", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian/Buzkashi", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Theme_Merchandise", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Theme Merchandise", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/CAD_and_CAM/2D_Drafting", "label": "dmoz/Computers/CAD and CAM/2D Drafting", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Fantasy", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Fantasy", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/CAD_and_CAM/Associations", "label": "dmoz/Computers/CAD and CAM/Associations", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 74}], "image": "https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_crop,w_5604,h_3152,x_0,y_200/c_fill,w_1440,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/images/GettyImages/mmsport/229/01hw7238an2pq9kcjq1z.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9509328", "eventUri": "eng-9509328", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-04-25", "textStart": 359, "textEnd": 367, "freq": 2}], "sentiment": 0.2156862745098038, "wgt": 212, "relevance": 1}

Something viewed as impossible or unlikely, as it was almost annually held from New York City. Until 2014, that is. The event moved to Chicago for two years, Philadelphia for one, then became traveling as part of a bidding process.\n\nNow, the league brings one of its biggest events to cities and fans around the country.\n\nIn 2024, the NFL Draft is headed to the Motor City. After years of bidding, Detroit was finally awarded as host of the NFL Draft. The event, while big in the football world, is also known for bringing in over $100,000 to the local economy. Everyone wins, especially Lions fans who are coming off their best season in 30 years.\n\nNowadays, the NFL Draft is more than a place where the next class of football greats are selected. It's an event for the community and for fanbases to celebrate the upcoming season. And for many, it's a once in a lifetime opportunity.\n\nSo if you've ever dreamed of going to the NFL Draft, here's how.\n\nMORE: Follow the ultimate guide to the 2024 NFL Draft, including sleepers, busts and more\n\nWhile it seems as though tickets to the NFL Draft would cost a pretty penny, they don't. It's actually a free event!\n\nThe NFL Draft Experience is another event surrounding the three-day draft. It lasts all day, Friday through Sunday, and is free for all. It takes place around Detroit's Campus Martius and Hart Plaza. Cities that previously hosted the draft typically see just less than half a million fans at the NFL Draft Experience\n\nThe event has plenty of interactive activities for everyone. Fans can take picture with the Lombardi Trophy and get autographs from current and former players. Children can also enjoy the experience with games and drills to show off their football skills. Detroit's culture will be celebrated through music, art and food and beverage concessions celebrating local cuisines.\n\nThose interested in going to the actual draft typically can't. Only invited ticket-holders can enter the draft theater for the main event.\n\nMORE: Complete 7-round NFL Mock Draft for 2024\n\nYou can register for the NFL Draft Experience using the NFL OnePass app or online here. It will be open all weekend during the following hours:\n\nThis year, the NFL Draft will be held from Thursday, April 25 to Saturday, April 27. Round 1 will be chosen on Thursday beginning at 8 p.m. ET, Rounds 2 and 3 will be selected Friday at 7 p.m. ET and the remaining selections will be decided Saturday beginning at noon ET.\n\nThis is the first time Detroit has hosted the annual event.\n\nWe don't know teams' exact schedules for 2024 yet, as that's a secret the NFL likes to keep until its official announcement. We do, however, know everyone's home and away opponents, just not dates and times.

The NFL Combine and Pro Days are all now in the books, and the Chicago Bears will be on the clock with the No. 1 overall pick in a matter of hours. The Bears are widely expected to select former USC quarterback and 2022 Heisman Trophy winner Caleb Williams, who is the -20000 favorite to be the No. 1 overall pick in the latest 2024 NFL Draft props. After the Bears make their pick official, life could get very interesting for NFL fans.\n\nThe top-five in the first round is rounded out by the Washington Commanders (2), New England Patriots (3), Arizona Cardinals (4), and Los Angeles Chargers (5). The Commanders and Patriots are in the market for an upgrade at quarterback, and with six quarterbacks receiving first-round buzz, there could be plenty of movement early on Thursday. Which 2024 NFL Draft player props should you target in your 2024 NFL Draft bets? Before locking in any 2024 NFL Draft prop bets of your own, you'll want to see what SprotsLine NFL expert Jason La Canfora has to say.\n\nLa Canfora has been covering the NFL since 2004 and spent 10 years as CBS's NFL Insider for \"THE NFL TODAY\" across all platforms. He continues to cover the NFL as an analyst and insider for The Washington Post and gathers information from a plethora of sources throughout the game.\n\nLa Canfora joined SportsLine as a wagering analyst in 2022, giving out weekly best bets and selections throughout the NFL season, appearing on live betting shows, and making other regular appearances on CBS Sports HQ and SportsLine. La Canfora finished last season on a blistering run, posting a 59-32 record on his NFL picks, returning more than $2,300 for $100 players. Anybody who followed along with those picks had a huge payday.\n\nNow he's turned his attention to the 2024 NFL Draft and has revealed his best prop bets and multiple longshot prop plays, including two that return 35-1. You can only see La Canfora's NFL Draft 2024 prop bet picks at SportsLine.\n\nTop 2024 NFL Draft prop picks\n\nOne of the 2024 NFL Draft prop bets La Canfora recommends: Take Michael Penix Jr. drafted 32nd overall or earlier. The former Washington standout was one of the most efficient and productive quarterbacks in the country in 2023, leading the Huskies to a conference title and berth in the College Football Playoff National Championship Game. He finished his final collegiate season with 4,903 yards, 36 touchdowns and 11 interceptions. Penix was outstanding as a passer in college and followed that up by displaying elite athleticism during pre-draft workouts, running a 4.46-second 40-yard-dash at Washington's Pro Day.\n\n\"I don't mess with this sort of payout very often, but I would here. The media made more of the medicals than any team I spoke to about him. I very easily could see him going to the Vikings, Broncos, Raiders or Seahawks in the first half of the first round, and frankly at this point would be surprised if he didn't land there. There's so much production and upside. He makes NFL throws and is more than a good enough athlete,\" La Canfora told SportsLine.\n\n\"I very easily could see him going to the Vikings, Broncos, Raiders, or Seahawks in the first half of the first round, and frankly at this point would be surprised if he didn't land there,\" La Canfora told SportsLine.

Does that bode well for the Lions in 2024?\n\nWhile Patrick Mahomes might have been a bigger factor in the Chiefs' championship run than the location of the draft, Lions fans will descend on the 2024 NFL Draft knowing their team has legitimate Super Bowl hopes for the upcoming season. That should only add energy to what is already a fun in-person experience.\n\nThe draft itself won't be all about the Lions. Detroit doesn't pick until No. 29 overall, and it's NFC North rival Chicago holding the No. 1 pick. But that doesn't mean Lions fans won't make their presence felt on the NFL's biggest night since February.\n\nHere's a look inside the NFL's Detroit setup for the draft and what fans can enjoy at the 2024 NFL Draft experience.\n\nSN's NFL DRAFT HQ\n\nLive picks tracker | 7-round mock draft | Top 250 big board\n\nThe official NFL Draft stage -- or \"NFL Draft theater,\" as the league calls it -- was constructed near Campus Martius Park in downtown Detroit. That's where commissioner Roger Goodell will welcome the next generation of NFL players to the league.\n\nConstruction of the stage began on March 29 and continued into mid-April. The venue is open-air but well-covered in case of rain, which could be a factor on Saturday, according to latest weather forecasts.\n\nNFL director of event operations Steve Farago told media outlets in mid-April that the theater is an \"ode to the spirit of Detroit statue\" that sits in downtown Detroit, explaining that the league is \"trying to pull that spirit and look and feel of downtown Detroit\" with its stage.\n\nThe stage will feature \"elaborate LED displays,\" according to the Detroit Free Press, with colors that will change accordingly as different teams are on the clock. In all, 50 million LED pixels will make up the theater's light operation.\n\nThe theater is expected to hold about 1,500 people each day and has about two million square feet in total.\n\nYes, the structure will also feature a green room for prospects who choose to attend the draft. Like the rest of the stage, the green room was constructed specifically for the draft.\n\nBy now, the construction of a stage is nothing new for the NFL. The league broke tradition and took the draft on the road in 2015, leaving Radio City Music Hall for Chicago, but it wasn't until 2017 that the league started creating its own venues for the event.\n\nFrom the NFL Draft on the Rocky Steps in Philadelphia in 2017 to the draft outside Union Station in Kansas City in 2023, the league has developed a routine leading up to the big weekend each year. Detroit appears fully ready to take on the NFL Draft in 2024.\n\nMORE: SN's ultimate guide to 2024 NFL Draft\n\nThe NFL Draft Experience, an annual fan favorite during draft weekend, is being held at Hart Plaza in downtown Detroit. The event is family-friendly and features everything from music to food vendors.\n\nMore than two dozen food vendors will come together to form the \"Taste of Detroit\" experience, blending different cuisines as NFL fans from across America descend on Detroit.\n\nFull details haven't been released for the NFL Draft Experience, but last year's events included kid-friendly games such as the 40-yard dash and vertical jump. Last year's fan experience in Kansas City also featured a replica NFL locker room and an autograph stage.\n\nFans must register to attend the events and will receive a QR code to gain entry once they register. Registration allows fans to attend all or any of the event's three days.\n\nThe 2024 NFL Draft will begin at 8 p.m. ET on Thursday, April 25. The Bears will start the draft with the No. 1 overall pick, and the end of the first round will conclude Day 1.\n\nDay 2 will begin at 7 p.m. ET on Friday, April 26. The second night of the draft will feature the second and third rounds. Rounds 4-7 will make up Day 3, which begins at noon ET on Saturday, April 27.\n\nAll seven rounds will be held at the NFL Draft theater at Campus Martius Park, not far from the NFL Draft Experience at Hart Plaza.", "source": {"uri": "sportingnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sporting News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draft_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Draft (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Downtown_Detroit", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Downtown Detroit"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detroit", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Detroit"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Detroit"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kansas_City,_Missouri", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kansas City, Missouri"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Kansas City, Missouri"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Sporting_News", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Sporting News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patrick_Mahomes", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Patrick Mahomes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vince_Lombardi_Trophy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Vince Lombardi Trophy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NFC_North", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NFC North"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kansas_City_Chiefs", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kansas City Chiefs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Bowl", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Super Bowl"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Campus_Martius_Park", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Campus Martius Park"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detroit_Free_Press", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Detroit Free Press"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roger_Goodell", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Roger Goodell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philip_A._Hart_Plaza", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Philip A.

White reveals his top NFL Draft longshot props for the 2024 NFL Draft in Detroit USATSI\n\nThe 2024 NFL Draft will be conducted in Detroit, with the festivities beginning with the first round on Thursday. The next two rounds take place Friday and the remaining four will be held on Saturday. A total of 257 players will be selected during the three-day event, with anywhere from four to six quarterbacks expected to be chosen in the opening round. As usual, speculation is running wild regarding which player will be drafted by which team. The only one that appears to be a sure thing is USC quarterback Caleb Williams, who is expected to be taken with the No. 1 overall pick by the Chicago Bears. The latest 2024 NFL Draft props list that happening at -20000 (risk $20,000 to win $100).\n\nNo one will become rich by making that wager, but anyone making 2024 NFL Draft prop bets will have plenty of other opportunities to cash in when the NFL Draft 2024 takes place. With so many 2024 NFL Draft prop picks available, help from an expert on longshot plays can go a long way. Before locking in any 2024 NFL Draft prop bets, you'll want to see what SportsLine NFL expert R.J. White has to say.\n\nWhite, a Fantasy and gambling editor for CBS Sports, consistently crushes against-the-spread picks and went 636-534-34 on his ATS picks from 2017-23, which returned almost $4,900 to $100 players.\n\nIn his time as a CBS Sports NFL editor, White was also widely recognized as one of the nation's premier NFL Draft experts. Every spring, he put together seven-round mock drafts read by millions, including trades he expects. No stone is left unturned in White's draft analysis.\n\nThis is the same expert who, very early in the 2018 draft process, bet Baker Mayfield to go No. 1 overall at 25-1. He also was ahead of the Trey Lance to 49ers prediction in 2021, giving it out at 3-1 on the Early Edge podcast.\n\nIn 2022, White hit five of his eight best bets at +200 or shorter odds, including Sauce Gardner to be a top-five pick at -120, Panthers to take an offensive lineman first at +110, Over 2 first-round safeties selected at +125, Aiden Hutchinson Over pick 1.5 at +140 and Kenny Pickett to be the first QB drafted at +140. He also hit on the Texans going defensive back first at +350, so anyone who followed along with those picks had a huge payday.\n\nNow, he's turned his attention to the 2024 NFL Draft and has revealed his 10 best longshot prop bets. You can only see White's NFL Draft 2024 longshot prop bet picks at SportsLine.\n\nTop 2024 NFL Draft longshot prop picks\n\nOne of the 2024 NFL Draft longshot prop bets White recommends: Take Brock Bowers being selected by the Denver Broncos on Thursday, which currently brings a +1000 (risk $100 to win $1000) payout. Denver's quarterback situation is not ideal, even after the team acquired Zach Wilson from the New York Jets to compete with Jarrett Stidham for the starting job, so taking a signal-caller at No. 12 is a possibility.\n\nHowever, the Broncos selection a quarterback isn't guaranteed. Enter Bowers, who is projected by many to be the NFL's next elite tight end. The 6-4, 240-pounder was the top target in Georgia's passing game during his three-year tenure with the Bulldogs, leading the team in receptions, receiving yards and touchdown catches each season. Despite appearing in only 10 contests in 2023, he hauled in 56 passes for 714 yards and six TDs. Bowers is an excellent blocker, drawing comparisons to George Kittle. While many predict the Jets will select Bowers with the 10th overall pick on Thursday, White sees the Broncos calling his name if he's still available when their turn comes.

Six former Bruins were selected in the 2022 NFL Draft, with tight end Greg Dulcich being the school's highest pick, and four more were taken in 2023.\n\nNFL Draft picks: 357\n\nFour former Longhorns who were taken in the NFL Draft went onto Hall of Fame careers, including the likes of Tom Landry, a former defensive back who won two Super Bowls and an NFL championship as head coach of the Dallas Cowboys.\n\nRunning back Earl Campbell was the No. 1 overall draft pick in 1978, taking his aggressive running style to the professional ranks, rushing for over 1,300 yards in five of his six seasons with the Houston Oilers, and was named a State Hero of Texas by the state legislature. Vince Young, who famously led Texas to its most recent national championship, was the No. 3 overall draft pick in 2006 to the Tennessee Titans.\n\nNFL Draft picks: 358\n\nAn astounding eight former Hurricanes that were taken in the NFL Draft were eventually selected for the Pro Football Hall of Fame: Ted Hendricks (1969), Jim Kelly (1983), Michael Irvin (1988), Cortez Kennedy (1990), Warren Sapp (1995), Ray Lewis (1996), Edgerrin James (1999), and Ed Reed (2002). A ninth, Jim Otto, was taken in the 1960 AFL Draft. At least one Miami player has been taken in a draft for 49 straight years and the 2001 national championship team made a record with an eventual 16 first round draft selections.\n\nNFL Draft picks: 360\n\nTwo future Hall of Famers went through the NFL Draft from Rocky Top, including defensive end Doug Atkins, the No. 11 overall pick by Cleveland in 1953 and made his impact during a legendary career with the Chicago Bears, helping to forever change the edge rusher position for the modern era.\n\nTennessee produced another revolutionary player in quarterback Peyton Manning, the No. 1 overall pick in 1998, winning two Super Bowl championships, claiming five NFL MVP honors, seven First-Team All Pro honors, 14 Pro Bowl selections, and earning three records: most TD passes in a season (55), in a game (7), and passing yards in a season (5,477).\n\nNFL Draft picks: 368\n\nThis may not be the college football powerhouse it was in the 90s or the 70s -- Nebraska hasn't produced a first-rounder since Prince Amukamara in 2011 -- but the Cornhuskers are still among the very best in terms of total NFL Draft output. Notably, Nebraska turned out both the No. 1 and No. 2 pick in 1984. The Huskers put out a pair of second-round picks in the 2022 NFL Draft.\n\nNFL Draft picks: 371\n\nGeorgia boasts five No. 1 overall draft picks all time, including two in the 21st century: quarterback Matthew Stafford in 2009 and defensive end Travon Walker in 2022, a year of some history by the resurgent Bulldogs program.\n\nIn 2022, defending national champion Georgia produced 15 total NFL Draft selections, establishing a new all-time record and breaking the former mark held by Ohio State in 2004 and LSU in 2020, with 14 players taken those years. As repeat national champs in the 2023 draft, the Bulldogs shared the national lead with 10 players selected.\n\nNFL Draft picks: 372\n\nFlorida produced a pair of top-five picks in the last few years, including Kyle Pitts, who went to Atlanta with the No. 4 last spring. Dante Fowler was the third-overall selection to Jacksonville in 2015. Florida had eight total draft picks in 2021, the program's most in six years., and it was third in the SEC with six picks in 2023.

UF had three picks in 2022, including first-round cornerback Kaiir Elam.\n\nNFL Draft picks: 375\n\nWhether the Tigers or national title contenders or not, you can always count on this program acquiring not only some of the fastest skill players, but also the most physical players at the line of scrimmage.\n\nLSU has produced 17 first-round draft picks in the last decade alone, five of which came off its 2019 national championship team. LSU placed second overall with 10 selections in 2022, behind only Georgia.\n\nNFL Draft picks: 381\n\nNFL teams took a chance on six former Penn Staters in the 2021 Draft, including Micah Parsons, the latest in a long line to come out of Linebacker U, and who emerged as one of the top defensive players in football in recent years. Penn State was second in the Big Ten, tied with Ohio State, with six draftees in 2023.\n\nRunning back Saquon Barkley was the No. 2 overall pick in 2018, the first first-rounder for PSU in eight years. Washington took Lions wideout Jahan Dotson in the first round in 2022, one of eight selections, the Big Ten's best mark.\n\nNFL Draft picks: 401\n\nBama produced a school-record six first-round picks in the 2021 NFL Draft, and had 10 players go overall in each of the 2022 and 2023 drafts, sharing a lead with Georgia with the most players taken in the '23 event.\n\nNick Saban has produced 47 first-round picks in his career, 41 at Alabama, which is more than Joe Paterno, who had 33 first-round picks over several decades. Alabama has totaled 46 first-round selections since 2000. Quarterback Bryce Young was the Crimson Tide's first No. 1 overall selection in the common draft era.+3\n\nNFL Draft picks: 401\n\nSeven-time Super Bowl champion -- and the consensus greatest player in NFL history -- Tom Brady highlights Michigan's all-time NFL Draft class since being taken in the sixth round of the 2000 NFL Draft.\n\nBut the Wolverines have also produced 28 other selections in the last three seasons, including eight in the 2021 event and led the Big Ten with nine selections in the 2023 NFL Draft. Michigan is top-10 all-time with 49 first-round picks.\n\nNFL Draft picks: 414\n\nSix former Sooners have been taken at No. 1 overall, including three quarterbacks since 2010 (Sam Bradford, Baker Mayfield, and Kyler Murray). Other first-overall picks including running back Billy Sims and defensive end Lee Roy Selmon. Oklahoma is top-10 among college football programs with 50 first-round picks all-time.\n\nNFL Draft picks: 485\n\nOne of the college football programs that has consistently turned out NFL Draft talent for decades, the Buckeyes saw 10 players go in the 2021 NFL Draft, and the scarlet and gray has produced first-rounders in every event since 2015. Ohio State also came out of the 2023 NFL Draft with the distinction of having produced the most first-round picks ever (90).\n\nNFL Draft picks: 523\n\nOne of two programs to turn out more than 500 draft picks all-time, USC is also second with 84 first-round selections, and has produced five No. 1 overall picks. Carson Palmer, O.J. Simpson, Keyshawn Johnson, Rickey Bell, and Ron Yary hold the distinction of going No. 1 overall out of Troy.\n\nNFL Draft picks: 525\n\nNotre Dame has built a football pedigree over generations that still leads the pack in producing NFL talent, just edging rival USC in the total number of players taken. Five former Irishers have gone No. 1 overall, but the last was in 1972. ND has turned out a draft class of six or more players six times in the last decade, and tied with Georgia for third overall with nine selections in the 2021 NFL Draft.", "source": {"uri": "si.com",

McCarthy in consideration during Round 1. Such a crowded playing field means we could see four signal-callers drafted within the first four picks of the 2024 NFL Draft, which would be an NFL record.

With the country's top college football prospects like Caleb Williams and Marvin Harrison Jr. set to join the NFL, here's a look at the best ways to watch the 89th annual NFL Draft for free starting Thursday, April 25 through Saturday, April 27. That includes a list of the best streaming services, and which ones have free trials or promotions for new customers looking to avoid paying for cable.\n\n* You can watch all seven rounds of the 2024 NFL Draft live for free with DirecTV Stream (free trial) or fuboTV (free trial), or watch all three nights of the Draft on the cheap with Sling Orange (promotional offers, cheapest streaming plans).\n\nAll seven rounds of the 2024 NFL Draft will air on ESPN, ABC, ESPN Deportes and NFL Network.\n\n* Multiple streaming services carry ESPN, but not all of them carry ABC, and not all of them offer a free trial. DirecTV Stream is the best bet for cord cutters looking to avoid paying for cable. DirecTV Stream offers a 7-day free trial and 90+ channels including ESPN and local ABC channels. Plus, right now you can add the Sports Pack ($14.99/month), which includes NFL Network, and save $30 on your first three months of service. You can watch the draft for free, and then decide if it's worth paying for more exciting sporting events in May, including the PGA Championship, Kentucky Derby and more.\n\n* The next best streaming service option is fuboTV, and honestly, this one is nearly an even match with DTV, above. fubo starts at $79.99 per month after a 7-day free trial, and offers 199 channels, including its own exclusive fubo Sports lineup. It includes ABC, ESPN and NFL Network in its basic package, but it starts with a 1,000 hour limit on DVR storage and 10-screen limit, vs. unlimited on both for DTV.\n\n* Sling is worth considering too, especially if you already plan on sticking around, and a free trial isn't important to you. Sling Orange, which includes ESPN, ESPN2 and 30 other channels, only costs $40 per month, and new subscribers get their first month half price ($20). That's a 50% cost reduction over the more premium live services above. You just might want to purchase an HDTV antenna to get local channels like ABC and CBS, since Sling doesn't typically carry them. NFL Network will also cost extra, but since you already have ESPN, that's not important for Draft viewing.\n\n* Finally, sports junkies should consider a subscription to ESPN+, which will include special draft programming, \"The Pat McAfee Show Draft Spectacular,\" for the first time this year. It won't include the main NFL Draft broadcasts, but the special will feature a wide range of personalities and analysts to breakdown picks while also emphasizing the Draft experience from a fan perspective. ESPN+ is also packed with exclusive sports content, including UFC Fight Nights and a huge selection of college and professional sports every day. It doesn't include a free trial, but you can bundle it with Hulu and Disney+ using the Disney Bundle for just $14.99 per month, and enjoy a massive discount.\n\nCable customers can also login on ESPN.com or ESPN apps with their cable credentials to stream all three games for free.\n\nThe NFL Draft begins with Round 1 on Thursday, April 25 at 8 p.m. ET/5 p.m. PT and the draft resumes on Friday, April 26 at 7 p.m. ET/4 p.m. PT, and finally rounds 4-7 on Saturday, April 27 at noon ET/9 a.m. PT. Here's a look at the complete schedule for the 2024 NFL Draft.\n\nThis year's draft will be held at Campus Martius Park and Hart Plaza in Detroit, Michigan.\n\nThe newly released NFL Draft hat collection features licensed hats for all 32 teams in multiple styles and colors, and it's all available on Fanatics.\n\nThe Buffalo Bills hold the No. 28 pick. Based on the past three drafts, Buffalo will not make their selection until after 11 p.m.", "source": {"uri": "syracuse.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "syracuse"}, "authors": [], "concepts":

It also marks a potential change for numerous organizations, who will get the chance to add high-end talent to their rosters.\n\nThe Bears are on the clock with the first pick, and they're expected to take a USC QB Caleb Williams. The 2022 Heisman winner has long been regarded as the top talent in the 2024 draft class, and Chicago is in line to bring in the talented quarterback as its starter.\n\nMORE: 2024 NFL Draft big board of top 257 players | Complete 7-round 2024 NFL Mock Draft | Who are the youngest players at 2024 NFL Draft?\n\nAfter that?

It gives Chicago the No. 1 and No. 9 picks in the draft.\n\nThe Vikings traded up into the first round earlier in the offseason, acquiring the No. 23 pick from the Texans, which previously belonged to the Browns. It gives Minnesota a pair of first-round picks -- No. 11 and No. 23.\n\nIn addition, the Cardinals have two first-round picks after acquiring the Texans' first-round pick last year when Houston moved up to No. 3 in the 2023 draft.

Below is a full guide on how to livestream the 2024 NFL draft -- even if you don't have cable -- plus an easy way to get a free NFL draft livestream (legally).\n\nThe 2024 NFL draft is being broadcast on live TV through ESPN, ABC, and NFL Network, and it's being streamed on ESPN+ and NFL+. In addition to those streaming services, cord-cutters can also watch the draft online using any live TV streaming service that carries ESPN, ABC, or NFL Network. Here are our top suggestions, including pricing and free trial information:\n\nDirecTV Stream's five-day free trial is one easy way to watch the NFL draft for free. The live TV streaming service carries ESPN and ABC in its Entertainment package (the most affordable plan) and you can add NFL Network by upgrading to the Choice package. If you want to keep service after the five-day free trial, the Entertainment plan costs $79.99 a month. See DirecTV Stream deals here.\n\nESPN+ is a more affordable option for watching the 2024 NFL draft online, although it doesn't offer a free trial. The service costs $10.99 a month, or $109.99 a year if you pay annually. You can also get ESPN+ through the Disney Bundle, which costs $14.99 a month and also includes Disney+ and Hulu (on-demand).\n\nAnother budget-friendly option for watching the 2024 NFL draft is NFL+ (this option also doesn't have a free trial, however). NFL+ costs just $6.99 a month, or $14.99 a month if you want access to NFL Redzone as well.\n\nAnother live TV streaming service that you can use to watch the 2024 NFL draft is Hulu + Live TV. This one also starts with a free trial (three days) before payment kicks in at $76.99 a month. The service carries ESPN, ABC, and NFL Network in its 95+ channel lineup, but you also get complimentary access to ESPN+, Disney+, and Hulu (on-demand).\n\nIf you want to watch the NFL Draft for free, use a free trial from either DirecTV Stream or Hulu + Live TV. DirecTV Stream's trial lasts for five days, and Hulu + Live TV's lasts for three, which means either one will be enough to stream the whole NFL draft for free. Just set a reminder to cancel before the trial is over to avoid being charged.\n\nThe 2024 NFL draft kicks off Thursday, April 25, with round 1. Rounds 2-7 happen on Friday and Saturday. Here's the full schedule:\n\nThe Chicago Bears get the first pick this year, followed by the Commanders and the Patriots to round out the top three.

So does beat writer Jeff McLane, who has the Eagles moving up to the No. 16 pick to select Toledo cornerback Quinyon Mitchell.\n\nIn his final mock draft, NFL Network analyst and former Eagles scout Daniel Jeremiah predicts the Birds will move all the way up to the No. 12 pick to select explosive Oregon State offensive tackle Taliese Fuaga.\n\nDuring the first round, each team has 10 minutes to make its pick. If the Birds still have the No. 22 pick, expect the Eagles to be on the clock for their selection around 10:40 p.m., based on the pace of the last few years.\n\nHere's everything you need to know to watch and stream this year's NFL draft:\n\nThe 2024 NFL draft is scheduled to begin at 8 p.m. Eastern and run through 11:30 p.m. In addition to airing on ABC, ESPN, ESPN2, and the NFL Network, the draft will also stream on the ABC app, the ESPN app, the NFL app, NFL+ (the league's subscription service) and on NFL.com (cable authentication is required).\n\nHere's how television networks are planning to cover the draft.\n\nFor the sixth-straight year, ABC will air its own coverage of the NFL draft on Thursday and Friday focused more on the personal stories of the prospects than their specific impact on the field. Rece Davis will host ABC's main coverage alongside analysts Kirk Herbstreit, Desmond Howard, and Field Yates. Former Alabama head coach Nick Sabban will also make his debut as an ESPN analyst.\n\nNot returning to ABC's coverage this year is analyst Todd McShay, who was among those laid off by ESPN in June 2023. He's sitting this year's draft out on TV due to \"obvious contract limitations\" but has been offering his analysis on social media and various podcasts, including Pardon My Take and The Ryen Russilo Podcast.\n\nThis will be ESPN's 45th year broadcasting the NFL draft, dating back to 1980. Anchoring the network's draft coverage for the third straight year will be Get Up! host Mike Greenberg. On Thursday and Friday he'll be joined by analysts Louis Riddick, Booger McFarland, and Mel Kiper Jr., who is working his 41st NFL draft and still does not own a cell phone (though he does have at least four landlines).\n\nOne voice that will be missed is Chris Mortensen, the celebrated NFL reporter who died in March after a long battle with cancer. Alongside NFL insider Adam Schefter this year will be college football reporter Molly McGrath, who is making her NFL draft debut.\n\nAn added complication this year is the NBA playoffs. On Friday night, the second and third rounds of the NFL draft will air on ESPN2, since ESPN will be broadcasting NBA playoff games beginning at 5:30 p.m.\n\nFor the 18th year, NFL Network will have its own coverage, hosted by Rich Eisen. He'll be joined by NFL Network analyst Daniel Jeremiah, CBS analyst Charles Davis, Hall of Famer Kurt Warner, and Fox Sports lead college football analyst Joel Klatt.\n\nFormer New England Patriots head coach Bill Belichick will join Pat McAfee in a special NFL draft version of his show tonight beginning at 8 p.m., which will stream on ESPN+ and for free on YouTube. McAfee's regular crew will also be part of the draft coverage, which includes Conor Campbell, Ty Schmit, Tone Digs and former Green Bay Packers linebacker AJ Hawk.\n\nFor the sixth straight season, ESPN Deportes will cover every round in Spanish. The network's broadcast will feature Monday Night Football announcers Eduardo Varela and Pablo Viruega, among others.\n\nAfter spending nearly 50 years in New York City, the NFL decided to venture out of Radio City Music Hall and hit the road with the NFL draft. Since holding the draft in Chicago in 2015, the NFL has moved from city to city, including a stop in Philadelphia in 2017.\n\nThis year's traveling road show is taking place in downtown Detroit, with the main stage set up near Campus Martius Park. Organizers are expecting as many as 400,000 people to travel to Motown for the draft, according to the Detroit News.\n\nNext year, the draft is scheduled to take place in Green Bay inside and around Lambeau Field and Titletown.\n\nThree teams entered Thursday with 11 picks each in the 2024 NFL draft -- the Arizona Cardinals, Green Bay Packers, and Los Angeles Rams. It's the second straight season the Packers will enter the draft with 12 picks.\n\nThe Chicago Bears have the fewest, holding just four picks. Two of those are in the first round tonight, including the No. 1 overall pick.\n\nOverall, the Eagles have eight picks entering the 2024 NFL draft, though general manager Howie Roseman isn't known for quiet draft days. Since Roseman took over as general manager in 2010, the Eagles have made trades and shifted picks in just about every draft (though Roseman lost his power to do so to former head coach Chip Kelly in 2015).\n\nLast year, Roseman and the Eagles traded up to draft defensive tackle Jalen Carter with the No. 9 pick. The year before, the Eagles moved up two spots in the first round to snag fellow defensive tackle Jordan Davis with the No. 13 pick.\n\nIn addition to their two first-round picks this year, the Birds have one pick in the second round, one in the third, and two in the seventh. Here's the full breakdown:\n\n\" READ MORE: 2024 NFL draft: Rating 15 potential first-round targets for the Eagles\n\nThe Chicago Bears hold the No. 1 pick in the draft for the first time since 1947, when they selected halfback Bob Fenimore, a College Football Hall of Famer know as the \"Blond Bomber.\" Hopefully this year's top pick goes better for the Bears, as Fenimore only played a single season for Chicago before injuries forced him off the field.\n\nThe Bears' more recent pick in the top five was in 2017, when they took quarterback Mitch Trubisky with the No. 2 overall pick. That pick didn't pan out either, as Trubisky lasted just four seasons in Chicago and is now on his second stint with the Buffalo Bills as a backup.\n\nThree teams don't have a single first-round pick:

More than 200 former college standouts will continue their careers at the professional level.\n\nThanks to a talented group of players at key positions like quarterback and wide receiver, there's plenty of intrigue surrounding Round 1 Thursday night.\n\nHere are some of the latest rumors about what could happen tomorrow night in Detroit:\n\nWho goes at the top? Latest NFL mock draft picks for top 5 players at 2024 NFL Draft\n\nLSU quarterback and 2023 Heisman Trophy winner Daniels is predicted to be a top-three pick in the 2024 NFL Draft. Currently, the Chicago Bears hold the No. 1 overall pick, followed by the Washington Commanders at No. 2 and the New England Patriots at No. 3.\n\nMultiple teams have inquired about trading into the top three for Daniels or one of the other top quarterback prospects in this class. Per NFL Network's Mike Garafolo, the Las Vegas Raiders are one of those teams to contact Washington regarding a trade.\n\nThe Athletic's Dianna Russini reports that Daniels is \"cool\" with going to Washington but a \"dream world\" scenario would be reuniting with his former college coach and current Raiders head coach Antonio Pierce.\n\n2024 NFL mock draft: Six QBs make first-round cut as trade possibilities remain\n\nMaking the leap: Small school prospects to know for the 2024 NFL draft\n\nESPN NFL Insider Dan Graziano reported Wednesday that Maye is New York's favorite quarterback in the first round. But if a deal doesn't materialize for the Giants to trade up, Graziano says team officials like Washington quarterback Michael Penix Jr. as well.\n\n\"I've been told the Giants and Vikings are the two teams that have been most active in discussions with the Patriots about the No. 3 pick,\" Graziano wrote in a column Wednesday. \"And that if Washington takes Daniels at No. 2, the Giants would be very interested in trading up to No. 3 for Maye.\"\n\nGraziano added that the Giants may be willing to take Penix Jr. as early as No. 6.\n\nNew England has been less clear about their top-three selection than Chicago or Washington. De-facto general manager Eliot Wolf told reporters last week that the Patriots are \"open for business\" in trade talks.\n\nIn the days leading up to the draft, that seems to have changed. Sports Illustrated's senior NFL reporter Albert Breer said this morning on Instagram he feels that \"Drake Maye is going to become a New England Patriot.\"\n\nBreer added that the team will listen to offers up until they're on the clock in Round 1 but he feels pretty good they'll go with Maye.\n\n'Is this real?': After unique football path, Qwan'tez Stiggers on verge of NFL draft dream\n\nThe 2024 NFL Draft features a talented crop of wide receiver prospects. After the consensus top three - Marvin Harrison Jr., Rome Odunze, and Malik Nabers in some order - there's a drop-off to the next crop of prospects.\n\nLSU's Brian Thomas Jr. is commonly the fourth wide receiver taken in mock drafts, including the latest USA Today mock draft. But ESPN's Jeremy Fowler says Texas' Xavier Worthy is in the conversation for the fourth wide receiver drafted in Round 1 with Thomas Jr.\n\nWorthy set an NFL Scouting Combine record in the 40-yard dash with a 4.21 official time and that could power a rise to Round 1.\n\n2024 NFL draft rankings: Caleb Williams, Marvin Harrison Jr. lead top 50 players\n\nThe 2024 NFL Draft is widely considered a weaker class for the off-ball linebacker position but one player could make it into the first round: Michigan's Junior Colson.\n\nNFL Network insider Tom Pelissero included Colson in his annual list of four potential surprise first round players.\n\nPelissero notes the former Wolverine star won the Lott IMPACT trophy in 2023. The two prior winners, Will Anderson Jr. in 2022 and fellow Michigan star Aidan Hutchinson in 2021, were both top-five selections in their respective draft classes.\n\nThis article originally appeared

Seven of first 13 teams selecting in the draft have quarterback needs or quarterback questions. Four of the top QB prospects are nearly guaranteed to go in the top 10.\n\nThe NFL has more teams that need quarterbacks heading into the 2024 NFL Draft than there are elite quarterbacks available.\n\nThat clear-cut case of supply and demand could lead to a record-tying number of quarterbacks being drafted in the first round of the 2024 NFL Draft on April 25 in Detroit. The record was set with six quarterbacks taken in the first round of the 1983 NFL Draft, when legends like John Elway, Dan Marino, and Jim Kelly were selected.\n\nESPN's Adam Schefter went on The Rich Eisen Show on April 23 to break down the ins and outs of the massive demand for quarterbacks (via X:)\n\nThere aren't enough quarterbacks to go around. There just aren't. So even if you're not as good or you're grade isn't as high, the chances are you're gonna get elevated because of the need. The demand exceeds the supply, so based on that I say we get six in the first round, including Michael Penix.\n\nThe quarterbacks Schefter has projected to go in the first round are USC's Caleb Williams, LSU's Jayden Daniels, North Carolina's Drake Maye, Michigan's J.J. McCarthy, Washington's Michael Penix Jr. and Oregon's Bo Nix.\n\nThere are seven teams in the first 13 picks that have clear needs or clear questions at quarterback; the Chicago Bears (No. 1), Washington Commanders (No. 2), New England Patriots (No. 3), New York Giants (No. 6), Minnesota Vikings (No. 11), Denver Broncos (No. 12) and Las Vegas Raiders (No. 13).\n\nEven teams later in the first round have questions at quarterback that need to be resolved -- the Los Angeles Rams have an aging starter in Matthew Stafford, Dallas Cowboys quarterback Dak Prescott is in the final year of a four-year, $160 million contract, and the Seattle Seahawks have a good-but-not-great option in starter Geno Smith.\n\nHistory shows us that the need to get a franchise quarterback in place could lead to not only a record run of quarterbacks taken in the 2024 draft but, perhaps, some surprises as well.\n\nRelated Ranking the Top 10 First-Round Quarterbacks Drafted in the Last Decade There have been 32 quarterbacks drafted in the first round of the NFL draft since 2014 and this group has separated themselves from the pack. Who Could Shock the NFL by Making a Move up in 2024? K.C. came out of nowhere to get Patrick Mahomes in 2017, shocking Draft experts\n\nOne team in recent history that changed its fortunes by making a move up to select a quarterback in the NFL Draft was the Kansas City Chiefs, who traded up to take Texas Tech quarterback Patrick Mahomes at No. 10 overall in 2017. It was a move that wasn't on the radars of any top draft experts.\n\nSeven years and three Super Bowl wins later, it's arguably the greatest draft-day move in NFL history.\n\nGIVEMESPORT Key Stat: The Chicago Bears traded up to select North Carolina's Mitch Trubisky at No. 2 overall in the 2017 NFL Draft, passing on Texas Tech quarterback and future three-time Super Bowl champion and two-time NFL MVP Patrick Mahomes. Since then, Trubisky has gone 31-26 as a starter with a 85.5 passer rating while Mahomes has racked up a 74-22 record with a sparkling 103.5 passer rating.\n\nThe 1983 draft, with its record six quarterbacks taken in the first round, also tells us that no matter how many are taken, there are always going to be winners and losers.\n\nFrom the 1983 draft, Elway (No. 1), Kelly (No. 14), and Marino (No. 27) all ended up landing in the Pro Football Hall of Fame.\n\nOn the flip side, Todd Blackledge (No. 7) and Tony Eason (No. 15) never made a Pro Bowl, while Ken O'Brien (No. 24) finished his career with a 50-59-1 record as a starter.\n\nAll stats courtesy of Pro Football Reference unless stated otherwise.

My second-to-last mock.\n\nTeams' needs have changed drastically with all the transactions in free agency, impacting how they approach the top prospects in the draft. Some teams that looked to be in the market for certain positions among the 2024 NFL rookie class may be going in a different direction than a few weeks back.\n\nHence, I've created the 2024 NFL Draft Needs For All 32 NFL Teams Post-Free Agency - as my guide to align this latest mock draft with what NFL teams will do when they are on the clock. I've also conducted a deep dive into the historical trends of each team's major decision-makers to project how they will approach Round 1 of the NFL Draft.\n\nNote that I will also be using my remaining mock drafts following the \"Huddle Reports\" mock draft contest. The rules are simple: One point for a player selected in Round 1. A player matched to a team is worth two points. Ergo, it's more important to me in this exercise to focus on player-to-team and players selected in Round 1 generally, not so much on where a player is selected (numerically).\n\nAs a bonus (we love extra content), I took a look back at how past mock drafts have fared since 2018. Just some food for thought as you put the final touches on your personal mock draft. You can find it here along with my full latest 2024 NFL Mock Draft.\n\nI used that information - along with the data I found in my team's needs and historical trends articles - to construct this mock.

What are the biggest NFL Draft day trades ever?\n\nThe NFL Draft is obviously most known for the actual picks. There is a lot to look forward to during the draft. There are draft day steals, players who surprisingly fall down the board, players who become draft busts, and much more. Year-round, teams and fans look forward to what selections will be made during the draft, but draft picks aren't the only massive transactions that happen on draft day.\n\nTrades are also a big part of the draft process. Teams are always moving up and down the draft board, moving up to target players they like or moving down to add more capital. There have been some massive picks on draft day, but there have also been some league-altering trades that were made on the day of the draft, despite the fact that teams can trade year around (except for after the trade deadline).\n\nWith the 2024 NFL Draft right around the corner, we decided to give you a break from looking at the mock drafts and instead update our list of the most shocking and game-changing NFL Draft day trades ever.\n\nCowboys trade for Emmitt Smith\n\nThe groundwork for Dallas' return to contention was made through the NFL Draft with the selections of Michael Irvin and Troy Aikman in 1988 and 1989, respectively.\n\nWith their offense seemingly set in stone, the Cowboys traded its first and third-round picks with the hopes of selecting linebacker James Francis in the 1990 NFL Draft. However, the Bengals got Francis with the 12th pick, causing Dallas to go another route.\n\nThe Cowboys used the 17th NFL Draft pick on running back Emmitt Smith to form \"The Triplets.\" With Aikman calling the shots and Irvin doing damage down the field, Smith tore defenses with his explosive rushes as a reinvigorated Cowboys squad was able to take home three Vince Lombardi trophies in the 1990s.\n\nPatriots trade for Randy Moss\n\nBy 2007, Randy Moss has established himself as one of the most feared wide receivers in the league. However, it was also a time of unhappiness when Moss openly voiced his displeasure in two challenging seasons with the Raiders.\n\nBill Belichick and the Patriots swooped in on the opportunity and traded their fourth-round NFL Draft selection in exchange for the uber-talented Moss. His partnership with Tom Brady proved to be one of the most lethal quarterback/wide receiver combinations the league has ever seen as the Patriots dismantled their opposition, shattering numerous offensive records en route to just the fourth undefeated regular season in NFL history.\n\nDespite Moss' terrific three-year stint, the Patriots did not offer him a contract extension and would be released in 2010. Moss would make a brief homecoming with the Vikings thereafter before calling it quits in 2012.\n\n49ers get a tremendous lift with Jerry Rice\n\nPut this NFL Draft story in the \"rich get richer\" category.\n\nThe 49ers were just three months removed from their Super Bowl XIX victory over the Dolphins when they selected Jerry Rice with the 16th overall pick of the 1985 NFL Draft. Head Coach Bill Walsh was reportedly so impressed with Rice that the former decided to trade away 49ers' first two selections to the Patriots.\n\nWalsh's intuitions in that NFL Draft proved to be true: Rice would leave his indelible mark with the 49ers. By his fourth season, \"Flash 80\" led San Francisco to its third Super Bowl victory, earning Most Valuable Player honors in the process.\n\nRice spent 16 of his 20 playing seasons with the Niners, ranking number one overall in most of the franchise's all-time offensive ranks.\n\nChargers and Giants swap quarterbacks\n\nEli Manning was considered to be the top prize in the 2004 NFL Draft, and logic would dictate that the then-San Diego Chargers will use their number one overall selection on the second generation quarterback.\n\nThere was one big problem, though. Eli Manning openly stated to the public that he did not want to be a Charger. General Manager A.J. Smith drafted Manning anyway and worked out a deal with the Giants in exchange for two 2005 NFL Draft picks, Nate Kaeding, Shawne Merriman, and Philip Rivers.\n\nIn hindsight, the NFL Draft day trade proved to be beneficial for both teams as Rivers would go on to have a solid 16-year career with the Chargers, earning eight Pro Bowls in the process and leading the Bolts to five NFC West Titles.\n\nManning would also lead the Giants to a period of success in his tenure, with his crowning glory coming in the form of besting Tom Brady and the Patriots in the Super Bowl. Twice.\n\nSaints go all-in for Ricky Williams\n\nEight draft picks. That was the price Saints Head Coach Mike Ditka was willing to pay to select Ricky Willams with the fifth overall pick of the 1999 Draft. While interest for Williams was warranted as the reigning Heisman Trophy winner, eyebrows were raised with Ditka's approach of trading away most of the Saints' immediate future.\n\nDitka was so fascinated with his newly acquired talent that he was willing to hand out a contract reportedly amassing to $68M before Williams was even able to step foot to the professional gridiron.", "source":

White reveals his top NFL Draft longshot props for the 2024 NFL Draft in Detroit USATSI\n\nWhat is arguably the most high-profile position in sports will be the main focus for a number of teams starting Thursday, when the first round of the 2024 NFL Draft takes place in Detroit. It's believed that as many as six quarterbacks could be among the first 32 NFL Draft picks, and some experts think four may be off the board by the time the New York Giants step up to the podium with the No. 6 overall pick. While 2023 Heisman Trophy winner Jayden Daniels, national champion J.J. McCarthy, Drake Maye, Michael Penix Jr. and Bo Nix ponder which NFL city they will call home, Caleb Williams likely has his living accommodations for the fall and winter already locked down.\n\nOnce the Chicago Bears traded Justin Fields to the Pittsburgh Steelers in mid-March, speculation as to whether or not the team would make him the No. 1 overall pick in the NFL Draft 2024 all but ended. Since the selection basically is a foregone conclusion, it is -20000 (risk $20,000 to win $100) in the latest NFL Draft odds. Since that is a bet that won't have you seeing dollar signs, you might want to consider the multitude of 2024 NFL Draft prop picks that are available. With so many 2024 NFL Draft prop picks available, help from an expert on longshot plays can go a long way. Before locking in any 2024 NFL Draft prop bets, you'll want to see what SportsLine NFL expert R.J. White has to say.\n\nWhite, a Fantasy and gambling editor for CBS Sports, consistently crushes against-the-spread picks and went 636-534-34 on his ATS picks from 2017-23, which returned almost $4,900 to $100 players.\n\nIn his time as a CBS Sports NFL editor, White was also widely recognized as one of the nation's premier NFL Draft experts. Every spring, he put together seven-round mock drafts read by millions, including trades he expects. No stone is left unturned in White's draft analysis.\n\nThis is the same expert who, very early in the 2018 draft process, bet Baker Mayfield to go No. 1 overall at 25-1. He also was ahead of the Trey Lance to 49ers prediction in 2021, giving it out at 3-1 on the Early Edge podcast.\n\nIn 2022, White hit five of his eight best bets at +200 or shorter odds, including Sauce Gardner to be a top-five pick at -120, Panthers to take an offensive lineman first at +110, Over 2 first-round safeties selected at +125, Aiden Hutchinson Over pick 1.5 at +140 and Kenny Pickett to be the first QB drafted at +140. He also hit on the Texans going defensive back first at +350, so anyone who followed along with those picks had a huge payday.\n\nNow, he's turned his attention to the 2024 NFL Draft and has revealed his 10 best longshot prop bets. You can only see White's NFL Draft 2024 longshot prop bet picks at SportsLine.\n\nTop 2024 NFL Draft longshot prop picks\n\nOne of the 2024 NFL Draft longshot prop bets White recommends: Take Brock Bowers being selected by the Denver Broncos on Thursday, which currently brings a +1000 (risk $100 to win $1000) payout. The Broncos likely have their eye on one of the five top quarterback prospects not named Williams, but it's possible that player could already have a home by the time they're on the board with the No. 12 pick. If Denver decides to shift gears and go in a different direction at that point, White believes selecting Bowers would be an excellent option.\n\nA key member of Georgia's back-to-back national championship-winning teams in 2021 and 2022, Bowers led the team in receptions (56), receiving yards (714) and touchdown catches (six) for the third consecutive season in 2023. The 6-4, 240-pound appeared in only 10 games last year but still won his second straight John Mackey Award as the top collegiate tight end in the nation, becoming the first player since its inception in 2000 to earn the honor twice. Bowers posted 10 100-yard performances over his three seasons with the Bulldogs and gained over 150 yards on three occasions, including a 152-yard effort in Georgia's rout of TCU in the 2022 National Championship Game. Bowers is expected by many to be the next great tight end in the NFL and has been compared to Rob Gronkowski and George Kittle, so White's prediction that he lands in the Mile High City could be an accurate one. See which other NFL Draft longshot props White loves here.\n\nHow to make 2024 NFL Draft longshot predictions\n\nWhite also loves nine other underdog props and is releasing a monster 150-1 longshot pick. You can only see which 2024 NFL Draft longshot prop bets to jump on at SportsLine.\n\nWhat are the 10 best 2023 NFL Draft longshot prop bets you can make?

Three teams -- the Carolina Panthers, Houston Texans, and Cleveland Browns -- don't currently have a first-round pick this year due to trades they've made in previous years.\n\nNonetheless, some big college stars are expected to hear their names called early on night one.

Comparisons with Aaron Rodgers - for years the scourge of Chicago - haven't helped matters, while it's abundantly clear that most Bears fans would have just preferred to keep hold of Justin Fields.\n\nConsider also that Williams hails from Washington, D.C., and the Commanders hold the No.2 pick, and you get an idea of where his mind's at.\n\nJJ McCarthy is expected to be the next quarterback to go, though the fact he coasted with an all-conquering Michigan team could count against him. Ohio State's Marvin Harrison Jr., Washington's Rome Odunze and LSU's Malik Nabers are the most coveted wide receivers. Georgia's Brock Bowers is the top tight end, and the fantastically named Qwan'tez Stiggers looks set to put the Canadian Football League on the map.\n\nHere's everything you need to know to watch NFL Draft 2024 online, plus the full schedule, TV channels and all the live stream information, with or without cable.\n\nBut what if you're based there but aren't at home to catch that free NFL Draft coverage?

We'll show you how to do that below.\n\nAway from home at the moment and blocked from watching the show on your usual subscription?\n\nYou can still watch the NFL Draft live stream online thanks to the wonders of a VPN (Virtual Private Network). The software allows your devices to appear to be back in your home country regardless of where in the world you are. So ideal for fans away on vacation or on business. Our favorite is NordVPN. It's the best on the market:\n\n2. Choose the location you wish to connect to in the VPN app. For instance if you're in the U.S. and want to view an Australian service, you'd select Australia from the list.\n\n3. Sit back and enjoy the action. Head to 7Plus or another website and watch the 2024 NFL Draft live stream.\n\nIn the U.S., the 2024 NFL Draft is being shown on ESPN, ESPN2, ABC/ESPN3 and NFL Network.\n\nIf you've already cut the cord and don't have a cable package, you can get all of those channels through an OTT cable TV alternative.\n\nSling TV is one of the better options. It includes ESPN, ESPN2 and ESPN3 in its Orange plan, with prices starting from $40/month and your first month half-price.\n\nAlternatively, ABC and NFL Network are included in its $45 per month Blue plan.\n\nSky Sports has the rights to NFL Draft live streams in the U.K., so if you already have a Sky subscription that doesn't include Sports, you'll need to pay \u00a318/month to add those channels.\n\nWhichever package you go for, you'll also gain access to coverage in 4K and HDR, so long as you also have an HDR-ready Sky Q box and HLG-compatible TV.\n\nSky Glass is another option. This gives you Sky TV within a 4K TV that has a built-in Dolby Atmos soundbar, and without the need for a dish. Prices start at \u00a314/month for the TV, plus a Sky sub on top of that.\n\nIf you don't want to shell out for a full Sky subscription, you could also consider its Now Sports streaming service. This gives you 24-hour access for \u00a311.99 or month-long access for \u00a334.99.\n\nIf you're not interested in Sky, NFL Game Pass on DAZN is showing the NFL Draft for \u00a38.99.\n\nAll sounds great, right? But if you're not in the UK, you can still follow NFL Draft live streams by using one of the best VPN services, such as NordVPN.\n\nTSN has the rights to show 2024 NFL Draft live streams in Canada.\n\nIf you don't have cable, you could subscribe to TSN+ instead, which lets you get access to all TSN has to offer on an $8/month or $80/year subscription basis.\n\nIn Australia, the 2024 NFL Draft live stream of the first round will be shown on the free 7Mate TV channel and 7Plus streaming service.\n\nEvery round, meanwhile, will be shown on ESPN via Foxtel.\n\nDon't have Foxtel and don't want to subscribe? Specialist streaming service Kayo Sports is also showing the NFL Draft, with its affordable, commitment-free plans starting from just $25/month, and hosting plenty of NBA basketball, cricket, AFL, rugby, F1 and loads of other live sports besides.\n\nThere's also a 7-day FREE trial for anybody who hasn't used the service before.\n\nNot in Australia right now? You can simply use a VPN like NordVPN to watch all the action on your account as if you were back home.", "source": {"uri": "tomsguide.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Tom's Guide"}, "authors": [],

Why trust us?\n\nThe 2024 NFL Draft gets underway tonight. For 257 prospects, it's the culmination of years of hard work, and for 32 teams, it's the introduction to integral pieces that will shape the future of their franchise.\n\nContents Is There a Free NFL Draft 2024 Live Stream?The Cheapest Way to Watch the NFL Draft 2024 Live StreamHow to Watch NFL Draft 2024 Live Stream from Abroad\n\nRound 1 of the draft starts on Thursday, April 25, at 8:00 p.m. ET, while Rounds 2 and 3 will start Friday at 7:00 p.m. ET, and Rounds 4 through 7 will start Saturday at 12:00 p.m. ET.\n\nCoverage of all three rounds will be on ABC, ESPN and NFL Network, but if you don't have cable or those channels, we've compiled all the different ways you can watch a live stream of the 2024 NFL Draft for free or cheap.\n\nRelated Arsenal vs Chelsea live stream: Can you watch for free? Real Madrid vs Barcelona live stream: Can you watch for free? Watch Haney vs Garcia live stream: PPV time, price, undercard\n\nIs There a Free NFL Draft 2024 Live Stream?\n\nOf all the live-TV streaming services, there are three that include the channels we're looking for and come with a free trial, allowing us to watch this weekends NFL draft without paying anything: Fubo, YouTube TV and DirecTV Stream.\n\nWith Fubo, the \"Pro\" channel package includes ABC (live in most markets), ESPN, NFL Network and a massive 190-plus live TV channels. It comes with a seven-day free trial.\n\nYouTube TV's \"Base Plan\" includes ABC (live in most markets0, ESPN, NFL Network and 100-plus channels. It comes with a five-day free trial, though you're able to watch for free for 20 minutes before you need to sign up.\n\nFinally, DirecTV Stream has four different channel packages. All four, starting with \"Entertainment,\" will get you ABC (live in most markets) and ESPN, while you'll need the \"Choice\" and up bundles for NFL Network. You can include any package in your free five-day trial.\n\nThe Cheapest Way to Watch the NFL Draft 2024 Live Stream\n\nObviously, it doesn't get cheaper than a free trial. However, if we take those out of the equation-or if you've already used up your Fubo, YouTube TV and DirecTV Stream free trials-then Sling TV becomes the cheapest way to watch a live stream of the 2024 NFL Draft.\n\nDepending on which coverage you want to watch, you can go with either the \"Sling Orange\" channel package, which includes ESPN and 31 other live-TV channels, or \"Sling Blue,\" which has NFL Network and 38 other channels.\n\nBoth packages cost $40 per month, which is already less expensive than any other live-TV streaming service with either ESPN or NFL Network, but they're each currently on sale for just $30 for your first month.\n\nFor the basketball fans out there looking for an NBA playoffs live stream, the \"Sling Orange\" plus \"Sports Extra\" bundle is also the cheapest way to get every channel you need to watch every single game. That would be just $41 for your first month, and then $51 per month after that.\n\nHow to Watch NFL Draft 2024 Live Stream from Abroad\n\nIf you find yourself in a country without a way to watch the NFL draft, you can combine one of the aforementioned streaming services with a virtual private network (VPN). All of those streaming sites are US-only, but a VPN hides your location and allows you to bypass geo-locks, thus letting you access content online as if you were physically in the United States.\n\nYou can check out our lists of the best VPN services and the best VPN deals for a detailed rundown of a lot of good options, but we would start with NordVPN. It's easily one of the safest and fastest VPN's out there, plus it comes with a 30-day money-back guarantee.\n\nEditors' Recommendations Atalanta vs Fiorentina live stream: Can you watch for free?

The 2024 NFL Draft begins on Thursday, April 25 in Detroit, Michigan. The early rounds are expected to be heavy on offensive players being selected with up to six quarterbacks being mentioned as potential first round picks during the pre-draft process. Former USC quarterback is the overwhelming -20000 favorite to be selected by the Chicago Bears with the No. 1 overall pick. The Bears are followed in the top five by the Washington Commanders, New England Patriots, Arizona Cardinals, and Los Angeles Chargers.\n\nThe Commanders are also expected to target a quarterback at No. 2 overall, with 2023 Heisman Trophy winner Jayden Daniels listed as the -185 favorite to be selected in that spot. Will Washington end up selecting Daniels, or will they target someone like Drake Maye (+175) or J.J. McCarthy (+800)? Which 2024 NFL Draft prop picks should you lock in? Before locking in any 2024 NFL Draft prop bets of your own, you'll want to see what SprotsLine NFL expert Jason La Canfora has to say.\n\nLa Canfora has been covering the NFL since 2004 and spent 10 years as CBS's NFL Insider for \"THE NFL TODAY\" across all platforms. He continues to cover the NFL as an analyst and insider for The Washington Post and gathers information from a plethora of sources throughout the game.\n\nLa Canfora joined SportsLine as a wagering analyst in 2022, giving out weekly best bets and selections throughout the NFL season, appearing on live betting shows, and making other regular appearances on CBS Sports HQ and SportsLine. La Canfora finished last season on a blistering run, posting a 59-32 record on his NFL picks, returning more than $2,300 for $100 players. Anybody who followed along with those picks had a huge payday.\n\nNow he's turned his attention to the 2024 NFL Draft and has revealed his best prop bets and multiple longshot prop plays, including two that return 35-1. You can only see La Canfora's NFL Draft 2024 prop bet picks at SportsLine.\n\nTop 2024 NFL Draft prop picks\n\nOne of the 2024 NFL Draft prop bets La Canfora recommends: Take Michael Penix Jr. drafted 32nd overall or earlier. Penix began his career at Indiana before transferring to Washington where he would blossom into one of the best players in the country. In his final season in Seattle, Penix finished in second place in the 2023 Heisman Trophy voting, and led his team to a 14-1 overall record and a berth in the College Football Playoff National Championship Game.\n\nPenix produced massive numbers as a passer during his time at Washington, finishing with 9,544 yards, 67 touchdown passes, and 19 interceptions in his two seasons quarterbacking the Huskies. During pre-draft workouts he flashed elite level athleticism, running his 40-yard-dash in 4.46 seconds at Washington's Pro Day. There were some injury concerns coming out of college, but those have since been settled.\n\n\"The media made more of the medicals than any team I spoke to about him. I very easily could see him going to the Vikings, Broncos, Raiders or Seahawks in the first half of the first round, and frankly at this point would be surprised if he didn't land there. There's so much production and upside,\" La Canfora told SportsLine. See which other NFL Draft props La Canfora loves here.\n\nHow to make 2024 NFL Draft predictions\n\nLa Canfora also loves several other underdog NFL Draft props and is releasing a pair of monster 35-1 longshot picks.

The first round of the NFL Draft begins Thursday.\n\nCaleb Williams\n\nNavigating emotions ahead of being the presumptive first overall pick: \"Very normal, very calm. I've prepared myself mentally for it and I've also prepared myself to put myself in this position physically around my teammates for the last 12 years now. Ready for the moment, ready to go, ready to lock and load.\"\n\nWhat he wanted Bears players to learn about him during his visit: \"I'm just one of them. Nothing more, nothing less. What they saw at the dinner is the person that I am five years from now, 10 years from now, 15 years from now. And hopefully just a couple more accolades on that list. But other than that, just being the same guy, getting around them, learning them, them learning me and just enjoying each other's company.\"\n\nJayden Daniels\n\nWhat he believes teams would get from drafting him: \"A competitor. Someone who is very passionate in the game of football. Somebody that loves to have fun and a leader. Somebody, a hard-worker, somebody who's gonna go out there every day and grind, do whatever it takes to help the team win.\"\n\nDrake Maye\n\nHow the pre-draft process prepared him for his pro career: \"It was the first time I really got to focus on myself in life. You're always worried about the team, being the quarterback, worried about that. I really just focused on my body, working on myself, getting ready for Pro Day. Get ready for things where I can focus on my diet and just work on myself.\"\n\nMalik Nabers\n\nHow often he looks back at his past in preparation for the Draft: \"I'd probably say every day. Every day, I look at the NFL Draft, the logo. It brings back memories of where I came from, how I got up out, everything I've been through out when I was out there in Louisiana. Just to overcome all of that and be one of those people that, I can relate back to the children that are coming up. I can have a story for those guys to look at me and stay down until they come up.\"\n\nOn attending the NFL Draft with LSU teammates Jayden Daniels and Brian Thomas Jr.: \"It's a dream come true to share this dream that we've all got together. To come out in the same year, and to have my brothers here with me, we're all having a great time. To see those guys walk on stage and have their names called, their dreams, change their lives, it's gonna mean everything. Now, we can go into the league as a whole big group, do special things and let's see where the future leads.\"\n\nDarius Robinson\n\nWhere he believes he could be drafted: \"I think it's too wild. That's the thing, everyone has a different position that I play. So certain teams maybe have this guy already versus some teams don't. That's why I'd say it's wide open.\"\n\nOn how it feels being back home for the NFL Draft: \"It's amazing. I'm glad I can be a face for the future kids coming up, coming throughout this program.

Now, here's Mike Sykes.\n\nGoooood morning, Winners! Welcome back to the Morning Win. Thank you so much for reading today. I appreciate you giving us a bit of your time.\n\nThe NFL draft is finally here. Many of you have been waiting for this day for a long, long time. I hope your team does the exact thing you want it to do. It probably won't, but hey! There's still hope.\n\nMe personally? I'm only rooting for a timely process. That starts with the Chicago Bears, who hold the first overall pick.\n\nGiven that, I have a request for GM Ryan Poles and company: Pick Caleb Williams already, you cowards. Get it over with.\n\nObviously, the draft hasn't started just yet. It won't until 8 p.m. ET tonight (SIGH). But let's be real -- we all know who the Bears are picking here. It's Williams. It's always been Williams. We've known since, basically, September. Once Chicago traded Justin Fields, it was a wrap.\n\nRELATED: Caleb Williams liked a video of Bears fans chanting his name\n\nYet, for whatever reason, Poles was out here trying to be cute with his pre-draft press conference. \"We know what we're going to do, but everyone is going to have to wait until Thursday to go there,\" he told reporters.\n\nHey, Ryan. Buddy. I've got a newsflash for you: WE KNOW WHAT YOU'RE DOING, TOO.\n\nMost of us have probably known what you and your team were doing for longer than you have. While y'all were hemming and hawing over where to trade Justin Fields, we wondered why you were still playing these silly games.\n\nThis is the worst-kept secret in the NFL. Just announce that you're drafting Williams already. There's no need to take more than two minutes to do this. If it takes the entire 10 minutes allotted for the pick, I will riot.\n\nWe've all got things to do and I need to hurry up and get to my team's pick.

Detroit is in the spotlight this year and, well, the city's got a lot riding on this one, writes Ken Belson of the New York Times.\n\nThe city declared bankruptcy a decade ago, as the real estate market crash led to thousands of homes being abandoned and the automotive industry, which drove the city's economy, was still on the road to recovery after its collapse.\n\nSince then, Detroit has been on the up-and-up. There are still problems, of course, but it's recovering. Belson writes the draft may perhaps be a springboard to hasten that recovery a bit more:\n\n\"Detroit hosted the Super Bowl in 2006, as a reward to the Lions for moving into a new stadium. But city officials expect that being the site of this year's draft, which begins on Thursday, will provide an economic jolt, though how much of one is unclear. They also hope the three days of exposure on television showcases the city to fans who might not otherwise visit. Detroit, they say, is not the Detroit of a decade ago, when the city was bankrupt, tens of thousands of homes had been abandoned and the automobile industry was pulling out of a long slump. Since then, new hotels, businesses and residents have flooded downtown; unemployment has fallen; and the city's debt has returned to investment grade.\"\n\nOf course, there are doubts about how much of a boost the draft -- and other events like it -- would provide for the city's economy.\n\nUltimately, money generated will probably be spent just to host this event. Belson writes that road closures and increased security eat up that cash.\n\nBut this is Detroit's moment to show the world how far it's come since hitting rock bottom. In the end, that's a good thing.\n\nREAD MORE: The NFL Draft is like the Super Bowl for Detroit\n\nMeet the man who makes the fastest NFL players faster\n\nEach one of the athletes you see picked today in the NFL Draft is one of the best athletes in the world. But they all won't make it.\n\nIn the NFL, you win on the margins. Each second and every inch matters. Running a sub-4.3 40-yard dash could be the difference between being drafted in the second round or the fifth round. Most of these guys cut it that close.\n\nThat's where Tony Villani comes in.\n\nVillani is the founder of XPE Sports -- a training facility where some of the best names in the game have come to get better over the last 22 years. Travis Kelce, Tariq Woolen, Anquan Boldin, Mark Ingram and so many more have come through those doors.\n\nThrough his speed training program, he helps the fastest players in the NFL become even faster. We got to fly down to Florida and chop it up with him to see how it all works.\n\nHe makes his strategy sound simple. \"When people run a [40-yard dash] at 25 miles an hour, they get to 15 miles an hour at the first 5 yards,\" Villani told For The Win. \"They spend the next 35 yards getting the next 10. Training that explosive force into your form and doing it inside and tracking it...It's so easy. We call it 'get fast, fast.'

For some who were able to excel in college but never came close to matching those achievements in the NFL, it was the pinnacle of their careers. For others, winning the Heisman Trophy wasn't the end of their football story. For all they accomplished in college, more greatness awaited them in the professional ranks.\n\nAs Daniels awaits to be selected Thursday in the first round of the 2024 NFL Draft, those same questions will follow him: Can college football's most outstanding and electrifying player in 2023 become the face of a franchise, someone who can help an NFL team fulfill its Super Bowl dreams? And what does his status as a Heisman winner do for his draft stock and where he might ultimately be picked?\n\nIn the leadup to this week's draft, here's a look at the recent history of Heisman Trophy winners in the NFL Draft and how they fared once getting to the league:\n\nHeisman winners in the NFL draft\n\nWhile their NFL experiences varied once games actually began, Heisman winners have overwhelmingly at least been drafted over the past quarter-century. Since 1994, only one Heisman recipient went undrafted: Oklahoma quarterback Jason White, who won the award in 2003, but whose physical limitations and lengthy injury history didn't make him a viable professional prospect.\n\nIn recent years, winning the Heisman has come close to guaranteeing a high draft position. All but one Heisman winner since 2007 has been selected in the first round of the draft. Even the exception to that trend, former Alabama star running back Derrick Henry -- a second-round draft pick in 2015 -- has gone on to a successful NFL career that was highlighted by a 2020 season in which he won NFL Offensive Player of the Year.\n\nHere is where every Heisman winner since 2000 has been taken in the NFL draft:\n\nThe NFL draft has been even kinder to LSU Heisman Trophy winners.\n\nThe Tigers' previous two Heisman recipients before Daniels - Billy Cannon in 1959 and Joe Burrow in 2019 - were both drafted No. 1 overall. Though Daniels is unlikely to continue that streak -- USC's Caleb Williams is widely projected to go to the Chicago Bears with the No. 1 overall pick -- the LSU quarterback nonetheless is expected to be a high draft selection.\n\nHow many Heisman Trophy winners have won NFL MVP?\n\nOnly a select handful of players have earned the distinction of winning both the Heisman Trophy and the NFL MVP, a group Daniels could potentially join depending on how he performs in the NFL.\n\nHere are the seven players who have managed the feat:\n\nREQUIRED READING: 2024 NFL mock draft: J.J. McCarthy or Drake Maye for Patriots at No. 3?\n\nJayden Daniels NFL mock draft\n\nAs the start of the 2024 NFL Draft inches closer, something resembling a consensus has been reached on Daniels, who is slated by virtually every major outlet with an NFL mock draft to go in the first three picks, most of which have him going No. 2 or No. 3 overall.\n\nHere's a sampling of where Daniels is projected to end up:", "source": {"uri": "theadvertiser.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Daily Advertiser"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jayden_Daniels", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jayden Daniels"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draft_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Draft (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LSU_Tigers_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "LSU Tigers football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/College_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "College football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heisman_Trophy", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Heisman Trophy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Quarterback"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dual-threat_quarterback", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dual-threat quarterback"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jason_White_(American_football)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jason White (American football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oklahoma_Sooners_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Oklahoma Sooners football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_agent", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Free agent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Bowl", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Super Bowl"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "American football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caleb_Williams", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Caleb Williams"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Burrow", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Joe Burrow"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drake_Bulldogs_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Drake Bulldogs football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billy_Cannon", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Billy Cannon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Bears", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chicago Bears"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alabama_Crimson_Tide_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Alabama Crimson Tide football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derrick_Henry", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Derrick Henry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_England_Patriots", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "New England Patriots"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Football", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Football", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Football/American", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Football/American", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Theme_Merchandise", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Theme Merchandise", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Fantasy", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Fantasy", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/CAD_and_CAM/Associations", "label": "dmoz/Computers/CAD and CAM/Associations", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 77}], "image": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/authoring/images/smg/2024/04/24/USAT/73372250007-USATSI_22658038.jpeg?auto=webp&crop=4052,2280,x0,y209&format=pjpg&width=1200", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9509328", "eventUri": "eng-9509328", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3490196078431373, "wgt": 143, "relevance": 1}

The NFL world truly lives for the NFL Draft.\n\nIt's one of the best times of the year, and this year could be one of the best drafts in terms of entertainment value.

Yes; Caleb Williams, Jayden Daniels, Drake Maye, JJ McCarthy, Bo Nix, and Michael Penix Jr will not only all go in the first round, but will all get taken in the top-16 selections, which would be nearly half of the first half of the NFL Draft. It'd be an unprecedented amount of QBs going this high, but this class is truly that talented.\n\nYou'll see a few teams sit with their current pick and take a quarterback, but you can also see a few teams making some sort of draft-day trade to move up or even move down for a passer.

All is set to become clear on Thursday night with the start of the 2024 NFL Draft.\n\nOnly the first of seven rounds will get underway on Thursday with the first 32 picks of this year's draft. Rounds 2 and 3 will take place Friday with Rounds 4-7 on Saturday. Draft order for the first round has been decided by each team's record from the 2023 NFL season with strength of schedule as a tiebreaker.\n\nThis year, almost every team has a first-round pick. That includes the Los Angeles Rams, who have not made a first-round selection since taking quarterback Jared Goff with the first overall pick in 2016. Heading into draft night, only three teams do not have their first-round selection thanks to trades in previous years.\n\nHere's how the full first-round draft order stacks up heading into Thursday night.\n\nNFL MOCK DRAFT: Six QBs make first-round cut as trade possibilities remain\n\nNFL DRAFT TRADE CANDIDATES: Which teams look primed to trade up or down in first round?\n\nThree teams do not have a first-round pick in the 2024 draft.\n\nHOW TO WATCH: Catch all seven rounds of the 2024 NFL Draft with a subscription to fuboTV\n\nWe occasionally recommend interesting products and services.

The over/under for total offensive players suggested is 21. The defensive over/under is 11. Keep in mind, there are no linebackers or safeties with a first-round projection. You can do the math. There are 32 slots in the first round.\n\nSo why is the offense getting such a big showcase? Well, there is a quarterbacks class that could swell to six first rounders, which would tie an NFL Draft record. The wide receivers should have a banner first round. And there will be offensive linemen everywhere. Latest odds suggest as many as 10, or almost one third of the slots, going to the o-linemen. Let's take a look at the defensive prop bets -- the odds for defensive linemen as provided by BetOnline.\n\nOddsmakers and NFL Draft analysts aren't sure who will be the first defensive lineman off the board. Keep in mind, this position group also includes edge rusher, which is a catch-all phrase for defensive ends in a 4-3 or outside linebackers in a 3-4.\n\nAlabama edge rusher Dallas Turner hopes to be like his former teammate, Will Anderson, as the first defender off the board in the first round. Anderson went to the Texans at No. 3, behind two quarterbacks, in the 2023 NFL Draft. He then earned NFL Defensive Rookie of the Year.\n\nTurner has odds of 10/11. Meanwhile, UCLA star Laiatu Latu has some momentum for the first defender off the board. His odds are 5/2. Teams have to come to terms on whether Latu's neck injury he suffered while he was playing for Washington will impact his pro career. Here are the others in play as first defender off the NFL Draft boards:\n\nByron Murphy II (Texas): 9/2\n\nJared Verse (Florida State): 5/1\n\nChop Robinson (Penn State): 50/1\n\nJer'Zhan Newton (Illinois): 50/1\n\nCall this a battle between the blue bloods and the mid-level program over achievers. Toledo's Quinyon Mitchell, currently, is the favorite to be the first cornerback off the NFL Draft Board.\n\nMitchell enjoyed an excellent NFL Combine, running a 4.32-second time in the 40-yard dash and registering a 38-inch vertical. Daniel Jeremiah, the chief draft analyst for NFL Network, said this week that the Ravens may be willing to trade up for Mitchell. So see, it's not all about the quarterbacks or receivers.\n\nMeanwhile, Alabama's Terrion Arnold has the second-best odds at 5/4. The SEC always produces quality cornerbacks, so it wouldn't be a big jump for an NFL team to use a high draft pick on a Crimson Tide star. Here are the others in the mix as the first DB:\n\nCooper DeJean (Iowa): 14/1\n\nNate Wiggins (Clemson): 18/1\n\nKool-Aid McKinstry (Alabama): 50/1\n\nEnnis Rakestraw Jr. (Missouri): 100/1\n\nT.J. Tampa (Iowa State): 100/1\n\nHere's how dire it might be for defenders hoping to go in the first round of the NFL Draft. Current mock drafts are predicting only one defender may go in the top 10. Barring any sort of trade, the Falcons are the first team in the draft order looking for a defensive player. And Atlanta drafts eighth.", "source": {"uri": "on3.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "On3"}, "authors": [{"uri": "suzanne_halliburton@on3.com", "name": "Suzanne Halliburton", "type": "author",

Because the NFL Draft isn't the only way players can enter the league. Once the draft has concluded, any player not selected becomes a free agent, and is able to sign with any team.\n\nPlayers like Breiden Fehoko, Micah Baskerville, Reid Ferguson, and Badara Traore all ended up with NFL deals without being taken in the NFL Draft.\n\nBut when it comes to the NFL Draft, LSU has been very prolific over the years. In 2020, LSU tied a record for the most players taken in a single NFL Draft from one school. That year, LSU tied the record by having 14 players taken in that year's draft. That included 5 players being taken in the first round of the 2020 draft.\n\nThe record for most players from a single school being taken in a draft has since been broken, when Georgia had 15 players taken in 2022.

The 1983 NFL Draft saw six quarterbacks go off the board in Round 1, the most of any draft in history. Three of the six QBs taken in the first round of the '83 draft went on to be inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame.\n\nIt's no secret that the 2024 NFL Draft is loaded at the quarterback position.\n\nIt isn't often that QBs go 1-2-3 -- it's only happened three times in the common draft era (1971, 1999, 2021) -- but that's likely exactly what will happen on Thursday night.\n\nThe Chicago Bears will undoubtedly use the No. 1 overall pick on Caleb Williams. That's a given. The Washington Commanders will then have to choose between Drake Maye and Jayden Daniels with the second selection, and whoever they don't select will fall to the New England Patriots at No. 3.\n\nOnce those three are off the board, J.J. McCarthy, Michael Penix Jr., and Bo Nix will then sit and wait for their names to be called. And there's a chance this trio could also go in the first round.\n\nIf that happens, this 2024 edition will tie the record for the most quarterbacks taken in the first round of any NFL draft in history. While several drafts have seen five taken off the board in Round 1, including the aforementioned 2021 edition (Trevor Lawrence, Zach Wilson, Trey Lance, Justin Fields, Mac Jones), the record stands at six.\n\nAnd the same draft that produced this record number of signal-callers in Round 1 is the same one that produced the greatest QB class in NFL draft history.\n\nRelated Ranking the Top 5 QB Classes in NFL Draft History It's clear that the 1983 NFL Draft was the best when it came to quarterbacks, but which others had a top-notch quarterback class? Six QBs Were Taken in the First Round of the Famed 1983 NFL Draft Three Hall of Famers and three other future NFL starters went in the opening round in '83\n\nThe 1983 NFL Draft was loaded with quarterback prospects, none bigger at the time than Stanford's John Elway, who made it crystal clear that he didn't want to play for the Baltimore Colts, who held the No. 1 overall pick.\n\nThe Colts took him anyway but then traded him to the Denver Broncos, with whom he was a nine-time Pro Bowler, a three-time All-Pro, a one-time NFL MVP, a two-time Super Bowl winner, and a one-time Super Bowl MVP.\n\nAt No. 7, the Kansas City Chiefs took Penn State's Todd Blackledge, who ultimately played seven NFL seasons, five with Kansas City and two with the Pittsburgh Steelers. Blackledge was the most disappointing member of the group, going 15-14 in 29 starts and ending his career with 5,286 passing yards with 29 touchdowns against 38 interceptions.\n\nAt No. 14, the Buffalo Bills selected Miami's Jim Kelly, who initially refused to play for the Bills and opted for the USFL. He eventually made his way to Buffalo and became the greatest QB in franchise history, earning five trips to the Pro Bowl and two All-Pro selections while throwing for 35,467 yards and 237 touchdowns in 11 seasons.\n\nHe also led the Bills to four consecutive Super Bowl appearances in the early 1990s, famously losing all four.\n\n1983 NFL Draft 1st Round Quarterbacks\n\nPick\n\nPlayer\n\nTeam\n\n1\n\nJohn Elway\n\nBaltimore Colts (traded to Denver Broncos)\n\n7\n\nTodd Blackledge\n\nKansas City Chiefs\n\n14\n\nJim Kelly\n\nBuffalo Bills\n\n15\n\nTony Eason\n\nNew England Patriots\n\n24\n\nKen O'Brien\n\nNew York Jets\n\n27\n\nDan Marino\n\nMiami Dolphins\n\nOne pick later at No. 15, the New England Patriots nabbed Illinois' Tony Eason, who played eight NFL seasons. While he never earned a Pro Bowl or All-Pro selection, he did lead the Pats to the Super Bowl in 1985, losing to the Bears in what, at the time, was the biggest blowout in Super Bowl history.\n\nThe fifth QB off the board was Ken O'Brien, who was taken at No. 24 by the New York Jets. The UC Davis standout spent nine years with Gang Green and made two trips to the Pro Bowl. His 24,386 passing yards and 124 touchdown passes both rank second in franchise history, trailing only Joe Namath.\n\nLast but certainly not least, Dan Marino became the record sixth QB taken in 1983, going 27th overall to the Miami Dolphins. The Pitt product famously never won a Super Bowl, losing his lone appearance following his record-setting 1984 NFL MVP campaign, but was easily one of the greatest quarterbacks of all time.\n\nIn 17 seasons with the Dolphins, Marino was a nine-time Pro Bowler, a six-time All-Pro selection, and threw for 61,361 yards and 420 touchdowns.\n\nAll stats courtesy of Pro Football Reference unless stated otherwise.\n\nRelated 15 best quarterbacks in NFL history, ranked Patrick Mahomes isn't yet the best quarterback in NFL history, but he's rapidly climbing the list.

Our Minnesota Vikings are one of the teams that has had the most focus on them throughout the pre-Draft process, and tonight it all comes to a head with the purple (currently) having two first-round picks, slotted at #11 and #23 overall.\n\nSo, how can you be a part of the festivities this evening? Here's everything you need to know.\n\nCoverage of the Draft will be happening on various outlets throughout the course of the day leading up to the start of the selection meeting, but the real festivities get started at 7:00 PM Central on Thursday night. Once we get past the Ceremonial Booing of Roger Goodell, the Chicago Bears will probably be on the clock with the #1 pick sometime around 7:10 PM.\n\nYou will have several sources to choose from when it comes to watching the Draft. Coverage will be taking place on ESPN, the NFL Network, and your local ABC affiliate, wherever you might be. You can also get coverage in Spanish on ESPN Deportes if you'd like.\n\nWell, it's 2024, so of course you can! The NFL Network's coverage will be on NFL.com/watch, as well as through NFL+ and the NFL app. ESPN's coverage will be available on ESPN+ as well as on YouTube, Twitter/X, and FaceBook. You can also find NFL Draft Center on numerous free streaming services, such as Pluto TV, Roku, Peacock, and the free TV services available on most smart TVs.\n\nYou can do that, too! ESPN Radio will be carrying the Draft, as will Westwood One affiliates around the country. If you have satellite radio, you can find the 2024 NFL Draft on SiriusXM NFL Radio (Channel 88) or ESPN Radio (Channel 80).\n\nWell. . .that depends.\n\nIf the Vikings stay at #11 and all of the teams in front of them use their full allotment of ten minutes for each pick, the Vikings would likely be on the clock for the first time tonight sometime at around 9:00 PM Central. However. . .if the Vikings trade up as they've been rumored to be trying to do for months, they could be on the clock much earlier than that, so your best bet is probably to have your snacks and beverages of choice ready when things get started at 7 and just hang out and wait.\n\nWhy, I thought you'd never ask.\n\nAfter having to skip last year for various reasons, Vikings Report with Drew and Ted will be back again with their live draft show that will cover the entirety of Round 1! Yours truly will join Drew and Ted starting at 6:30 PM Central and will be watching and commenting on the entirety of the first round. If you join the show, you'll have the opportunity to interact with other viewers/listeners and possibly win yourself some pretty sweet prizes, so you can head over to the Vikings Report with Drew and Ted YouTube page and log in to check it out.\n\nWe'll also have the show embedded at the top of all of our Open Threads throughout the weekend. Speaking of which. . .\n\nThe same as always. . .better than everybody else does.\n\nWe'll have Open Threads for each round of this year's Draft, including multiple Open Threads should things start to get bogged down with activity. That will include Rounds 2 and 3 despite the Vikings not (currently) having a selection in either of those rounds.\n\nWe will also be updating our Minnesota Vikings 2024 NFL Draft Tracker as soon as picks are made with quick profiles of all of the players selected as well as the particulars on any trades the Vikings might make over the course of the next three days. After the Draft is over, we'll have an Undrafted Free Agency tracker that we'll be updating with the latest and greatest whenever we get wind of players signing with the Vikings in the post-Draft frenzy.\n\nThis is the 18th NFL Draft that we've gotten the privilege to cover here at The Daily Norseman, and we hope that you'll be joining us for as much of it as possible over the course of Draft Weekend.", "source": {"uri": "dailynorseman.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Norseman"}, "authors": [{"uri": "christopher_gates@dailynorseman.com", "name": "Christopher Gates", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota_Vikings", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota Vikings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NFL_Network", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "NFL Network"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "ESPN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Bears", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chicago Bears"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN_Radio", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "ESPN Radio"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roger_Goodell", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Roger Goodell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christmas", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Christmas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detroit", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Detroit"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Detroit"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NFL+", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NFL+"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sirius_XM", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sirius XM"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peacock_(streaming_service)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Peacock (streaming service)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN+", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "ESPN+"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pluto_TV", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pluto TV"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN_Deportes", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "ESPN Deportes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free-to-air", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Free-to-air"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roku", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Roku"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Westwood_One", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Westwood One"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smart_TV", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Smart TV"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satellite_radio", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Satellite radio"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Broadcasting_Company", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "American Broadcasting Company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streaming_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Streaming media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_language", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Spanish language"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_app", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mobile app"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YouTube", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "YouTube"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Ten-Pin", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Ten-Pin", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Candlepin", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Candlepin", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 67}], "image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/BfB7bDtJ9I65CAxylIX5XChW5Io=/0x0:8001x4001/fit-in/1200x600/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25417074/usa_today_23106109.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9509328", "eventUri": "eng-9509328", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1843137254901961, "wgt": 139, "relevance": 1}

This article will explore whether Paramount Plus is part of those platforms.\n\nWill NFL Draft 2024 air on Paramount Plus?\n\nThe answer is no. Paramount Plus will not live stream the 2024 NFL Draft. While Paramount Plus typically broadcasts NFL events, it does not have the coverage rights for this year's Draft, which are held by ESPN.\n\nParamount Plus is a streaming service associated with the CBS network. CBS does not have coverage rights for this year's Draft, so people interested in watching the grand event will need to explore alternate means. But there's no need to worry -- you can keep reading to find out alternate means.\n\nYou could also go for modern NFL-centric streaming platforms like FuboTV, DAZN, DIRECTV, and Hulu + Live TV.

Some of us have been placing bets on the NFL Draft for months, maybe even nearly a year if you're that giddy, but not everyone has the time to check in on these lines that early. Not to mention there have been plenty of other sporting events competing for your attention.\n\nIf you're looking for some NFL Draft bets/predictions, you have come to the right place! I have a handful of picks that were available at the time of publishing this, as well as a handful of NFL Draft predictions I have made over the past couple of months where we might see some value if the betting odds shift accordingly.\n\nIn trying to handicap the NFL Draft, I find it best to fill out an NFL mock draft based on the odds. I try to take out personal opinion in order to just take a look at what the odds are suggesting will happen on Thursday night. I filled out my first NFL mock draft a little over a week ago, but the odds have changed quite a bit since then. So, I filled out one more today (Wednesday) in an attempt to find some more NFL Draft bets I like. In my most recent mock, I didn't worry about filling out which team will actually be making the selection - lines were on the move this afternoon and I wanted to not only lock in my bets ASAP, but also get my predictions in front of you before lines changed further.\n\nIn filling out the mock draft above, I really prioritized NFL Draft props that allow you to bet both sides / all outcomes. So, draft position over/unders were my preferred prop, but I did consider everything available. If you're like me, there are too many players above that just don't seem like a good fit where they have been placed. This is the starting point for me putting together my NFL Draft predictions.\n\nIf you're interested in doing the same thing, you can use our printable NFL mock draft template to fill out your own.\n\n2024 NFL Draft Predictions\n\nLet's dive into the bets I have put together using my mock above! All bets are 1 unit unless I state otherwise.\n\nMost sportsbooks still have Dallas Turner as the favorite to be the first defensive player selected. However, you can find his draft position over/under listed at 9.5 with the over favored at most books. Most are not giving the under +145 odds, though.\n\nWhen I look at the teams selecting in the top nine picks, I see three who have a pretty big need for an edge rusher: Tennessee (7th), Atlanta (8th), and Chicago (9th). Though I think the Titans will address their offensive line (with Joe Alt), I fully expect the Falcons to take a defensive lineman, either an edge rusher or interior lineman. I also think there's a really good chance Chicago follows suit with the next pick. I do not think there's a 48% chance both teams pass on Turner.\n\nI think just about everyone would agree there are three wide receivers who will undoubtedly be picked in the first round on Thursday night. Those three are: Marvin Harrison Jr, Malik Nabers, and Rome Odunze. The odds also favor Brian Thomas Jr, Xavier Worthy, and Adonai Mitchell being first-round picks as well. But then you also have Xavier Legette, Ladd McConkey, and even Keon Coleman, who are projected to be early second-round picks.\n\nI think there's a better than 25% chance that one of those guys sneaks into the first round to make it seven receivers selected.\n\nRemember everything I said in my Dallas Turner pick? Barring a team trading up, I don't see how Rome Odunze fits into the top eight picks. All we have heard is that the first three picks will be QBs and JJ McCarthy will also be selected early. Then the odds heavily favor MHJ being the first WR off the board and Malik Nabers being the second. So, that's six picks already. Then you throw in Joe Alt to the Titans and have the Falcons in need of a pass-rusher.\n\nI think the only way Odunze is drafted in the first eight picks is if someone trades up to get him or he's the second WR off the board. If you do like Odunze to go this early, I think the better bet is to take him to be the second WR selected at +300 (DraftKings). I'll be betting him to go over 8.5 at +135 odds, though.\n\nDepending on the NFL draft value chart you use, the Vikings 11th and 23rd-overall selections in the 2024 draft are either a little more or a little less valuable than the third-overall pick. I do not believe Minnesota gave up two second-round picks to acquire the 23rd-overall pick, a move which was made two days after Kirk Cousins left in free agency, simply because they like a player they expect to be there late in the first round. This was a move to go up and get their new QB. The Patriots, who currently hold the third-overall pick and have plenty of holes on their roster, would make for a great trade partner too.\n\nI feel the two QBs that would best fit Kevin O'Connell's system are Drake Maye and JJ McCarthy. Even if Jayden Daniels were to be in the board, I think the Vikings would go with either Maye or McCarthy over him. For all of those reasons, I love the +400 odds on McCarthy to go third-overall.\n\nThis is an example of ESPN Bet having some contradicting odds. Their prop for first defensive player drafted has Byron Murphy II, Dallas Turner, and Laiatu Latu all listed as co-favorites at +175 odds. But then if you go down to their first defensive lineman / edge rusher drafted prop, we see Turner at +130, Latu at +150, and Murphy at +220. Murphy's odds to be the first DL/EDGE selected should not be worse, let alone significantly worse, than his odds to be the first defensive player drafted.\n\nJust about every other sportsbook has Murphy between +160 and +175 to be the first DL/EDGE player drafted. So, I'm mostly looking at this as some positive EV. However, I think there's a really good chance we see Murphy & Turner go 8th and 9th, respectively.\n\nIf you wanted to search for more bets on your own, you can see many more props at our NFL Draft betting odds page.\n\nThen I also want to communicate bets that I already placed (over the past couple of months) where the odds have changed now:\n\nNabers to be the first non-QB selected has moved in the wrong direction for me, as it can be found as long as +800 at bet365 now, or +700 at DraftKings if you're not in a legal bet365 state. At the time of placing the bet, Nabers was receiving more hype, but I do still think it's worth a quarter of a unit at +800.\n\nAll the others have moved in the right direction, but the NFL Draft isn't exactly the time to celebrate closing line value, nor have we reached the closing lines either. There will still be plenty of movement between now and tomorrow night.", "source": {"uri": "sportsbettingdime.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sports Betting Dime"}, "authors": [{"uri":

In all, eight prospects have fathers who were selected to at least one Pro Bowl (with the eight combining for an astonishing 39 Pro Bowl nods). That's some incredible NFL pedigree about to enter the league.\n\nWith that in mind, here's a breakdown of 2024 draft prospects who had fathers play in the NFL, as well as those who had (or currently have) brothers and other relations in the league:\n\nLiving up to the expectations set by a Pro Football Hall of Fame father who played the same position won't be easy, but Marvin Harrison Jr. possesses next-level route running, body control and ball skills that will make him the envy of any team selecting at the top of the first round that does not have an immediate need for a quarterback. His father was a first-round selection (No. 19 overall) in the 1996 draft and went on to play 13 NFL seasons. He was an eight-time Pro Bowl selection, three-time first-team All-Pro, voted to the NFL's All-2000s team and was a member of the Indianapolis Colts' Super Bowl XLI-winning team.\n\nIn what is a strong 2024 draft class for offensive tackles, Alt is the clear top-rated prospect at the position. Alt stands at 6-foot-9 and 321 pounds, and possess athleticism to add to that immense size. His father, John Alt, was a 6-foot-8 behemoth who played 13 seasons in the NFL, all with the Kansas City Chiefs. He was a first-round selection (No. 21 overall) in the 1984 NFL draft and a two-time Pro Bowl selection.\n\nJenkins could be the second former Michigan Wolverines player off the board during this year's draft, following quarterback J.J. McCarthy. In addition to his skills, Jenkins brings the pedigree of being the son of a four-time Pro Bowl defensive tackle. Jenkins the elder was a second-round pick in the 2001 NFL draft by the Carolina Panthers and went on to play 10 NFL seasons.\n\nThink Marvin Harrison Jr. faces pressure to live up to his Hall of Fame father? Brenden Rice is the son of the wide receiver G.O.A.T. who is arguably the best NFL player of all time, Jerry Rice. The football family ties for Brenden Rice run deep. His half-brother, Jerry Rice Jr., was a wide receiver who played at UCLA and UNLV. His brother, Qualen Cunningham, was a defensive end at Texas A&M; and his stepfather, Rick Cunningham, was an offensive lineman who played eight seasons in the NFL.\n\nJonah Elliss is in a family full of football players. His brothers Christian Elliss and Noah Elliss each have been on NFL rosters. Christian plays for the New England Patriots, while Noah has been on the Philadelphia Eagles' practice squad. Their father, Luther Elliss, was a standout defensive lineman in the NFL. A first-round pick (No. 20 overall) by the Detroit Lions in the 1995 NFL draft, Luther Elliss played 10 seasons in the NFL and earned two Pro Bowl selections. Jonah Elliss brings a high-energy game that likely has NFL teams intrigued by his pro possibilities.\n\nHere's another family full of football players. Brothers Christian and Max McCaffrey each have NFL experience, with Christian among the most electric players currently in the league. Their father, Ed McCaffrey, was a third-round selection by the New York Giants in the 1991 NFL draft. He played mostly as a reserve (he did win a Super Bowl ring with the 49ers in 1994) before catching on with the Denver Broncos, posting three 1,000-yard seasons, earning a Pro Bowl nod and winning two Super Bowls. Luke McCaffrey projects as a possible slot receiver in the NFL.\n\nJeremiah Trotter, a Philadelphia Eagles icon nicknamed the \"Axe Man,\" played 11 seasons in the NFL after being a third-round pick in the 1998 NFL draft and earned four Pro Bowl selections. Jeremiah Trotter Jr. was a first-team All-ACC selection, a finalist for the Butkus Award (presented to college football's best linebacker) and the sort of tackling machine that NFL teams crave for their rosters.\n\nFrank Gore played so long he nearly got to be in the league at the same time as his son (something the NBA's LeBron James is aiming to do with his son, Bronny). Gore played 16 seasons in the NFL (2005-2020) after being a third-round pick by the San Francisco 49ers in the 2005 draft, and is third on the league's all-time rushing yardage list behind Emmitt Smith and Walter Payton (and ahead of Barry Sanders, Curtis Martin, LaDainian Tomlinson, Jerome Bettis, Eric Dickerson, Tony Dorsett, Jim Brown ... shall we name more Hall of Famers?). Despite questions about his overall speed, Frank Gore Jr. at least will get a training camp look from some NFL team.\n\nDurable player who was a team captain and first-team All-SEC pick in 2023, Javon Foster is the type of prospect who could stick with a 53-player roster going into the 2024 NFL season. His father, Jerome Foster, was a fifth-round pick by the Houston Oilers in the 1983 draft and went on to play five seasons in the NFL as a defensive end.\n\nJaylen Harrell is one of many Michigan players who could hear their names called during the 2024 NFL draft. An astonishing 18 Wolverines were invited to the NFL scouting combine. Jaylen Harrell, an edge rusher, was among those 18. Father James Harrell played eight seasons in the NFL (1979-1987), mostly with the Detroit Lions and primarily in a reserve role. That seems to be his son's potential NFL role as well.\n\nDrake Nugent played two seasons at Stanford before using the transfer portal to join Michigan, where he was a first-team All-Big Ten selection and finalist for the Rimington Trophy (presented to college football's top center). His father, Terry Nugent, was a quarterback who picked in the sixth round of the 1984 draft by the Cleveland Browns. He appeared in one NFL game, doing so for the Indianapolis Colts during the NFLPA strike of 1987.\n\nNot as celebrated as his Longhorns teammates Adonai Mitchell - who is a projected first-round pick - and Xavier Worthy - who ran a record 40-yard dash time at the combine - the 6-foot-1 205-pound Whittington was the thunder to the Mitchell-Worthy lightning. His father, Arthur Whittington, was a running back who was picked in the seventh round of the 1978 draft by the Oakland Raiders, with whom he was a member of the Super Bowl 15-winning team.\n\nDraft

He enrolled at the University of Texas as the No. 1 recruit in the 2023 high school class, but he backed up Quinn Ewers in his freshman season.\n\nDespite his minimal playing time, Manning continues to have a huge spotlight on him prior to becoming draft eligible.

Per NFL rules, a player must be three years removed from high school and have used their collegiate eligibility in order to enter the NFL Draft.\n\nManning joined the Texas Longhorns in 2023 and is entering his second season as a redshirt freshman. Whether he remains at Texas for all three-plus years does not matter -- Manning can transfer and still remain eligible for the 2026 NFL Draft.\n\nBecause Manning redshirted his true freshman season, his latest NFL Draft eligibility would be the 2028 NFL Draft, barring any injuries that grant him another season of eligibility.\n\nPlayers are only draft-eligible in the first year after they finish or forego their collegiate career.\n\nNFL DRAFT RANKINGS: QBs | RBs | WRs | TEs | EDGE\n\nThe NFL is different than the other three major sports leagues in the United States. The NBA, MLB, and NHL all allow players to join the professional ranks in their teenage years.\n\nTo make the NFL, a player must be at least three years removed from high school and have used their collegiate eligibility. If a college freshman is 18 years old, the earliest they can be drafted is at 21, for example.\n\nHere's a list of the criteria that each player must meet to become draft eligible.\n\nMORE 2024 NFL DRAFT: Safest picks | Riskiest picks | Top sleepers | Small-school steals\n\nManning played just two games in his true freshman season, completing 2-of-5 passes for 30 yards.

McCarthy, other top prospects rank in 2024", "body": "The NFL Draft can be a humbling experience for the seasoned football fan. It's one thing to take in college football, but it's another when the recent teenagers become pros, experiencing the dream of playing in the NFL.\n\nNot everyone in the NCAA immediately elects to go pro as quickly as they can. At times, there are players still playing collegiately that are older than others making a name for themselves at the highest level of football. However, there are plenty on the other end of the spectrum, as teams have their eyes on 20 and 21-year-olds looking to build up their future.\n\nThe ages of the top prospects are about the same each season, but if you want to feel old, here's a fun fact for you: There's a player eligible to be selected at the 2024 NFL Draft that was born in 2004. Yes, you read that right.\n\nSo, who else are among the most youthful prospects waiting to hear their names called on draft day? Here's a look at the youngest players available in the 2024 NFL Draft.\n\nSN's NFL DRAFT HQ\n\nLive picks tracker | 7-round mock draft | Top 250 big board\n\nThere are a few 20-year-olds in the 2024 NFL Draft class, but only one has the honor of being born in 2004 -- Braelon Allen. The Wisconsin running back does not look anything like his age, as he comes in listed at 6-2, 240 pounds. He has all the elements of a true power runner and could find a role in the NFL as an early-down runner.\n\n2024 NFL DRAFT TOP 10 LISTS: QBs | RBs | WRs | TEs | EDGE\n\nStaying on the theme of power backs, Audris Estime out of Notre Dame is another well-built running back who plays on the nasty side. The Fighting Irish RB has a bit more quickness to his game than Allen, and he has a knack for finding and bursting through holes behind the offensive line.\n\nMarvin Harrison Jr. has long been touted as the top non-quarterback in the 2024 draft class. While there is a strong argument for the Ohio State product, Malik Nabers has a strong case to be considered for that honor. The LSU receiver is as smooth of a route runner as they come and his quickness allows him to pick up extra yards after the catch.\n\nMORE: How Nabers compares to LSU greats Ja'Marr Chase, Justin Jefferson\n\nThe running back class in 2024 is not overly impressive, but one of the first RBs who could be taken off the board is Jonathan Brooks. The Texas running back may not be the best pure runner, but he has the ability to make an impact in the passing game. He's dangerous in the open field with his quickness and speed, and he could be a great complementary back as a pro.\n\nKeon Coleman is one of the youngest players in the draft class, yet his build is already at an NFL level. At 6-3, 213 pounds, he has the size to translate from college to the pros, and an exceptional skill set, as well. The Florida State product is as technical as they come and is always a threat to make the big play. Don't be surprised if Coleman becomes a WR1 in the NFL.\n\nNFL DRAFT RUMORS: Drake Maye | Jayden Daniels | J.J. McCarthy | Vikings | 2024 Draft\n\nIf there's one word to describe Xavier Worthy, it's fast. The Texas wide receiver broke John Ross' NFL Combine record in the 40-yard dash, blazing his way to an eye-popping 4.21 seconds. Worthy has always had excellent acceleration in his arsenal, but he's a complete wide receiver who could find himself taken on Day 1.\n\nWatch out for Jaylen Wright when he hits the open field. The Tennessee running back is explosive when he bursts through a hole, as his straight-line speed is one of his best assets. Wright also can be used in the passing game, so his versatility should make him an intriguing Day 2 option.\n\nBrock Bowers is the clear-cut top tight end entering the 2024 NFL Draft, but Ja'Tavion Sanders could be the next-best option. The Longhorns TE is an athletic receiver who has a proven ability to make a difference in the passing game. He may not be as strong on the blocking side, but if a team needs an athletic red-zone weapon, expect Sanders to be one of the targets.\n\nAnother wide receiver in this year's loaded class is Troy Franklin. The Oregon standout carries a tantalizing package of size, speed, and agility, making him an enticing option as an open-field threat in the passing game. There's a chance he sneaks into the first round, but if not, a team could be getting a steal with a Day 2 selection.\n\nMORE: Experts explain J.J. McCarthy's meteoric rise up draft boards\n\nThere may be no polarizing QB prospect this year than J.J. McCarthy. He was originally considered a borderline first-round candidate, but then he impressed at the NFL Scouting Combine and Michigan Pro Day, and now could hear his name go in the top 10. The Wolverines QB is an incredibly athletic playmaker who throws well out of the pocket and shows great speed on all of his passes. The accuracy needs work, but there is the potential for McCarthy to excel in the NFL.", "source": {"uri": "sportingnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sporting News"}, "authors": [], "concepts":

{"uri": "8096695289", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2024-04-25", "time": "12:10:06", "dateTime": "2024-04-25T12:10:06Z", "dateTimePub": "2024-04-25T12:08:59Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.5215686559677124, "url": "https://sports.yahoo.com/marvin-harrison-jr-joe-alt-120202639.html", "title": "Marvin Harrison Jr., Joe Alt among 2024 NFL draft prospects with football family ties", "body": "A draft class featuring the offspring of notable former NFL players is not unusual.\n\nThe 2024 draft class, however, is an exception.\n\nThis year's group of prospects features two who have fathers in the Pro Football Hall of Fame (and a third who could be a first-ballot selection once eligible). In all, eight prospects have fathers who were selected to at least one Pro Bowl (with the eight combining for an astonishing 39 Pro Bowl nods). That's some incredible NFL pedigree about to enter the league.\n\nWith that in mind, here's a breakdown of 2024 draft prospects who had fathers play in the NFL, as well as those who had (or currently have) brothers and other relations in the league:\n\nLiving up to the expectations set by a Pro Football Hall of Fame father who played the same position won't be easy, but Marvin Harrison Jr. possesses next-level route running, body control and ball skills that will make him the envy of any team selecting at the top of the first round that does not have an immediate need for a quarterback. His father was a first-round selection (No. 19 overall) in the 1996 draft and went on to play 13 NFL seasons. He was an eight-time Pro Bowl selection, three-time first-team All-Pro, voted to the NFL's All-2000s team and was a member of the Indianapolis Colts' Super Bowl XLI-winning team.\n\nIn what is a strong 2024 draft class for offensive tackles, Alt is the clear top-rated prospect at the position. Alt stands at 6-foot-9 and 321 pounds, and possess athleticism to add to that immense size. His father, John Alt, was a 6-foot-8 behemoth who played 13 seasons in the NFL, all with the Kansas City Chiefs. He was a first-round selection (No. 21 overall) in the 1984 NFL draft and a two-time Pro Bowl selection.\n\nJenkins could be the second former Michigan Wolverines player off the board during this year's draft, following quarterback J.J. McCarthy. In addition to his skills, Jenkins brings the pedigree of being the son of a four-time Pro Bowl defensive tackle. Jenkins the elder was a second-round pick in the 2001 NFL draft by the Carolina Panthers and went on to play 10 NFL seasons.\n\nThink Marvin Harrison Jr. faces pressure to live up to his Hall of Fame father? Brenden Rice is the son of the wide receiver G.O.A.T. who is arguably the best NFL player of all time, Jerry Rice. The football family ties for Brenden Rice run deep. His half-brother, Jerry Rice Jr., was a wide receiver who played at UCLA and UNLV. His brother, Qualen Cunningham, was a defensive end at Texas A&M; and his stepfather, Rick Cunningham, was an offensive lineman who played eight seasons in the NFL.\n\nJonah Elliss is in a family full of football players. His brothers Christian Elliss and Noah Elliss each have been on NFL rosters. Christian plays for the New England Patriots, while Noah has been on the Philadelphia Eagles' practice squad. Their father, Luther Elliss, was a standout defensive lineman in the NFL. A first-round pick (No. 20 overall) by the Detroit Lions in the 1995 NFL draft, Luther Elliss played 10 seasons in the NFL and earned two Pro Bowl selections. Jonah Elliss brings a high-energy game that likely has NFL teams intrigued by his pro possibilities.\n\nHere's another family full of football players. Brothers Christian and Max McCaffrey each have NFL experience, with Christian among the most electric players currently in the league. Their father, Ed McCaffrey, was a third-round selection by the New York Giants in the 1991 NFL draft. He played mostly as a reserve (he did win a Super Bowl ring with the 49ers in 1994) before catching on with the Denver Broncos, posting three 1,000-yard seasons, earning a Pro Bowl nod and winning two Super Bowls. Luke McCaffrey projects as a possible slot receiver in the NFL.\n\nJeremiah Trotter, a Philadelphia Eagles icon nicknamed the \"Axe Man,\" played 11 seasons in the NFL after being a third-round pick in the 1998 NFL draft and earned four Pro Bowl selections. Jeremiah Trotter Jr. was a first-team All-ACC selection, a finalist for the Butkus Award (presented to college football's best linebacker) and the sort of tackling machine that NFL teams crave for their rosters.\n\nFrank Gore played so long he nearly got to be in the league at the same time as his son (something the NBA's LeBron James is aiming to do with his son, Bronny). Gore played 16 seasons in the NFL (2005-2020) after being a third-round pick by the San Francisco 49ers in the 2005 draft, and is third on the league's all-time rushing yardage list behind Emmitt Smith and Walter Payton (and ahead of Barry Sanders, Curtis Martin, LaDainian Tomlinson, Jerome Bettis, Eric Dickerson, Tony Dorsett, Jim Brown ... shall we name more Hall of Famers?). Despite questions about his overall speed, Frank Gore Jr. at least will get a training camp look from some NFL team.\n\nDurable player who was a team captain and first-team All-SEC pick in 2023, Javon Foster is the type of prospect who could stick with a 53-player roster going into the 2024 NFL season. His father, Jerome Foster, was a fifth-round pick by the Houston Oilers in the 1983 draft and went on to play five seasons in the NFL as a defensive end.\n\nJaylen Harrell is one of many Michigan players who could hear their names called during the 2024 NFL draft. An astonishing 18 Wolverines were invited to the NFL scouting combine. Jaylen Harrell, an edge rusher, was among those 18. Father James Harrell played eight seasons in the NFL (1979-1987), mostly with the Detroit Lions and primarily in a reserve role. That seems to be his son's potential NFL role as well.\n\nDrake Nugent played two seasons at Stanford before using the transfer portal to join Michigan, where he was a first-team All-Big Ten selection and finalist for the Rimington Trophy (presented to college football's top center). His father, Terry Nugent, was a quarterback who picked in the sixth round of the 1984 draft by the Cleveland Browns. He appeared in one NFL game, doing so for the Indianapolis Colts during the NFLPA strike of 1987.\n\nNot as celebrated as his Longhorns teammates Adonai Mitchell - who is a projected first-round pick - and Xavier Worthy - who ran a record 40-yard dash time at the combine - the 6-foot-1 205-pound Whittington was the thunder to the Mitchell-Worthy lightning. His father, Arthur Whittington, was a running back who was picked in the seventh round of the 1978 draft by the Oakland Raiders, with whom he was a member of the Super Bowl 15-winning team.",

McCarthy, Brock Bowers, other top prospects aren't at 2024 NFL Draft in Detroit", "body": "It's no Oscars or Grammys or Met Gala, but the NFL Draft is pretty close.\n\nEach year, the NFL's top prospects put on their best suits and ties to walk the red carpet at the draft. It's a chance for them to show off their style and personality before heading to the pros. It's an added bonus for fans, too, as seeing players walk across the stage after hearing their names called is one of the best parts of the event.\n\nMany of the top college stars will be in Detroit come Thursday. The latest Heisman winner, the No. 1 pick, and more will grace downtown before officially becoming a pro. However, the red carpet will still be without over half of the first-round picks.\n\nJ.J. McCarthy led Michigan to the latest national championship after the Wolverines' tumultuous season. He's one of many, many talented and highly anticipated quarterbacks in this year's draft.\n\nHowever, he won't be in Detroit. The NFL's official listing of attendees does not include the Michigan QB, as he declined the league's invitation.\n\nHe's expected to be selected in the first round of the draft as the No. 3 or 4 quarterback off the board, but McCarthy will be watching the draft at home with close friends and family and shown virtually after his name is selected.\n\nMORE: Tracking the latest news and rumors for J.J. McCarthy ahead of the 2024 NFL Draft\n\nBrock Bowers is arguably one of the best tight ends to play college football. He helped Georgia to back-to-back national championships and holds the program's single-season record for receiving touchdowns with 13 as a freshman.\n\nWhile he is long and far the best TE in the NFL Draft, he won't be in Detroit. Bowers is one of three prospects to turn down the league's invitation to the event.\n\nInstead, he'll be with his family watching the event from home. Whether that's in Napa, Calif., or Athens, Ga., only time will tell.\n\n2024 NFL DRAFT TOP 10 LISTS: QBs | RBs | WRs | TEs | EDGE\n\nEvery year, the NFL invites a select number of top prospects to the draft to walk the red carpet and accept their new team's hat and jersey on stage. It makes sense the league only wants first-rounders in Detroit. The first night of the draft (Thursday) only goes through the first round, so any players selected later would have little reason to attend the event in-person.\n\nThis year, there will be 13 prospects, no more than three from each position, waiting in the green room to walk the stage at Campus Martius in Detroit. That isn't always a solid number, as 17 draftees were in Kansas City last year.\n\nAttending the draft does not mean a player is guaranteed to be picked first round.\n\nMORE: Tracking the latest news and buzz ahead of the 2024 NFL Draft\n\nThe main event kicks off Thursday, April 25 at 8 p.m. ET.

For some who were able to excel in college but never came close to matching those achievements in the NFL, it was the pinnacle of their careers. For others, winning the Heisman Trophy wasn't the end of their football story. For all they accomplished in college, more greatness awaited them in the professional ranks.\n\nAs Daniels awaits to be selected Thursday in the first round of the 2024 NFL Draft, those same questions will follow him: Can college football's most outstanding and electrifying player in 2023 become the face of a franchise, someone who can help an NFL team fulfill its Super Bowl dreams? And what does his status as a Heisman winner do for his draft stock and where he might ultimately be picked?\n\nIn the leadup to this week's draft, here's a look at the recent history of Heisman Trophy winners in the NFL Draft and how they fared once getting to the league:\n\nWhile their NFL experiences varied once games actually began, Heisman winners have overwhelmingly at least been drafted over the past quarter-century. Since 1994, only one Heisman recipient went undrafted: Oklahoma quarterback Jason White, who won the award in 2003, but whose physical limitations and lengthy injury history didn't make him a viable professional prospect.\n\nIn recent years, winning the Heisman has come close to guaranteeing a high draft position. All but one Heisman winner since 2007 has been selected in the first round of the draft. Even the exception to that trend, former Alabama star running back Derrick Henry -- a second-round draft pick in 2015 -- has gone on to a successful NFL career that was highlighted by a 2020 season in which he won NFL Offensive Player of the Year.\n\nHere is where every Heisman winner since 2000 has been taken in the NFL draft:\n\nThe NFL draft has been even kinder to LSU Heisman Trophy winners.\n\nThe Tigers' previous two Heisman recipients before Daniels - Billy Cannon in 1959 and Joe Burrow in 2019 - were both drafted No. 1 overall. Though Daniels is unlikely to continue that streak -- USC's Caleb Williams is widely projected to go to the Chicago Bears with the No. 1 overall pick -- the LSU quarterback nonetheless is expected to be a high draft selection.\n\nOnly a select handful of players have earned the distinction of winning both the Heisman Trophy and the NFL MVP, a group Daniels could potentially join depending on how he performs in the NFL.\n\nHere are the seven players who have managed the feat:\n\nREQUIRED READING: 2024 NFL mock draft: J.J. McCarthy or Drake Maye for Patriots at No. 3?\n\nAs the start of the 2024 NFL Draft inches closer, something resembling a consensus has been reached on Daniels, who is slated by virtually every major outlet with an NFL mock draft to go in the first three picks, most of which have him going No. 2 or No. 3 overall.\n\nHere's a sampling of where Daniels is projected to end up:", "source": {"uri": "sports.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo Sports"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jayden_Daniels", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jayden Daniels"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draft_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Draft (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LSU_Tigers_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "LSU Tigers football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/College_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "College football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heisman_Trophy", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Heisman Trophy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Quarterback"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dual-threat_quarterback", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dual-threat quarterback"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jason_White_(American_football)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jason White (American football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oklahoma_Sooners_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Oklahoma Sooners football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_agent", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Free agent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Bowl", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Super Bowl"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "American football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caleb_Williams", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Caleb Williams"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Burrow", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Joe Burrow"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billy_Cannon", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Billy Cannon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drake_University", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Drake University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Bears", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chicago Bears"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alabama_Crimson_Tide_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Alabama Crimson Tide football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derrick_Henry", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Derrick Henry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_England_Patriots", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "New England Patriots"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Ten-Pin", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Ten-Pin", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Candlepin", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Candlepin", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 75}], "image": "https://s.yimg.com/cv/apiv2/social/images/yahoo_default_logo-1200x1200.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9509328", "eventUri": "eng-9509328", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3960784313725489, "wgt": 132, "relevance": 1}

So for the NFL Draft, which starts tonight, you can wager on such topics as dogs, crying, hugging and smiling. And don't forget nail polish.\n\nThese prop bets are courtesy of BetOnline.com Sportsbook. They cover even the tiniest of details. So let's get started.\n\nFlip on tonight's NFL Draft coverage and you can hear analysis from two legendary, but unemployed coaches. Nick Saban, who retired from Alabama at the end of the 2023 season, will be on hand, as will Bill Belichick. Saban doesn't plan on a return to the sidelines. But Belichick, who parted ways with the Patriots earlier this year, does want to coach again.\n\nNeither coach is a warm and fuzzy sort. However, in a crazy moment, maybe one will smile. Who grins first?\n\nNick Saban: -150\n\nBill Belichick: +110\n\nCaleb Williams, the likely No. 1 pick of tonight's NFL Draft, has yet to reveal what he'll be wearing for the festivities. So we don't know what kind of nail art he'll sport. Williams started painting his nails back in high school. He usually only did so for game day. But we're thinking draft night also qualifies.\n\nAnd speaking of Williams, if he is the top pick of the NFL Draft, you can also bet on who he'll hug first back in the green room. Roger Goodell calls his name ... He hugs (or if it's someone else)\n\nSome of the best scenes of the NFL Draft are the live, unscripted ones. ESPN has camera crews stationed at several homes across the country for tonight's action. We'll see the player's parents and the rest of his family. The girlfriend will be somewhere on the couch.\n\nAnd there will be furry family members. The over/under on dogs shown on camera is 2. For cats, the o/u is 1. Dogs rule.\n\nJim Harbaugh, who won an NCAA championship for Michigan back in January, now is in charge of the Chargers. He makes his NFL Draft debut wearing Chargers gear tonight.\n\nThere is crazy buzz that suggests Harbaugh drafts his old quarterback, J.J. McCarthy. The team selects at No. 5. But maybe the Chargers trade down. The team also needs a running back and wide receiver. Maybe the best guess for a Wolverines-to-Chargers selection is running back Blake Corum in the later rounds.\n\nMeanwhile, there could be as many as 18 Michigan players selected in this year's NFL Draft. There's going to be a ton of Hail! Hail! to Michigan over the next three days.\n\nThe Eagles love the Bulldogs. Need evidence? Philadelphia drafted three Georgia players in last year's draft. Two of them were in the first round -- defensive tackle Jalen Carter and edge rusher Nolan Smith. Philly added DB Kelee Ringo in the third round.\n\nThe year before, the Eagles drafted two Bulldogs -- defensive tackle Jordan Davis and linebacker Nakobe Dean. Overall, Philadelphia has picked 26 Georgia players in its history. That's the most drafted by any NFL team.\n\nSo many NFL Draft prospects are second- or third-generation athletes. Or they have family members who played pro sports. So of course there will be family footage. What highlight package will ESPN show first?", "source": {"uri": "on3.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "On3"}, "authors": [{"uri": "suzanne_halliburton@on3.com", "name": "Suzanne Halliburton", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Belichick", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bill Belichick"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nick_Saban", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nick Saban"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alabama_Crimson_Tide_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Alabama Crimson Tide football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_England_Patriots", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New England Patriots"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caleb_Williams", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Caleb Williams"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Harbaugh", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jim Harbaugh"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draft_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Draft (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_school_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "High school football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roger_Goodell", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Roger Goodell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michigan", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Michigan"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Michigan"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NCAA_Division_I_men's_basketball_tournament", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jalen_Carter", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jalen Carter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kelee_Ringo", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kelee Ringo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jordan_Davis_(American_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jordan Davis (American football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blake_Corum", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Blake Corum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nakobe_Dean", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nakobe Dean"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defensive_tackle", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Defensive tackle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nolan_Smith", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nolan Smith"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgia_Bulldogs_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Georgia Bulldogs football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philadelphia_Eagles", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia Eagles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defensive_back", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Defensive back"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wide_receiver", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wide receiver"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linebacker", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Linebacker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Quarterback"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "ESPN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philadelphia", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgia_(U.S._state)", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Georgia (U.S. state)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Georgia (U.S. state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Ten-Pin", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Ten-Pin", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Candlepin", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Candlepin", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://on3static.com/uploads/dev/assets/cms/2024/04/24105506/nfl-draft-logo.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9509328", "eventUri": "eng-9509328", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1529411764705881, "wgt": 129, "relevance": 1}

The school would wait a few decades for its second -- offensive lineman Jake Long went to four Pro Bowls with the Miami Dolphins in his NFL career.\n\nThe late 80s and early 90s were very good to the Hurricanes, who emerged as the college football dynasty of the time, and went on to produce two top picks in a few years' time, including Russell Maryland, a former defensive tackle who won three Super Bowls in his NFL career, and quarterback Vinny Testaverde, a two-time Pro Bowl selection.\n\nSam Francis was the Cornhuskers' first No. 1 pick, playing with four teams before serving the nation in World War II. Fryar went to five Pro Bowls with four teams as the school's most recent top selection. Overall, Nebraska is ninth among college football programs with 363 draft picks.\n\nPenn State is seventh all-time with 367 draft picks, including six in 2021, and put out a pair of top selections: running back Ki-Jana Carter (1995) and Brown, a defensive end who remains one of the Cleveland Browns' biggest draft busts.\n\nGeorge Rogers was the first Gamecocks product to go No. 1 overall, adding two Pro Bowls and a Super Bowl ring to his career plaudits, which include a Heisman Trophy during the 1980 season. Clowney went to three Pro Bowls with the Houston Texans.\n\nLonghorns linebacker Tommy Nobis and running back Earl Campbell went on to earn 10 combined Pro Bowl nominations in their NFL careers, and Campbell is regarded as one of the best running backs in NFL history after a career defined by physical, determined, and aggressive play.\n\nPace went on to seven Pro Bowl selections in his NFL career, in addition to a win in Super Bowl XXXIV with St. Louis, and was elected to the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 2016. Defensive tackle Dan Wilkinson, one of the Buckeyes' stars during the 90s, played a 12-year pro career.\n\nBurrow and halfback Billy Cannon both played for national championship teams at LSU and both were Heisman Trophy winners. Cannon won three AFL championships with the Oilers and Raiders.\n\nJaMarcus Russell went No. 1 to the Raiders in 2007, but infamously failed to live up to his lofty expectations. Burrow has fared better so far, earning an AFC championship and Super Bowl appearance in his second NFL season.\n\nAll of Stanford's top draft picks have been quarterbacks, starting with Bobby Garrett in 1954, Jim Plunkett in 1971, John Elway in 1983, and Andrew Luck in 2012. Plunkett won a Super Bowl, Elway won two more, and Luck could have if he hadn't decided to retire early due to injuries.\n\nOne of the SEC schools with the most top overall selections, former Auburn players on this list include quarterback Cam Newton and legendary running back Bo Jackson, one of the best players in college football history at any position.\n\nNotre Dame has etched its name across not only college football history, but that of the NFL Draft, too, producing the most top picks. But it's been a while since the Irish climbed to the top of this ladder, with most of its run of elite talent production coming from the 1940s through 1960s.\n\nOU has emerged as quarterback factory in the 21st century, producing a trio of signal callers that went No. 1 since 2010, including Sam Bradford, Baker Mayfield, and Kyler Murray. All three also won the Heisman Trophy.\n\nThe top football factory on the West Coast, USC is also responsible for producing the second-most NFL Draft picks all-time with 516. Heisman Trophy winners O.J. Simpson and Carson Palmer highlight the Trojans' No. 1 selections.\n\nThe quarterback who recently won the Super Bowl of course comes to mind when you think of Georgia's top draft picks, but don't forget Frank Sinkwich, the halfback who also landed with Detroit and was NFL MVP in 1944.\n\nOr Charley Trippi, who was NFL champion in '47 and elected to the Hall of Fame in 1968. Edge rusher Travon Walker is the Bulldogs' most recent top pick, going No. 1 to the Jaguars in 2022.", "source": {"uri": "si.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sports Illustrated"}, "authors":

On the evening of April 25th in Detroit, they can finally put all of their plans into action.\n\nLike every year with the NFL Draft, their will be winners and losers after the highly-anticipated first round. Some teams will make major scores, while others reach too far or completely miss on their desired prospects.\n\nNFL Draft 2024: Teams most likely to pick up winning prospects\n\n#1 - Los Angeles Chargers\n\nThe Los Angeles Chargers made major changes during the offseason, including hiring head coach Jim Harbaugh. They also made notable offensive changes, such as moving on from both of their starting wide receivers.\n\nThey will have an opportunity to find a replacement with the fifth-overall pick, and if they take one of the top three wide receiver prospects, they should thrive with Justin Herbert.\n\nMany rumors circulated that they may stick with Justin Fields, but they eventually traded him to the Pittsburgh Steelers. As long as they stick with the apparent plan and don't try to get too creative, they could potentially have a generational talent in Williams.\n\n#3 - New York Giants\n\nThe 2024 NFL Draft features three wide receiver prospects that most around the league have labeled as elite.\n\nThe New York Giants currently hold the sixth pick, so they should have an opportunity to land one of them. While they are rumored to be considering a quarterback instead, they just gave Daniel Jones a contract extension last year, so giving him a much-needed weapon may be their best move.\n\nNFL Draft 2024: Teams most likely to stumble with their prospects\n\n#1 - Minnesota Vikings\n\nMany rumors have indicated that the Minnesota Vikings will be aggressive in trying to land a quarterback in the first round.\n\nMost of those rumors suggest that it will be JJ McCarthy and they may even try to trade up to as high as the fourth pick to get him. While they surely need an upgrade, such a bold move for a prospect who was once thought of as a mid-round pick seems like a reach if the Vikings do it.\n\n#2 - New York Jets\n\nThe offensive line has been a bit of an issue for the New York Jets in recent years. While they could address it in the first round of the 2024 NFL Draft, they are rumored to be targeting a pass-catcher instead.\n\nThis could be a bad decision if they do, especially considering Aaron Rodgers is 40 years old and coming off of a major Achilles injury. It may be a better idea to focus on protecting him.\n\n#3 - Arizona Cardinals\n\nThe Arizona Cardinals are reportedly interested in trading out their fourth-overall pick in the 2024 NFL Draft. They are theoretically looking to swap with a quarterback-needy team for a package of more draft picks.\n\nWhile they have several holes to fill, wide receiver is the most noticeable, especially with Marquise Brown this year. Potentially trading back will likely result in missing out on the top prospects in the position, leaving their offense around Kyler Murray depleted of weapons.", "source": {"uri": "sportskeeda.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sportskeeda"}, "authors": [{"uri": "adam_hulse@sportskeeda.com", "name": "Adam Hulse", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Chargers", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Chargers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wide_receiver", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Wide receiver"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota_Vikings", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota Vikings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_coach", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Head coach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Giants", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York Giants"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detroit", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Detroit"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Detroit"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Jones_(American_football)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Daniel Jones (American football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justin_Fields", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Justin Fields"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justin_Herbert", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Justin Herbert"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Harbaugh", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jim Harbaugh"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Quarterback"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_Steelers", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pittsburgh Steelers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marquise_Brown", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Marquise Brown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lineman_(gridiron_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lineman (gridiron football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyler_Murray", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kyler Murray"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Rodgers", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Aaron Rodgers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arizona_Cardinals", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Arizona Cardinals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Jets", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "New York Jets"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Gambling/Sports", "label": "dmoz/Games/Gambling/Sports", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Locks", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Locks", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Theme_Merchandise", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Theme Merchandise", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Fantasy", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Fantasy", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/CAD_and_CAM/Associations", "label": "dmoz/Computers/CAD and CAM/Associations", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 94}], "image": "https://staticg.sportskeeda.com/editor/2024/04/116c6-17140543858766-1920.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9509328", "eventUri": "eng-9509328", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-04-25", "textStart": 253, "textEnd": 263}], "sentiment": 0.2313725490196079, "wgt": 127, "relevance": 1}

Front offices have a chance to snag generational talents that might be one-of-one to Heisman Trophy finalists. With the likes of Bo Nix, Caleb Williams, Drake Maye, and Jayden Daniels who are among the choices, one might think that the first round could be crucial in shaping the next decade of the league. So, does that mean that franchises will be giving up some capital to move up? Ian Rapoport does not think so.\n\nWith the exception of Caleb Williams going to the Chicago Bears, there is nothing certain about where Jayden Daniels, Drake Maye, and the other quarterbacks are going. This makes it a perfect scenario for front offices to move their team's picks up in the 2024 NFL Draft. But, Ian Rapoport posits that they are not likely to do that. He explains why, via The Pat McAfee Show.\n\n\"You know there's been a lot of talks, and a lot of action. I don't know that we're going to see the massive run-up on quarterbacks that maybe we thought. If you're going to pay for either 2 or 3, it's going to be so much, that maybe someone does it, but I haven't gotten that sense right now,\" the NFL pundit declared.\n\nThe teams that are at the top might not be too willing to give up their picks. Currently, the Bears hold the right to go first in the 2024 NFL Draft. The Washington Commanders are second, Jerod Mayo's rebuilding New England Patriots go third, a weapon-seeking Arizona Cardinals squad picks fourth, and a Los Angeles Chargers squad with a new head honcho rounds out the top five.\n\nThe New York Giants, Tennessee Titans, and Atlanta Falcons then go next before the Ryan Poles' Bears get another pick.\n\nWho's who in the 2024 NFL Draft?\n\nThere have been a lot of players that fell down to the third or fourth rounds in the draft. Will Levis was a good example of this back in 2023 when he failed to get drafted in the first round and fell all the way to the 33rd overall pick. But, it does not seem like any of the prospects are going that far.\n\nAgain, Williams going to the Bears is a foregone conclusion. If Poles does not make that move, the franchise and its fans could be in shambles for years to come. Then, it has recently been a toss-up between Drake Maye and Jayden Daniels at number two. Regardless, the Patriots and the Commanders are going to have long-term solutions for their quarterback conundrums in the 2o24 NFL Draft.\n\nThen, a rare weapon is likely going to be drafted by the Cardinals because they already have Kyler Murray. This move takes away Marvin Harrison Jr. at the fifth pick. Now, the Los Angeles Chargers are in a tricky position. They could trade away the pick or keep it. Nonetheless, Joe Alt, Malik Malik Nabers, Laiatu Latu, Brock Bowers, and Rome Odunze will all be available for the taking here.", "source": {"uri": "clutchpoints.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ClutchPoints"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jay_postrado@clutchpoints.com", "name": "Jay Postrado", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ian_Rapoport", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ian Rapoport"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Quarterback"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drake_Maye", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Drake Maye"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caleb_Williams", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Caleb Williams"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jayden_Daniels", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Jayden Daniels"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bo_Nix", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bo Nix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Bears", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chicago Bears"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heisman_Trophy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Heisman Trophy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_Commanders", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Washington Commanders"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pat_McAfee", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pat McAfee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerod_Mayo", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jerod Mayo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color_commentator", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Color commentator"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_England_Patriots", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "New England Patriots"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvin_Harrison_Jr.", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Marvin Harrison Jr."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brock_Bowers", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Brock Bowers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Will_Levis", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Will Levis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Chargers", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Chargers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyler_Murray", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kyler Murray"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennessee_Titans", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tennessee Titans"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arizona_Cardinals", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Arizona Cardinals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Giants", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "New York Giants"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta_Falcons", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Atlanta Falcons"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Crafts/Soft_Toys", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Crafts/Soft Toys", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Moving_and_Relocating", "label": "dmoz/Home/Moving and Relocating", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Moving_and_Relocating/Moving", "label": "dmoz/Home/Moving and Relocating/Moving", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Locks", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Locks", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Fantasy", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Fantasy", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 59}], "image": "https://wp.clutchpoints.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Ian-Rapoport-pushes-back-on-massive-QB-run-ahead-of-NFL-Draft.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9509328", "eventUri": "eng-9509328", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2156862745098038, "wgt": 126, "relevance": 1}

Will they choose the best player available, or draft for team needs? No matter the answer, the immediate reaction to whoever's name is called will be \"Awesome! But how likely are they to succeed in the NFL?\"\n\nThat's the billion dollar question, isn't it? While some players like Caleb Williams, Marvin Harrison Jr., Joe Alt, and Dallas Turner are all considered \"can't-bust\" prospects and the best at their position in this year's class, no one is immune from busting. There is no way of knowing for certain which players will or won't succeed, but there are some patterns that can help us determine how well a player will perform. Most notably, their position.\n\nWhile not every position gets drafted at the same rate in the first round, the expectations for first-round draftees are always the same: be a game-changer that takes your team to the next level. That's easier said than done though. However, some positions must be easier to scout, because there is a vast difference in levels of success between some positions in the league. So, which position produces the most/least serviceable NFL talent? Quarterbacks? Receivers? Offensive linemen? Defensive backs?\n\nHere are the hit rates for every position in the NFL over the last twenty years based on various measurements of success.\n\n2024 NFL Draft: Latest NFL mock draft picks for top 5 players\n\nOne way to determine NFL success is whether or not the team that drafted you wants to keep you around. Obviously, there are some instances where a team can't afford to keep someone coming off their rookie deal around, and that can really damage certain positions' percentages as markets in the NFL fluctuate.\n\nFor example, wide receivers are becoming more and more valuable by the day and their market keeps getting driven up. However, as they become more expensive, more and more teams will be unable to afford them, making it more likely they join a different team by the end of their rookie contracts. Running backs, on the other hand, keep seeing their value drop. Even though a great one can be an incredible weapon, their price tags make it more likely that teams will retain their star tailbacks.\n\nAt the same time though, a lot of halfbacks drafted in the first round are driven into the ground by the team that drafts them. Since they're so highly touted, they're often expected to be workhorses right away, and oftentimes, that can lead to regression by their fourth years. Many teams will refuse to re-sign their tailbacks in those cases because they've seen the regression first hand and don't want to pay for someone who isn't as good as they once were.\n\nAs you can see, offensive linemen have been pretty good bets to remain on their teams through their rookie contracts, whereas skill position players and DBs tend to be near the bottom. With that in mind, perhaps the best course of action for teams looking to rebuild would be to build the offensive line first, because they are the most likely players to stick around when their team eventually drafts a quarterback and weapons that can win them a Super Bowl while still only making rookie contract money.\n\nAnother measure of success could be first team All-Pro appearances. While the Pro Bowl is great, many skeptics believe the game to be a popularity contest that doesn't always put the league's best players on the proper pedestals. All-Pro selections are more or less concrete, although not bulletproof.\n\nSome positions barely get any recognition in the All-Pro department. For example, quarterbacks only get one first team All-Pro every year. Players like Josh Allen, who are by no means a bust would not register on this metric since he's never been named first-team All-Pro.\n\nStill, it's hard to argue against an All-Pro being a bust, so here is every first-round position ranked by how many First Team All-Pro selections they had between 2010 and 2019.\n\nSurprisingly, a running back drafted in the first round is the most likely position to become an All-Pro at some point in the future. It makes sense. Given the way the NFL is headed in regards to running backs, it would take a truly incredible talent to warrant a first-round pick.\n\nOf the 16 running backs drafted in the first round in the 2010s, five of them ended up first team All-Pros at one point or another in their careers (31%) - Josh Jacobs, Todd Gurley, Doug Martin, Ezekiel Elliott, and Christian McCaffrey.\n\nAfter running backs, the next most likely positions to produce first team All-Pros are center (29%), guard (27%), and defensive back (23%). The least likely positions to produce first teamers are tight end (0%), quarterback (10%), and wide receiver (12%).\n\nThe 2024 draft class is very quarterback-heavy, with some experts predicting as many as six quarterbacks being selected in the first round this year - Caleb Williams, Jayden Daniels, Drake Maye, J.J. McCarthy, Michael Penix, and Bo Nix. Many believe that each of the first three picks of the draft will be quarterbacks.\n\nThe last time that happened was 2021 when Trevor Lawrence (Jacksonville), Zach Wilson (New York Jets), and Trey Lance (San Francisco) were taken with the first three picks. Although Trevor Lawrence was considered a generational prospect, he hasn't lived up to the hype quite yet. While he has led his team to the playoffs and even has a playoff win under his belt, he has not shown MVP-caliber talent like most people expected.\n\nThis year, a similar situation is upon us. USC's Caleb Williams is considered a generational talent at quarterback by some people, and he will likely be taken first overall. Clearly though, that doesn't guarantee he will be great in the NFL. Frankly, every other quarterback taken in the first round of that 2021 class wound up underwhelming in the NFL (with Justin Fields being an exception, as the court of public opinion is still undecided on him).\n\nOf course, that doesn't mean the 2024 quarterback class is doomed to fail. It's just that although there are many chances for one of them to become a star, that is not a guarantee.\n\nSince 1999, 74 quarterbacks have been taken in the first-round of the NFL Draft. USA Today's Jim Sergent lists that only 28 of those picks (38%) wound up being franchise stalwarts, while 39 would up being disappointments.\n\nThe hit rate on quarterbacks isn't spectacular in the first-round, but unless you're the 49ers and happen to stumble into a Pro Bowler with the last pick in the draft, there isn't much hope you'll find a franchise guy outside of the first round.\n\nWatch the draft: Stream the 2024 NFL Draft with a Fubo subscription\n\nWe occasionally recommend interesting products and services.

In round one, each team will have 10 minutes to make a pick while in the second round, teams will have seven minutes to make a selection.\n\nFrom rounds three to six, teams will have five minutes to make their selection, regardless of whether the picks are regular or compensatory. Lastly, teams will have four minutes to make a pick in round seven.\n\nFor all the latest on news, politics, sports, and showbiz from the USA, go to The Mirror US\n\nBryce Young was the first overall pick of the NFL Draft in 2023 What happens if a team fails to make pick in time?\n\nWith that in mind, teams often already have an idea of what they will do with their picks on any given day. However, if a team somehow forgets to make a selection during the time period, the next team on the clock is free to submit a pick ahead of it. The original organization will be allowed to make the selection as soon as it informs the league, but it no longer holds the exclusive right to make a pick once time runs out.\n\nPerhaps the most glaring example of having the time limit run out occurred during the 2003 draft with the Minnesota Vikings. Back then, the first round took place on Saturday and teams were given 15 minutes to decide on their pick.\n\nAt the time, the Vikings were discussing trades with three teams - the Baltimore Ravens, Jacksonville Jaguars and New England Patriots - at the same time. The Vikings eventually settled on a trade with the Ravens, which would give Baltimore the seventh pick in exchange for the 10th pick and picks in the fourth and sixth rounds.\n\nInstead, time ran out and the Jaguars selected Byron Leftwich with the No. 8 pick, the same player the Ravens wanted to draft No. 7. The Carolina Panthers quickly picked Jordon Gross after Jacksonville, leaving the Vikings to select No. 9 overall.\n\nMinnesota selected Kevin Williams when they were able to finalize their pick. Afterward, Vikings coach Mike Tice explained how the team informed the NFL of the deal with the Ravens with 32 seconds remaining but Baltimore reportedly did not sign off in time, showcasing how important it is to understand how much time is left.\n\n\"I'm pissed,\" Tice said at the time, per ESPN. \"There is no other way I can put it.\"", "source": {"uri": "mirror.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Mirror"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jarrod_castillo@mirror.co.uk", "name": "Jarrod Castillo", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draft_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Draft (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eli_Manning", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Eli Manning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_manager", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "General manager"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Jets", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York Jets"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bryce_Young", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bryce Young"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota_Vikings", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota Vikings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byron_Leftwich", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Byron Leftwich"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Williams_(defensive_tackle)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kevin Williams (defensive tackle)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Tice", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mike Tice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baltimore_Ravens", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Baltimore Ravens"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carolina_Panthers", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Carolina Panthers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_England_Patriots", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "New England Patriots"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacksonville_Jaguars", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jacksonville Jaguars"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "ESPN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vikings", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Vikings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baltimore", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Baltimore"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Baltimore"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacksonville,_Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jacksonville, Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Jacksonville, Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Paintball/Teams", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Paintball/Teams", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Robotics/Competitions", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Robotics/Competitions", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Airsoft/Teams", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Airsoft/Teams", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Paintball/Scenario", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Paintball/Scenario", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Theme_Merchandise", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Theme Merchandise", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 88}], "image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/news/us-news/article32656845.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_gettyimages-116614238.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9509328", "eventUri": "eng-9509328", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3098039215686275, "wgt": 122, "relevance": 1}

But Do Sportsbooks Actually Know Anything?", "body": "The legalization of sports gambling has dramatically changed how fans consume football. Al Michaels's not-so-subtle acknowledgements when a late play would flip the point spread or push the total over, long a treasured and cheeky toeing of the line, now feel mundane. Almost every major sports league has a partnership with a sportsbook (or two, or three). Betting segments populate pregame shows, with analysis not just on lines and totals, but specific player props as well. Some of our podcasts here at The Ringer are brought to you by FanDuel Sportsbook -- I should know, I've read their ads a thousand times. Betting on sports has become an inexorable part of how we consume sports.\n\nThis shift has trickled to the NFL draft, where you can bet on anything from Kool-Aid McKinstry's draft slot (current over/under: 28.5) to the position of the first player selected by the Cleveland Browns (current favorite: defensive line/edge at +170) to the exact player to go ninth overall (Byron Murphy, +170) to who the second tight end selected will be (Ben Sinnott, +175). Just five years ago, the likelihood that a certain team would pick a certain player could only be riddled out from the exact wording used by a few league insiders. Today, we can replace our Twitter-powered crystal ball with cold, hard numbers backed by cash. How likely is Jayden Daniels to go second overall? At press time, his odds stand at -950. That's an implied 90 percent chance.\n\nBut anyone who has dropped $5 on the Chiefs to beat the Bills, and another $5 on the Patriots to draft J.J. McCarthy, will notice something quickly: NFL draft markets don't behave like the markets on NFL games. Not at all.\n\nRewind the clock one year. It's the week of the 2023 draft, and Alabama quarterback Bryce Young is definitely, absolutely, no question, for sure, going to be the first overall pick. Earlier in April, that wasn't certain -- Ohio State QB C.J. Stroud was the favorite (-333, an implied 77 percent chance) -- but by draft week, the Panthers' intentions had apparently leaked, and Bryce Young's name was written in stone. Sportsbooks were sure -- to the tune of -2000 odds -- that Young was going to be a Panther.\n\nThen, two days before the draft, Kentucky QB Will Levis made that stone crack. Just a little, but enough. Levis's odds to be the first overall selection went from +4000 to +400 -- a movement from 2 percent to 20 percent.\n\nCould the Panthers really be doubting themselves at the 11th hour? Had every national and local reporter been duped? Was ownership stepping in and taking control of the draft room?\n\nOr was everyone just overreacting to a Reddit post -- yes, a Reddit post -- from an anonymous account claiming that Levis was telling friends and family that he was going to be the first pick?\n\nThree sentences from u/SaleAgreeable2834 was apparently all that was needed to make markets fly. At the beginning of the day, a $10 bet on Levis to go first would have made you $400 if it hit -- by the afternoon, the same bet would have made you $40.\n\nOnly that wasn't it! Just days before, Levis had overtaken Stroud to be the second overall pick to the Houston Texans -- his odds at BetMGM sat at -145 just four days before the draft began.\n\nAnd that's not all! Just days before that, Levis was the favorite to go fourth overall to the Indianapolis Colts.\n\nAnd where did Levis end up going? Not first, as that anonymous Redditor -- who had never posted before and has not posted since -- promised. Not second, where he'd been steadily climbing as the favorite over Stroud. Not fourth, where he was a favorite over Florida QB Anthony Richardson until the moment the pick was announced. He went 33rd overall. Not even in the first round.\n\nWhat happened with Levis last year does not happen with NFL games. When the Chiefs open as a 3-point favorite over the Bills, they don't suddenly become a 9-point favorite because someone on Reddit thinks Patrick Mahomes is a winner. And Kansas City doesn't subsequently stumble so hard that they lose by 50.\n\nSo while betting on the NFL draft may scratch the same itch for an enterprising fan that betting on NFL games does -- chasing a gut feeling, sending screenshots of long shots in the group chat, rooting for Your Guys -- it's important to understand that the two events are not similar at all. And if Vegas is pretty much unbeatable in standard NFL games ... does that mean they're beatable when it comes to the NFL draft?\n\nI spoke to Jeffrey Benson, the director of operations at Circa Sportsbook, about the difference between setting a line for an NFL game as opposed to one for a player in the NFL draft. \"If you have any semblance of an idea of what you're doing, the worst that you're going to do is open the Titans -1.5 when the market maybe hangs -3,\" he said. \"Maybe you open 46 (on the total) when the market hangs 48. It'd be pretty hard, if you follow the sport, and you've been doing this for a long time, where you open a point spread that's 20 points off.\"\n\nIt's not just that books have been setting lines for NFL games for a long time -- it's that they have a computer to help them do it. There are enough metrics out there to create solid power rankings and produce reasonable lines for any matchup. Adjustments are made -- maybe the Chiefs have been traveling for three straight weeks, or the Bills are missing key starters. That's where the experience comes in to set a number that is fine-tuned and relatively stable.\n\nDraft markets behave in exactly the opposite way. Initial lines are created not by an algorithmic recommendation, but by heuristic musing. As Nick Bogdanovich, who was in charge of setting the lines for Circa's 2023 NFL draft markets, said last year: \"You're listening to every podcast you can, watching TV and scouring the internet for information. I compiled 10 or 11 mock drafts from respectable people and used that to try to come up with a good number.\"\n\nBecause there is so little to go off of, those lines are not posted with the expectation that they're correct -- rather, books know that those lines will get hammered by sharp bettors. Sharp bettors are those bettors who are reliably profitable, but there's an enormous difference between a sharp bettor on NFL action -- one who is good at picking winners in NFL games, likely with a data-based edge or a reliable system -- and a sharp bettor in the NFL draft market. The latter is usually someone who is informed. While having a source with an NFL team can give you a bit of an edge in an NFL game -- imagine someone who knows the severity of a Jalen Hurts injury before the public does -- it gives you a much greater edge in the NFL draft market.\n\nThose sharp NFL draft bettors inundate the market with money, and the lines fly accordingly. Benson used Jer'Zhan Newton, the Illinois defensive tackle, as an example of how rapidly Circa responds to money in the NFL draft market. Circa initially opened Newton's draft position at 17.5. Within minutes of posting, they brought Newton's number all the way up to 32.5. \"What I don't think people realize, when somebody sees Newton go from 17 to 32, they're like 'Oh my God, they took 25 steps to get there.' That's not really the reality ... the first two bets may have been on Newton, and he goes from 17.5 to 22.5. The next two bets are on Newton, he goes from 22.5 to 27.5. The next two bets are on Newton, now he's at 32.5, and we're writing two-way action.\"\n\nBy \"writing two-way action,\" Benson means they're starting to take bets on Newton's under and on Newton's over -- and that's where sportsbooks want to be in the NFL draft markets. It's hard, if not impossible, to get 50 percent of the money on a player's over, and 50 percent on the under -- especially in the case of a player like Newton, whose line moved so much. But eventually, the books want those lines to reach a place of homeostasis, where they're taking about as many tickets on the under as they are on the over.\n\nThis works for a player's over/under market, which is a simple two-way market, much like an NFL point spread is -- but what about something a bit more complex, like that pesky second-overall market which had Levis and Stroud and Will Anderson Jr. and Tyree Wilson listed? Those markets with tons of potential winners -- which Benson calls \"index markets\" -- react even more quickly to incoming money. It's one thing for a sportsbook to pay out on posting a bad Newton line, where most winners pay out at around -110 (a $110 bet wins $100 for the bettor). If you're lucky, maybe you're snagging a payout around +150, but that's about as high as they get. It's much riskier for a sportsbook to hang a bad line on an index market, where a bettor might be able to wager at +300 or +400 or higher, and a winning $110 bet is paying out $330 or $440 to the bettor.\n\nLook at the current odds on Fanduel Sportsbook for this year's second pick. Jayden Daniels is a bigger favorite right now than he's ever been on the book.\n\nBut what if, just as you're reading this, someone with a huge account comes in and drops $10,000 on Drake Maye at +650? No Adam Schefter report. No history from this account at dominating in the NFL draft. The book will now pay a whopping $65,000 to that bettor if they're right. And in a market with no algorithms, no computer-generated line that historically sets a fair price -- in a market based on just information, and not very much of it -- that $10,000-sized nugget can weigh as heavily as Schefter's musings or u/SaleAgreeable2834's post. The book has to move on that information now.\n\nThat's how markets like Will Levis's last season get out of hand. Like most of us who aren't employed at the highest levels of NFL front offices, sportsbooks are flying blind in the NFL draft. They jump at every shadow of new information, desperate to not be the book on the market with the worst Levis line or Maye line. They've been hammered too many times on these exact markets. In the 2022 NFL draft, Georgia edge rusher Travon Walker was a substantial underdog to be the first overall pick, and books took a bath when the public figured out that the Jaguars were targeting him with the top selection. In the 2022 NBA draft, the Orlando Magic pulled a late stunner when they took Paolo Banchero with the top overall pick over Jabari Smith Jr., and books got hammered on that as well.\n\nAt this point, Circa does not offer index markets on the NFL draft, and they don't even offer bets on any other drafts besides that of the NFL. And despite the fact that they've passed on these specific markets, Circa still expects to lose money. \"It's a loss leader,\" Benson tells me. \"But it's something that we do because it's the biggest league in the world, and there's an expectation that we're going to offer it.\" Reflecting on the Banchero fiasco for Fox Sports, Tieme Wesselink, a trader for the now defunct Fox Bet, made much of the same observation. \"Generally, books, including ours, see more red numbers than green numbers on draft wagering for NFL, NBA, NHL. We still love to continue to offer draft betting as it is a great way to build stories around the draft and to keep customers engaged in the sport during the offseason.\"\n\nOf course, books aren't in the business of losing money. From removing some markets to putting limits on bet sizes, sportsbooks are trying to find ways to still post the NFL draft and keep you engaged in the offseason, but without too large of an expense to their wallets. Another way to do that? Move even faster to new information. React more explosively to every new scrap of intel. Never, ever, be caught hanging a stale line that the public can take advantage of.\n\nIn this way, there's a cognitive dissonance between the public's view on a sportsbook's draft lines, and the way the book views it internally. When Levis suddenly becomes the favorite to go second or fourth overall, the public wonders if the sportsbook knows something. But the sportsbooks aren't trying to know anything, really. They aren't so much trying to outsmart the public as they are trying to reflect what the public believes -- whatever the money believes. And while you're there, pawing through odds for J.J. McCarthy to go second overall or Rome Odunze to be the pick for the Bears at no. 9, they're hoping you drop a few dollars on the Celtics to cover, as well.\n\nSo there is no wisdom of the sportsbook in April -- no \"Vegas is always right,\" as we often parrot during the season, when the public hammers a Week 9 line that inevitably fails to cover. Instead, the sportsbook becomes no different than any bettor who saw a Redditor say they've heard that a prospect is telling friends and family that he'll be the no. 1 pick. It's lying season, and sportsbooks are just as gullible as the rest of us.", "source": {"uri": "theringer.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Ringer"}, "authors": [{"uri":

[Everyone] really comes together to watch the draft. And that red carpet moment, it's such an important style moment.\"\n\nThe NFL has robust coverage plans for the draft to highlight the prospective players and their red carpet looks. In addition to multiple broadcasts and social streaming, the NFL's social media team will be on the red carpet with 13 prospective players to create content that aims to fully immerse viewers.\n\nAs the intersection of sport and fashion continues to gain in importance, specifically among Gen Z and younger, the NFL is \"really focused on leveling that up and supporting our players,\" said Kylie Callura, the manager of social content and production at the NFL. \"As they continue to see the storytelling efforts that we're doing across our entire ecosystem, it kind of gives them an incentive to lean into their fashion a little bit more and have more fun with it.\"\n\nThe NFL Draft has had a history of memorable fashion moments over the decades. Anderson and Callura pointed to former football players like Deion Sanders and his black and white tracksuit at the NFL Draft in 1989, Ray Lewis and his white, black and gold flashy outfit in 1996 and Ezekiel Elliott and his cropped dress shirt in 2016 as notable moments.\n\nOther football players have used the draft to give a nod to their roots. For instance, last year Christian Gonzalez wore a jacket featuring the Colombian flag on the interior, and in 2022 Sauce Gardner accessorized a powder blue suit with a \"Sauce\" bottle chain necklace.\n\n\"For the prospects, it's such an amazing experience,\" Anderson said about the NFL Draft. \"What we've seen over the last few years, it's such an opportunity for them to lean into fashion and it almost becomes an art form. Our team's job is really to lean into the unique and authentic personalities that prospective players want to tell, help them build their brands and ultimately amplify their interests across our social broadcasts and coverage as it pertains to the draft as a whole.\"\n\nAccording to Callura, the NFL's fashion content is some of its top performing. Last season, the average fashion post drove 43 percent more engagement and garnered 51 percent more videos views year-over-year. This has encouraged the NFL's social media team to expand its fashion coverage for the draft and for the upcoming football season.\n\nThis past football season was arguably the NFL's most fashionable, with players like Travis Kelce, Jeremiah Owusu-Koramoah, Stefon Diggs, Ray-Ray McCloud III, Darren Waller and others regularly going viral for their high-fashion looks.\n\nFor this year's NFL Draft, Anderson said it will be noteworthy given the number of quarterbacks that are predicted to be selected during the first round, some of whom will be on the red carpet.\n\nCallura also highlighted the number of legacy players that will be highly watched at the draft and on the red carpet, including Marvin Harrison Jr., son of Marvin Harrison, Luke McCaffrey, brother of Christian McCaffrey, and Brenden Rice, son of Jerry Rice, among others.", "source": {"uri": "uk.news.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo News UK"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Taking place in Detroit, the focus is on the 32 NFL teams, each with their seven selections for a total of 257 players who will find their new professional home.\n\nAs usual, the first round is the most important. This year, the Chicago Bears lead the first overall pick after a trade with the Carolina Panthers to claim the top spot. With a record of 7 wins and 10 losses last season, the Bears will be betting big on Caleb Williams, the talented USC quarterback who could become one of the most successful QBs of the decade. But, as is often the case, not all college players with brilliant records manage to translate their success to the professional level, making the pick a long shot for Chicago.\n\nMeanwhile, the Washington Commanders and New England Patriots, both with a 4-13 record last season, have picks two and three respectively. For the Patriots, a team accustomed to greatness during the Brady and Belichick era, this is a crucial opportunity to rebuild after a disappointing season. With their eyes set on the third overall pick, they are looking to revitalize their team and get back to competing among the league's elite.\n\nThe draft usually changes every few years as the league has grown and become more popular, with the league having to alter the rules to make the process fair for all teams.\n\nThe event is a roller coaster of emotions and surprises, where franchises are willing to risk everything for a chance at success. From the lowest-tier teams to the biggest winners, everyone is looking for the next star to take them to the big time. Here's what you need to know about the 2024 NFL Draft.\n\nAll rounds will be broadcast in ESPN and ABC, in addition to the NFL Network, and their respective online applications. ESPN Deportes will have the broadcast in Spanish.\n\nAll 32 teams may select one player in each of the seven rounds of the draft. The order of selection begins with the last-place side from the previous season and works its way up through the Super Bowl champions.\n\nThe first 20 spots are assigned to teams that did not qualify for the playoffs in ascending order based on their place at the end of the regular season. Those that did advance to the playoffs take the 21st through 32nd spots following the same ascending order based on their postseason record, with the Super Bowl champion Kansas City Chiefs in last place.\n\nIf there are teams with the same number of points, the place of their draft position is determined by the overall winning percentage of a team's opponents.

Fans from all over the country will be eagerly anticipating the announcement of who will be added to their team's roster.\n\nHere are the updated NFL Draft odds According to latest NFL Draft odds from BetMGM.\n\nSecond overall pick: Currently, Jayden Daniels (-1000) is the top pick to go 2nd overall in the NFL draft. However, J.J. McCarthy from Michigan is quickly rising in the latest odds at +1100.\n\nThird overall pick: Drake Maye, North Carolina's quarterback, is currently favored to go third overall in the 2024 NFL Draft with odds at -275. The New England Patriots hold the third pick, and oddsmakers predict a quarterback will be selected.\n\nFourth overall pick: Ohio State's wide receiver, Marvin Harrison Jr., is currently the favorite to be selected fourth overall in the upcoming NFL draft, with odds at -400. The Arizona Cardinals hold the fourth pick in the draft and have already committed to a long-term extension with quarterback Kyler Murray. Therefore, it is highly speculated that Marvin Harrison Jr. (-400) will be drafted by the Cardinals, joining forces with Murray in Arizona.\n\nFifth overall pick: It is unclear who the Los Angeles Chargers will pick with the fifth overall selection in the upcoming draft, as there are several options available to them. There is a logjam of talent as pertains to odds: J.C. Latham (+250), Marvin Harrison Jr. (+300), Joe Alt (+320), LSU wide receiver Malik Nabers (+350) and Michigan quarterback J.J. McCarthy (+350) are all getting favorable odds.\n\nWhoever is selected would join the Chargers under the leadership of new head coach Jim Harbaugh.\n\nWe occasionally recommend interesting products and services.

Of the top three QB picks in 1999, only Donovan McNabb had a successful NFL career. Trevor Lawrence, Zach Wilson, and Trey Lance went 1-2-3 in the 2021 NFL Draft. GIVEMESPORT VIDEO OF THE DAY SCROLL TO CONTINUE WITH CONTENT\n\nWhile it's a foregone conclusion that the Chicago Bears will take USC quarterback Caleb Williams with the top pick in the 2024 NFL Draft, there are still plenty of question marks heading into Thursday's big event. What quarterback will the Washington Commanders select at No. 2? Will the New England Patriots pick a QB as well or trade out of the third spot and stockpile more picks?\n\nThree QB-hungry teams are at the top of the draft order, and it's expected that Jayden Daniels and Drake Maye will join Williams as the top three players selected.\n\nIf this holds true, it will mark just the fourth time in the common draft era (since 1967) that quarterbacks went 1-2-3 in an NFL draft. Here's a look at the previous three.\n\nRelated Ranking the Top 5 QB Classes in NFL Draft History It's clear that the 1983 NFL Draft was the best when it came to quarterbacks, but which others had a top-notch quarterback class? 1 1971 The 1971 NFL Draft produced three QBs who went on to have healthy pro careers\n\nIf the 2024 draft is anything like 1971, it will turn out to be a strong quarterback class.\n\nWhile the Patriots didn't benefit much from selecting Stanford's Jim Plunkett with the No. 1 overall pick in 1971, the Oakland Raiders did years later. For five seasons, Plunkett did what he could for a woeful Patriots organization. He went 23-38 with the Pats, who traded him to the San Francisco 49ers before the 1976 season.\n\nAfter two seasons with the 49ers, Plunkett's career took off when he put on the silver and black. He finished his career with eight seasons with the Raiders, going 38-19 and winning a pair of Super Bowl titles, taking Super Bowl MVP honors in the first.\n\nAt No. 2, the New Orleans Saints selected Mississippi's Archie Manning, the father of future NFL quarterbacks Peyton and Eli Manning. Like Plunkett, the elder Manning played on some bad teams, but he still managed to put together Pro Bowl seasons in 1978 and 1979.\n\nWhile Manning proved he could play, he had very little to work with in New Orleans and went 35-91-3 over 11 seasons with the Saints. He never had a winning season in the NFL.\n\nWith the third pick, the Houston Oilers selected Dan Pastorini out of Santa Clara. Pastorini played nine seasons with the Oilers and enjoyed a Pro Bowl season in 1975. He went 10-4 that season and threw for 2,053 yards and 14 touchdowns. Pastorini ultimately went 53-54 during his Houston career.\n\nWhile the top three picks in '71 were all solid, the best QB in the draft came in the fourth round when the Miami Dolphins selected Notre Dame's Joe Theismann. Although he never played with Miami, Theismann went on to enjoy an outstanding career in Washington, where he won a Super Bowl following the 1982 campaign and was named NFL MVP in 1983.\n\n2 1999 Only one of the top three QBs taken in 1999 had a solid NFL career\n\nIf the Cleveland Browns had a do-over in 1999, Donovan McNabb would likely have been their starting quarterback for years. Instead, the Browns passed on the Syracuse quarterback and instead selected Kentucky's Tim Couch.\n\nWhile Couch can't be labeled a serious bust, he certainly was no McNabb. The Browns took Couch with the top pick in 1999, and things just didn't go as planned. As expected, he struggled as a rookie in the NFL, going 2-14. In his five professional seasons, Couch had only one winning season and also had just one 300-yard passing game in his career.\n\nCouch's career was plagued by injuries. He played just five games in 2000 after suffering a broken thumb during the season. He broke his leg at the end of his best season in 2002. That year, Couch went 8-6 as he threw for 2,842 yards and 18 touchdown passes.\n\nMeanwhile, McNabb, taken second overall, compiled six Pro Bowl seasons, including five straight from 2000 to 2004. In just his second NFL season, he finished second in the MVP voting after leading the Philadelphia Eagles to an 11-5 record.\n\nIn 2004, McNabb led Philly to a berth in Super Bowl 39 after racking up 3.875 passing yards and tossing a career-best 31 touchdown passes. The Eagles faced the New England Patriots, who escaped with a 24-21 victory. McNabb is the Eagles' all-time leader in passing yards (32,873) and touchdown passes (216).\n\nAt No. 3, the Cincinnati Bengals swung and missed badly with Akili Smith. Smith stuck around with the Bengals for four seasons but went 3-14 in 17 career starts. He finished his career with five touchdown passes and 13 interceptions.\n\n3 2021 Trevor Lawrence is the only success story of the top three picks in 2021 thus far\n\nWhile it's still early to judge the 2021 quarterback class, the top three picks include a hit, a miss, and a maybe.\n\nClemson's Trevor Lawrence was the clear-cut choice to be selected No. 1 overall in 2021, and he's helped turn around a struggling Jacksonville Jaguars franchise. Like many rookie quarterbacks thrown into the fire, Lawrence struggled in his first NFL season. He started all 17 games as a rookie and went 3-14. His 17 interceptions were the most in the league.\n\nLawrence cut down those picks in his second year, finishing with eight. He also threw 25 touchdown passes and went 9-8 in his 17 starts. In his first playoff game, Lawrence threw four first-half interceptions against the Los Angeles Chargers but rallied his team from a 27-0 deficit to pull out a 31-30 victory, marking one of the greatest comebacks in NFL history.\n\nIn 2023, Lawrence and the Jags got off to a hot start but dropped five of their last six games to miss the playoffs. Lawrence went 8-8 in 16 starts and threw for 4,016 yards and 21 touchdown passes.\n\nAt No. 2, the New York Jets selected BYU's Zach Wilson, whose NFL career has been much maligned. Wilson went 3-10 as a rookie starter, and his three years with the Jets were plagued by inconsistent play. Wilson is a dual threat under center but hasn't been able to prove he can be a consistent starter in the NFL.\n\nThe Jets traded Wilson to the Denver Broncos during the 2024 offseason, and he'll get a fresh start working under head coach and former quarterback Sean Payton.\n\nWith the third pick, the San Francisco 49ers traded up and selected Trey Lance out of North Dakota State. Lance played sparingly as a rookie, backing up Jimmy Garoppolo. He went 1-1 in two starts and was named the starter for the 2022 season.\n\nIn Week 2, Lance suffered a season-ending ankle injury and hasn't played since. The 49ers cut their losses with Lance and traded him to the Dallas Cowboys, where he was named their third-string quarterback and never saw any action.\n\nAll statistics courtesy of Pro Football Reference unless stated otherwise.\n\nRelated 15 best quarterbacks in NFL history, ranked Patrick Mahomes isn't yet the best quarterback in NFL history, but he's rapidly climbing the list.

Us too!\n\nThe time has come for Roger Goodell to get booed, football fanatics to get their quick fix until September and sports bettors to make some money.\n\nLet's focus now on 2024 NFL Draft odds and the best prop bet picks with an eye on cashing winning tickets.\n\nCheck out latest 2024 NFL Draft odds for the No. 1 pick at the best online sportsbooks:\n\nThis is the most highly anticipated betting market, but one you don't need to bet on with Caleb Williams at prohibitive odds.\n\nWhere to bet on NFL Draft: Latest sports betting promo codes and bonuses\n\nAt DraftKings, navigate to the \"Draft Pick Parlays\" tab and click on \"Top 4 Exact Order\" to find a pair of NFL prop bet picks to consider.\n\nWill history be made with four quarterbacks being selected in the first four picks? Nobody knows for certain, of course, but we're willing to fire on that possibility at these odds. It's worth a small toss accompanied by a larger wager on the next \"Top 4\" pick.\n\nThis is the more likely scenario. With the Cardinals slotted at No. 4, and presuming they don't trade the pick, Ohio State WR Marvin Harrison Jr. is a perfect fit to fill a deep need.\n\nArizona lost free agent wide receiver Hollywood Brown to the Chiefs, and there's not a single WR left on the roster that you'll likely recognize: Michael Wilson, Greg Dortch, Chris Moore, Zach Pascal, Jeff Smith, Daniel Arias, Andre Baccellia, Dan Chisena, Kaden Davis?\n\nLike former Arizona great Larry Fitzgerald, Harrison could help the Cardinals immediately out of college and for a long time to come. Love this bet!\n\nTop-rated sportsbooks offer myriad ways to bet on the NFL Draft. Check out other betting markets here from FanDuel including a player to be drafted in first round and first player drafted at a certain position.\n\nMcConkey, the diminutive wide receiver from Georgia, could make you sweat all the way to No. 32 when the Chiefs conclude the first round.\n\nKansas City's wide receivers dropped more balls than any other team in the NFL last season. The Chiefs still won the Super Bowl with continued magic from Patrick Mahomes.\n\nMcConkey's a reliable pass catcher with the ability to move the sticks. Kansas City went away from a deep-passing attack last year due in part to all the drops. This pick makes sense on a lot of levels.\n\nRemember when running backs used to really matter in professional football? The NFL's transformation from ground games to aerial-first attacks is all but complete. But Florida State's Benson could be a valuable first-year contributor at running back for many NFL teams.\n\nBenson's draft stock rose after he killed it at the combine with a 4.39-second time in the 40 and other key metrics. There's no clear-cut favorite in this betting market, but Texas RB Jonathon Brooks is -110 at FanDuel. Benson is the second choice at +170, and we'll take those odds.", "source": {"uri": "sportingnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sporting News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

With headquarters in Detroit, the focus is on the 32 NFL teams, each with its seven selections for a total of 257 players who will find their new professional home.\n\nAs usual, the first round is the most important. This year, the Chicago Bears lead the No. 1 overall pick after trading positions with the Carolina Panthers to claim the top spot. With a record of 7 wins and 10 losses in the previous season, the Bears will bet big on Caleb Williams, the talented quarterback from USC, who could become one of the most successful quarterbacks of the decade. But, as is often the case, not all college players with brilliant records manage to translate their success to the professional level, making the pick a risky bet for Chicago.\n\nMeanwhile, the Washington Commanders and New England Patriots, both with a 4-13 record last season, have picks two and three respectively. For the Patriots, a team accustomed to greatness during the Brady and Belichick era, this is a crucial opportunity to rebuild after a disappointing season. With their eyes set on the third overall pick, they seek to revitalize their team and compete again at the league's elite.\n\nThe draft typically changes every few years as the league has grown and become more popular, with the league having to alter the rules to make the process fair for all teams.\n\nThe event is a roller coaster of emotions and surprises, where franchises are willing to risk everything for a chance at success. From the lowest level teams to the most successful, everyone is looking for the next star that will lead them to victory. This is what you should know about the 2024 NFL draft.\n\nAll rounds will be broadcast in Spanish on ESPN Deportes. In English, it can be followed through ESPN and ABC, in addition to the NFL Network, and their respective online applications.\n\nThe 32 teams can select one player in each of the seven rounds of the draft. The selection order begins with the last-place team from the previous season and continues ascending to the Super Bowl champions.\n\nThe top 20 spots are assigned to teams that did not qualify for the playoffs in ascending order based on their place at the end of the regular season.

Dozens of colleges have cranked out the NFL Draft picks over the years, filling out the NFL ranks.\n\nBut which schools produce the most NFL Draft talent?\n\nThe fine folks at Pick Six Previews have tallied the total number of draft picks for each program since 2000 and the results might surprise you. Let's take a look.\n\nOhio State leads the way after cranking out the NFL Draft picks over the last 25 years. There have been numerous first-round picks like AJ Hawk, Malcolm Jenkins, Joey and Nick Bosa, Chase Young, Justin Fields and CJ Stroud. There have also been plenty of players who have played supporting roles.\n\nThis year's Buckeyes crop is no different. While Marvin Harrison Jr. will headline the group, there are plenty of other prospects likely to hear their names called this weekend. Enough to stretch Ohio State's lead? We shall see.\n\nNot far behind Ohio State is Alabama, which rode the wave of the Nick Saban era for almost two decades. Naturally, Saban cranked out dozens and dozens of picks, including many first-rounders like Julio Jones, Mark Ingram, CJ Mosley, Amari Cooper and Derrick Henry.\n\nThe Crimson Tide's next few NFL Draft picks -- which are likely to include Dallas Turner and Terrion Arnold, among others -- will still be credited to Saban, too. Then it's on to the Kalen DeBoer era to see what next-level success he can produce.\n\nHot on the heels of Alabama is Georgia, which has emerged as an equal in recent years in a competitive and brewing cross-division rivalry. The Bulldogs have long been an NFL factory, the likes of which has produced picks like Matthew Stafford, AJ Green, Alec Ogletree, Todd Gurley and Roquan Smith.\n\nThe Tigers have another deep draft class this year, headlined by 2023 Heisman Trophy winner Jayden Daniels. Two of his top weapons will also go early in the NFL Draft, with receivers Malik Nabers and Brian Thomas likely to draw potential first-round looks.\n\nDespite the majority of Florida's on-field success being highly concentrated in the mid-2000s, the Gators have managed to produce NFL Draft picks at a high rate. Among the most high-profile: Lito Sheppard, Max Starks, the Pouncey twins, Tim Tebow, Percy Harvin, Joe Haden, Carlos Dunlap, Dante Fowler and Trent Brown.\n\nFor the Gators, the goal will be to get back to that level of talent under current coach Billy Napier. Florida's a long way off, as evidenced by a relatively weak draft crop this year. The presumed headliner is receiver Ricky Pearsall, a potential Day 2 pick.\n\nThe Hurricanes might not have been able to recapture the magic from the early 2000s just yet, but that hasn't stopped them from cranking out pro-caliber talent. Some of Miami's picks in the last two decades plus include Jeremy Shockey, Ed Reed, Andre Johnson, Vince Wilfork, Calais Campbell and David Njoku.\n\nCurrent coach Mario Cristobal has done a nice job recruiting and continues to up the talent level in Coral Gables. Miami doesn't have a deep draft class this year, but players like Leonard Taylor III and Kamren Kinchens should have a shot to hear their names called.\n\nLike Florida, most of USC's high-level success was concentrated in the early to mid-2000s, when the likes of Matt Leinart and Reggie Bush were working their way toward elite status. But other picks like Clay Matthews, Tyron Smith, Robert Woods, Leonard Williams and JuJu Smith-Schuster have carried on the tradition.\n\nUSC is another program with a fairly new head coach looking to really spark a turnaround to former heights. Caleb Williams is likely to be the No. 1 overall pick this year, while running back MarShawn Lloyd and receiver Brenden Rice are others likely to earn a selection.\n\nOklahoma has been a touch more consistent than programs like Florida and USC over the last two decades, though the NFL Draft talent lags a bit. Highlighting the selections in that span were Adrian Peterson, Phil Loadholt, Gerald McCoy, Sam Bradford, Lane Johnson, Orlando Brown, Kyler Murray and CeeDee Lamb.\n\nWith Brent Venables now in charge, don't be surprised if you see a slightly defensive shift in terms of the players emerging as NFL Draft picks. This is a particularly weak draft class for the Sooners, though, with tackle Tyler Guyton the only probable high-profile selection.\n\nFlorida State's success has been well spread through the last two decades, including a national title run. Naturally, a lot of the prominent picks are from that era: Jameis Winston, Kelvin Benjamin, Eddie Goldman, Jalen Ramsey, Dalvin Cook.\n\nNew coach Mike Norvell is quickly building back toward those heights, fresh off a 13-0 regular season and ACC title game win using a combination of transfer portal players and homegrown recruits. Jordan Travis and Jared Verse headline this year's crop, but it's possible the Seminoles see double-digit prospects drafted this year.\n\nTied with Florida State is Michigan, which is only just now coming back into power after an absence from the national stage. The Wolverines, though, stay producing picks like Braylon Edwards, LaMarr Woodley, Jake Long, Taylor Lewan, Jabrill Peppers and Aidan Hutchinson.\n\nComing off a national title, it'll be interesting to see how well new coach Sherrone Moore can sustain the current talent level. As evidenced by this year's draft, Michigan is loaded with talent: JJ McCarthy, Roman Wilson, Zak Zinter, Blake Corum and more than a dozen others who could be picked this weekend.\n\n11. Notre Dame - 105\n\n12. Penn State - 102\n\n13. Clemson - 97\n\n14. Wisconsin - 96\n\n15. Tennessee - 93\n\n16. Virginia Tech - 86\n\nT-18. Auburn - 85\n\nT-18. Iowa - 85\n\nPlenty of programs are hovering right around the 100 mark in the last decade, which translates to about 4.5 picks per draft cycle. The programs are all fairly prominent, and most have enjoyed a high level of success on the field as a result of their talent level. Who will be the next to make a major surge?

Not always: High-end physical talent doesn't always translate to production.\n\n* Good things sometimes take time: Playing quarterback in the NFL is tough. Not every quarterback can hit the ground running, and even the top-billed passers can struggle early.\n\n* Draft and trade for yourself: Try PFF's Mock Draft Simulator -- trade picks and players and mock for your favorite NFL team.\n\nIt's too early to make sweeping conclusions about the 2023 NFL Draft. Rookies entering the league and contributing at a high level are rarer than many might think. It will be another year or two before many players in last year's draft class truly find their footing in the NFL.\n\nHowever, it isn't too early to attempt to learn from what transpired over the past year or two. Here are some of my bigger takeaways from recent drafts as we get closer to the start of the 2024 NFL Draft.\n\nIt's easy to become enamored with the measurables used to quantify a player's physical ability. There's so often an advantage to being the fastest or strongest player on the field -- look no further than the transcendent speed of Tyreek Hill or the earth-shattering strength of Myles Garrett. Both are smart and nuanced players in their own right, but their physical traits make them the players they are. NFL teams see how much that sort of specimen, with so much raw physical talent, can change a franchise.\n\nBut tapping into that rawness and expunging that potential is no easy feat, and sometimes it's all too easy to look at the NFL combine numbers and create a narrative from them.\n\nThe 2022 No. 1 overall pick, Travon Walker, put up historically good numbers at the combine. His RAS score of 9.98 rightly paints him as an otherworldly athlete, but he was also seen as a project compared to prospects such as Aidan Hutchinson and Kayvon Thibodeaux. While they've matured and grown into effective edge rushers, Walker has stagnated. He earned just a 53.9 grade and recorded 59 pressures in 2023, whereas Hutchinson posted a 91.0 grade and 121 pressures.\n\nThe physical freaks will always have their place in the game. But even the 2023 NFL Draft, with Will Anderson Jr. being drafted over freaky athlete Tyree Wilson, showed that the NFL quickly reminded itself that nuance and skill set are just as important as the testing numbers.\n\nAnderson finished his rookie season with an 81.6 grade, the best among rookie edge rushers. Wilson finished at 47.1.\n\nRookie quarterbacks are often tasked with changing the fate of an entire franchise. From the word go, they are expected to perform well, often to their detriment.\n\nLike every other position, the quarterback position has a real adjustment period in the NFL. Defenses are faster and stronger at the NFL level, and quarterbacks generally have less time to decipher and problem-solve. Not every quarterback can hit the ground running, and few actually do in Year 1.\n\nTrevor Lawrence was viewed as a generational prospect, mentioned in the same ilk as quarterback prospects like Andrew Luck, Peyton Manning and John Elway. When he got to the NFL, he immediately found himself in one of the worst environments in recent history and posted a 59.6 grade in his rookie season, completing less than 60% of his passes and throwing a league-leading 17 interceptions.\n\nHowever, Lawrence has since started to find his feet. He posted a 78.6 PFF grade in 2022 and a 79.7 grade in 2023, throwing 51 touchdowns in the process.\n\nBryce Young entered the 2023 season as the No. 1 overall pick and the best quarterback in the class. He struggled mightily in his rookie season, earning a 52.6 passing grade, 40th among 45 qualified quarterbacks. Young was tarred with the bust brush like Lawrence before him, but it's too early to write him off.\n\nDon't expect quarterbacks to hit the ground running, especially if they're set to land in an unfavorable situation.\n\nThe 2023 NFL season was a timely reminder of how difficult it is to play on the offensive line, especially as a rookie. The physical demands of the offensive line and playing against grown 300-pound men are challenging enough, but the growing athletic abilities of defensive linemen are making the job of protecting the quarterback and opening up holes in the running game even more difficult.\n\nThose predicted struggles reflected onto the field, too, as the 2023 offensive line class struggled to make an impact. Early production at tackle, guard or center isn't the expectation, even for first-round picks.\n\nOnly nine of the 25 qualifying rookie linemen finished with a grade of 60.0 or higher in 2023. The quality shone through as Paris Johnson Jr., Darnell Wright, Peter Skoronski, and Broderick Jones -- all first-round picks -- finished with grades higher than 60.0.\n\nIn recent seasons, the production from rookie pass-catchers across the league has increased. Ja'Marr Chase, Jaylen Waddle and Garrett Wilson were all big contributors in their rookie seasons, but in 2023, the class exploded.\n\nNine pass-catchers from the 2023 NFL class finished with 70.0-plus receiving grades, with Puka Nacua, Rashee Rice and Sam LaPorta all standing out. Beyond them, the likes of Tank Dell, Jordan Addison and Zay Flowers were exceptionally important contributors to their teams.", "source": {"uri": "pff.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "PFF"}, "authors": [{"uri": "thomas_valentine@pff.com", "name": "Thomas Valentine", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rookie", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rookie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Quarterback"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myles_Garrett", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Myles Garrett"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyreek_Hill", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tyreek Hill"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pro_Football_Focus", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pro Football Focus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draft_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Draft (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Track_and_field", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Track and field"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Will_Anderson_Jr.", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Will Anderson Jr."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travon_Walker", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Travon Walker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aidan_Hutchinson", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Aidan Hutchinson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kayvon_Thibodeaux", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kayvon Thibodeaux"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lineman_(gridiron_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lineman (gridiron football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NFL_Scouting_Combine", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NFL Scouting Combine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Skoronski", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Peter Skoronski"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broderick_Jones", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Broderick Jones"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris_Johnson_Jr.", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Paris Johnson Jr."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puka_Nacua", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Puka Nacua"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darnell_Wright", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Darnell Wright"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bryce_Young", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bryce Young"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ja'Marr_Chase", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ja'Marr Chase"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guard_(gridiron_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Guard (gridiron football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaylen_Waddle", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jaylen Waddle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rice_Owls_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rice Owls football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tackle_(gridiron_football_position)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tackle (gridiron football position)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garrett_Wilson", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Garrett Wilson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Elway", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "John Elway"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Luck", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Andrew Luck"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peyton_Manning", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Peyton Manning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interception", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Interception"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Touchdown", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Touchdown"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Ten-Pin", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Ten-Pin", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Candlepin", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Candlepin", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://media.pff.com/2024/03/McCarthy-JJ-2-Alamy-scaled.jpg?w=1200&h=675", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9509328", "eventUri": "eng-9509328", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1294117647058823, "wgt": 112, "relevance": 1}

It's one of a number of examples-like the scouting combine and the annual schedule release-of the world's richest sports league manufacturing big commercial opportunities outside of its regular season and playoffs. Hundreds of thousands of fans are expected in Detroit this week for the event, with teams selling new sponsorships to their own draft day activities.\n\nMore from Sportico.com\n\nUSC quarterback Caleb Williams is expected to be the first pick, chosen by the Chicago Bears. While it's unclear exactly what Williams will make on his rookie contract, it will be considerably less than what top picks were making two decades ago. When Sam Bradford was taken No. 1 in 2010, he signed a $78 million deal with $50 million guaranteed. Last year, top pick Bryce Young signed a $38 million deal with about $24.6 million guaranteed. The hosts talk about why that's changed.\n\nThey also discuss a few ways in which NIL opportunities have changed the way NFL prospects view the jump from college to the pros. Williams was making millions, above board, at USC. He'll make more in the NFL of course, but the financial calculus for the biggest NCAA stars has certainly shifted the way they approach the draft. Sports lawyer Darren Heitner said on Twitter Wednesday that he'd heard more NFL prospects were choosing not to attend the draft, largely because they're now accustomed to being paid for appearances. Williams, who does not have an agent, reportedly has broached the topic of getting equity in the team that drafts him, something that is not allowed by the NFL.\n\nThe hosts close by talking more about New York Rangers rookie Matt Rempe. The 6-foot-7 forward, popular for his physical play, has the second highest selling jersey among all first-year NHL players (trailing only Connor Bedard).

Mock draft and big board season is now behind us, and soon we will find out where the top talents in college football will be heading to start their professional careers.\n\nThis year, there is no shortage of Cardinals that are in the draft pool. 13 players from the Louisville football program have either graduated or declared early in hopes of hearing their name called on draft night.\n\nOut of that group, four players have separated themselves from the others. Running backs Jarwhar Jordan and Isaac Guerendo, wide receiver Jamari Thrash and cornerback Jarvis Brownlee Jr. are the former Cards who have the highest chance of getting selected.\n\nRelated: Mock Draft Roundup: Where Louisville's Top Prospects are Projected to Land\n\nBrownlee is the slight favorite to be the first of the four taken off the board. While hit-or-miss at times, his aggressive, physical and competitive nature is something that NFL scouts are very intrigued by, not to mention that the 6-foot-0, 190-pound corner had a good showing at Louisville's Pro Day. He has snuck into the back part of day two (rounds 2-3) in some mocks, but has routinely fallen squarely in the 4-5 round range.\n\nRelated: Jarvis Brownlee Jr. 2024 NFL Draft Profile\n\nHowever, don't be surprised if it's Thrash who is the one who gets picked up first. The 6-foot-1, 185-pound receiver's savviness and route running ability is what scouts and draft pundits are most attracted to, but they are wary of his frame and overall physicality. Like Brownlee, he could go as high as late day two, but will most likely be an early day three pickup. Some have even tabbed him as a sixth round selection.\n\nRelated: Jamari Thrash 2024 NFL Draft Profile\n\nAs for Guerendo, he's been the near-consensus pick to be the third former Cardinal drafted. While the 6-foot-1, 225-pound running back is older and has a relative lack of production as a career backup, his phenomenal performance at the NFL Combine almost guaranteed he will be drafted. Mocks have routinely tabbed him in rounds 5-6, dipping as low as the final round seven in some.\n\nRelated: Isaac Guerendo 2024 NFL Draft Profile\n\nWhat about Jordan? Unfortunately, there's no guarantee that the 5-foot-10, 185-pound running back will get selected at all. Most scouts question his NFL future due to both his frame/durability concerns and - like Guerendo - his age. Some mocks have Jordan as a seventh round pick, while most have him completely undrafted.\n\nRelated: Jawhar Jordan 2024 NFL Draft Profile\n\nOutside of those four, there are a few other Cardinals that have been generating some pre-draft buzz. Center Bryan Hudson has appeared in a couple mocks as a late day three selection, as has cornerback Storm Duck.\n\nEven if Hudson or Duck are not drafted, expect them - as well as quarterback Jack Plummer - to be among the more sought after priority free agents. They will have the opportunity to sign with any team they choose as an undrafted free agent, or UDFA, following the end of the draft if they go unselected.\n\nOther former Cardinals hoping to be drafted or sign as a UDFA are: quarterback Brock Domann, tight end Joey Gatewood, offensive tackles Eric Miller and Willie Tyler IV, linebacker Gilbert Frierson and safety Cam'Ron Kelly.\n\nThe 2024 NFL Draft will begin with round one on Thursday, Apr. 25 at 8:00 p.m. EST. Rounds 2-3 will start on Friday, Apr. 26 at 7:00 p.m. EST, and rounds 4-7 on Saturday, Apr. 27 starting at 12:00 p.m. EST. The entire draft will be televised on ABC, ESPN and the NFL Network.\n\n(Photo of Jamari Thrash: Trevor Ruszkowski - USA TODAY Sports)", "source": {"uri": "si.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sports Illustrated"}, "authors": [{"uri": "matthew_mcgavic@si.com", "name": "Matthew McGavic", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draft_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Draft (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scout_(sport)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Scout (sport)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louisville_Cardinals_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Louisville Cardinals football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arizona_Cardinals", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Arizona Cardinals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/College_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "College football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wide_receiver", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wide receiver"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cornerback", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cornerback"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louisville,_Kentucky", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Louisville, Kentucky"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Louisville, Kentucky"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NFL_Scouting_Combine", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NFL Scouting Combine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanford_Cardinal", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Stanford Cardinal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_agent", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Free agent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NFL_Network", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NFL Network"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linebacker", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Linebacker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Broadcasting_Company", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "American Broadcasting Company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Quarterback"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "ESPN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USA_Today", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "USA Today"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tackle_(football_move)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tackle (football move)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Ten-Pin", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Ten-Pin", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Candlepin", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Candlepin", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_crop,w_4564,h_2567,x_0,y_68/images/ImagnImages/mmsport/si-temp/01hw8maybzssvm0q66pw", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9509328", "eventUri": "eng-9509328", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Louisville, Kentucky"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-04-25", "textStart": 3362, "textEnd": 3369}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-04-26", "textStart": 3421, "textEnd": 3428}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-04-27", "textStart": 3475, "textEnd": 3482}], "sentiment": 0.05098039215686279, "wgt": 110, "relevance": 1}

record last season, would normally have picked first, however the Chicago Bears will have first dibs this time around having acquired the pick from the Panthers as part of the deal which saw the franchise move up in 2023 to take Bryce Young.\n\nThe regular season is set to begin on September 5 and will last until January 5.\n\nThe play-offs will then get underway from January 11, with the

Other quarterbacks likely to be chosen early are Michigan's J.J. McCarthy, UNC's Drake Maye, LSU's Jayden Daniels, and Washington's Michael Penix Jr.\n\nIf you're looking to watch the NFL draft live this year, read on. Below is a full guide on how to livestream the 2024 NFL draft -- even if you don't have cable -- plus an easy way to get a free NFL draft livestream (legally).\n\nThe 2024 NFL draft is being broadcast on live TV through ESPN, ABC, and NFL Network, and it's being streamed on ESPN+ and NFL+. In addition to those streaming services, cord-cutters can also watch the draft online using any live TV streaming service that carries ESPN, ABC, or NFL Network. Here are our top suggestions, including pricing and free trial information:\n\nDirecTV Stream's five-day free trial is one easy way to watch the NFL draft for free. The live TV streaming service carries ESPN and ABC in its Entertainment package (the most affordable plan) and you can add NFL Network by upgrading to the Choice package. If you want to keep service after the five-day free trial, the Entertainment plan costs $79.99 a month. See DirecTV Stream deals here.\n\nESPN+ is a more affordable option for watching the 2024 NFL draft online, although it doesn't offer a free trial. The service costs $10.99 a month, or $109.99 a year if you pay annually. You can also get ESPN+ through the Disney Bundle, which costs $14.99 a month and also includes Disney+ and Hulu (on-demand).\n\nAnother budget-friendly option for watching the 2024 NFL draft is NFL+ (this option also doesn't have a free trial, however). NFL+ costs just $6.99 a month, or $14.99 a month if you want access to NFL Redzone as well.\n\nAnother live TV streaming service that you can use to watch the 2024 NFL draft is Hulu + Live TV. This one also starts with a free trial (three days) before payment kicks in at $76.99 a month. The service carries ESPN, ABC, and NFL Network in its 95+ channel lineup, but you also get complimentary access to ESPN+, Disney+, and Hulu (on-demand).\n\nIf you want to watch the NFL Draft for free, use a free trial from either DirecTV Stream or Hulu + Live TV. DirecTV Stream's trial lasts for five days, and Hulu + Live TV's lasts for three, which means either one will be enough to stream the whole NFL draft for free. Just set a reminder to cancel before the trial is over to avoid being charged.\n\nThe 2024 NFL draft kicks off Thursday, April 25, with round 1. Rounds 2-7 happen on Friday and Saturday. Here's the full schedule:\n\nThe Chicago Bears get the first pick this year, followed by the Commanders and the Patriots to round out the top three.

Then, Minges Brook initially received a $1,000 NFL Play 60 grant as the Detroit Lions local recipient in the competition. As the grant prize winner, the school also receive an additional $1,000 to use toward physical activity equipment.\n\nOn Thursday, Day and Minges Brook found out they won the award for a second time for the 2024 season, getting the $1,000 NFL Play 60 grant as the Detroit Lions local recipient in the competition as several of the school's students met in the gym to hear their name called by Lions mascot Roary for earning the honor.\n\n\"We were very surprised we won it two years in a row,\" Day said. \"It's a big accomplishment. Our parents are very active at our school and they were very involved in helping our students log all of their minutes for the NFL Play 60. It was a community effort, for sure.\"\n\nDuring the competition, classrooms and afterschool programs were able to track physical activity minutes as a group through the NFL PLAY 60 app. Students also had the ability to track their minutes at home. Those minutes of activity rolled up to a leaderboard, allowing participants to see rankings compared to other groups participating on behalf of their hometown NFL team.\n\nJason Kane of the American Heart Association was on hand Thursday, pointing out that Day has a very important job in announcing her NFL pick because you never know who it might be.\n\n\"It's amazing this is the second year in a row they are winning this,\" Kane said. \"The fact so many schools participate and they have won it two years in a row, it's impressive. It just shows the great work Jessica is doing. I work with schools in Kalamazoo, Battle Creek, all the way to the lakeshore, and she does as good a job as anyone in getting the kids engaged.\n\n\"And, because she won this last year, she gets to be part of the draft this year with it being in Detroit. That's a once-in-a-lifetime thing. It's pretty cool. Coincidently, one of the other times the American Heart Association had someone pick for them, the name they had to announce was for the Bills when they selected Damar Hamlin - and that came full circle,\" Kane explained, as Hamlin famously made headlines when he went into cardiac arrest during a game in 2023.\n\nSince finding out about her involvement in the NFL Draft, Day has had a lot of thoughts when asked about standing on the stage in front of a big crowd in Detroit and a national TV audience.\n\n\"My friend has a nephew (Nate Lynn of William and Mary) who might get drafted about the time I'm supposed to do it. It would be awesome if he was the pick. I was thinking, no matter what the card said, maybe I'll say Nate Lynn anyway... but not really,\" Day said with a laugh. \"I'm really good at talking in front of kids, but not so good talking in front of adults. I just know I'm going to really nervous.\"\n\nContact Bill Broderick at bbroderi@battlecreekenquirer.com.

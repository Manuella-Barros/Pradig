Just when we think we've seen the best LEGO has to offer in terms of innovation, nostalgia, and sheer delight, the company outdoes itself yet again. LEGO's latest marvel? A brand new entry into its LEGO Super Mario range for adults, its fifth addition to the collection, to be exact. This time, LEGO brings fan-favorite Yoshi into the fold with an homage to his earliest appearance in Nintendo's classic video game Super Mario World. And yes, we'll see LEGO Yoshi carry Mario into glorious adventures. The LEGO Super Mario World: Mario & Yoshi set brings together nostalgic visuals, truly innovative animation effects, and a gorgeous aesthetic we can't get enough of.\n\nJoin us as we exclusively reveal this build, and let's take a deep dive into the new Super Mario World: Mario & Yoshi LEGO set.\n\nSpeechless? So are we. Honestly, this first-look image of LEGO's new Super Mario World-inspired Mario & Yoshi set has us swooning. But a picture is not worth a thousand words in this case. To understand just how cool this LEGO build requires a deeper understanding of all its excellent design elements. We'll get into that in our next section. First, though, we have a few more first-look images of this fifth set from LEGO's Super Mario range for adults.\n\nWe even got to be among the first to see Super Mario World: Mario & Yoshi in person at SDCC 2024. But more on that below.\n\nThe universal truth of LEGO sets is that no matter how beautiful they are, there's always more excitement hidden between their bricks. LEGO's Super Mario World: Mario & Yoshi 2D build is absolutely no different. Although its first-look images alone have us craving the set, the coolest parts of it lie in its clever design.\n\nFirst, Super Mario fans will recognize how this Mario & Yoshi LEGO set's pixelated aesthetic nostalgically mirrors visuals from Super Mario's earliest games. Super Mario World first released in 1990. Gaming graphics looked a little different back then. We're obsessed with the way LEGO has manipulated its bricks in order to harken back to the game's original style. Of course, Super Mario World was also a 2D game. And so LEGO has taken it upon itself to make this 3D build look 2D for the occasion. Mamma mia! We love it.\n\nSecond, this Super Mario World: Mario & Yoshi LEGO set comes with a set of practical animations. Yes, once you build Mario and Yoshi out of LEGO bricks, you'll be able to see Yoshi run with Caped Mario riding on his back. Additionally, Yoshi's tongue can pop in and out, just like it does in Super Mario World. LEGO shares that this Mario & Yoshi set is built in multiple layers, allowing for its practical animations to function.\n\nCarl Merriam, a Senior Designer on LEGO Super Mario, explains: \"In this model, we wanted to capture the original sprite animation from Super Mario World. This meant re-creating the pixel art in LEGO bricks and then adding a mechanism to make Yoshi run with Caped Mario riding on his back. AND if that wasn't enough fun, we also added a dial to make Yoshi's tongue pop in and out - just like in the game!\"\n\nBut when will this new LEGO\u00ae Super Mario\u2122 Super Mario World\u2122: Mario & Yoshi set release? This Super Mario World LEGO set will be available from October 1st, 2024. It will be sold via LEGO stores, LEGO.com and from select leading retailers around the world. If you simply must add it to your collection, you can pre-order the set today on LEGO.com.\n\nThe LEGO Super Mario World: Mario & Yoshi set will cost $129.99. For more information, you can check out www.LEGO.com/supermario as well as www.LEGO.com/mario_yoshi.\n\nThe more technically-minded among us may enjoy these more specific details about the LEGO Super Mario World: Mario & Yoshi set:\n\nOf additional note, this is the first time fans will see Mario's trusted companion, Yoshi, in 2D LEGO brick form. Furthermore, this Super Mario World-inspired LEGO set is a part of LEGO's 'Adults Welcome' series. This range is designed to bring fond memories to all LEGO fans who remember Super Mario as an essential part of their childhood. The Mighty Bowser and Piranha Plant from the LEGO Super Mario line are also part of this series.\n\nLEGO's announcement of this new Mario & Yoshi LEGO set coincides with the first day of San Diego Comic-Con 2024. Fans attending the convention will become some of the first to see this new Super Mario build if they visit LEGO's booth (#2829). LEGO will display Super Mario World: Mario & Yoshi starting on Thursday, July 25.\n\nLEGO will have a truly inspired space-themed presence at the convention. But the message of LEGO's SDCC booth extends beyond literal space travel. Instead, LEGO brings with it an overall spirit of discovery and exploration. Anyone who visits LEGO's booth (#2829) will be able to journey into orbit, but can also visit many other faraway worlds, including that of Super Mario. And if pictures of this new Mario & Yoshi set are anything to judge by, seeing this build in person will be a true treat.", "source": {"uri": "nerdist.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Nerdist"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lego_Super_Mario", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lego Super Mario"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yoshi_(video_game)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Yoshi (video game)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Mario", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Super Mario"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Mario_World", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Super Mario World"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yoshi", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Yoshi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lego", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lego"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Animation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2D_computer_graphics", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "2D computer graphics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nostalgia", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nostalgia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nintendo", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nintendo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_game", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Video game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Diego_Comic-Con", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "San Diego Comic-Con"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3D_computer_graphics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "3D computer graphics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pixel", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pixel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piranha_Plant", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Piranha Plant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bowser", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bowser"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pixel_art", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pixel art"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pre-order", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pre-order"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sprite_(computer_graphics)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sprite (computer graphics)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mario", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mario"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Virtual_Reality/Multi-User_Systems", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Virtual Reality/Multi-User Systems", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Interactive", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Interactive", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Toys_and_Games/Varied_Merchandise", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Toys and Games/Varied Merchandise", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 59}], "image": "https://legendary-digital-network-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/21165058/new-LEGO-super-mario-world-mario-and-yoshi-set.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9762521", "eventUri": "eng-9762521", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-25", "textStart": 4531, "textEnd": 4538}], "sentiment": 0.5529411764705883, "wgt": 226, "relevance": 1}

As revealed by Jay's Brick Blog, the LEGO Super Mario World: Mario & Yoshi set is apparently scheduled for release on October 1st. The 1215-piece set features a pixel version of a caped Mario riding Yoshi. The set also has a little crank, which allows Yoshi to stick its tongue out! As of this writing, LEGO has not officially revealed this set, so we don't have a price for it, but hopefully an announcement will happen sometime soon.\n\nImages of the set can be found at Jay's Brick Blog right here. An image of that same pose from Super Mario World can be found below.\n\nSuper Mario World launched alongside the Super Nintendo Entertainment System in 1991, and greatly expanded on several of the concepts from the NES era. The game also introduced several elements that remain part of the Mario canon to this day, including new power-ups and characters. Most notably, the game marked the first appearance of the Yoshis, making this set quite fitting. LEGO has been making sets based on the Mario franchise for several years now, but the vast majority are focused on more recent games in the series, like New Super Mario Bros. U and Super Mario 3D World. Those sets tend to be aimed at LEGO fans of all-ages, but this Super Mario World: Mario & Yoshi set seems to be targeting older collectors.\n\nThis isn't the only upcoming Nintendo set aimed at the older crowd. Back in May, LEGO announced a set based on the Zelda franchise. The set has a special 2-in-1 design that allows builders to replicate the Great Deku Tree's appearance in either The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time, or Breath of the Wild. It also includes four minifigures in total: Young Link and Adult Link from OoT, and Link and Zelda from BotW. That set will be released on September 1st, and has a price of $299.99. With the Zelda set coming just one month before the Super Mario World: Mario & Yoshi set, it's looking like Nintendo fans are going to have a fun (but pricey) few months ahead!\n\nAre you excited for this LEGO set?

The listing, now removed, included a number of images and an October 1, 2024 release date.\n\nThe 1,215-piece set includes a 16-bit caped Mario who rides Yoshi, and what looks like a hand crank that makes Yoshi stick out his tongue. Western pricing is yet to be revealed, but local pricing suggests an approximate $160 cost in the U.S.\n\nAn official reveal looks likely at San Diego Comic-Con, which kicks off today, July 25. Attendees have already spotted what looks like a tease for the set at the show.\n\nLEGO and Nintendo have a long-standing relationship that's seen a number of sets released in recent years, kicking off with the LEGO Super Mario Adventures with Mario Starter Course in 2020. LEGO has also unveiled a few more Mario sets, including The Bowser Express Train set, the King Boo's Haunted Mansion set, and Battle with Roy at Peach's Castle set.

The announcement comes on the first day of San Diego Comic-Con 2024, and it's the fifth set to be added to the LEGO Super Mario range for Adults.\n\nLEGO Says that: \"This is the first-time fans will see Mario's trusted companion, Yoshi in 2D LEGO brick form. The LEGO Super Mario Super Mario World: Mario & Yoshi (71438) set pays homage to Nintendo's classic video game, Super Mario World and is built in multiple layers to enable eye-catching animation effects. The nostalgic visuals from the earlier generation of the Super Mario games are also reflected in the new set, featuring pixelated Mario and Yoshi figures.\"\n\nCarl Merriam, a Senior Designer said: \"In this model, we wanted to capture the original sprite animation from Super Mario World. This meant re-creating the pixel art in LEGO bricks and then adding a mechanism to make Yoshi run with Caped Mario riding on his back. AND if that wasn't enough fun, we also added a dial to make Yoshi's tongue pop in and out - just like in the game!\"\n\nLEGO says that: \"When builders are done building, this set also stands as a beautiful display piece. The model, amongst others such as The Mighty Bowser and Piranha Plant from the LEGO Super Mario line is also part of the 'Adults Welcome' series. This range is designed to bring fond memories to all LEGO fans who remember Super Mario as an essential part of their childhood.\"\n\nThe new set is for ages 18+ and will cost \u00a3114.99 (or \u20ac129.99). It has 1215 pieces, and size wise is \"over 15.5 in. (40 cm) high, 10 in. (26 cm) wide and 4 in.

Western pricing is yet to be revealed, but local pricing suggests an approximate $160 cost in the U.S.\n\nAn official reveal looks likely at San Diego Comic-Con, which kicks off today, July 25. Attendees have already spotted what looks like a tease for the set at the show.\n\nLEGO and Nintendo have a long-standing relationship that's seen a number of sets released in recent years, kicking off with the LEGO Super Mario Adventures with Mario Starter Course in 2020.

The upcoming LEGO set includes 1214 pieces, with a crank feature allowing Yoshi to move his legs and fire his tongue. Nintendo and LEGO collaboration continues to thrive, with a rumored display at San Diego Comic-Con 2024 and an expected October release date.\n\nSuper Mario World fans who still hold a soft spot in their heart for the beloved Super Nintendo Entertainment System platformer are in luck because a new leak confirms an upcoming LEGO set is paying homage to the platformer. Released back in 1990, Super Mario World is widely regarded as being one of the best games on the SNES and helped to elevate the already iconic Super Mario Bros. franchise even higher. Aside from its excellent level of design and memorable soundtrack, it's also remembered as Yoshi's first appearance, making it an even more important entry in the series.\n\nPer NintendoLife, a recent leak prompted \"The Brick Shop,\" a certified LEGO store in Singapore, to release images of the \"Super Mario World: Mario & Yoshi\" set. The product, which consists of 1214 pieces, depicts Mario with his yellow cape riding atop Yohsi with the bricks replicating the artwork of the SNES classic. Further illustrations suggest that the crank on the right side of the base can be turned to have Yoshi open his mouth and fire his tongue while moving his legs, although the length of the mechanism is currently unknown.\n\nRelated\n\nSuper Mario World's Cape Makes The Game Too Easy (But Is Still Fun)\n\nSuper Mario World is a beloved title from the SNES era, but its cape and flight mechanics (while fun) make the game pretty easy overall.\n\nLEGO And Nintendo Continue To Dominate\n\nA Match Made In Heaven\n\nClose\n\nWhile LEGO has yet to officially reveal the existence of the Super Mario World set, further rumors claim that the build will be on display at San Diego Comic-Con 2024 which, if true, suggests an imminent announcement. Based on the leak, the set will be available to pre-order and is expected to ship on October 1, retailing for a price of S$209.90, which equates to roughly $156.36 USD at the time of writing. The set's webpage on The Brick Shop is no longer active so eager fans will just have to wait for the formal announcement.\n\nNintendo and LEGO have spent many years collaborating with one another to great success. Beginning their partnership in 2020, the companies have released dozens of sets based on Super Mario Bros., including a full-scale replica of the original Nintendo Entertainment System that shipped with a buildable mini television depicting the original game. Since then, several other Nintendo franchises have received the LEGO treatment, including Animal Crossing and, most recently, The Legend of Zelda.\n\nThe bulk of LEGO's Super Mario Bros. line consists of smaller diorama-style builds that allow users to construct their own level based on the games, so it's nice to see a set more geared towards adults with a nostalgia for Super Mario World. It may not be as interactive as some other sets, but it should make for a fun decoration or shelf piece for those who want to show off their fandom. It's also not a gigantic build, so it's unlikely to require hours of concentration to fully construct.\n\nSource: NintendoLife\n\nSuper Mario World\n\nFranchise Super Mario\n\nPlatform(s) SNES , Game Boy Advance\n\nReleased August 23, 1991\n\nDeveloper(s) Nintendo EAD\n\nPublisher(s) Nintendo\n\nGenre(s) Platformer\n\nExpand", "source": {"uri": "screenrant.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ScreenRant"}, "authors": [{"uri": "brad_lang@screenrant.com", "name": "Brad Lang", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Mario_World", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Super Mario World"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yoshi", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Yoshi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lego", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lego"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Nintendo_Entertainment_System", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Super Nintendo Entertainment System"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platform_game", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Platform game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yoshi_(video_game)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Yoshi (video game)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nintendo", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Nintendo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steam_(service)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Steam (service)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Diego_Comic-Con", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "San Diego Comic-Con"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Mario_Bros.", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Super Mario Bros."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friends", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Friends"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamer_Network", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gamer Network"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_mechanics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Game mechanics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soundtrack", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Soundtrack"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singapore", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Singapore"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Singapore"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Mario", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Super Mario"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nintendo_Entertainment_Analysis_&_Development", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nintendo Entertainment Analysis & Development"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal_Crossing", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Animal Crossing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_Boy_Advance", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Game Boy Advance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fandom", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fandom"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nintendo_Entertainment_System", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nintendo Entertainment System"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Legend_of_Zelda", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Legend of Zelda"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_dollar", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States dollar"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Toys_and_Games/Games", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Toys and Games/Games", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Collecting/Toys", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Collecting/Toys", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Console_Platforms", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Console Platforms", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Platform", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Platform", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Toys_and_Games/Construction", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Toys and Games/Construction", "wgt": 30}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 52}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 47}], "image": "https://static1.srcdn.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/untitled-design-2024-07-25t122818-755.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9762521", "eventUri": "eng-9762521", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-10-01", "textStart": 2186, "textEnd": 2195}, {"amb": false, "date": "1991-08-23", "textStart": 3518, "textEnd": 3533}], "sentiment": 0.388235294117647, "wgt": 216, "relevance": 1}

This is a diorama-style LEGO set that evokes the 2D, 16-bit look of older Super Mario games. It features Mario riding Yoshi, his green dinosaur pal, and it appears that movement will be possible due to a hand crank on the piece.\n\nThe pictures show Mario and Yoshi in a few different positions, one of which includes Mario hitting Yoshi in the head so that his tongue pops out, his signature long-ranged attack in the games.\n\nThe set clocks in at 1,215 pieces and costs $209.99 SGD. That's about \u00a3121.37, but prices may be different globally and haven't been announced yet. The set releases on October 1, 2024.\n\nUnder a tweet sharing news of the Super Mario LEGO set, fans have been very excited. \"They didn't have to give the Lego super Mario world sprite layers the amount of detail for this is insane!\" wrote one user.\n\nOne person shared a meme of a very dehydrated Spongebob Squarepants saying, \"I need it\", and another person simply tweeted in all caps, \"NEED\". Sentiment is similar for a lot of people, all expressing their desire to own this set.\n\nThere are also some people hoping the set isn't too expensive, as LEGO often sells for a lofty price. \"I hate how over priced Lego tend to be. 90 dollars is probably the most I wound spend on something like that,\" wrote one person.", "source": {"uri": "nme.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NME Music News, Reviews, Videos, Galleries, Tickets and Blogs | NME.COM"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Mario", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Super Mario"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lego", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lego"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yoshi", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Yoshi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/16-bit_computing", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "16-bit computing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yoshi_(video_game)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Yoshi (video game)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Mario_World", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Super Mario World"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2D_computer_graphics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "2D computer graphics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singapore", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Singapore"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Singapore"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dinosaur", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dinosaur"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clock", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Clock"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpongeBob_SquarePants", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "SpongeBob SquarePants"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sprite_(computer_graphics)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sprite (computer graphics)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_caps", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "All caps"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_meme", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Internet meme"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Collecting", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Collecting", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Collecting/Toys", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Collecting/Toys", "wgt": 25}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Platform", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Platform", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Theme_Parks/Legoland", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Theme Parks/Legoland", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Toys_and_Games/Construction", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Toys and Games/Construction", "wgt": 37}], "image": "https://www.nme.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/NSwitch_PaperMarioTheThousandYearDoor_06.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9762521", "eventUri": "eng-9762521", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3254901960784313, "wgt": 214, "relevance": 1}

It's built in multiple layers with a turn-handle system that replicates the game's running animation effects.\n\nAt $129.99 (\u20ac129.99 / \u00a3114.99), it's the second-cheapest of the five display sets, and has 1,215 pieces. That's around 10 cents a piece, but with mostly larger bricks, it's not bad value. Once it's built, it stands at 15.5in (40cm) high, 10in (26cm) wide, and 4in (11cm) deep.\n\nAs display pieces go, this isn't just the best-looking Super Mario set it's released over its four-year run-it's probably the best gaming LEGO in recent memory. I've got the Lego NES and Pac-Man cabinet sets still sitting in their boxes, and the likes of Horizon Forbidden West's Tallneck set is a stunner, but this is a day-one purchase for me, and it's getting opened and built the minute it lands on my dining room table.\n\nCarl Merriam, a senior designer on LEGO's Super Mario range, said: \"In this model, we wanted to capture the original sprite animation from Super Mario World.\n\n\"This meant re-creating the pixel art in LEGO bricks and then adding a mechanism to make Yoshi run with Caped Mario riding on his back. And if that wasn't enough fun, we also added a dial to make Yoshi's tongue pop in and out-just like in the game!\"\n\nLEGO Super Mario World: Mario & Yoshi (71438) is available for preorder today via LEGO.com and will be released on October 4. Like its predecessors in the same line-up, it's not a website and store exclusive-you can pick it up from selected retailers worldwide, meaning there might be a deal or two for patient bargain hunters.\n\nHopefully it'll also inspire some more gaming pixel-art sets in the future.

Whether you're a casual fan of gaming or a committed Nintendo enthusiast, odds are you've got a favorite Super Mario platformer. From way back with Super Mario Bros. all the way up to Super Mario Wonder, there's so much to enjoy along the way. For those who hold a special place in your hearts for Super Mario World, today's your lucky day, as an incredible new Lego set featuring Mario and Yoshi has just been made available for pre-order!\n\nThis set breaks the mold of what one would typically expect from a Lego set; rather than being a diorama depicting a full scene, this set is simply the classic sprites of Mario riding atop Yoshi. There's more than just that however, as by rotating a lever the duo will begin running in place reminiscent of how they would in the original game. Yoshi can even extend his tongue! If you're remotely interested in Lego or Super Mario, you might want to pick up this set for a wonderful display piece.\n\nThe listed price is fairly hefty at $129.99, which is fairly typical for larger Lego sets. The release is planned for October 1st, 2024, with pre-orders being available right now. As one might expect, the construction is fairly advanced, with a total of 1,215 pieces and an age of 18+ recommended to build it.

back seat with the Super Mario World LEGO adult set.\n\nThis new set has been leaked by Singaporean LEGO Certified Store The Brick Shop which listed the product on their website early before taking it

an interactive element.\n\nUsing the crank essentially makes the fully built sprite appear to be walking, and even opens Yoshi's mouth for that trademark tongue to pop out.\n\nAs for the price, it'll reportedly cost $209.00 Singaporean dollars, roughly coming out at $155 USD, so if you want some nostalgia in LEGO form, it is on the pricey end.\n\nHowever, this shouldn't shock you too much since most of the other Nintendo collaborations of this caliber are around a similar price point, or even more expensive.\n\nRegardless of the price though, one thing is for sure, it's going to sell out almost instantaneously.\n\nAccording to that now-deleted listing the release date for the set is October 1, 2024 but we'll wait for the official reveal before putting all our eggs in that basket just in case.\n\nWe expect the official announcement for the Super Mario World LEGO set to be imminent since it's technically a trusted retailer that accidentally posted the listing early, but we'll aim to

Growing up with this game is surreal to think about with the modern day systems on the market and the obvious advancements in gaming, but this set is a fun throwback to the 16-bit phenomenon and the wild, wacky world our pipe-venturing duo.\n\nStacking up to 1,215 pieces, the LEGO 71438 Super Mario World Mario & Yoshi set is a wonderful ode to bygone days at the same time that it is a great display-worthy build to add to your shelves. It features a 16-bit version of the titular character of the franchise riding sweet, dependable Yoshi. It also looks like there is some movement action built into the design, with a hand crank that triggers Yoshi to both run in place and stick out his tongue.\n\nThere is not much else we know or can gather from other sources, but as pointed out by Jay's Brick Blog, it looks like it is currently slated for an October 1, 2024 release with no pricing yet given - though in Singapore it looks to be listed for approximately $209.99 shipped. We will have more information and images to share once they become available.\n\nSource: Jay's Brick Blog", "source": {"uri": "9to5toys.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "9to5Toys"}, "authors": [{"uri": "reinette_lejeune@9to5toys.com", "name": "Reinette LeJeune", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lego", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lego"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Mario_World", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Super Mario World"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yoshi_(video_game)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Yoshi (video game)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lego_Star_Wars", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lego Star Wars"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourth_generation_of_video_game_consoles", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fourth generation of video game consoles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Nintendo_Entertainment_System", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Super Nintendo Entertainment System"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singapore", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Singapore"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Singapore"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Title_character", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Title character"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yoshi", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Yoshi"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Action", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Action", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Adventure", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Adventure", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Interactive", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Interactive", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 48}], "image": "https://i0.wp.com/9to5toys.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2024/07/LEGO-71438-Super-Mario-World-Mario-and-Yoshi-set.jpg?resize=1200%2C628&ssl=1", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9762521", "eventUri": "eng-9762521", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.5450980392156863, "wgt": 199, "relevance": 1}

That typically means it's intended more for display than for play. And that's absolutely the case with this Mario & Yoshi set. It's made to be set on a shelf or a desk and shown off to whoever comes by.\n\nTo that end, it's basically a one-sided display piece. The front of it re-creates, pixel by pixel, the sprite of Mario riding Yoshi in the 1990 SNES Super Mario World. Turning a crank makes Yoshi appear to run in place, complete with moving legs and his body rising and lowering with Mario on his back, just like the animation from the game. You can also make Yoshi's mouth open and tongue pop out.\n\nThat's the front of the set. Turning it around and looking at the rear of the set is like peeking behind the scenes at Disney World: you can see how it all works. The back of the set lays bare all the cranks, wheels, joints, arms, and levers that make the front side's movement work. It's a pretty genius design that re-creates the effect of the Super Nintendo sprite animation. I adore it.\n\nAdditionally, if you have a LEGO Super Mario, Luigi, or Peach Starter Set, you can tap their figures on an Action Tag included in this new set for \"an interactive experience.\" I wouldn't expect too much from this based on a similar feature in the LEGO Super Mario 64 Question Block, but I imagine it's a fun little Easter egg if you happen to have one of those figures.\n\nFor more, check out our picks for the best LEGO Nintendo sets.\n\nChris Reed is a commerce editor and deals expert for IGN.

As is generally the case in these situations, LEGO decided to rush the set out the door shortly thereafter. So, surprise! Nintendo fans have a 1215-piece set inspired by the beloved 1991 game to look forward to. In fact, it's available to pre-order now right here at the LEGO shop priced at $129.99 with an October 1st release date.\n\nThe set features pixelated Mario and Yoshi figures with fun interactive elements that are reminiscent of the Piranha Plant set. These elements include a handle at the base that will make Yoshi run with Mario on his back, a dial behind Yoshi's head that will make his tongue pop in and out, and an Action Tag that works with the Mario, Luigi, and Peach figures from LEGO Super Mario Starter Sets. Note that all of these Starter Sets are currently 30% off via the following links:\n\nSuper Mario Adventures with Mario Starter Course Set - See at LEGO Super Mario Adventures with Peach Starter Course Set - See at LEGO Super Mario Adventures with Luigi Starter Course Set - See at LEGO\n\nAnother Nintendo-themed LEGO set that leaked early and promptly went up for pre-order in recent months is The Legend of Zelda Great Deku Tree (77092). It's currently available here at the LEGO shop for $299.99 with a release date set that's just around the corner on September 1st. The 2500-piece set includes minifigures of Young Link and Adult Link from Ocarina of Time, and Link and Zelda from Breath of the Wild. The 2-in-1 set can also be reconfigured to display the Great Deku Tree as it appeared in these games.\n\nYou can find all of the upcoming LEGO releases here in the \"Coming Soon\" section. After the launch, they will shift here in the \"Available Now\" section. Some of the new releases will be available here on Amazon, but in most cases you'll want to stick with LEGO to take advantage of their monthly launch promotions. With August 2024 expected to have a larger slate of LEGO releases, there should be some pretty great bonuses available.

The series has always been popular and experienced genuine heights, with massive sales figures and quality reviews from industry veterans. Audiences have come to love this absurd band of characters, and it's no surprise that The Super Mario Bros. Movie was a major hit at the box office, after years of fans interacting with this ensemble through beloved gaming experiences. Measuring the impact that an entry into the Mario saga has had is certainly difficult because there are so many different factors to consider. The reviews at the time, the nostalgia fans had for the piece, the way it broke new territory, and the position it currently holds in Nintendo's empire are all important elements to discuss.\n\nHowever, analyzing these titles from the modern world is to completely shift that lens. Reactions today are very different from the reception titles would have received at their initial launch. Looking back on those retro games, fans will often debate whether they have aged well and still hold up against the cavalcade of other successful Nintendo titles. There's an argument to be made that Nintendo's ambition to always be improving has ensured that most of its games from previous eras won't be able to compare. However, there are plenty of Mario games that, in truth, changed everything for the Nintendo Company and were so ahead of their time that they are still just as enjoyable today. There's one particular Mario title that stands out among the bunch, has a phenomenal legacy attached, and is still exhilarating to pick up and play.\n\nThe Mario Franchise Is So Varied\n\nFrom Mario Kart To Mario Party, Nintendo Has Encouraged Innovation\n\nClose\n\nThere are over 200 games in the Mario franchise.\n\nRelated\n\nHow To Beat Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door's Pit of 100 Trials\n\nPaper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door contains the Pit of 100 Trials -- a dungeon of constant fights that only the strongest plumbers can conquer.\n\nLooking over Nintendo's catalog of Mario titles, newcomers to the franchise would be forgiven for not knowing where to start. There's a huge ensemble of incredible releases in every era, each of which managed to bring something new to the table. Just look at how many copycat games have been created in the wake of Mario Kart's release, a run that has only improved in each new installment. The Super Mario Bros. main line of platform projects is incredibly impressive, with some immense standouts. And from WarioWare to Mario and Sonic at the Olympic Games, there are plenty of bizarre spinoffs, crossovers, and original concepts that have proven to be just as popular.\n\nIndeed, the theme here is longevity. Irrespective of how Mario's world is utilized in a game, these releases remain relevant and are revisited in new incarnations with almost every new generation of console. What's more, fans are always looking for ways to play those older releases, suggesting that many of them hold up superbly. Few other companies have managed to master the art of longevity quite like the Japanese video game producer, and for that, Nintendo should be congratulated.\n\nChoosing which title has aged the best is thus a challenge unto itself. Within that debate, there are significant areas to consider. Have the graphics held up? Do the gameplay mechanics feel clunky? Is the narrative clear? Are the characters still relevant? A title not only has to have smooth controls and a fun visual palette, but it also needs to carry significance. The first Mario Kart, for example, was a novel idea with a great premise but was difficult to fully interact with due to less accurate steering mechanics.\n\nSuper Smash Bros. Brawl was a great entry into that Nintendo crossover series but lacked the excitement and sheer quality of Super Smash Bros. Ultimate, which has significantly blown its predecessor out of the water. But, there is a historically important game that doesn't have the flaws of its brethren. Considering how old this game really is, it's absolutely incredible that players around the world still search for the hit and enjoy it just as generations have in the past.\n\nThe Very First Game Is Surprisingly Still One Of The best\n\nDonkey Kong Is A Stalwart Of The Franchise\n\nClose\n\nDonkey Kong first released in 1981.\n\nRelated\n\nWhat's the Best Platformer Franchise That's Not Super Mario?\n\nSuper Mario is probably the most iconic video game platformer franchise. But after that, Crash Bandicoot is definitely close to the top. The games are fun, challenging, and for a time, Crash felt like a video game mascot that could truly rival Mario.\n\nBefore Mario Kart and Super Mario Bros., before Mario was even known by his famous name, before Luigi existed, there was Donkey Kong. The very first Donkey Kong title was a massive success at the time of its release. The arcade platformer has a lot going for it and was both simple and utterly effective in its execution. The game featured a character called Jump Man, Mario by another name, who had to climb to the top of an obstacle course to save the damsel in distress, Pauline. In his way is the antagonistic Donkey Kong, who has no problem throwing barrels at his enemy to halt his progress.\n\nIn just that small description, which essentially sums up the entire plot and mechanics of Donkey Kong, there are numerous elements that have carried over into successor titles. All the characters are still featured in the Mario franchise, with Donkey Kong and Jump Man in particular leading their own lines. What's more, the basic nature of the controls means that the title is accessible; anyone can play it irrespective of their experience level. Intuitive and surprisingly reactive, these gameplay components are just as comfortable in the hands of current gamers as they were in the hands of players at the time of release.\n\nVisually, the title is very much of its era, but boasts that retro aesthetic that some indie games now try to emulate. That arcade style is still a beloved form of the medium, and fans are all too happy to fully embrace the throwback nature of Donkey Kong's look. Character designs that match later iterations, an easy-to-understand point system, and imaginative sound design all combine for a truly nostalgic experience. Donkey Kong is a game that can be played by anyone in any period and that is the true definition of longevity.\n\nThe difficulty level is just right too, and with ingenious platform designs that continue to test players, this is a title that somehow works for all ages. It's only logical that the addictive gameplay has enchanted so many, becoming a global phenomenon that transcends language and borders. What's fascinating, though, is that it's not just the nuts and bolts of the title that ensures it still holds up today. Its place in the industry is another fragment of this puzzle to consider, and that isn't just relevant for spinoff material like the movies and animated shows. Donkey Kong is actually significant for video game history as a whole.\n\nDonkey Kong Put The Groundwork In Place For An Industry Revolution\n\nThe Bar Was Set For Platform Titles\n\nClose\n\nNintendo developed the title alongside Ikegami Tsushinki Co., Ltd.\n\nRelated\n\nWhere Should Paper Mario Go From Here?\n\nAfter The Thousand-Year Door's glowing review, how can Nintendo improve upon the classic RPG gameplay that fans consider perfect?\n\nDonkey Kong has aged well because it's an idea. An idea of what arcade games could look like. The very first genuine platform title in the whole industry was Donkey Kong. It was a breath of fresh air and a trendsetter in every sense. Without Donkey Kong, there wouldn't be Super Mario Bros. Without Donkey Kong, none of those successive, popular platform titles would have ever been made. The fact is, this was a completely novel concept, with a unique set of mechanics, that created a new genre and with it, immortalized itself.\n\nDonkey Kong isn't just fun to play today, but it still protects those core ideals of what Nintendo wanted to produce. For a game that was so revolutionary and so outside of the box, it's incredible that it still holds up. The first incarnation of an idea isn't always the best, as trial and error and the benefit of time will improve it. However, Donkey Kong, as the first platform game to be released, somehow stuck the landing. The industry has evolved to include other styles of platform play, but this Mario-universe project represents the genre in its most fundamental form.\n\nSo, the likes of Mario Kart, Super Mario Bros., and even Mario Party will be praised as some of the greatest entries to the Mario franchise, but without that first Donkey Kong game, the brand itself, and a whole genre, wouldn't have been created. Nintendo owes a lot of thanks to that first outing and has continued to honor it in re-releases, remakes, and new ways to access the title on modern consoles. Any Mario fan has to go back to Donkey Kong and relive the retro experience. They may just be surprised at how irrelevant its year of release really is. It might not have the world-building or character arcs of other Mario titles, but it truly captured the essence of what this series could be and backed up that potential with quality decision-making at every level of development.\n\nSuper Mario Bros.\n\nSuper Mario is a platform game series created by Nintendo starring their mascot, Mario. It is the central series of the greater Mario franchise. At least one Super Mario game has been released for every major Nintendo video game console.\n\nCreated by Shigeru Miyamoto\n\nCharacter(s) Mario , Luigi\n\nVideo Game(s) Super Mario Bros. , Mario Kart , Paper Mario , Mario Party , Super Mario Run , Mario Golf", "source": {"uri": "cbr.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CBR"}, "authors": [{"uri": "george_chrysostomou@cbr.com", "name": "George Chrysostomou", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donkey_Kong_(arcade_game)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donkey Kong (arcade game)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mario_(franchise)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mario (franchise)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mario_Kart", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mario Kart"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_mechanics", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Game mechanics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Mario_Bros.", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Super Mario Bros."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platform_game", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Platform game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nintendo", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nintendo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paper_Mario:_The_Thousand-Year_Door", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Super_Mario_Bros._Movie", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Super Mario Bros.

Do you like LEGO sets that recreate some of your favorite series or franchises? If so, you're not alone, and LEGO knows it. They've made their name off of stacking their beloved bricks in all sorts of ways over the years, including remaking things from iconic shows, films, comics, and video games. You might recall that they've been diving into Nintendo's universe a bit recently, including getting ready to release a special version of The Great Deku Tree. However, they've had some fun with Mario in the past, and now, Super Mario World is apparently getting the tap for a LEGO set!\n\nAs revealed by Nintendo Life, an official LEGO store in Singapore accidentally leaked a set from Super Mario World that features Mario riding on Yoshi. The store has since taken down the listing, but the pictures that were posted are now forever on the internet, and we should be grateful for that. The set looks nice, and it recreates an iconic visual that fans will love. After all, it was that SNES game that first introduced Yoshi to us, and being able to ride that dinosaur through levels was incredibly helpful in beating the game.\n\nAccording to the listing, it will be released on October 1st, contain over 1,200 pieces, and cost just over $200. So, if you think you'll enjoy this, you'll want to start setting aside money for it now!\n\nOh, but if you're at San Diego Comic Con this weekend, then you're in for a treat! The set is apparently going to be at the show, as LEGO has its own both at SDCC! Thus, if you're in the neighborhood, go and check it out for yourself and see if it's something that's worth the price!\n\nNintendo has been pushing hard recently to get more exposure for its IPs. It might seem like a \"basic move,\" but doing some LEGO sets is the right idea in various ways. First, it invokes nostalgia in those who grew up with Mario and might have kids of their own now. Second, it speaks to the younger generation who might want to have this kind of set in their home. Finally, if they sell well, they have entire worlds full of content that they can use to do various sets in.\n\nThe sky is the limit if Nintendo and LEGO decide to go full force into a partnership.

With a variety of badges, players can experiment with different builds for Mario, from attack-heavy to defensive tank. Despite changes in the remake, Danger Mario can still deal massive damage but requires more skill and resources to set up.\n\nPaper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door has a build that can make Mario absurdly powerful, but the remake tweaked a few details. There were a fair amount of changes and new features in Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door's recent Switch remake, which should be no surprise. However, the fact that the developers seem to have addressed one of the deadliest builds in the game was unexpected. Players can still recreate it though, and the raw numbers behind it are still present. They should just know that it's not exactly the same as in the Gamecube classic's original release.\n\nThe plethora of badges in Paper Mario: TTYD gives players access to a wide variety of builds for Mario. They can make jump-only builds or hammer-only builds thanks to the Jumpman and Hammerman badges. They can use badges to raise Mario's defense and play him like a tank of sorts. With the variety of various attack badges on display, players can even mix and match to give Mario a wide arsenal of attacks. It will probably take some time for each player to find their preferred build for Mario. Thankfully, badges can be removed and have their BP refunded at will, giving players plenty of opportunities to experiment.\n\nRelated\n\nNintendo's Next Paper Mario Remake Shouldn't Be the Obvious One\n\nNintendo may want to remake another Paper Mario after The Thousand-Year Door's high acclaim, but perhaps not the most obvious choice.\n\nPaper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door's Danger Mario Build Saw Some Changes in the Remake\n\nClose\n\nDanger Mario Can Quickly Clear TTYD's Toughest Challenges\n\nWhile unavailable until the later chapters of Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door, the Danger Mario build is easily its most destructive. It required lowering Mario's maximum HP to 5, permanently placing him in Danger status, and equipping several copies of Power Rush, which increases his Attack by 2 when in Danger. Combined with Power Bounce, which lets Mario jump on an enemy until the player misses an action command, Mario can deal absurd amounts of damage every turn. Players who are proficient with Power Bounce's timing can even take out some of the game's toughest bosses in one turn with Danger Mario.\n\nMultibounce also works well in a Danger Mario build to clear entire groups of enemies in one turn.\n\nThe Thousand-Year Door's Remake Offers Extra Obstacles to Danger Mario\n\nDespite its power, Danger Mario received a surprising nerf with Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door's new features. First, the timing for Power Bounce has changed, and the fourth jump has to be frame-perfect to continue the attack, making it much harder to score high combos. Second, the prices for Power Rush in both the Pianta Parlor and the Lovely Howz of Badges have increased. The Lovely Howz display price rose from 50 coins to 80 coins, and the Pianta price skyrocketed from 34 to 100. As a result, the Danger Mario build in the remake is harder to build up and execute.\n\nDanger Mario Still Works Despite the Remake's Changes\n\nEven though the remake made it harder to use, Danger Mario is still a powerful build through Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door's first update. Admittedly, it does take much longer to build up due to the increased prices of Power Rush, and the harder timing for Power Bounce is a definite factor. However, a good Danger Mario build can still deal upwards of 100 damage in a single turn with only four Power Bounce hits, enough to take down all but the game's absolute toughest bosses right out of the gate. Even in the remake, Danger Mario can completely trivialize the game's battles.\n\nPaper Mario: The Thousand Year Door made Danger Mario harder to use, but didn't completely drain its power. While the prospect of beating Bonetail in Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door in one turn with Danger Mario may now only be possible for the most skilled of players, the build still packs a lot of power. While it's unclear if the changes were specifically made to dilute Danger Mario's potential, they certainly affected the build. Even so, checking out Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door's Danger Mario build should still be fruitful.\n\nPaper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door (2024)\n\nA modern version of the classic 2004 RPG, Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door for the Nintendo Switch features upgraded graphics along with other changes intended to make the game as accessible as possible.\n\nFranchise Paper Mario\n\nSystem Nintendo\n\nPlatform(s) Switch\n\nReleased May 23, 2024\n\nDeveloper(s) Nintendo\n\nPublisher(s) Nintendo\n\nGenre(s) RPG\n\nESRB E For Everyone Due To Mild Fantasy Violence, Mild Suggestive Themes\n\nHow Long To Beat 30 Hours\n\nExpand\n\nSee at Nintendo See at Amazon", "source": {"uri": "gamerant.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Game Rant"}, "authors": [{"uri": "devin_friend@gamerant.com", "name": "Devin Friend", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paper_Mario:_The_Thousand-Year_Door", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paper_Mario", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Paper Mario"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_game_remake", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Video game remake"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nintendo_Switch", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Nintendo Switch"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jumpman_(video_game)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jumpman (video game)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GameCube", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "GameCube"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nintendo", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nintendo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mario", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mario"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_(game_terminology)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Health (game terminology)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boss_(video_games)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Boss (video games)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entertainment_Software_Rating_Board", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Entertainment Software Rating Board"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_(company)", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Amazon (company)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Role-playing_video_game", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Role-playing video game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platform_game", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Platform game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fantasy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fantasy"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Materials/Pulp_and_Paper", "label": "dmoz/Business/Materials/Pulp and Paper", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Construction_and_Maintenance/Building_Types", "label": "dmoz/Business/Construction and Maintenance/Building Types", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Platform", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Platform", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Models/Paper", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Models/Paper", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Build_Management", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Build Management", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 79}], "image": "https://static0.gamerantimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2024/07/paper-mario-thousand-year-door-angry-mario-1.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9762521", "eventUri": "eng-9762521", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1058823529411765, "wgt": 173, "relevance": 1}

At first, the 1,215-piece set just looks like a caped Mario sitting on top of Yoshi. But a look at the back reveals more complex mechanics, including a hand crank that makes Yoshi's feet and arms move and a dial that opens his mouth and extends his tongue.\n\nFurther Reading\n\nMost of the Mario sets have included some kind of interactive moving part, even if it's as simple as the movable mouth on the Lego Piranha Plant. Yoshi's mechanical crank most strongly resembles the NES set, though, which included a CRT-style TV set with a crank that made the contents of the screen scroll so that Mario could \"walk.\"\n\nThe Mario & Yoshi set is available to preorder from Lego's online store for $129.99. It begins shipping on October 1.\n\nLego has also branched out into other video game-themed sets. In 2022, the company began selling a replica Atari 2600, complete with faux-wood paneling. More recently, Lego has collaborated with Epic Games on several Fortnite-themed sets, including the Battle Bus.\n\nListing image by The Lego Group", "source": {"uri": "arstechnica.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Ars Technica"}, "authors": [{"uri": "andrew_cunningham@arstechnica.com", "name": "Andrew Cunningham", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yoshi", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Yoshi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lego", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Lego"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Mario_World", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Super Mario World"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nintendo_Entertainment_System", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nintendo Entertainment System"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nintendo", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nintendo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mario", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mario"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourth_generation_of_video_game_consoles", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fourth generation of video game consoles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_mechanics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Game mechanics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Nintendo_Entertainment_System", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Super Nintendo Entertainment System"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piranha_Plant", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Piranha Plant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yoshi_(video_game)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Yoshi (video game)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Lego_Group", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Lego Group"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epic_Games", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Epic Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrolling", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Scrolling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atari_2600", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Atari 2600"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Television_set", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Television set"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Toys_and_Games/Games", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Toys and Games/Games", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Adventure", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Adventure", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Coin-Op/Arcade_Games", "label": "dmoz/Games/Coin-Op/Arcade Games", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Fan_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Fan Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 72}], "image": "https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/mario-world-lego-2-760x380.jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9762521", "eventUri": "eng-9762521", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-10-01", "textStart": 1126, "textEnd": 1135}], "sentiment": 0.2313725490196079, "wgt": 171, "relevance": 1}

Not only does it look exactly like the game, but it animates like it too, with a crank on the back so you can make Yoshi's arms and legs move. There's also a dial to make Yoshi's tongue shoot out.\n\nDespite the obvious potential, Lego has never really leaned into pixel art designs for its various video game sets, with anything other than Minecraft, but this one looks fantastic and nostalgia overload for fans of the game.\n\nLego has been working with Nintendo for years now, starting with the Super Mario line of interactive toys aimed primarily at children, which use Bluetooth minifigures to trigger sounds and images when placed over special tiles.\n\nThe only other one based on a specific game is the ? Block which opens up into a diorama recreating levels from Super Mario 64.\n\nThat suggests Lego might get around to other games in the future, which would be neat. Especially as the interactive sets haven't drawn much from Super Mario Galaxy or Odyssey.\n\nAs ever, Lego isn't cheap and the Super Mario World: Mario & Yoshi (71438) set is priced at \u00a3114.99. It's much bigger than you'd first assume though, at 40cm by 26cm, and is made up of 1,215 Lego pieces.\n\nRelatively speaking, that makes it pretty good value. It won't be released until October 1, although pre-orders are available now on the Lego website.\n\nThe new set was announced at San Diego Comic-Con, alongside a model of Shadow The Hedgehog's head. It's also out on October 1, at a price of \u00a359.99.\n\nSonic The Hedgehog also has his own line of Lego sets but so far most of them have been playsets, not dissimilar to the Mario ones, and a few Funko Pop style BrickHeadz models.\n\nShadow is the only character who's had his head immortalised in Lego but then he's a big part of the upcoming Sonic The Hedgehog 3 movie and Sonic X Shadow Generations game. If the set is popular we'd imagine a Sonic equivalent will appear sooner or later.\n\nEmail gamecentral@metro.co.uk, leave a comment below, follow us on Twitter, and sign-up to our newsletter.\n\nTo submit Inbox letters and Reader's Features more easily, without the need to send an email, just use our Submit Stuff page here.\n\nFor more stories like this, check our Gaming page.\n\nMORE : Metallica brings battle stage to Fortnite as band get Lego makeover", "source": {"uri": "metro.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Metro"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Mario_World", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Super Mario World"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yoshi", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Yoshi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lego", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lego"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nintendo", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Nintendo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_game", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Video game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shadow_the_Hedgehog", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Shadow the Hedgehog"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Nintendo_Entertainment_System", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Super Nintendo Entertainment System"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sprite_(computer_graphics)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sprite (computer graphics)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yoshi_(video_game)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Yoshi (video game)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Mario", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Super Mario"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fortnite", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fortnite"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diorama", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Diorama"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pixel_art", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pixel art"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lego_minifigure", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lego minifigure"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Mario_64", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Super Mario 64"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Mario_Galaxy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Super Mario Galaxy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nostalgia", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nostalgia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Toy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minecraft", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Minecraft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bluetooth", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bluetooth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Diego_Comic-Con", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "San Diego Comic-Con"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Funko", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Funko"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metallica", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Metallica"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games", "label": "dmoz/Games", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Adventure", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Adventure", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Fan_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Fan Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Party_Games/Holidays_and_Celebration", "label": "dmoz/Games/Party Games/Holidays and Celebration", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 64}], "image": "https://metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/SEI_214097677-af0f.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&crop=0px%2C176px%2C2500px%2C1313px&resize=1200%2C630", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9762521", "eventUri": "eng-9762521", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-10-01", "textStart": 1687, "textEnd": 1696, "freq": 2}], "sentiment": 0.4039215686274509, "wgt": 166, "relevance": 1}

This is all operated by a handle at the back, giving your decor something of a party trick. Not many of the best Lego sets can do that.\n\nYou can get the full lowdown on the Lego Super Mario World set below, but it'll hit shelves this October 1 and is available to pre-order now at the official Lego store. That means it'll be launching on the same day as the new actual Lego Fortnite sets (including the most unsettling kit I've ever seen).\n\nUnlike so much of the Lego Super Mario range, this is a for-adults kit primarily designed to look cool on your shelf rather than being a 'playset' in the traditional sense. Well, sort of - as per the Lego NES, turning the handle will bring it all to life. To be precise, Yoshi's legs and arms will move as if he's running along the model's pixellated base. His tongue also pops out on command, just like it did in the SNES game.\n\nMario himself doesn't seem to move, but look into his eyes.

See our ethics statement.\n\nLego has announced its latest collaboration with Nintendo at San Diego Comic-Con: a pixelated recreation of Mario and Yoshi from the 16-bit Super Nintendo classic, Super Mario World. Like Lego's Art sets, it's a 2D creation meant for display but also includes hidden moving mechanisms, bringing Yoshi to life.\n\nThe 1,215-piece set stands over 15 inches tall when assembled and features a yellow-caped Mario riding Yoshi atop a grass-covered hill. The front of the set is assembled from Lego tiles and looks to be a very accurate recreation of the 16-bit sprites used in Super Mario World.\n\nBut when you turn the set around, it becomes very obvious why Lego is positioning this as a display piece. Lego's designers incorporated a pair of mechanisms to recreate the game's sprite animations. Turning a crank attached to the base makes Yoshi's legs run in an endless loop, while a knob on the back opens the dinosaur's mouth and makes his bright red tongue pop in and out.\n\nThe Lego Super Mario World: Mario & Yoshi set is officially available for preorder starting today through Lego's online store for $129.99 and will ship starting on October 1st. It will be the fifth adult-focused set released as part of Lego and Nintendo's ongoing collaboration, joining the 2,646-piece NES console, 2,807-piece Mighty Bowser, 540-piece Piranha Plant, and 2,064-piece transforming question mark block.", "source": {"uri": "theverge.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Verge"}, "authors": [{"uri": "andrew_liszewski@theverge.com", "name": "Andrew Liszewski", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yoshi", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Yoshi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lego", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lego"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/16-bit_computing", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "16-bit computing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Mario_World", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Super Mario World"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lego_Art", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lego Art"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Diego_Comic-Con", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "San Diego Comic-Con"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vox_Media", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Vox Media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2D_computer_graphics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "2D computer graphics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Nintendo_Entertainment_System", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Super Nintendo Entertainment System"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sprite_(computer_graphics)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sprite (computer graphics)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nintendo", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nintendo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tile-based_video_game", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tile-based video game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piranha_Plant", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Piranha Plant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bowser", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bowser"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lego_Super_Mario", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lego Super Mario"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yoshi_(video_game)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Yoshi (video game)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nintendo_Entertainment_System", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nintendo Entertainment System"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Animation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_game_console", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Video game console"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Toys_and_Games", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Toys and Games", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Adventure", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Adventure", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Interactive", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Interactive", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Toys_and_Games/Varied_Merchandise", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Toys and Games/Varied Merchandise", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 71}], "image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/mLEeU52KtJ6-u-5xPi64XGU-ahQ=/0x0:2500x1667/1200x628/filters:focal(1204x395:1205x396)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25545223/lego_mario2.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9762521", "eventUri": "eng-9762521", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-10-01", "textStart": 1235, "textEnd": 1246}], "sentiment": 0.2784313725490195, "wgt": 163, "relevance": 1}

It's a shame there aren't any Koopas for him to wrap the appendage around.\n\nMeanwhile, Mario can be seen wearing the iconic yellow cape power-up introduced in the 1992 game. This bestowed players with the ability to fly with a simple jump and flick of the control stick.\n\nHowever, as inviting as it looks, the new set isn't for kids. Like some display-only models Lego has previously released, including the Super Mario 64 Question Mark Block set, it is for builders aged 18 and over.\n\nThat means you should stick it on your mantelpiece, not get it grubby by playing with it continually. You can pre-order it online today (July 25) for \u00a3115 before its October 1 release date.\n\nLego has been pumping out Mario sets since partnering with Nintendo in 2020. If you want something for the kids (or more interactive), there's plenty to choose from.\n\nAt the time of writing, the sets range from \u00a36.29 for smaller models like the one featuring Donkey Kong's rideable buddy, Rambi the Rhino, to \u00a3230 for the elaborate Nintendo Entertainment System set. The latter is an intricate 2,646-piece model of the SNES predecessor, complete with an old-school TV with a channel-turning knob and a cable that plugs into the system.\n\nIf the new set makes you want to revisit the glorious game it's based on, you'll be happy to learn you don't need to find a dusty old SNES to play it. Super Mario World is available on the Nintendo Switch Online classic gaming library from \u00a33.49 a month.\n\nSuper Mario isn't the only game receiving the brick treatment.

Basically, they could change as we get closer to that date! However, if that title is correct, it would debunk some of the rumors that have surrounded the movie. In the months following the sequel announcement, there had been some leakers claiming that the next Mario movie would not be a numbered follow-up, but would instead be a spin-off centered on Donkey Kong or Luigi. While both Charlie Day and Seth Rogen have shown an interest in making spin-off films starring their characters, there's still nothing to suggest that the next movie will be a spin-off, rather than a direct sequel.\n\nThe Super Mario Bros. Movie did offer a brief tease for a sequel, with a hint of a green Yoshi egg hatching in the sewers beneath Brooklyn. A herd of Yoshis did make a brief appearance in the background of The Super Mario Bros. Movie at one point, but they didn't have much else to do in the movie. Yoshis have played a pivotal role in the Mario franchise since 1991, and it would make a lot of sense for the characters to get a big focus in the sequel. However, plot details for the next movie are basically nonexistent at this time.\n\nAre you excited for The Super Mario Bros. Movie sequel? What did you think of the first film?

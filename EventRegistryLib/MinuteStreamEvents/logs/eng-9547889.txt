With Curry headed overseas in a couple weeks, one of his most well-known hobbies will take a back seat.\n\nCurry announced in a statement on Tuesday afternoon that he will not participate in the 2024 American Century Championship, a celebrity golf tournament in mid-July, passing up the opportunity at back-to-back titles in the pursuit of international athletic achievement.\n\n\"I'm disappointed that I won't be able to defend my title at the American Century Championship in Tahoe this summer, but the chance to represent my country and, hopefully, win an Olympic gold medal for the first time at the 2024 Games in Paris is an opportunity that I simply could not pass up,\" Curry said in a statement. \"I look forward to returning to the shores of Lake Tahoe and creating more memories next July and in subsequent years.

The Warriors star brings a wealth of experience that should help push USA over the hump.\n\nCurry has won four championships with the Warriors in addition to two MVP awards and several All-Star and All-NBA honors.\n\nThe 35-year-old has not missed a beat after finishing his 15th season. Curry led the Warriors to a 46-36 record in 2023-24. He held season averages of 26.4 points, 5.1 assists, 4.5 rebounds, shot 40.8 percent on three-pointers, and nailed 92.3 percent of his free throws.\n\nCurry will not have to carry as much of a load as he does on Golden State given the amount of stars on Team USA.

In the interim, I know that Dell and Seth will represent the Curry family well in my absence, but if one of them doesn't come home with another trophy for our mantel, I will be highly disappointed!\"\n\nHis father, Dell Curry, and brother, Seth Curry, will both play at Edgewood Tahoe this summer.\n\nThe Golden State Warriors star won the 2023 ACC championship with the same flair he's displayed on the basketball court throughout his career. Curry carded four eagles in three days of tournament play, including a hole-in-one during the second round and a scintillating, clutch do-or-die, 18-foot putt on the final hole to capture the title.\n\nIn winning, Curry became the first active athlete in 23 years to claim the title (Al Del Greco, Tennessee Titans, 2000), and the first African American to win it in the tournament's 35 years. He's been a fan favorite at Edgewood Tahoe since helping the Warriors win the NBA Championship four times, in 2015, 2017, 2018 and 2022.\n\nThe Summer Olympics are scheduled for July 26-Aug. 11 in Paris. The ACC celebrity golf tournament is July 12-14.\n\n\"Well, we've discovered that the only thing Stephen Curry can't do is be in two places at once,\" Jon Miller, president, NBC Sports Acquisitions and Partnerships, said in a news release. \"Obviously, the tournament and our fans are as disappointed as Steph that he can't be here, but representing our country at the Olympics and going for gold is a proud priority to support. We wish Team USA and our entire Olympic contingent well and look forward to having Steph defend his American Century title in 2025.\"\n\nIn addition to Dell and Seth Curry, the tournament will feature 84 sports and entertainment celebrities competing at Edgewood Tahoe.\n\nThe field represents a collection of Hall of Famers, All-Pros, All-Stars and fan favorites including Charles Barkley, Tony Romo, Josh Allen, Jerry Rice, Steve Young, Aaron Rodgers, John Elway, Ray Allen, DeMarcus Ware, Baker Mayfield, Kyle Lowry, Brian Urlacher, Charles Woodson, Canelo and Larry Fitzgerald. Entertainers feature Colin Jost, Miles Teller, Nate Bargatze, Ray Romano, Don Cheadle, Carson Daly, Jake Owen, Larry the Cable Guy, Rob Riggle and Brian Baumgartner.\n\nPrevious tournament winners include three-time champions Romo and former MLB pitcher Mark Mulder, two-time winner Jack Wagner, along with Mardy Fish and Vinny Del Negro, plus top competitors Annika Sorenstam, John Smoltz and NHL star Joe Pavelski.", "source": {"uri": "rgj.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Reno Gazette Journal"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Starting with Michael Jordan and LeBron James, Rodman rounded out his four with Magic Johnson and Steph Curry.\n\nThis is always a very controversial topic, as Jordan and James have the top-two spots locked up, but the next two are always up for debate. While Curry is in most people's top-10, he usually does not crack the top-four. There are different arguments for placing Curry this high, as some believe his impact on the game of basketball places him near the top of any exclusive list of all-time greats.\n\nThe omission of Kareem Abdul-Jabbar from this list is going to be a controversial one, as most people seem to have him no lower than third or fourth all-time. These list become more and more difficult as the years go on, as the NBA's current legends like Curry, James, and others continue to add to their already historically great resumes.\n\nMany of these discussions come down to what a person values. All of these players are incredibly accomplished, with both individual and team accolades, but there are certain distinctions that set them apart from person to person. For Rodman, he has Jordan, James, Johnson, and Curry on his Mount Rushmore.\n\nJJ Redick Fires Back at Former NBA Star Over Viral Michael Jordan Statement", "source": {"uri": "si.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sports Illustrated"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Curry", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Stephen Curry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dennis_Rodman", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Dennis Rodman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Jordan", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Michael Jordan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LeBron_James", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "LeBron James"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Rushmore", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mount Rushmore"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Bulls", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chicago Bulls"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic_Johnson", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Magic Johnson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kareem_Abdul-Jabbar", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kareem Abdul-Jabbar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JJ_Redick", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "JJ Redick"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Show_Basketball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Show Basketball", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 59}], "image": "https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_crop,w_1528,h_859,x_358,y_80/c_fill,w_1440,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/images/ImagnImages/mmsport/bulls_news/01hxfqvnqpxcsr01er0b.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9547889", "eventUri": "eng-9547889", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.09019607843137245, "wgt": 133, "relevance": 1}

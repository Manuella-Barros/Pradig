{"id": 231289162, "title": "Report: A\u2019ja Wilson And Breanna Stewart Headline A Loaded USA Olympic Roster That Does Not Include Caitlin Clark", "text": "The United States women\u2019s basketball team will be playing for their eighth consecutive Olympic gold medal in Paris later this summer, and as is always the case for Team USA, arguably the most competitive part of the Olympic process is making the roster. The potential pool of players for USA Basketball to choose from is loaded, and this year presented an additional challenge as they had to decide if they would leave off a veteran for Caitlin Clark, as the Indiana Fever rookie sensation has become the talk of women\u2019s basketball. Ultimately, Team USA chose to stick with its veterans and leave Clark at home for the 2024 Olympics, and it\u2019s hard to fault them given the roster chosen, per reports from The Athletic\u2019s Shams Charania, Chantel Jennings, Joe Vardon, Mark Puleo, and Ben Pickman, and Christine Brennan of USA Today. The reported roster is loaded with All-Stars, MVP candidates, and some longtime Team USA stalwarts. A\u2019ja Wilson Breanna Stewart Diana Taurasi Brittney Griner Alyssa Thomas Napheesa Collier Jewell Loyd Kelsey Plum Jackie Young Sabrina Ionescu Chelsea Gray Kahleah Copper As Brennan confirmed, that means Clark, who has drawn an incredible number of eyeballs to the sport, has been left off, but if there was any thought USA Basketball was being run by NBC, this would rule that out. The network would surely prefer Clark would be on the team given her ratings draw, but it\u2019s also more than understandable why she wouldn\u2019t make the roster off merit at the moment. You could certainly make a case for her, but leaving off any of those 12 veterans in favor of her would be a tough argument to make in basketball terms only. Clark will surely be disappointed, and we\u2019ll have to wait to see how USA Basketball handled this with her. They previously burned bridges with stars (namely Candace Parker) over their selection process and one would expect them to want Clark in the fold long-term. However, this also might be a welcome break for Clark, who will get a few weeks off for the first time in nearly a full calendar year. By the time the Olympics roll around, she would\u2019ve been on her 10th straight month of playing high-level competitive basketball without any real break, as she went straight from the Final Four to the WNBA Draft and into training camp. As for the rest of the roster, it\u2019s a murderer\u2019s row of the best of the best. Wilson, the reigning two-time MVP, is having the best season of her career. She\u2019ll be joined by three of her Aces teammates, as Young continues to grow into being a star, Plum provides needed floor-spacing on a roster with so many star bigs, and Gray, who isn\u2019t yet back from her foot injury suffered in the Finals, is expected to return to the floor at some point in the coming weeks. Stewart, Thomas, and Collier are putting up MVP caliber campaigns themselves in the frontcourt, while Copper and Ionescu are enjoying the most productive seasons of their careers so far. Griner and Taurasi provide some Olympic veteran leadership for this group, as longtime members of USA Basketball with multiple golds to their name.", "summary": "<figure class=\"post-thumbnail\">\n\t\t<img width=\"1024\" height=\"440\" src=\"https://uproxx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/aw.jpg?w=1024&amp;h=440&amp;crop=1\" class=\"attachment-article-featured size-article-featured\" alt=\"a&#039;ja wilson breanna stewart\" decoding=\"async\" fetchpriority=\"high\" srcset=\"https://uproxx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/aw.jpg 1024w, https://uproxx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/aw.jpg?resize=300,129 300w, https://uproxx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/aw.jpg?resize=704,303 704w, https://uproxx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/aw.jpg?resize=768,330 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) calc(100vw - 20px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 40px), (min-width: 1025px) 1024px, 1024px\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\"><span class=\"wp-media-credit\">Getty Image</span></figcaption>\t</figure>\n\tUSA Basketball is riding with its vets for Paris, as the loaded squad features many of the world's best players, but not the star rookie.", "url": "https://uproxx.com/dimemag/usa-basketball-womens-roster-olympics-wilson-stewart-no-clark/", "image": "https://uproxx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/aw2.jpg?w=710", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-08 14:19:36", "author": "Robby Kalland", "authors": ["Robby Kalland"], "language": "en", "source_country": "US", "sentiment": -0.007}

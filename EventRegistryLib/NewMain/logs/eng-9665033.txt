But that indicated rate increase for 2025 is about 25%, a vast improvement over the 41% that would have been indicated before Florida lawmakers passed major litigation reforms in 2022.\n\n\"The news today will be about the rate increase. But to me the real story is that the uncapped, indicated rate is so much lower than it was just a year ago,\" board member Scott Thomas said at the meeting. \"That's a phenomenal change.\"\n\nIt's all because of Senate Bill 2A, approved in late 2022, which ended one-way attorney fees for plaintiffs and barred assignment-of-benefits agreements with contractors. Those were two quirks of Florida law that property insurers had blamed for incentivizing claims lawsuits and overwhelming some carriers with litigation costs.\n\nLitigation rates for non-catastrophe claims have fallen significantly for Citizens, from a high of 14% in 2020 to 6% in 2023. In the three most populous south Florida counties, litigation rates dropped from 28% in 2020 to 16% last year, Citizens data show.\n\n\"The primary driver of Citizens' improved results is due to the continued decrease of the litigation rates for non-catastrophe losses,\" reads an actuarial slide presentation at the meeting.\n\nAnother bit of good news for insurers: Citizens' depopulation plan appears to be working, perhaps better than expected. Citizens policies topped 1.2 million this year, but the number is expected to drop below 1 million by years's end, officials said. As many as 400,000 policies should be moved to private carriers this year, thanks partly to take-out offers made by insurance companies.\n\nThe 2025 recommended Citizens rate changes, which would take effect Jan. 1 if approved by regulators, would raise homeowner multiperil (HO-3) rates by an average of 13.5%. Actual premiums will vary by property and by county.

The rate includes multiperil policies with wind coverage and wind-only coverage for those categories.\n\nThe company is recommending raising the premium it charges for multiperil coverage of 71,196 single-family homes in Broward County by an average of 13.5% -- from an average $5,385 to $6,112.\n\nIn Palm Beach County, 61,357 homeowners would see comparable coverage hiked by an average of 13.4% -- from $4,904 to $5,561.\n\nThe 96,941 single-family homeowners covered by Citizens in Miami-Dade County would also see an average 13.5% increase from $5,113 to $5,804.\n\nCondominium rates would increase by 14.3% in Broward County, 14.5% in Palm Beach County and 14.2% in Miami-Dade County.\n\nBecause the company releases average rate hikes and premiums, individual policies might cost more or less, depending on factors such as insured value and age of the structure.\n\nThe recommendations must be approved by the company's Board of Governors in a meeting Wednesday morning as well as by the Florida Office of Insurance Regulation following a public rate hearing at some point in the future.\n\nTypically, the state's insurance regulators approve a rate that's somewhat reduced from what Citizens requests.\n\nIf the rate hike limit wasn't in effect, Citizens would need a 38% rate hike to achieve what's known in the insurance business as \"actuarial soundness.\"\n\nPrior to 2022, Citizens' annual rate increases were capped at 10%.

This increase, the greatest authorized by the state, is intended to stabilize Florida's insurance market and decrease the financial strain on Citizens Insurance, the state's insurer of last resort.Ron DeSantis, the state's governor, has previously referred to the insurer as \"insolvent\".\n\nIn recent years, Citizens has become the largest property insurer in Florida, accounting for 18% of the market. However, state officials are attempting to shift policies from Citizens to private insurers to reduce financial risks during hurricanes. Since October, more than 400,000 insurance have moved to the private market. \"We've seen over 400,000 Citizens policies transition to the private market.\" Why is this a positive thing? Number one, it eliminates risk exposure for citizens; second, it demonstrates that the private market is healthier,\" noted Mark Friedlander of the Insurance Information Institute.\n\nFriedlander stressed that the rate increase is critical to improving the competitiveness of Florida's insurance market. \"You're buying insurance from Citizens at a discount. Many people may disagree, thinking, 'I'm paying so much, what are you talking about?' But you are purchasing Citizens Insurance at an artificially cheap premium.\"\n\nLaura Bongarzone, a West Palm Beach resident, has seen the impact of rising insurance costs personally, telling CBS12 News that her premiums increased from $2,800 in 2020 to $5987 this year.\n\nFor homeowners like Bongarzone, the anticipated rise presents a difficult situation. \"You're basically a captive. You may go anyplace; no one will write insurance now, and if I move somewhere else, it will cost even more,\" she explained.\n\nThe planned rate hike, which requires approval from both the Board of Governors and the Office of Insurance Regulation, might go into effect on January 1, 2025. This would be the greatest average rate rise and only the second double-digit boost in Citizens Insurance's history.\n\n\"These are very positive indications that we're creating an environment where there's a potentially more stable marketplace inside of the state of Florida, as well as more competition,\" said Charlie Lydecker, chairman of Foundation Risk Partners and a member of the Board of Governors.\n\nCitizens Insurance, which covers 1.2 million policyholders, was originally intended for homeowners who were unable to obtain insurance in the open market. As private insurers canceled coverage and upped rates, Citizens became a more inexpensive alternative. \"They cannot charge what we refer to as actuarially sound rates, meaning if they were a private insurer, they would have been charging much higher rates over the past several years just based on market conditions, risk exposure,\" according to Friedlander.\n\nDespite the rate hikes, the private insurance sector has experienced lesser increases this year, reflecting better health. \"The bottom line is, the private insurance market has gotten much healthier,\" Friedlander told reporters. \"That's why they're able to adjust their rates now to very moderate levels.\"\n\nThe strength of new insurers joining the market has been called into doubt. According to the abstract of a Harvard/Columbia/Federal Reserve study, conventional insurers are leaving high-risk locations, while new lower-quality insurers come and fill the vacuum. \"These new insurers service the riskiest areas, are less diversified, hold less capital, and 20% of them become insolvent.\"\n\nCitizens Insurance anticipates attracting thousands of new clients throughout the hurricane season, while depopulation activities will be paused during this time. \"Our real dream is de-population and reduced rates,\" Lydecker stated.\n\nWhile the projected premium increase is less than half of what would be required without a cap, the Board of Governors expects the number of policies to fall below one million. The Florida Office of Insurance Regulation must still accept the increase, with the option of returning it for modifications and re-filing.\n\nAs the state works through these reforms, homeowners are left looking for viable insurance options in a volatile market setting.", "source": {"uri": "howafrica.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "How Africa News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citizens_Insurance", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Citizens Insurance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insurance", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Insurance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Board_of_directors", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Board of directors"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accounting", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Accounting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_risk", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Financial risk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insolvency", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Insolvency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Governor (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tropical_cyclone", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tropical cyclone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Palm_Beach,_Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "West Palm Beach, Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "West Palm Beach, Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Federal Reserve"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Actuarial_science", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Actuarial science"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volatility_(finance)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Volatility (finance)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvard_University", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Harvard University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Columbia,_South_Carolina", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Columbia, South Carolina"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Columbia, South Carolina"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services", "wgt": 32}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/Insurance", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/Insurance", "wgt": 60}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Government/Finance", "label": "dmoz/Society/Government/Finance", "wgt": 33}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance", "wgt": 31}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance/Insurance", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance/Insurance", "wgt": 61}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 79}], "image": "https://howafrica.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Home-insurance.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9665033", "eventUri": "eng-9665033", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1450980392156862, "wgt": 194, "relevance": 1}

Judged by the prevailing mood during Wednesday's board of governors meeting, it was a reason to celebrate.\n\nAnd that's because the state's elected leaders don't see Citizens, Florida's largest insurer, as a powerful tool to help floundering homeowners in Florida's failed insurance market but as an albatross, and they don't view its customers as people in need but as numbers on a spreadsheet they'd rather delete. Instead of leveraging a viable public insurance option to help homeowners who are drowning in skyrocketing costs, state officials are myopically focused on kicking them off it. The result is \"depopulation,\" a clinical euphemism that in practice means coercing Citizens customers into entering a chaotic private marketplace that has failed Floridians for years, and in which they may well end up paying even higher rates.\n\nThis is what it looks like when elected leaders place ideology and campaign contributions ahead of good sense and concern for their own constituents.\n\nThe sentiment during Wednesday's meeting was not regret or anger over the double-digit hikes, which, if approved by regulators, will be borne by many people with no other realistic options. Instead, as has become customary in Gov. Ron DeSantis' Florida, sycophancy trumped lived reality: Several members of Citizens' board of governors brazenly hailed state leaders for implementing industry-backed insurance reforms last year even as those changes did nothing to stave off painful increases -- in some cases, the highest-possible 14 percent increase Citizens can levy -- for much of the company's customer base. \"I'm sure the news will be about the proposed rate increase,\" board member M. Scott Thomas, a Jacksonville attorney, dismissively noted, before heaping praise on Florida's elected officials for enacting \"reforms\" that make it harder for policyholders to sue insurance companies when they believe they were shortchanged on coverage.\n\nFor Citizens' customers, there is no good news, even when the insurer's costs of covering a community go down.\n\nThe increases approved Wednesday, for example, are artificially high for many thousands of policyholders in South Florida -- a kind of illusion, albeit one with severe real-world consequences, designed to prop up private insurers.\n\nOne of those industry-backed insurance \"reforms\" the governor and Legislature implemented last year prevents Citizens from simply charging what it needs to cover its anticipated obligations in the future, the way one might expect an insurance company to price out its coverage. Instead, Citizens must also make sure its rates are not too low, otherwise -- gasp! -- private insurance companies might lose customers to Citizens.\n\nSo instead of being able to offer customers in Miami-Dade a 4 percent decrease next year, which a Citizens staffer told board members would be enough to cover its obligations, Citizens instead had to recommend a 14 percent increase because its rates can't be too competitive with private insurers who are charging far higher rates. Read that again: A 4 percent decrease became a 14 percent increase because of these much-ballyhooed insurance \"reforms.\"\n\nFor South Florida policyholders, it's a no-win dilemma. Staffers estimated that Citizens' rates in Miami-Dade would have to jump by more than 82 percent to become truly \"non-competitive\" -- which they define as ensuring Citizens' rates are more expensive than 7 out of 10 private insurers. But Citizens can only ask for a 14 percent rate increase in any given year, not 82 percent, so that's what Miami-Dade customers will be getting if state regulators approve the rate hike even though the cost of servicing those customers went down.\n\nCitizens' rates are apparently destined to rise in perpetuity almost by default, with nary a peep from the board of governors about that sad reality for the 1 million-plus customers who will have to shell out hundreds more or face the prospect of being priced out of their home.\n\nIn real terms, that 14 percent increase means a Miami policyholder who paid $5,011 this year would pay $5,710 next year, according to figures Citizens staff presented to the board of governors. Rates in Broward could have been kept effectively flat, but the competitive analysis required a 14 percent jump as well. Palm Beach could have gotten a 9.8 percent increase but for this requirement, so they, too, are getting a 14 percent increase.\n\nDespite Citizens' allegedly too-low rates, an S&P analysis found the public company still posted net income of $746.5 million last year.\n\nThis all should have raised some natural questions among the board of governors: Instead of demonstrating the virtues of the private sector, this competitive analysis simply shows how poorly served many Floridians are by the state's out-of-control private insurance market. It also reveals how well positioned Citizens is to actually help people, were Florida's elected leaders not entirely dedicated to a special-interest-driven project to gut the public insurer. And in a fitting coda, a Citizens staff memo noted that the \"non-competitive\" analysis did not include rate decreases announced earlier this year by several private insurers.\n\nSpeaking of governors, asked at a Wednesday news conference about Citizens' insurance hike, DeSantis basically shrugged. And -- big shock -- he blamed it all on the president. \"We still have inflation in this country,\" he caterwauled, before noting that his drive-through McDonald's meal was more expensive, too.\n\nDeSantis often confronts unflattering narratives with this same breezy dismissal. Last week, when devastating, historic rains sank Miami, his aides rushed to social media to say this was just the rainy season -- any critics of his reactive posture toward the many ecological and humanitarian disasters unfolding and that are set to unfold are chicken-little scolds who expect DeSantis to change the weather.\n\nAnd although COVID-19 serves as a kind of creation myth in the DeSantis canon, the ugly reality is that more than 93,000 Floridians died from it -- a grim statistic that any leader, regardless of their opinions on masks and vaccines, or their own self-evaluation of their success in navigating the pandemic, ought to publicly mourn. DeSantis simply never mentions it. What's he supposed to do? Care?\n\nAnd so Citizens, a perfectly functioning, viable public option for Floridians in need of affordable insurance -- a public company that has existed and served as a lynchpin in Florida's insurance market for decades, all somehow without turning the place into a collectivist penal colony -- must self-immolate and throw its customers to the wolves because of vibes. And hey, the price of the governor's Big Mac rose too, so get over it.

The rate includes multiperil policies with wind coverage and wind-only coverage for those categories.\n\nIt's the highest rate hike allowed by a law enacted in 2021 that increased the maximum annual rate increase from 10% that year to 15% in 2026.\n\nThe company is recommending raising the premium it charges for multiperil coverage of 71,196 single-family homes in Broward County by an average of 13.5% -- from an average $5,385 to $6,112.\n\nIn Palm Beach County, 61,357 homeowners would see comparable coverage hiked by an average of 13.4% -- from $4,904 to $5,561.\n\nThe 96,941 single-family homeowners covered by Citizens in Miami-Dade County would also see an average 13.5% increase from $5,113 to $5,804.\n\nCondominium rates would increase by 14.3% in Broward County, 14.5% in Palm Beach County and 14.2% in Miami-Dade County.\n\nResponding to a South Florida Sun Sentinel story outlining the proposed rate increases, Luz Green, a Florida Atlantic University student, noted that the increase could help quash her dream of owning her own home someday.\n\nIn an email, Green noted the $657 average increase for a Citizens policy in Palm Beach County.\n\n\"I may not be a mathematician, but I am unable to ascertain how someone would be able to increase their payment amounts without an increase in pay,\" Green wrote. \"I find it especially difficult to defend this increase when there is no change in coverage. There is no added protection, no new features, no incentives; the same policy just with higher rates.\"\n\nNo one at the Board of Governors meeting argued for a lower increase. But several praised improved financial results made possible by legislative reforms that make it harder for homeowners to sue insurers when they believe their claims are denied or undervalued.\n\nFor owners of single-family houses in South Florida, the rate hikes would have been much lower if the board had relied on what's called the \"actuarial\" indicated rate.\n\nIn insurance terms, actuarial rates are what companies need to cover expected losses. For years, Citizens has approved rates that were much lower than indicated actuarial rates.\n\nThis year is no different, although indicated actuarial rate increases have fallen sharply -- from 55.1% statewide for personal multiperil and wind-only coverage in 2024 to 25.2% in 2025 -- thanks to the decline in litigation that followed passage of a broad series of reforms in 2022.\n\nThe reforms have ushered in what Citizens actuary Brian Donovan called \"a dramatic improvement\" in the company's financial picture. The company posted a $746.5 million net profit last year after losing $2.24 billion the year before, S&P Global reported in March.\n\nBut in South Florida, the decline in litigation drove the indicated actuarial rate hikes well below the hikes of close to 14% that were approved for Broward, Palm Beach and Miami-Dade counties, according to an analysis presented during the hearing.\n\nThe indicated actuarial rate hike for multiperil home policies in Broward County is 0.8%. Palm Beach County rates would increase by 9.8% if the indicated actuarial rate hike was adopted. And the indicated actuarial rate projection calls for rates in Miami-Dade to decline by 4%.\n\nA big reason is that rates have previously been allowed to swell in the tricounty region to cover estimated losses from litigation for non-catastrophe losses prior to the reforms.\n\nIn 2015, lawsuits were filed for 56% of all non-catastrophe claims filed in South Florida. By the end of 2023, that number had fallen to 16%, according to data shown during the meeting.\n\nBut the company's actuaries, under a mandate to reduce policy counts, justified the flat 14% hike for multiperil coverage of 225,453 single-family houses in South Florida with an analysis that found that Citizens' rates remain \"competitive\" with private-market insurers.\n\nActuaries who developed the analysis decided that \"non-competitive\" status would be achieved when Citizens' rates are higher than seven of 10 private-market insurers. That's not the case, according to the analysis.\n\nState law requires Citizens' rates to be \"non-competitive\" with private market rates to prevent the company from attaining too large of a market share and to encourage private-market growth.\n\nAccording to the analysis, rates would have to climb 96.6% statewide to be non-competitive. They would have to climb 74.1% in Broward County, 80.5% in Palm Beach County, and 82.6% in Palm Beach County.\n\nYet the analysis did not factor in rate declines announced in recent months by several private market insurers.\n\nAnd in public remarks in Marathon on Wednesday morning, Gov. Ron DeSantis noted that \"a chunk of people on Citizens\" have actually found lower rates with private market companies.\n\nCitizens has grown significantly over the past five years, increasing from about 420,000 policies in 2019 to about 1.2 million today. That growth has triggered concerns that all insurance customers in Florida could face assessments and surcharges if the company cannot pay all claims after a catastrophe.\n\nThe Office of Insurance Regulation must approve Citizens' rate hike requests following a public hearing to be scheduled in the near future.\n\nIn recent years, the office has approved lower increases than Citizens and its board have sought.", "source": {"uri": "sun-sentinel.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "SunSentinel"}, "authors": [{"uri": "ron_hurtibise@sun-sentinel.com", "name": "Ron Hurtibise", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Actuary", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Actuary"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Florida", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "South Florida"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insurance", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Insurance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palm_Beach_County,_Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Palm Beach County, Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Palm Beach County, Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami-Dade_County,_Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Miami-Dade County, Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Miami-Dade County, Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broward_County,_Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Broward County, Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Broward County, Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun_Sentinel", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Sun Sentinel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Condominium", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Condominium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Board_of_directors", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Board of directors"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ron_DeSantis", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ron DeSantis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_home", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mobile home"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawsuit", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lawsuit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida_Atlantic_University", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Florida Atlantic University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematician", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mathematician"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Email", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Email"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Office_(American_TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Office (American TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Net_income", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Net income"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_share", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Market share"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._state", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "U.S. state"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/County_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "County (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marathon", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Marathon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/Insurance", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/Insurance", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance/Insurance", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance/Insurance", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings", "wgt": 31}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings/Animals", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings/Animals", "wgt": 25}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings/Parodies", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings/Parodies", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 89}], "image": "https://www.sun-sentinel.com/wp-content/uploads/migration/2022/12/14/NFUOLJRIPVAHHBLG7LML3GF5LU.jpg?w=640", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9665033", "eventUri": "eng-9665033", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1843137254901961, "wgt": 188, "relevance": 1}

But it would still need to be approved by state regulators before taking effect.\n\nAccording to its website, Citizens is Florida's largest property insurer with more than 1.4 million policies.\n\nMark Friedlander, with the Insurance Information Institute, tells Local 10 News that the proposed increase is coming at a time where over the past year, Florida has seen a stabilization to what has been a very volatile private insurance market.\n\n\"In the private market, we're seeing average rate increases this year under 2%,\" he said. \"That's an incredible change from prior years, where we saw double-digit increases.\"\n\nGov. Ron DeSantis spoke on the proposed increase during an event in Marathon Wednesday.\n\n\"Interestingly, you got a chunk of people on Citizens who got on private and actually got lower rates on private. So Citizens is usually below actuary and I think that's true mostly, but in this case, there were things that are done,\" DeSantis said. \"We've had 10 companies file for no increase in rates for the 2024 year and there have been eight companies that have filed for decrease in rates. Now, not 25% decreases; you're talking about half a percent here. But if you look at what had been happening when the market was really destabilized, you know, you, you have that.\"\n\nFriedlander largely echoed the governor's comments.\n\n\"In most cases, Citizens customers pay much less than private market customers. In fact, the analysis we did showed a 30 to 40% average rate difference between a Citizens policy and a private market policy in 2023,\" he said. \"So there's still a large gap. So even with a 14% increase, most likely, you're still going to be paying less (with) Citizens rates.\"\n\nThe Florida Office of Insurance Regulation will have to sign off on the increase.\n\nIf it does, the rate hike will take effect in January.\n\nRate hike breakdown:", "source": {"uri": "local10.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "WPLG"}, "authors": [{"uri": "christina_vazquez@local10.com", "name": "Christina Vazquez", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "chris_gothner@local10.com", "name": "Chris Gothner", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citizens_Property_Insurance_Corporation", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Citizens Property Insurance Corporation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ron_DeSantis", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ron DeSantis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WPLG", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "WPLG"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insurance_Information_Institute", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Insurance Information Institute"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Actuary", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Actuary"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insurance", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Insurance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marathon", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Marathon"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/Insurance", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/Insurance", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance/Insurance", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance/Insurance", "wgt": 24}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings", "wgt": 28}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings/Animals", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings/Animals", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings/Parodies", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings/Parodies", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 64}], "image": "https://res.cloudinary.com/graham-media-group/image/upload/f_auto/q_auto/c_thumb,w_700/v1/media/anyclip/TL1GMZABZydD-s-LAby9/1718814008179_1920x1080_thumbnail.jpg?_a=ATAPphC0", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9665033", "eventUri": "eng-9665033", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1372549019607843, "wgt": 188, "relevance": 1}

But to me the real story is that the uncapped, indicated rate is so much lower than it was just a year ago,\" board member Scott Thomas said at the meeting. \"That's a phenomenal change.\"\n\nIt's all because of Senate Bill 2A, approved in late 2022, which ended one-way attorney fees for plaintiffs and barred assignment-of-benefits agreements with contractors. Those were two quirks of Florida law that property insurers had blamed for incentivizing claims lawsuits and overwhelming some carriers with litigation costs.\n\nLitigation rates for non-catastrophe claims have fallen significantly for Citizens, from a high of 14 percent in 2020 to 6 percent in 2023. In the three most populous south Florida counties, litigation rates dropped from 28 percent in 2020 to 16 percent last year, Citizens' data show.\n\n\"The primary driver of Citizens' improved results is due to the continued decrease of the litigation rates for non-catastrophe losses,\" reads an actuarial slide presentation at the meeting.\n\nAnother bit of good news for insurers: Citizens' depopulation plan appears to be working, perhaps better than expected. Citizens policies topped 1.2 million this year, but the number is expected to drop below 1 million by year's end, officials said. As many as 400,000 policies should be moved to private carriers this year, thanks partly to take-out offers made by insurance companies.\n\nThe 2025 recommended Citizens rate changes, which would take effect Jan. 1 if approved by regulators, would raise homeowner multiperil (HO-3) rates by an average of 13.5 percent. Actual premiums will vary by property and by county. Condominium coverage would increase 14.2 percent, and commercial policy rates would jump an average of 13.5 percent.\n\nFor second or non-primary homes, which are not subject to the same glide path that limits primary HO rate increases to no more than 15 percent per year, average rates would rise 18 percent for homeowners policies and by 15 percent for condominium units.\n\nBoard member Robert Spottswood asked if further consideration has been given to making Citizens the primary wind-only carrier for Florida. A bill in the legislature this spring proposed the change, but the bill died in committee. On Wednesday, Citizens CEO Tim Cerio said that a staff analysis of the proposed idea indicated that it would create more than $3 trillion of exposure for Citizens, requiring the purchase of $5.5 billion of reinsurance.\n\n\"It might get floated again, and there's more than one way to skin a cat, but we found that it would be cost-prohibitive,\" Cerio said.\n\nChief Actuary Brian Donovan noted that Citizens' multiperil policies, most of which include wind coverage, subsidize the cost of providing Citizens' wind-only coverage.", "source": {"uri": "carriermanagement.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Carrier Management"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawsuit", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lawsuit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insurance", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Insurance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Actuarial_science", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Actuarial science"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Actuary", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Actuary"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Board_of_directors", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Board of directors"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Florida", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "South Florida"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/County_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "County (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawyer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lawyer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plaintiff", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Plaintiff"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian_Donovan_(actor)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Brian Donovan (actor)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reinsurance", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Reinsurance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Take-out", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Take-out"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Condominium", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Condominium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cat", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legislature", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Legislature"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/Insurance", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/Insurance", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance/Insurance", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance/Insurance", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings/Animals", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings/Animals", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings/Parodies", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings/Parodies", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 77}], "image": "https://www.carriermanagement.com/assets/Florida-1536x821-1.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9665033", "eventUri": "eng-9665033", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-01-01", "textStart": 2143, "textEnd": 2149}], "sentiment": 0.04313725490196085, "wgt": 187, "relevance": 1}

Private insurance companies have reported profits as well.\n\nNews4JAX asked Insurance Information Institute spokesman Mark Friedlander if the insurer of last resort's proposed rate increase is evidence that progress isn't actually happening.\n\n\"One important point to keep in mind is Citizens' customers typically pay much less than a private market customer.

That'll likely mean hundreds of more dollars out of pocket for those already struggling with high prices.\n\nIn their virtual meeting, the Citizens Property Insurance's board unanimously said yes to that sizable bump in premiums for many of its policyholders. State insurance regulators still need to give final approval, but if they do, an average 14% increase for personal line policies in 2025. That covers homeowners, condo owners, mobile homes, and more.\n\n\"The rates recommended by the board today seek to continue the move towards actuarially sound rates while reflecting the benefits gained from recent legislative reforms,\" Citizens said in a statement. \"Citizens' premiums remain well below the filed and approved rates of most private insurance companies writing in the state. The 2025 proposed rates will help reduce the risk of assessments on non-Citizens policyholders, many of whom are already paying higher premiums.\"\n\nAccording to Citizens' projections, average premiums would jump hundreds of dollars.

When asked about the rate increases, Wednesday, Gov. Ron DeSantis listed potential signs of stabilization after years of tort reform to curb insurance lawsuits.\n\nFlorida has eight new insurers that have joined its private market. Ten others have filed for flat rates in the coming year. Plus, another eight are seeking small decreases.\n\n\"The only reason you're seeing companies come into Florida,\" DeSantis said, \"the only reason you're seeing those types of rate filings in the private market, is because we did reforms to bring some sense to this market.\"\n\nDeSantis also went on to blame inflation -- and the federal government for Florida's woes.\n\nCitizens, meanwhile, has been trying to shed policies. It's all part of a plan, backed by the Legislature, to decrease taxpayer exposure and avoid competition with the private market.\n\nCritics however continue to say it's not enough. Florida Democrats this month launching billboards like this across the state and making the GOP's handling of insurance a main talking point heading into November's election.\n\n\"For 30 years, one party has controlled the state, and look what's happened,\" said Florida Democrats Chair Nikki Fried. \"We have the highest teacher shortage in the nation. The highest inflation across the country, because Republicans refuse to get the benefits the rest of the people of our state -- that the rest of the country is seeing because of Joe Biden.\"\n\nBut beyond the Bidenomics debate, back here in Florida that Citizens' rate increase is closer to a reality. The next step is a meeting with state regulators. Officials at the Office of Insurance Regulation said to expect an in-person meeting targeted for the second or third week of July.", "source": {"uri": "wptv.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "WPTV"},

It's been quite successful. Since October of last year, they have transferred over 400,000 policies to private carriers.\n\nAccording to state law, the planned 14% rate hike is the maximum allowable rate increase.\n\n\"These are very positive indications that we're creating an environment where there's a potentially more stable marketplace inside the state of Florida and there's more competition,\" said Charlie Lydecker, a member of the Board of Governors.\n\nCitizens Insurance, administered by the state, is renowned as the \"insurer of last resort,\" although it is also Florida's largest insurer. The company administers 1.2 million insurance.\n\nIt was originally intended for homeowners who were unable to obtain insurance on the private market. However, as commercial insurers canceled policies and hiked premiums over the years, Citizens Insurance became a more inexpensive option.\n\n\"They cannot charge what we refer to as actuarially sound rates, meaning if they were a private insurer, they would have been charging much higher rates over the past several years just based on market conditions, risk exposure,\" according to Friedlander.\n\nAccording to Friedlander, private-market rate increases are actually smaller this year.\n\n\"The bottom line is, the private insurance market has gotten much healthier,\" Friedlander told reporters. \"That's why they're able to adjust their rates now to very moderate levels.\"\n\nHe claims that Citizens Insurance is increasing rates in order to achieve more stable rates.\n\n\"So, if their rates are higher on average than the private market this year, that will be another incentive for consumers to choose private insurers over citizens,\" according to Friedlander.\n\nHe predicts that Citizens Insurance will add thousands of new clients per week throughout hurricane season.

The company covers 1.2 million policies.\n\nIt was originally designed for homeowners who couldn't find insurance on the private market. But as private insurers canceled policies and raised rates over the years, Citizens Insurance became the more affordable choice.\n\n\"They cannot charge what we refer to as actuarially sound rates, meaning if they were a private insurer, they would have been charging much higher rates over the past several years just based on market conditions, risk exposure,\" Friedlander said.\n\nFriedlander says rate increases in the private market are actually running lower this year.\n\n\"The bottom line is, the private insurance market has gotten much healthier,\" Friedlander said. \"That's why they're able to adjust their rates now to very moderate levels.\"\n\nHe says Citizens Insurance is tacking on the rate hikes in an effort to reach more sound rate levels.\n\n\"So, if their rates are higher on average than the private market this year, that will be another incentive for consumers to choose private insurers over citizens,\" Friedlander said.\n\nHe says Citizens Insurance is expected to take on thousands of new customers a week during hurricane season.

I agree. We have to pay a little more...but how much more? Too much. It's too much,\" Sofia Bereza, a Tampa area resident, told WFTS-TV on Wednesday.\n\nBereza said she considered a Citizens policy but that regardless of which company offered home insurance, the prices were steep.\n\nA combination of more intense storms and hurricanes as well as soaring inflation have sent insurance premiums skyrocketing.\n\n\"You know it's unfortunate, but I also understand that inflation has caused a whole mess of trouble, and then on top of that, the climate is not what it used to be as well, so we are hit with a lot of storms that were unexpected,\" Frances Druding, another Tampa area resident, told WFTS-TV.\n\nPrimary home owners will have to pay 14% more while those with secondary homes -- defined as residences that are occupied nine months or less each year -- will be required to pay 50% more.\n\nWhile the 14% hike is substantial, Citizens rates are still on course to be substantially lower than those offered by other insurers.\n\nHomeowners in Miami-Dade County with Citizens policies that cover fire, theft and windstorms would see premiums rise from average of $5,113 to $5,804, according to data compiled by the Miami Herald.\n\nBroward County residents who are signed up with Citizens would see premiums rise from an average of $5,385 to $6,112.\n\nIn less expensive parts of the state such as Hillsborough County which surrounds Tampa Bay, average premiums would rise from $2,667 to $3,028.\n\nIn neighboring Pinellas County, which encompasses Clearwater and St. Petersburg, premiums would rise on average from $2,854 to $3,234.\n\nCitizens, the state's largest insurer, was created by the Florida state legislature in 2002 as a last-resort option for residents who were unable to find policies on the open market.\n\nThe current board of Citizens is comprised of lawyers and business executives who were appointed by Florida's Republican governor, Ron DeSantis, and the GOP-led state legislature.\n\nBy law, Citizens insurance rates are capped. In recent years, however, lawmakers voted to raise the caps.\n\nIn 2022, Florida lawmakers required Citizens policyholders to get flood insurance by March 2027.\n\nAny Citizens policyholder who owns a home valued at $500,000 must get flood insurance by March 1 of next year.\n\nWhile Florida has seen a population explosion in recent years thanks to its low-tax and business-friendly climate that has attracted residents from blue states such as New York and California, its home insurance market has been unstable.\n\nIn March, an analysis conducted by S&P Global Market Intelligence found that insurance companies in Florida made money last year for the first time in seven years.\n\nA group of around 50 insurers reported $147.3 million in net income for 2023, compared to net losses of more than $1 billion in each of the previous two years, according to the analysis.\n\nWhile the group of insurers still had collective underwriting losses of $190.8 million, it was much smaller than in past years, when it was almost $1.80 billion in 2022 and $1.52 billion in 2021, S&P Global Market Intelligence said.\n\nDevastating storms such as Hurricane Andrew in 1992 and subsequent weather events have wiped out some insurers in the state while deterring others from doing business there.\n\nLast year, Farmers Insurance said it was discontinuing new coverage of auto, home and umbrella policies in Florida, and AAA said it had decided not to renew \"a very small percentage\" of homeowners and auto insurance policies.\n\nNine insurers have been declared insolvent or merged into other companies in Florida since 2021.\n\nAverage annual property insurance premiums jumped 42% last year to $6,000 in Florida, compared to a national average of $1,700.\n\nDeSantis and the state legislature has grappled with the issue in 2021 and 2022, including holding a special session, but most of the focus was on shielding insurance companies from lawsuits and setting aside money for reinsurance to help protect insurers.\n\nThe insurance companies are optimistic that the changes have reduced expenses, particularly the costs to litigate claims.\n\nAdditionally, Florida regulators this year have approved six property and casualty insurers to start writing residential property insurance policies, S&P Global Market Intelligence said.", "source": {"uri": "nypost.com", "dataType":

The governing board for Citizens Property Insurance agreed Wednesday morning to advance a double digit increase for many of its 1.2 million policyholders. That'll likely mean hundreds of more dollars out of pocket for those already struggling with high prices.\n\nIn their virtual meeting, the Citizens Property Insurance's board unanimously said yes to that sizable bump in premiums for many of its policyholders. State insurance regulators still need to give final approval, but if they do, an average 14% increase for personal line policies in 2025. That covers homeowners, condo owners, mobile homes, and more.\n\n\"The rates recommended by the board today seek to continue the move towards actuarially sound rates while reflecting the benefits gained from recent legislative reforms,\" Citizens said in a statement. \"Citizens' premiums remain well below the filed and approved rates of most private insurance companies writing in the state. The 2025 proposed rates will help reduce the risk of assessments on non-Citizens policyholders, many of whom are already paying higher premiums.\"\n\nAccording to Citizen's projections, average premiums would jump hundreds of dollars. In Miami-Dade, $699. Palm Beach, $670. Places like Hillsborough and Pinellas -- $360.\n\n\"I'm really concerned with the next year or the next round of insurance renewal is going to be for us,\" said Willie Butts, an Apopka resident.\n\nButts told us a series of increases was exactly what he feared last year. It came after a private provider surged its prices so high the veteran was essentially forced to take Citizens rates and its proposed increases.\n\n\"I had no other choice in that move,\" Butts said.\n\nBut the market is better these days, so say regulators and Florida's governor. When asked about the rate increases, Wednesday, Gov. Ron DeSantis listed potential signs of stabilization after years of tort reform to curb insurance lawsuits.\n\nFlorida has eight new insurers that have joined its private market. Ten others have filed for flat rates in the coming year. Plus, another eight are seeking small decreases.\n\n\"The only reason you're seeing companies come into Florida,\" DeSantis said, \"the only reason you're seeing those types of rate filings in the private market, is because we did reforms to bring some sense to this market.\"\n\nDeSantis also went on to blame inflation -- and the federal government for Florida's woes.\n\nCitizens, meanwhile, has been trying to shed policies. It's all part of a plan, backed by the legislature, to decrease taxpayer exposure and avoid competition with the private market.\n\nCritics however continue to say it's not enough. Florida Democrats this month launching billboards like this across the state and making the GOP's handling of insurance a main talking point heading into November's election.\n\n\"For 30 years, one party has controlled the state, and look what's happened,\" said Florida Democrats Chair Nikki Fried. \"We have the highest teacher shortage in the nation. The highest inflation across the country, because Republicans refuse to get the benefits the rest of the people of our state -- that the rest of the country is seeing because of Joe Biden.\"\n\nBut beyond the Bidenomics debate, back here in Florida that Citizens' rate increase is closer to a reality. The next step is a meeting with state regulators. Officials at the Office of Insurance Regulation said to expect an in-person meeting targeted for the second or third week of July.\n\nIn just four months, a new Florida law would make it illegal for people to sleep in public spaces or parks. State leaders who support the bill say it will help push people who need help into shelters and programs, but Aaron Swift with the Homeless Leadership Alliance of Pinellas said that could cause more issues.\n\nHomeless shelters prepare for increase in need because of new Florida law\n\nNew poll suggests tight re-election race for US Rep.

With this vote Citizens' customers can see an increase of 14% in their property insurance rate as early as next year.\n\n\" 'All those in favor say aye'. 'Aye!' 'Aye!' 'Aye!',\" board members are heard saying as they cast their votes.\n\nThe insurer would be implementing its maximum allowable 14% rate statewide.This would be for all personal lines policies to include private condos, single-family homes, mobile homes, and rentals.\n\nCitizens, a not-for-profit corporation, tax-exempt, is Florida's insurer of last resort and the largest insurer in the state, providing both windstorm coverage and general property insurance for home-owners who can't access it otherwise in the private market. This is especially critical after a hurricane or storm.\n\nThe packaging is still pending more votes before it can be fully approved.\n\nIf the 2025 rate packages passes all approvals, here's how it could impact you.\n\nFor both Miami-Dade and Broward county, homeowners could see a possible increase of 13.5% Condominium units rates would likely increase by 14.2% in Miami-Dade and 14.3% in Broward County.\n\nWhile the board of governors voted for a rate increase, the office of insurance regulation still needs to approve it and they will hold a public hearing.\n\nCopyright 2024 Sunbeam Television Corp.

It's currently the 14th-largest bank in the country, with around $220 billion in total assets.\n\nAll rates and fees are current as of June 20, 2024, and are subject to change.\n\nCitizens Bank rates and products\n\nCitizens Bank offers many different account types, including checking, savings, money market, and CD accounts.\n\nChecking accounts\n\nCitizens Bank offers five checking accounts -- three everyday accounts, one student checking account, and one private client account. Every account comes with a contactless debit card, mobile app access, zero liability coverage, and Citizens Paid Early, which lets you get paid up to two days early.\n\nThese Citizens Bank checking accounts might not be the best free checking accounts on the market, as most come with monthly maintenance fees. However, they're relatively easy to waive.\n\nFor example, you can waive the One Deposit Checking $9.99 fee by making one deposit each statement period. The Citizens Quest Checking's $25 fee is waivable with $5,000 in total deposits each statement period or $25,000 in monthly combined balances across your accounts. Unfortunately, you can't waive the $5 fee for the Citizens EverValue Checking. There are no fees for the Citizens Private Client Checking and Student Checking accounts.\n\nThe two accounts that earn interest are the Private Client and Quest Checking accounts, but they only earn 0.07% and 0.05% APY, respectively.\n\nRight now, Citizens is offering a decent checking account bonus on every account except the EverValue Checking. See our list of best checking account bonuses to find other accounts with a sign-on bonus.\n\nSavings accounts\n\nThere are three Citizens Bank accounts to choose from: the One Deposit Savings from Citizens, the Citizens Quest Savings, and the Citizens Private Client Savings. None are a high-yield savings account, meaning you won't earn a ton of interest on your deposits. To find accounts with better APYs, consult our list of the best high-yield savings accounts.\n\nThe One Deposit Savings does have a $4.99 monthly fee, but you can waive it by making one deposit each month. It comes with a debit card, and you can get paid up to two days early. It makes the most sense if you want a basic, no-frills savings account.\n\nThe Quest Savings has no monthly fee and has a slightly higher APY. The Private Client savings has the highest APY at 0.10%, but you can still find better offerings nearly anywhere else.\n\nOne big benefit of all Citizens' savings accounts is that there are no monthly transaction limits. You can make as many withdrawals as you want without penalty.\n\nWhile Citizens Bank is a great option, some institutions offer higher interest rates. Compare the rates above to this list of competitors:\n\nMoney market accounts\n\nCitizens has three MMAs. One of the benefits of an MMA over a savings account is that they can have higher APYs. You can earn up to 3.00% APY with preferred rates and at least a $25,000 deposit, but standard rates are as low as 0.10% APY. Right now, the best MMAs have rates up to 5.25%.\n\nWith the Personal Money Market, you can waive the $10 monthly maintenance fee with a daily minimum balance of at least $2,500. The Quest Money Market and Private Client Money Market don't have monthly fees as long as you have a checking account.\n\nThe Quest Money Market has no fees for checks and no fees for ATM transactions while the Private Client Money Market has unlimited rebates on ATM fees charged by other banks.\n\nWhile all accounts come with a debit card, you're limited to six transactions in a statement period. If you go over this limit three times in one year, you may have your money transferred automatically to a noninterest-earning checking account.\n\nCertificates of deposit\n\nWith a CD, you deposit money for a set term in return for a fixed interest rate. Citizens Bank offers only two CD terms: eight months and 14 months.\n\nTo open a Citizens Bank CD, you'll need either a Citizens Quest or Citizens Private Client Checking account. Citizens' CD rates are comparable with some of the best CD rates on the market but the limited-term offerings may be a drawback.\n\nThere are also somewhat hefty early withdrawal penalties if you want to remove your principal before the term is up. You'll pay the 90 or 180 days of interest depending on term length, or half of the remaining interest to be earned, which could end up eating into your principal.\n\nOther services Citizens Bank offers\n\nAlong with the wide range of banking services listed above, Citizens Bank also offers:\n\nOnline banking\n\nEven though Citizens Bank is not an online bank, it still has a decent online banking experience. Once you open an account, you need to enroll in online banking services. Then, you can review account history, transfer funds, place stop payments, and much more.\n\nThe Citizens Bank platform and customer support\n\nIn addition to online banking, you can also access your accounts via mobile apps. It's rated 4.7 stars on both the App Store and Google Play. Using the apps, you can do everything from mobile check deposit to enroll in bill pay. The bank also offers online demos if you need help figuring out online or mobile banking.\n\nCitizens has phone support lines depending on what you need help with. For checking, savings, money market, and CD questions, phone support is available Monday through Friday from 7 a.m. to 10 p.m. Eastern time and from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m. ET on the weekends.\n\nIs Citizens Bank secure?\n\nCitizens has a history of data breaches. One happened in 2021 that impacted customer's Social Security and account numbers. Another happened in 2017 when nearly 5,000 customers had $1.6 million in assets stolen.\n\nCitizens Bank uses the highest level of encryption for your data and a one-time password request system to verify your identity. All accounts come with 100% online fraud protection.\n\nCitizens Bank user reviews\n\nMany customers speak highly of Citizens Bank, saying that they're \"pretty chill\" and that they \"cannot recommend them enough for personal bank accounts.\" However, others have complaints about CD renewals, saying they weren't informed of the new interest rate before the account renewed. Others had problems with customer service being rude.\n\nOverall, Citizens Bank is a reliable option if you prefer banking at brick-and-mortar locations with a large presence. As long as you live in the Citizens Bank service area, you'll have plenty of opportunities to pop into a branch for services.

Pipe replacement work in 2024 will be focused along the Rural Street corridor, between Fall Creek and 30th Street.\n\nThe company said it had received $7.5 million from the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA) in 2023 to replace legacy infrastructure.\n\n\"With Natural Gas Distribution Infrastructure Safety and Modernization grants like this one, PHMSA is effectively improving our American natural gas networks and thereby further increasing public health and public safety outcomes in our communities\", said J.P. Ghio, Citizens vice president for energy operations. The new infrastructure will curb potential methane emissions, according to Citizens.\n\nPHMSA grants have been allotted $1 billion in the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, to be awarded to community- or municipality-owned gas distributional systems in the coming years, Citizens noted.\n\nThe areas hosting Citizens' replacement projects are in the vicinity of the Avondale Meadows, Martindale Brightwood, and Far Eastside neighborhoods. Citizens said it continues to claim and direct funding for utility safety upgrades in neighborhoods that need it most across the totality of the service area.\n\n\"The safety of our infrastructure systems is critical for our neighborhood's vibrancy\", said Barato Britt, president and CEO of the Edna Martin Christian Center. \"Investment in the long-term sustainability, security, and health of our community is welcomed as this effort aligns perfectly with Martindale Brightwood's resident-led Quality of Life goals. Citizens' commitment to continued community engagement also helps ensure neighbors are informed of improvements made for their benefit\".", "source": {"uri": "rigzone.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Rigzone"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_gas", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Natural gas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fall_Creek_(Indiana)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Fall Creek (Indiana)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pipeline_and_Hazardous_Materials_Safety_Administration", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piping", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Piping"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plastic", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Plastic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corrosion", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Corrosion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cast_iron", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cast iron"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steel", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Steel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Vice President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_health", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Public health"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methane_emissions", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Methane emissions"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infrastructure_Investment_and_Jobs_Act", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sustainability", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sustainability"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christianity", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Christianity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brightwood_(Washington,_D.C.)", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Brightwood (Washington, D.C.)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Brightwood (Washington, D.C.)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Energy", "label": "dmoz/Business/Energy", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Occupational_Health_and_Safety", "label": "dmoz/Health/Occupational Health and Safety", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Energy/Associations", "label": "dmoz/Business/Energy/Associations", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Civic_Participation", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Civic Participation", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Occupational_Health_and_Safety/Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Health/Occupational Health and Safety/Organizations", "wgt": 17}], "image": "https://images.rigzone.com/images/news/articles/Citizens-Energy-Group-Starts-Legacy-Infrastructure-Upgrade-177150-582x327.webp", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9665033", "eventUri": "eng-9665033", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3333333333333333, "wgt": 114, "relevance": 1}

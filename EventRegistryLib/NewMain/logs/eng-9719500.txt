NNPC declared in August 2023 that it had obtained a $3.3 billion emergency credit from the African Export-Import Bank to repay crude oil.\n\nThe national oil firm is planning to increase the amount of its crude-backed loans to $5.3 billion when the $3.3 billion loan is added to the $2 billion newly planned loan. As of Tuesday at press time, Nigerians were unable to find out how much of the $3.3 billion loan the oil corporation had paid back.\n\nReuters claimed on Tuesday that Kyari stated the company was seeking a fresh loan in relation to its daily output of between 30,000 and 35,000 barrels of crude oil, but he did not specify how much money was being sought.\n\nThis occurred on Tuesday when lines for Premium Motor Spirit, also known as gasoline, continued to form in Abuja and the surrounding states, as well as in Lagos, the commercial hub of Nigeria. Marketers attributed this to NNPC's lack of supplies, as they are the only company importing PMS into Nigeria. Because they were unable to obtain US money, other dealers ceased importing the product.\n\nAdditionally, marketers cautioned NNPC against collecting debts backed by crude as they hoped the scenario wouldn't worsen things for Nigeria's oil industry.\n\nReuters also reported that NNPC's debts to gasoline suppliers had doubled in the last four months to hit $6 billion. This was, however, countered by the spokesperson of the NNPC, Olufemi Soneye.\n\n\"False. Did they name the marketers they claim we supposedly owe? Let them name them,\" Soneye told our correspondent while responding to the Reuters report.\n\nNigeria's government finances rely on the oil the NNPC exports, and oil provides the bulk of crucial foreign exchange reserves.

So we are expecting products from them because, as you know, NNPC is still the sole importer of PMS into Nigeria, and that has been a challenge,\" he stated.\n\nOn the proposed load, the PETROAN president advised the oil company to be smart about it, adding that \"it is true that they need the funds to grow investments, but they must be sure that in the long run it would be of benefit and not detrimental to the oil sector.\"", "source": {"uri": "bizwatchnigeria.ng", "dataType": "news", "title": "BizWatchNigeria.Ng"}, "authors": [{"uri": "boluwatife_oshadiya@bizwatchnigeria.ng", "name": "Boluwatife Oshadiya", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NNPC_Limited", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "NNPC Limited"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gasoline", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gasoline"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petroleum", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Petroleum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nigeria", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nigeria"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Nigeria"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_Export\u2013Import_Bank", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "African Export\u2013Import Bank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subsidy", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Subsidy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marketing", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Marketing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bola_Tinubu", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bola Tinubu"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corporation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Corporation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abuja", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Abuja"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Abuja"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Nigeria"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lagos", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lagos"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Lagos"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Nigeria"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_exchange_reserves", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Foreign exchange reserves"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cost_of_living", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cost of living"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pipeline_transport", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pipeline transport"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nigerian_naira", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nigerian naira"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Currency", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Currency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petroleum_industry", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Petroleum industry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Price_of_oil", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Price of oil"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aliko_Dangote", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Aliko Dangote"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riot", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Riot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oil_refinery", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Oil refinery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raw_material", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Raw material"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retail", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Retail"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_dollar", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States dollar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenya", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kenya"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Kenya"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks_and_Bonds", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks and Bonds", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance/Investing", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance/Investing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Guides", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Guides", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 96}], "image": "https://bizwatchnigeria.ng/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/NNPC-pic-e1689805572437.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9719500", "eventUri": "eng-9719500", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.07450980392156858, "wgt": 228, "relevance": 1}

Subsidies - which critics say are an inefficient tool that benefits mainly elite, city-dwelling car-owners - have been a drain on Nigeria's finances for years.\n\nBut given the pain of double-digit inflation, NNPC capped average fuel prices at just above 600 naira per litre a year ago - a price that has become further from market levels since the naira fell and global oil prices rose.\n\nFuel queues began forming last week in Lagos as Abuja petrol marketers stopped selling. Sources said the ex-depot price in Lagos is above 700 naira per litre, meaning stations would lose money if they sold at the capped prices.\n\nThe 650,000 barrel per day Dangote refinery on the outskirts of Lagos expects to begin producing gasoline in the coming weeks. But that refinery has loans - and crude oil feedstock costs - in U.S. dollars, and would be reluctant to sell at a loss inside Nigeria - or wait months for payments from the NNPC.\n\nThe sources said the pressure has mounted on the government to increase pump prices - but leaders, mindful of deadly riots in Kenya that forced the government to backtrack on plans to increase taxes, are expected to be cautious about doing so.\n\n(Reporting By Julia Payne in Brussels and Libby George and Ahmad Ghaddar in London, editing by Karin Strohecker and Barbara Lewis)", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Mail Online"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NNPC_Limited", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "NNPC Limited"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subsidy", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Subsidy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gasoline", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gasoline"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petroleum", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Petroleum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nigeria", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nigeria"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Nigeria"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_exchange_reserves", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Foreign exchange reserves"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bola_Tinubu", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bola Tinubu"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pipeline_transport", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pipeline transport"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nigerian_naira", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nigerian naira"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mele_Kyari", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mele Kyari"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cost_of_living", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cost of living"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barrel", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Barrel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Currency", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Currency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Price_of_oil", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Price of oil"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aliko_Dangote", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Aliko Dangote"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riot", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Riot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oil_refinery", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Oil refinery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raw_material", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Raw material"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marketing", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Marketing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_dollar", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States dollar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reuters", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Reuters"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brussels", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Brussels"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Brussels"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Belgium"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "London"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "London"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abuja", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Abuja"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Abuja"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Nigeria"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lagos", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lagos"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Lagos"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Nigeria"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenya", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kenya"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Kenya"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks_and_Bonds", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks and Bonds", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance/Investing", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance/Investing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Guides", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Guides", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 98}], "image": null, "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9719500", "eventUri": "eng-9719500", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-08", "textStart": 290, "textEnd": 296}], "sentiment": -0.1607843137254902, "wgt": 220, "relevance": 1}

Other dealers stopped importing the commodity due to their inability to access the United States dollars.\n\nMarketers also advised NNPC to mindful with the collection of crude-backed loans, as they expressed hope that the situation would not become detrimental to Nigeria's oil sector.\n\nReuters also reported that NNPC's debts to petrol suppliers had doubled in the last four months to hit $6bn. This was, however, countered by the spokesperson of NNPC, Olufemi Soneye.\n\n\"False. Did they name the marketers they claim we supposedly owe? Let them name them,\" Soneye had told our correspondent while responding to the Reuters report.\n\nNigeria's government finances rely on the oil the NNPC exports and oil provides the bulk of crucial foreign exchange reserves. But pipeline theft, and years of underinvestment, have sapped oil production in recent years, and the cost of fuel subsidies has further depleted cash reserves.\n\nPresident Bola Tinubu has been struggling to push through reforms in Africa's biggest oil exporter - including eliminating fuel subsidies and allowing the naira currency to trade close to market levels - without pushing the country's population to a cost-of-living breaking point.\n\nKyari confirmed that NNPC wanted a loan against 30,000-35,000 barrels per day of crude production, but declined to say how much money the company is seeking. He said the cash raised would be used for all of NNPC's business activities, including supporting production growth.\n\n\"We have no problem covering our petrol payments. This is just money for normal business and not a desperate act,\" Kyari told Reuters.\n\n\"It will be a syndication with critical but regular partners who have been in business with our company to forward the cash,\" he said, adding he expected to conclude the deal in the next two months.\n\nNNPC already has a $3.3bn oil-backed loan through Afreximbank, but five sources said the company's lack of cash had been aggravated by rising fuel subsidy costs, and that the new loan would help it to pay them.\n\nIt is unclear which lender would arrange the loan, as three sources said Afrexim would be unable to extend its exposure to Nigeria that far. All five sources who spoke to Reuters asked not to be named because they were not authorised to speak on the issue.\n\nSome oil trading houses have already stopped participating in NNPC's tenders for petrol because the overdue bills have pushed their exposure to Nigeria above the levels their companies allow.\n\nTinubu announced the removal of costly fuel subsidies shortly after he took office last year, allowing pump prices to triple. Subsidies - which critics say are an inefficient tool that benefits mainly elite, city-dwelling car owners - have been a drain on Nigeria's finances for years.\n\nBut given the pain of double-digit inflation, NNPC capped average fuel prices at just above N600/litre a year ago - a price that has become further from market levels since the naira fell and global oil prices rose.\n\nFuel queues began forming last week in Lagos as Abuja petrol marketers stopped selling. Sources said the ex-depot price in Lagos is above N700/litre, meaning stations would lose money if they sold at the capped prices.\n\nThe 650,000-barrel-per-day Dangote refinery on the outskirts of Lagos expects to begin producing gasoline and open a new tab in the coming weeks. But that refinery has loans - and crude oil feedstock costs - in US dollars, and would be reluctant to sell at a loss inside Nigeria - or wait months for payments from the NNPC.\n\nThe sources said the pressure had mounted on the government to increase pump prices, but leaders, mindful of deadly riots in Kenya that forced the government to backtrack on plans to increase taxes, are expected to be cautious about doing so.\n\nReacting to the fuel supply situation in Nigeria and the proposed loan by NNPC, the President of the Petroleum Products Retail Outlets Owners Association of Nigeria, Billy Gillis-Harry, said though the national oil company was working hard to clear the queues, marketers were still expectant of products from the company.\n\n\"NNPC has assured us that they are working hard to tackle the fuel supply issues. So we are expecting products from them because as you know, NNPC is still the sole importer of PMS into Nigeria, and that has been a challenge,\" he stated.\n\nOn the proposed load, the PETROAN president advised the oil company to be smart about it, adding that \"it is true that they need the funds to grow investments, but they must be sure that in the long run it would be of benefit and not detrimental to the oil sector.\"\n\nEarlier crude-backed loan\n\nOn August 17, 2023, The PUNCH reported that the NNPCL announced that it had secured a $3.3bn emergency crude oil repayment loan from the African Export-Import Bank.\n\nIt had explained at the time that the loan would be used by the oil company to support the Federal Government in stabilising Nigeria's exchange rate.\n\nIn June this year, The PUNCH also reported that the Federal Government received a lifeline of $925m from Afrieximbank to boost the forex market and meet its dollar obligations.\n\nThe report stated that Afreximbank announced an additional disbursement of $925m under the syndicated $3.3bn crude oil-backed prepayment facility sponsored by NNPC.\n\nThe facility is to help the Federal Government attend to some of its dollar obligations, assist the Central Bank of Nigeria to stabilise the foreign exchange market and provide funding for NNPC, among other things.\n\nThe Afreximbank's accordion disbursement for Project Gazelle Funding Limited brought the total funded facility size to $3.175bn.\n\nArranged and coordinated by Afreximbank, the accordion arrangement saw the raising of a combined total of $925m from a consortium of crude oil off-taker lenders, including but not limited to the Oando Group and Sahara Energy Resource Limited.\n\nProviding details about the deal in the document titled, \"Everything you need to know about the NNPC Limited's $3.3bn loan, also known as Project Gazelle,\" NNPC said, \"This is a financing agreement secured by NNPC Limited to prepay future royalties and taxes to the Federal Government.\"\n\nThe company also stated that it adopted a lower price benchmark for the $3.3bn crude-for-cash loan to reduce the risk of default and ensure financial stability.\n\nGiving details on the benchmark oil price, the company said the facility was using a conservative crude price of $65/barrel to calculate the allocated crude to be produced and sold in the future.\n\n\"This provides a safety margin for price fluctuations in the future..NNPC Limited has reserved up to 90,000 barrels of crude for Project Gazelle, ensuring sufficient cash flow for repayment and other financial obligations.\n\n\"If oil prices rise, more money will come in from selling the 90,000 barrels, allowing for faster repayment. However, if oil prices fall, the repayment may be slower.\n\n\"The quantity of crude earmarked (90,000 barrels) is sized to ensure enough cash is available for the repayment of the facility when it is due. This also ensures that NNPC Limited can meet other cash flow obligations, considering the expected future price of crude oil globally,\" it stated", "source": {"uri": "punchng.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Punch Newspapers"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NNPC_Limited", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "NNPC Limited"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_Export\u2013Import_Bank", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "African Export\u2013Import Bank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subsidy", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Subsidy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gasoline", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gasoline"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petroleum", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Petroleum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lagos", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lagos"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Lagos"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Nigeria"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nigeria", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nigeria"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Nigeria"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marketing", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Marketing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abuja", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Abuja"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Abuja"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Nigeria"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_exchange_reserves", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Foreign exchange reserves"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bola_Tinubu", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bola Tinubu"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pipeline_transport", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pipeline transport"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nigerian_naira", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nigerian naira"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barrel_(unit)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Barrel (unit)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commodity", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Commodity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_dollar", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States dollar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aliko_Dangote", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Aliko Dangote"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oil_refinery", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Oil refinery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cost_of_living", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cost of living"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raw_material", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Raw material"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_government_of_the_United_States", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Federal government of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Currency", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Currency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Price_of_oil", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Price of oil"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riot", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Riot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Bank_of_Nigeria", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Central Bank of Nigeria"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consortium", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Consortium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenya", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kenya"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Kenya"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance/Investing", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance/Investing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Guides", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Guides", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://cdn.punchng.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/15173118/Group-Managing-Director-of-NNPC-Mele-Kyari.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9719500", "eventUri": "eng-9719500", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2017-08-", "textStart": 5817, "textEnd": 5826}], "sentiment": -0.04313725490196074, "wgt": 216, "relevance": 1}

The state-owned oil company, crucial to Nigeria's economy, aims to raise at least $2 billion, sources familiar with the matter said.\n\nIn the past four months, NNPC's debts to gasoline suppliers have doubled, reaching $6 billion. The company's financial woes are exacerbated by pipeline theft and years of underinvestment, which have hindered oil production. Additionally, the high cost of gasoline subsidies has further strained cash reserves.\n\nPresident Bola Tinubu has been pushing for reforms in Africa's largest oil exporter, including eliminating fuel subsidies and allowing the naira to trade closer to market levels. However, these changes risk pushing the population to a cost-of-living breaking point.\n\nNNPC chief Mele Kyari confirmed that the company is seeking a loan backed by 30,000-35,000 barrels per day of crude production but declined to specify the amount. He emphasized that the funds would support all of NNPC's business activities, including production growth.\n\n\"We have no problem covering our gasoline payments. This is just money for normal business and not a desperate act,\" Kyari told Reuters. He added that the deal would be a syndication with regular partners and expected to conclude within the next two months.\n\nNNPC already has a $3.3 billion oil-backed loan through Afreximbank. However, sources indicated that the company's lack of cash has worsened due to rising fuel subsidy costs, and the new loan would help cover these expenses. It remains unclear which lender would arrange the loan, as Afreximbank may be unable to extend its exposure to Nigeria.\n\nSome oil trading houses have ceased participating in NNPC's gasoline tenders because overdue bills have exceeded their allowable exposure to Nigeria. After taking office last year, Tinubu announced the removal of fuel subsidies, allowing pump prices to triple. Critics argue that subsidies primarily benefit urban car owners and have drained Nigeria's finances for years.\n\nDespite the removal of subsidies, NNPC capped average fuel prices at just above 600 naira per liter last year.

This frees up immediate funds but burdens the country with debt obligations to be repaid with future oil exports.\n\nRead also: Nigeria's crude oil output rises to 1.28millio nbpd in June - OPEC\n\nAccording to experts surveyed by BusinessDay, prioritising short-term gains over long-term development jeopardises the future of Nigeria's youth.\n\n\"Oil-for-cash loan agreements saddle future generations with the burden of repaying these loans, potentially at the expense of investments in crucial sectors like education and healthcare,\" a senior oil executive who pleaded anonymity said.\n\nKelvin Emmanuel, an energy economist and board member at Obsidian Archenar Nigeria, said it beggars belief that the Nigerian government in 2024 is embarking on the financialisation of future revenues from oil and gas assets by securitising crude oil and gas output in pursuit of immediate cash.\n\n\"At a time when the Nigerian government should be laying out a detailed plan to conduct house cleaning for NNPC Ltd or books, start book building for an IPO, the Nigerian government is amortising precious future crude oil earnings in a deal structure that robs the federating units of millions of barrels of crude oil in oil for swap transaction that sums up the point Jeffrey Frankel made in his working paper about the 'Resource Curse Theory' at Harvard University,\" Emmanuel said.\n\nNNPC on Tuesday announced it's considering securing a new $2 billion loan using crude oil pre-payments as collateral.\n\nMele Kyari the group general manager said the company wanted a loan against 30,000-35,000 barrels per day of crude production but declined to say how much money it sought.\n\nHe said the cash raised would be used for all of the NNPC's business activities, including supporting production growth.\n\n\"We have no problem covering our gasoline payments. This is just money for normal business and not a desperate act,\" Kyari told Reuters.\n\nIt is unclear which lender would arrange the loan, as three sources said Afrexim would be unable to extend its exposure to Nigeria that far.\n\nWhile NNPC grows its appetite for oil-backed loans, Saudi Aramco declared total dividends of $124.3bn in 2024, a rise of almost 30 per cent compared with last year, when it also increased payments by 30 per cent to $97.8bn after reporting the second-highest annual profits in its history.\n\nRead also: CSO petitions Senate, EFCC to probe Nigeria daily crude oil production\n\nApart from Aramco, Abu Dhabi National Oil Company (ADNOC), the state-owned oil company of the United Arab Emirates declared revenue of $6.01 billion in the first quarter of 2024, up by 15 percent compared to $5.22 billion in the same quarter last year.\n\nThe NNPC has not published its full-year 2023 reports and its first-quarter earnings of 2024 but it doesn't take a seer to understand that the oil corporation is flailing and is getting more addicted to oil-backed-loans.\n\n\"Resource-backed loans are bad because you can't price the assets properly,\" Akinwumi Adesina, president of the African Development Bank Group (AfDB) said in a recent interview with the Associated Press.\n\nAdesina, whose Abidjan, Ivory Coast-based institution assists African countries in financing development projects, said these arrangements come with a litany of problems.\n\nHe pinpointed the uneven nature of the negotiations, with lenders typically holding the upper hand and dictating terms to cash-strapped African nations.\n\n\"This power imbalance, coupled with a lack of transparency and the potential for corruption, creates fertile ground for exploitation,\" Adesina said.\n\n\"These are the reasons I say Africa should put an end to natural resource-backed loans,\" Adesina said.\n\nHe pointed to a bank initiative that helps \"countries renegotiate those loans that are asymmetric, not transparent and wrongly priced.\"\n\nAdesina said loans secured with natural resources pose a challenge for development banks like his and the International Monetary Fund, which promote sustainable debt management.\n\n\"Countries may struggle to get or repay loans from these institutions because they have to use the income from their natural resources, typically crucial to their economies, to pay off resource-tied debts, he said.\n\nNigeria is the largest producer of crude in Africa with proven reserves of 36.97 billion barrels, yet the International Trade Administration, healthcare infrastructure said the country is still underdeveloped and lacks modern medical facilities.\n\nMedical professionals are in short supply, with only about 35,000 doctors despite needing 237,000, according to World Health Organisation figures, partially due to the massive migration of healthcare workers overseas.\n\nFor Aisha Mohammed, an energy analyst at the Lagos-based Centre for Development Studies, the fundamental reason why resource-backed loans are not ideal is that the process of accurately pricing the value of assets over the shelf life of the facility is always going to favour the lender over the borrower.\n\n\"The Project Gazelle Deal that was structured as a forward sale agreement by NNPC Ltd is a cautionary tale on why the Nigerian Parliament needs to oppose resource-backed loans as though our lives depended on it,\" Mohammed said.\n\nRead also: Group petitions Senate, EFCC to probe daily crude oil production\n\nLast year, the Nigerian National Petroleum Company Limited's (NNPC) $3.3 billion crude-for-cash loan from the African Export-Import Bank (Afreximbank) sparked debate and raised questions about its long-term implications for the nation's economy.\n\nEvelyne Tsague, a co-director at Natural Resource Governance Institute Africa (NRGI), said African leaders have often taken out these loans to help with their short-term political ambitions, but their countries have ended up severely indebted and with the risk of losing collateral worth more than the value of the loan itself.\n\n\"They should stop agreeing to such perilous deals, which are often negotiated by poorly managed state-owned enterprises that often bypass parliaments and national budgets,\" Tsague said in a report titled Resource-Backed Loans: Pitfalls and Potential.\n\nDavid Mihalyi, a co-author of the report and senior economic analyst with NRGI, said: \"These deals, sometimes labelled as oil advances, often resemble pay-day loans: they have short maturities, high interest rates and fees, and no commitments on how the money will be used. Countries should stay away from oil advances containing such harmful terms.\"\n\nApart from Nigeria, BusinessDay's findings showed four African countries where resource-backed loans have contributed

Ltd. (NNPC) has acknowledged a shortfall at gasoline refueling stations in the capital region and other parts of Nigeria that have resulted in queues.\n\nHowever, the national oil and gas company indicated that the shortage of motor vehicle fuel, known locally as premium motor spirit (PMS), was not due to a lack of supply but due to weather-induced logistical challenges that have hampered restocking at the pump.\n\nA recent thunderstorm has disrupted the ship-to-ship transfer of PMS. \"The adverse weather condition has also affected berthing at jetties, truck load-outs and transportation of products to filling stations, causing a disruption in station supply logistics\", NNPC said in a statement Monday.\n\n\"... due to flammability of petroleum products and in compliance with the Nigerian Meteorological Agency regulations, it was impossible to load petrol during rainstorms and lightning\", it added.\n\nParticularly for Abuja, truck routes from coastal fuel terminals to the capital city have been flooded, according to the NNPC.\n\nIt said it was working with relevant stakeholders to resolve the logistical challenges. \"Already, loading has commenced in areas where these challenges have subsided, and we are hoping the situation will continue to improve in the coming days and full normalcy will be restored\", NNPC added, urging motorists to avoid panic buying and hoarding of fuel.\n\nReuters reported earlier this week that the West African country's debt to gasoline suppliers breached $6 billion, doubling from April. The ballooning fuel debt comes as \"NNPC struggles to cover the gap between fixed pump prices and international fuel costs\", it wrote citing unnamed industry sources.\n\nOn Monday NNPC chief executive Mele Kyari confirmed to the news agency that the company was seeking a loan to cover 30,000-35,000 barrels per day of crude production. But Kyari denied any problem covering gasoline payments. \"This is just money for normal business and not a desperate act\", Kyari told Reuters.\n\nTwo months ago, NNPC also acknowledged fuel queues but assured there was no upcoming shortage.\n\n\"In filling stations monitored across several states, including Lagos and the FCT [Federal Capital Territory], the queues have since thinned out, a development that will keep improving daily in other states\", it said in a statement May 7. NNPC said then it had enough stocks for over 30 days at more than 1.5 billion liters as of that week.\n\n\"The NNPC Ltd is also collaborating with relevant downstream agencies, such as the Nigeran Midstream & Downstream Petroleum Regulatory Authority (NMDPRA), labor unions in the sector and security operatives to address hoarding and other unwholesome practices\", it said at the time.\n\nThe NMDPRA previously dismissed concerns of fuel shortage following the new administration's removal of a fuel subsidy last year, partially reinstated later. In his inaugural address May 2023, President Bola Ahmed Tinubu announced the decision as part of efforts to lighten the government's financial burdens.\n\n\"We are working closely with NNPC Limited and other key stakeholders to guarantee a smooth transition, avoid supply disruptions, and ensure that consumers are not shortchanged in any form\", the NMDPRA said in a statement May 30, 2023.\n\n\"The Authority assures that there is ample supply of PMS to meet demand as we have taken necessary steps to ensure distribution channels remain uninterrupted and fuel is readily available at all filling stations across the country.\n\n\"Therefore, we call on Nigerians to remain calm and resist the urge to stockpile as it poses a significant safety hazard. In the same vein, Operators are advised to refrain from hoarding petrol and causing hardship\".\n\nIn response to rising costs of living, the Tinubu government reimplemented in part the fuel subsidy, the International Monetary Fund confirmed in a financing assessment report February 9, 2024. The administration \"capped retail fuel and electricity prices -- thus partially reversing the fuel subsidy removal\", the United Nations lender said.", "source": {"uri": "rigzone.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Rigzone"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NNPC_Limited", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "NNPC Limited"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gasoline", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gasoline"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nigeria", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nigeria"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Nigeria"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petroleum", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Petroleum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motor_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Motor vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petroleum_product", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Petroleum product"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fossil_fuel", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fossil fuel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filling_station", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Filling station"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Logistics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thunderstorm", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Thunderstorm"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lightning", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lightning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rain", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rain"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abuja", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Abuja"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Abuja"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Nigeria"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mele_Kyari", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mele Kyari"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Capital_Territory,_Nigeria", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Federal Capital Territory, Nigeria"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Federal Capital Territory, Nigeria"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Nigeria"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panic_buying", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Panic buying"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hoarding", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hoarding"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hot_air_balloon", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hot air balloon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barrel", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Barrel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Africa", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "West Africa"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lagos", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lagos"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Lagos"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Nigeria"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bola_Tinubu", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bola Tinubu"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Monetary_Fund", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "International Monetary Fund"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cost_of_living", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cost of living"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midstream", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Midstream"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subsidy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Subsidy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inauguration", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Inauguration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United Nations"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Energy", "label": "dmoz/Business/Energy", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Energy", "label": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Energy", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work/Whistleblowing", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work/Whistleblowing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 95}], "image": "https://images.rigzone.com/images/news/articles/NNPC-Blames-Bad-Weather-for-Shortage-at-Fuel-Stations-177356-582x327.webp", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9719500", "eventUri": "eng-9719500", "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Nigeria"}}, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-05-07", "textStart": 2359, "textEnd": 2364}], "sentiment": -0.02745098039215688, "wgt": 142, "relevance": 1}

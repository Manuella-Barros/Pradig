The sign on the bus said it was servicing the MTA Blue Line.\n\nIn the video, a woman is seen ripping open the door that separates the driver from the rest of the bus. The driver fights back, pushing the woman off the bus, and screaming at her to get off the bus. The attacker is throwing punches the entire time.\n\nThe attacker appears to let up, and as the bus driver turns around to grab the woman's bag, the attacker throws a few more punches from behind. The bus driver then throws the woman's bag at her, gets back on the bus and starts to drive off.\n\nSUGGESTED: 'We're not safe': Metro bus driver expresses concern following series of attacks\n\nThe attack comes in the wake of several attacks on other transportation employees across LA County. Back in April, there were three separate attacks on Metro buses in the span of a week. In one of those attacks, a Metro bus driver was stabbed while driving his route in Willowbrook.\n\nThose attacks led the Metro Board of Directors to install barriers on buses, and approve an emergency procurement declaration to secure funds for more.

The driver swings open the barrier door and shoves her off, before the two spill into the street -- near LAPD's Newton Division -- on Central Avenue at Jefferson Boulevard.\n\nThe two got into a scuffle around midday, according to Los Angeles police. Video shows the passenger pushing and punching the bus driver, who defends herself -- at one point kicking the woman in an apparent attempt to get her to back off. Witnesses said the fracas came after the female passenger refused to pay the 50-cent fare, KTLA reported.\n\nThe encounter did not appear to last for more than a minute, and the driver was treated at the scene, police said. But it underscored the challenges facing bus drivers and transit agencies more widely.\n\nBus drivers across the county have been dealing with increasing hostility from passengers. Assaults on transit workers have tripled over the last 15 years, according to research from the Urban Institute. Between 2008 and 2022 federal data show the number of assaults resulting in deaths or medical transport rose to 492 from 168 nationwide.\n\nAlthough Metro drivers have faced several high-profile assaults in recent months, the DASH system, which is operated by the city in 27 communities including downtown Los Angeles, has largely stayed out of the spotlight. The woman was arrested but not yet booked as of 10:30 p.m. Sunday, according to the Los Angeles Police Department.\n\nThe DASH bus service feeds into the Metropolitan Transportation Authority's bus and train network, where operators say they are worried about being targets.

Dash bus operator Sunday, as well as a series of other attacks on Metro buses and trains, some riders who spoke with KTLA said safety concerns are top of mind on the city and county's public transit systems.\n\nYesterday's attack, which was captured on video, reportedly occurred after the Dash driver refused to allow a homeless woman on the bus.\n\nDash buses, which are operated by the L.A. Department of Transportation, have been free to ride since March 2020.\n\nFootage of the incident obtained by KTLA showed the violent struggle between the female bus operator and the homeless woman, who was able to drag the driver, who had been behind a plexiglass barrier, off the bus and onto the sidewalk.\n\nThe driver fought back as the homeless woman continued the violent attack, pulling on the bus operator's uniform and landing at least one blow to her face, video showed.\n\nAfter several heated minutes of the violent altercation, the bus operator was able to get back into her vehicle and shut the homeless woman out before driving off.\n\nDash passenger Sandra Pizano told KTLA she's had no issues on the city bus service, but is wary of riding Metro buses and trains, which are operated by the county's Metropolitan Transit Authority.\n\n\"I'd rate them a D,\" Pizano said of Metro. \"I know they're trying, but something is not working.\"\n\nOn May 3, dozens of Metro operators staged a \"sick out\" over ongoing safety concerns after a series of violent and even deadly attacks on bus and train drivers and passengers.\n\nOn April 22, a Metro train passenger was stabbed to death on her way home from work in Studio City. Authorities said her attacker was a transient.\n\nEarlier in the month, a bus driver was stabbed by a passenger in Willowbrook, and in March, a transient armed with an airsoft gun hijacked a Metro bus and crashed into the Ritz-Carlton in downtown Los Angeles.\n\nLast week, a member of the LA Metro board said she wouldn't ride the bus alone because she was concerned for her personal safety.\n\n\"Bus drivers, Metro drivers, they're being attacked,\" Earl Hutchinson, President of the Los Angeles Urban Policy Roundtable, told KTLA's Rachel Menitoff.\n\nHutchinson's organization is now calling for roving security teams on public transit in the city.\n\n\"That would provide a measure not only of security, but also give drivers and train operators a sense of, 'We're being protected,'\" he added.\n\nA spokesperson for Metro told KTLA that many of these unprovoked attacks are part of the \"twin crisis\" of untreated mental illness and drug addiction. In a statement, Metro went on to say:\n\n\"Transit security officers are now riding the top 10 bus lines that have experienced greater number of operator assaults and we are working on longer term plans, which include the addition of even more dedicated transit security bus riding teams.\"\n\nBus rider Laura Ismael told KTLA that she's hoping these actions produce results fast.\n\n\"The bus drivers do need protection as well as the riders,\" she said. \"Someone has to do something about it and soon before it gets worse.\"\n\nThe woman from Sunday's attack in South L.A. was arrested, though it's unclear what charges she will face.\n\nKTLA reached out to the Dash driver's union to see if she suffered any injuries and are waiting to hear back.", "source": {"uri": "ktla.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "KTLA 5"}, "authors": [{"uri": "josh_dubose@ktla.com", "name": "Josh DuBose", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KTLA", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "KTLA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metro_(British_newspaper)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Metro (British newspaper)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_transport", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Public transport"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homelessness", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Homelessness"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bus", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drag_queen", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Drag queen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metropolitan_Transportation_Authority", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Metropolitan Transportation Authority"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transit_bus", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Transit bus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electoral_district_(Canada)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Electoral district (Canada)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Willowbrook,_California", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Willowbrook, California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Willowbrook, California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earl_Hutchinson", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Earl Hutchinson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_County_Metropolitan_Transportation_Authority", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airsoft", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Airsoft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aircraft_hijacking", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Aircraft hijacking"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_disorder", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mental disorder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urban_area", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Urban area"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Addiction", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Addiction"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Downtown_Los_Angeles", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Downtown Los Angeles"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Downtown Los Angeles"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Transportation", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Transportation", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Transportation_and_Logistics/Bus", "label": "dmoz/Business/Transportation and Logistics/Bus", "wgt": 37}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Transportation_and_Logistics/Urban_Transport", "label": "dmoz/Business/Transportation and Logistics/Urban Transport", "wgt": 35}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Hardware/Buses", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Hardware/Buses", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Device_Drivers", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Device Drivers", "wgt": 24}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 50}], "image": "https://ktla.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2024/05/Metro-attack-5.png?strip=1&w=640", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9542638", "eventUri": "eng-9542638", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-03", "textStart": 1388, "textEnd": 1393}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-04-22", "textStart": 1565, "textEnd": 1573}, {"amb": false, "date": "2020-03-", "textStart": 503, "textEnd": 513}], "sentiment": -0.2941176470588235, "wgt": 185, "relevance": 1}

Several pending class action lawsuits seek to overturn or improve this nightmare.\n\nWhy not start by questioning the involved bus drivers to explain the training they received, if any, on how the camera system works.\n\nCollect bus route schedules and corresponding bus map software coordinates to determine which bus drivers were rushing and may have pushed the limits, opening the door before fully stopping.\n\nInstead of enriching an out-of-state company, the schools need a better solution.

Report it to the police. I'm not scared that you're recording,\" to which the passenger responds, \"Are you scared? Don't you feel scared that I will report it?\"\n\nSubsequently, the driver persistently urges the passenger to exit the bus.\n\nAmidst escalating tension, the driver screams, \"Get out!\" and forcefully ejects the passenger from the vehicle.\n\nA check into the local bus schedule reveals that this particular bus operates as part of the public transportation service connecting Permas Jaya and JB Sentral, with stops at JB Checkpoint for passengers continuing their journey to Singapore.\n\nAccording to the Johor Bahru South District police chief, the altercation occurred on 2 May at approximately 9:10 am.\n\nThe video, which has amassed over 900 thousand views, has garnered significant attention from netizens, accumulating over 5.7 thousand comments.\n\nSome condemned the bus driver's actions as wrong and dangerous.\n\nSpecifically, one netizen highlighted the importance of taking action against the bus driver for dropping passengers off midway through their journey.\n\nExpressing concern, one netizen suggested that authorities should take action, arguing that individuals prone to impatience and emotional outbursts should not be entrusted with public transport responsibilities.\n\nConversely, some netizens speculated that the bus driver's reaction might have been provoked by passengers' misconduct, highlighting a perceived lack of intervention from fellow travellers in the video.\n\nSome netizens emphasized the typically calm demeanour expected of bus drivers due to the responsibility of safeguarding passengers' lives.\n\nThe consensus was that a display of anger from a bus driver could indicate a lapse in patience in handling passenger interactions.\n\nIt is noted that according to preliminary information by the police, the viral video on social media depicts a female passenger being verbally abused by the bus driver for allegedly not paying the bus fare.\n\nThe Land Public Transport Agency (APAD) of Malaysia took action following the incident, suspending the bus driver pending a thorough investigation.\n\nIn a statement issued on 6 Monday (6 May), APAD emphasized the importance of preventing such occurrences in the future, directing the bus company to conduct a comprehensive inquiry into the matter.\n\nCiting the severity of the issue, APAD reiterated its firm stance against any actions that undermine public trust in land transport services.\n\nThe agency made it clear that it will not compromise with operators or drivers who fail to uphold standards of professionalism and safety.\n\nThe case is slated for investigation under Section 352 of the Penal Code, which pertains to the use of criminal force and carries a maximum imprisonment term of 3 months and a fine of up to RM1,000 (US$211)\n\nAdditionally, it falls under Section 14 of the Minor Offences Act 1955, relating to committing an indecent act, which incurs a fine of up to RM100 (US$21)\n\nAuthorities are urging individuals with any pertinent information about the incident to step forward and assist with the ongoing investigation.\n\nThose who can provide relevant details are encouraged to contact the Johor Bahru South District police headquarters at 07-2182323.", "source": {"uri": "gutzy.asia", "dataType": "news", "title": "Gutzy Asia"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TikTok", "type": "wiki",

Drivers have been the target of several recent attacks, including one in Willowbrook where a man stabbed a bus driver while passengers watched.\n\nLast year, the agency logged 168 assaults, a slight increase from the previous year. The assaults included being spat on and stabbed.\n\n\"We understand the sick-out affected a small percentage of bus riders,\" John Ellis, who represents six union locals, said in a statement. The representative of 5,000 Metro bus and train operators for the International Assn. of Sheet Metal, Air, Rail and Transportation Workers told passengers that the union recognizes their \"anguish\" and that \"Metro sees your frustration,\" adding: \"We will continue these stepping stones of safety.\"\n\nEllis has been working with Metro's Chief Executive Stephanie Wiggins to install protective barriers and has been advocating for the agency to create its own police force. He says he believes that working \"hand in hand\" with Metro leadership will improve security.\n\nOthers aren't so sure. The action was not organized by the union, but it raises questions about deep, brewing frustration within its ranks. Drivers have expressed outrage on social media about attacks, and many worry privately about their safety day in and out.\n\nIn February, there was an attack nearly every other day -- 12 in all -- according to a Metro report. In one instance, a driver was punched after asking a passenger at Western Avenue and Jefferson Boulevard to stand behind a yellow safety line.\n\nA longtime bus driver who wasn't authorized to speak to the media said Metro just wants the buses moving, while drivers are worried about not making it home.\n\nThe driver said workers are concerned the new protective barriers are not bulletproof.\n\n\"Metro doesn't care about its drivers,\" the person said.\n\n\"We are all expendable.\"\n\nMetro warned on Friday of at least 40 bus routes affected by the staff shortage, including Line 53, which runs from downtown Los Angeles to Dominguez Hills; Line 251, from Eagle Rock to Lynwood; Line 115, from Playa del Rey to Norwalk; Line 246, from Willowbrook to San Pedro; and Line 720, from Santa Monica to downtown Los Angeles.", "source": {"uri": "100percentfedup.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "100 Percent Fed Up"}, "authors": [{"uri": "m_winger@100percentfedup.com", "name": "M Winger", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_County_Metropolitan_Transportation_Authority", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strike_action", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Strike action"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bus", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Willowbrook,_California", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Willowbrook, California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Willowbrook, California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jefferson_Boulevard", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jefferson Boulevard"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Avenue_(Los_Angeles)", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Western Avenue (Los Angeles)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eagle_Rock,_Los_Angeles", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Eagle Rock, Los Angeles"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Downtown_Los_Angeles", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Downtown Los Angeles"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Downtown Los Angeles"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Pedro,_Los_Angeles", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "San Pedro, Los Angeles"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "San Pedro, Los Angeles"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santa_Monica,_California", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Santa Monica, California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Santa Monica, California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Playa_del_Rey,_Los_Angeles", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Playa del Rey, Los Angeles"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Playa del Rey, Los Angeles"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lynwood,_California", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lynwood, California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Lynwood, California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norwalk,_Connecticut", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Norwalk, Connecticut"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Norwalk, Connecticut"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Transportation", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Transportation", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Transportation_and_Logistics/Urban_Transport", "label": "dmoz/Business/Transportation and Logistics/Urban Transport", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Transportation_and_Logistics/Trolleys", "label": "dmoz/Business/Transportation and Logistics/Trolleys", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Kites/Plans", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Kites/Plans", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Transportation", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Transportation", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://100percentfedup.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/screen-shot-2024-05-06-at-4.52.41-pm-1200x630-1-1600x900.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9542638", "eventUri": "eng-9542638", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.3411764705882353, "wgt": 144, "relevance": 1}

It's an actual invasion,\" said Edison Police Officer Zachary Dlabik.\n\nThe comments were captured on bodycam video that was only released following a lawsuit filed by New Brunswick Today.\n\n(VIDEO is at the end of article)\n\nIn the video, officers are seen and heard interacting with the driver of the bus as well as a woman who identified herself as a security officer. They told police the bus was sent from Texas on orders of Gov. Greg Abbott.\n\nThe driver of the bus refused to tell police where he was headed but assured them Edison was not the final destination.\n\nVideo shows the officers being respectful and professional as they interviewed those in charge of the bus.\n\nOne officer tells them to keep everyone on the bus. \"No one is getting off this bus until I I-D you guys and then we'll figure out what's going on,\" the officer says.\n\nAway from the encounter with the bus security personnel, the tone of the officers changes dramatically.\n\nOfficer William Kenny asks his fellow officers, \"\"You ever see Red Dawn? Instead of paratroopers, it's (expletive) buses.\" In the 1984 film Red Dawn, the U-S is invaded by Cuba and Russia.\n\nOfficer Dlabik remarks, \"It's an actual invasion. It's actually happening.\"\n\nAt one point, another officer makes his hand into the shape of a gun and says, \"Get out of Edison.\"\n\nDlabik responds, \"Yee-haw! Corralin' 'em out.\"\n\nIn the days after the January encounter with the migrant bus, Edison Mayor Sam Joshi was an outspoken critic of receiving migrants in New Jersey.\n\nHe says his town does not have the financial resources to provide services to migrants arriving from the U.S. Southern Border.\n\nJoshi further broke with Democrats over illegal immigration in November when a bus from the Texas border dropped off migrants at the Edison NJ Transit station. The intent was for them to continue into New York City to get around restrictions on the buses imposed by New York City Mayor Eric Adams.\n\nJoshi instructed police to charter a bus and return any migrants who stayed in Edison back to the border.\n\nAccording to New Brunswick Today, Joshi has not commented on the behavior of his town's officers seen in the video of the January encounter.", "source": {"uri": "nj1015.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "New Jersey 101.5"}, "authors": [{"uri": "eric_scott@nj1015.com", "name": "Eric Scott", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edison,_New_Jersey", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Edison, New Jersey"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Edison, New Jersey"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawsuit", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lawsuit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Dawn_(audio_drama)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Red Dawn (audio drama)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greg_Abbott", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Greg Abbott"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bus", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Brunswick", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "New Brunswick"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New Brunswick"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NJ_Transit", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NJ Transit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Adams", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "John Adams"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mayor_of_New_York_City", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mayor of New York City"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illegal_immigration", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Illegal immigration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mayor", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mayor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Town", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Town"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refugee", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Refugee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Jersey", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "New Jersey"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New Jersey"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Russia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cuba", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cuba"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Cuba"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Theft", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Theft", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Murder", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Murder", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Job-Related", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Job-Related", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 93}], "image": "https://townsquare.media/site/385/files/2024/05/attachment-Untitled-design-55.jpg?w=1200&q=75&format=natural", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9542638", "eventUri": "eng-9542638", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1215686274509804, "wgt": 125, "relevance": 1}

Peter was collected from Priory School in Lewes to join it on the final journey to Ringmer depot where it left service, joined by his parents and sister Malissa.\n\nVictoria Garcia, accessibility and communities manager for Brighton and Hove Buses, said: \"When we first heard how much Peter enjoyed travelling on the Samuel Lewis bus we wanted to ensure he got to have one final trip on board before it was retired.\"\n\nPeter was presented with the named panel off the bus, with the registration and fleet number added to it by infrastructure officer David Grimstone.", "source": {"uri": "theargus.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Argus"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bus", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samuel_Lewis_(publisher)", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Samuel Lewis (publisher)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brighton_and_Hove", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Brighton and Hove"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Brighton and Hove"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Rock_(Brighton_and_Hove)", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Black Rock (Brighton and Hove)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nursing_home_care", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nursing home care"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_Housing_Group", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Southern Housing Group"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Housing_association", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Housing association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Sussex_County_Hospital", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Royal Sussex County Hospital"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queen_Victoria", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Queen Victoria"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lewes", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lewes"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Lewes"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ringmer", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ringmer"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Ringmer"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death/In_Memoriam", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death/In Memoriam", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Mental_Health/Grief,_Loss_and_Bereavement", "label": "dmoz/Health/Mental Health/Grief, Loss and Bereavement", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://www.theargus.co.uk/resources/images/18049676/", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9542638", "eventUri": "eng-9542638", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2627450980392156, "wgt": 122, "relevance": 1}

(Image: Daniel Mumby)\n\nA bus gate will also be introduced at the junction of Corporation Street and Park Street, with numerous traffic signals along Wellington Road being enhanced.\n\nOn top of these measures, 150 metres of carriageway will be turned into a bus-only route towards the new Taunton mobility hub.\n\nThese changes to the western approach to Taunton will cost an estimated \u00a31,857,040, with the detailed scheme currently being worked up and highway officers looking at the best time to schedule this construction before April 2025.\n\nOn the northern side of town, improvements will be made to cut journey times to and from the railway station, with a north-bound bus lane being planned for the A3038 Station Road running 450 metres between the junction with the A3027 Staplegrove Road and the junction with Whitehall.\n\nTraffic signals will be improved on Bridge Street, Priory Bridge Road, Station Road and Tangier Way to facilitate the new lane - with all these improvements expected to cost \u00a31,020,750.\n\nTraffic signals will be improved on Bridge Street and elsewhere. (Image: Newsquest)\n\nA council spokesman said: \"This scheme aims to improve bus journey times between the town centre and the railway station.\n\n\"This scheme remains at a feasibility phase and decisions are yet to be made\n\nas to what will be implemented.\"\n\nOn the eastern approach to the town, bus lanes will operate in both directions along the A3027 East Street and the A38 East Reach between Wordsworth Drive and the Market House.\n\nThere will also be improvements to signals on Hurdle Way and along this corridor before April 2025, at a cost of \u00a31,852,550.\n\nImplementing all of these new bus lanes, bus gates and traffic signal improvements is expected to cost \u00a34,730,340 in total - with every penny coming from central government, rather than out of the council's own budgets.\n\nThese improvements are designed to complement the delivery of the new Taunton mobility hub (on the former bus station site on Tower Street), which will be served by both local buses and national coach services.\n\nA spokesman said: \"The Mobility Hub will feature bus elective vehicle charging points, waiting spaces for public transport customers, bike storage and repair facilities, e-scooter facilities, other concessions as required following user consultation, travel information (including access points to Somerset's Think Travel Portal), real-time passenger information, and taxi/ private car drop-off facilities.\n\n\"The local bus network will be redefined to see all local and intra-urban services operate through the mobility hub, providing direct links from the hub to Musgrove Park Hospital, Taunton railway station, local enterprise zones and business parks, and the Taunton park and ride sites.\"\n\nThe delivery of this mobility hub is budgeted to cost \u00a32,715,050, with a further \u00a3510,000 being allocated to a smaller, similar \"rural hub\" in Somerton.", "source": {"uri": "somersetcountygazette.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Somerset

Once accounting for inflation, LA Metro's budget has increased 12%, going toward expanding its rail and bus lines, and decreasing the time between trains and buses during peak transit hours. However, despite notable service coverage and efficiency improvements, ridership is failing to recover as safety concerns continue to plague the beleaguered system.\n\nBecause LA Metro bus drivers are covered by a collective bargaining agreement, the sick-in, or calling in sick to impact service, by drivers is not a union-sanctioned effort. The one-day sick-in came after LA Metro agreed in late April to install full-length safety doors to protect drivers from violent passengers.\n\nJust days after the safety door announcement, a transient who refused to pay a bus fare violently attacked a bus driver in a video that went viral, highlighting the challenges faced by public transit drivers in the increasingly lawless city.\n\nProsecutors say the violence is a result of lack of criminal prosecution of violent individuals by the county's lead prosecutor, District Attorney George Gascon.\n\n\"While these barriers may help delay or discourage attacks on bus drivers, the real issue is the rise of property and violent crime in Los Angeles County over the past four years,\" said former U.S. Assistant Attorney General Nate Hochman, who is running against Gascon, to The Center Square. \"George Gascon refuses to prosecute many crimes, and as a result criminals know that there won't be consequences for their actions.\"\n\nWhen LA Metro stopped enforcing fares during the COVID-19 era, the system became a de-facto shelter for the county's homeless and mentally ill, limiting utilization of a system that is the product of billions of dollars of growing public investment ahead of the 2028 Los Angeles Olympics.\n\nCopy article link", "source": {"uri": "azdailysun.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Arizona

The bus driver, added Berger, helped keep passengers \"cool and calm\" during the traumatic incident.\n\n\"The bus driver was a superstar,\" Berger said.\n\nThe crash took place around 5:30 p.m. on Route 110 near Claire Road and the Boston North Industrial Park.\n\nIn addition to local firefighters and police, an ambulance from the Merrimac Fire Department and Atlantic Ambulance responded. EMS staging was set up at Boston North, according to published reports.\n\nThe No. 17, bus was bound for Haverhill when it was struck head on by Cox. MeVa has 24 fixed bus routes that travel as distant as Lowell and Salisbury, and serves 14 towns and cities.\n\nThe bus was virtually brand new with 5,000 miles on it, most of that coming from it being delivered from a California dealership, according to Berger.\n\nBerger went on to say that the bus's front section will need to be repaired but the vehicle should be back on the road at a later date. The fact that it sustained limited damage is proof that buses are an extremely safe mode of transportation, he added.\n\n\"A bus is made with safety in mind,\" Berger said.", "source": {"uri": "eagletribune.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Eagle-Tribune"}, "authors": [{"uri": "dave_rogers@eagletribune.com", "name": "Dave Rogers", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merrimack_Valley_Transit", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Merrimack Valley Transit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SUV", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "SUV"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Customs_District_of_Newburyport", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Customs District of Newburyport"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portsmouth,_New_Hampshire", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Portsmouth, New Hampshire"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Portsmouth, New Hampshire"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haverhill,_Massachusetts", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Haverhill, Massachusetts"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Haverhill, Massachusetts"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amesbury,_Massachusetts", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Amesbury, Massachusetts"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Amesbury, Massachusetts"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massachusetts_Route_110", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Massachusetts Route 110"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ambulance", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ambulance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/City_manager", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "City manager"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergency_medical_services", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Emergency medical services"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bus", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlantic_Ocean", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Atlantic Ocean"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salisbury,_Massachusetts", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Salisbury, Massachusetts"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Salisbury, Massachusetts"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merrimac,_Massachusetts", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Merrimac, Massachusetts"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Merrimac, Massachusetts"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lowell,_Massachusetts", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lowell, Massachusetts"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Lowell, Massachusetts"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Transportation", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Transportation", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Transportation_and_Logistics/Urban_Transport", "label": "dmoz/Business/Transportation and Logistics/Urban Transport", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Autos/Driving_and_Safety", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Autos/Driving and Safety", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Outdoors/Offroad_Vehicles", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Outdoors/Offroad Vehicles", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 55}], "image": "https://bloximages.chicago2.vip.townnews.com/eagletribune.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/8/e0/8e0244e8-bc1f-57dc-a8d0-d09a90c7e8ea/663d3c3dd506d.image.jpg?crop=1763%2C926%2C0%2C124&resize=1200%2C630&order=crop%2Cresize", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9542638", "eventUri": "eng-9542638", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Haverhill, Massachusetts"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.2627450980392156, "wgt": 119, "relevance": 1}

detachment in the Madrid town of M\u00f3stoles has become a true hero for the passengers of a bus heading to And\u00fajar, in Ja\u00e9n, by preventing the vehicle from crashing after the driver will

a bus on the A-4 highway, \" heading towards the municipality of And\u00fajar, in Ja\u00e9n.\"\n\nSpecifically, it was a bus that regularly covers the Madrid-C\u00e1diz line and in which at the time of the events, near the town of Santa Elena, in Ja\u00e9n, 17 passengers were traveling, many of them with destination to the capital of Cadiz.\n\n\"When we passed Despe\u00f1aperros, approximately around six fifteen, when the bus was completely silent, I was reading, I heard a loud scream from a passenger who was at the same height as the driver,\" said the Civil Guard agent in the video.\n\nWhen the agent looked up he saw \"how the bus was already leaving the shoulder on the right side and began to brush against everything that is the protective fence.\"\n\n\"At that moment I ran towards the driver and seeing that he was unconscious, I grabbed the steering wheel, straightened the trajectory of the bus and with the help of a passenger we were able to remove him from the seat and I took charge of steering the bus,\" he explained in the video that has gone viral on social networks.\n\nFrom there, the agent drove the bus to the first exit: \"I left towards the town, I parked the vehicle and while I arrived in Santa Elena there were already passengers calling 112 and they activated the health services to assist the driver.\" has added.\n\nThe professional driver was transported by the health services to the San Agust\u00edn Hospital in Linares for evaluation and discharged without any consequences for his health.\n\nAfter the instruction of the corresponding procedures by the Road Safety Investigation Unit of the Traffic Subsector of the Civil Guard of Ja\u00e9n, the transport company authorized another driver and the trip was able to continue with all

Let the total number of buses be given. Assume furthermore that the total demand for bus transportation is given in the form of the marginal totals of an origin-destination matrix, i.e. the total demand for travel from certain origins as well as the total demand for travel to certain destinations is given.Problem: Determine the complete travel pattern and decide which bus frequencies to use on the various lines.The problem is formulated as a non-linear programming problem The most interesting features are that the model explicitly takes into account capacity constraints on the buses, and that the distribution of trips between different zones is influenced by the frequencies on the bus lines. The model also takes into account modal split between bus riding and walking. (An extension to a model handling modal split between car and bus is formulated but not solved.)The model is intended for usage in medium to long range planning.An iterative algorithm to solve this problem is developed. The algorithm is shown to converge to stationary points.

This week, Metro has finally put out concrete plans for the changes they are proposing.\n\nThe \"Better Bus Network\" proposal involves many things riders are likely to embrace, like more service during off-peak hours and weekends; more service to hospitals, schools and grocery stores; and more service to fast-growing areas like National Harbor.\n\nBut Metro warns trade-offs may have to be made, and while many people would benefit, other riders may not be happy.\n\nFor instance, to make bus service faster and more efficient, some riders must go longer distances to get to a bus stop. The proposal calls for the elimination of more than 600 out of the nearly 10,000 stops in Metro's system.\n\nBringing more service to off-peak hours and weekends would mean a reduced service at peak hours. In addition, some areas with low bus ridership could see reduced or eliminated bus service.\n\nRELATED: Metro releases proposal for major changes to its bus system\n\nMetro is also proposing renaming routes. They're proposing a system which uses a letter and then two numbers, which officials say focus groups have shown is easiest to remember. For example:\n\n\"A lot of the [current] names are legacy names that we've inherited from trolley systems many, many years ago,\" said Tom Webster, Metro's Chief Planning and Performance Officer. \"And they don't make a lot of sense to new customers to the region and to visitors.\"\n\nAt Thursday's board meeting one board member seemed concerned the naming changes could be confusing, while another wanted to use more letters to provide more detailed information based on a route's name.\n\nFor a look at all the newly named routes, in addition to the current routes they correspond to, you can visit Metro's website.\n\nThere will be a period beginning Monday in which the public can give comments to Metro, and there are also a series of public meetings scheduled for next month about the \"Better Bus Network\" proposals.\n\nThis fall, the Metro board of directors is expected to vote on a final plan. If enacted, the changes to the bus system could begin about a year from now.", "source": {"uri": "wjla.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "WJLA"}, "authors": [{"uri": "tom_roussey@wjla.com", "name": "Tom Roussey", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metro_(British_newspaper)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Metro (British newspaper)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concrete", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Concrete"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Board_of_directors", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Board of directors"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_transport_bus_service", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Public transport bus service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grocery_store", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Grocery store"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bus_stop", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bus stop"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rapid_transit", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rapid transit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Webster_(ice_hockey)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tom Webster (ice hockey)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tram", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tram"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Focus_group", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Focus group"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Transportation_and_Logistics/Urban_Transport", "label": "dmoz/Business/Transportation and Logistics/Urban Transport", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work/Coworker_Relations", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work/Coworker Relations", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Bulletin_Board_Systems/Individual_Systems", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Bulletin Board Systems/Individual Systems", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Transportation", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Transportation", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://wjla.com/resources/media/fa2ddd37-ac8d-4aaf-8a12-c0a2b71d4699-large16x9_METROBUSSERVICEVO.transfer_frame_1348.jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9542638", "eventUri": "eng-9542638", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1215686274509804, "wgt": 112, "relevance": 1}

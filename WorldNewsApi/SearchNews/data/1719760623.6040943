In the days following Allegri\u2019s exit, the Bianconeri confirmed in a statement on their website that they had temporarily handed the reins to former defender Paulo Montero. The Uruguay native \u2013 who had been working in the Juve youth sector \u2013 oversaw a draw with Bologna and a win over Monza to see out the campaign. \u201cI honestly did not come here to transform anything, but to collaborate and I am proud to be with these players,\u201d he told DAZN shortly after the second of those matches. \u201cEvery time they play, I sit in the stands to watch them, so it was an honour to be here with them.\u201d What will Juventus pay Max Allegri after sacking him? Now of course, attention turns to a more permanent solution and to finalising the departure of Allegri who had one year remaining on his contract. According to La Gazzetta dello Sport, the 56-year-old Tuscan had offered to settle his termination at a gross cost of \u20ac14 million ($15.18 million). However, despite that being much more palatable than the true balance of \u20ac20 million ($21.69 million) remaining on his deal, the Italian newspaper believes that Juve have refused that offer outright.

When will Thiago Motta take over as Juventus Coach? At the same time as negotiating with Allegri, Juventus have also been working to secure his replacement \u2013 as this previous column explained \u2013 with Thiago Motta quickly emerging as the favourite. The former Inter and PSG midfielder officially left Bologna after the final round of matches, but there are mixed reports on when exactly the 41-year-old can be expected to arrive in Turin. A statement on the official Bologna website thanked Motta \u201cfor the incredible work he has done during his time here\u201d before the owner wished him all the best for his career going forward. \u201cIn the past two years, I have gotten to know a well-prepared and winning coach,\u201d said Bologna President Joey Saputo in that same statement. \u201cHe has instilled a brilliant style of play in that time. \u201cReaching the Champions League means he and all these players will go down in our Club\u2019s history. I would have liked him to stay at Bologna but I can only ever thank him and his staff for these amazing two seasons and I wish him the best for the future.\u201d According to Sky Italia, Motta will sign a contract that will pay him \u20ac5 million ($5.43 million) until June 2027, but while some \u2013 including Juve expert Romeo Agresti \u2013 believe he could be in Turin next week, the man himself appears to be taking his time. He has taken his wife from Bologna to Barcelona on his new motorbike, with La Gazzetta\u2019s Fabiana Della Valle believing it could be late June before Motta returns to Italy and puts pen to paper.

But once she understood what it meant, and with a flight to Canada on the horizon, she decided to give this slightly bizarre TikTok trend a go.\n\nThe concept is straightforward. - you simply stare into nothingness. This viral trend sees people, mostly men, enduring long flights without any form of entertainment, food, water or conversation. In fact, the most exciting option available to those who rawdog is watching the in-flight map.\n\nAs someone who appreciates moments of reflection and enjoys meditation, Cyann decided to try this trend on a recent journey from London Gatwick to Quebec, Canada. Eager to give it a go, the intrepid adventurer chose to bend the rules slightly.\n\nREAD MORE: The viral breakfast sausage roll recipe that has foodies 'running to the kitchen'\n\nShe allowed herself to eat, drink and use the toilet if necessary and decided she wouldn't ignore anyone who spoke to her, including the flight attendant confirming her vegetarian meal choice.\n\nCyann said: \"My flight was scheduled for around 1 pm on a Sunday afternoon - not too late that I'd be overly tired, and not too early that my mind would wander to stressful thoughts about whether I had a Canadian plug adapter. It seemed the perfect time to just sit, stare and think.\"\n\nSadly, it didn't take long for Cyann to realise that she had made a big mistake.\n\nExplaining her instant regret, she said: \"Craving my lunch and having noticed that Wonka was one of the films available on my seat-neighbour's screen, I instantly regretted my decision to try out this seemingly ridiculous trend. However, being the stubborn individual that I am, I persevered with the experiment of stillness and staring.\n\n\"Even before take-off, the other journalists travelling with me were giving me strange looks. I didn't blame them - the concept of being left alone with your thoughts does seem an odd way to pass the time, and one I'm sure not many people regularly engage in. Once I got over the potential embarrassment of being watched, I began to enjoy listening to the various languages being spoken around me.\"\n\nAs she sat listening to the sighs of a couple of air stewards, and the captain's monotonous tone of the captain giving his inflight speech, Cyann realised that when you are left alone with your thoughts, there's nothing else to contemplate but the inner-lives of these aviation employees.\n\nBy the time the flight was ready for take-off, Cyann recalls that she was still managing OK. However, once we were up among the clouds she quickly became restless and bored.\n\nShe said: \"I tried to turn my thoughts to a book I'd recently read and mentally draft a review of it, but I became frustrated that I couldn't jot down any of my ideas.\n\n\"The arrival of dinner sped up the next half an hour. Post meal, I found myself staring blankly for the following 45 minutes, obsessively checking the flight map every few moments.\"\n\nFinding her mind empty, she struggled to find anything to ponder on, which only fuelled her annoyance about this ridiculous, self-sabotaging 'rawdogging' trend. On the brink of tears from sheer boredom, she contemplated ditching the plan prematurely.\n\nLeading the charge in this meditative trend is Aussie music producer Torren Foot, who amassed 10 million views documenting his transpacific journey from LA to Melbourne. Producer wudini also received praise for surviving an \"insane dopamine detox\" by enduring a seven-hour flight devoid of any entertainment.\n\n\"The power of my mind knows no bounds,\" he confidently declared.\n\nInternet culture expert Josh Stuart has cast doubt on the actual mental value of rawdogging, questioning if it's more of a macho show-off. \"This is the ice bath of the sky,\" he informed ABC \"It's like a feat of strength.

When the small plane on the map in front of her came into line with mid-Iceland, she decided to call it quits.\n\nShe said: \"With a sigh of relief, I very quickly switched on Wonka and questioned why so many people claim to enjoy rawdogging.

You can check out at any time. More info\n\nWhen reporter Cyann Feilding first heard the term 'rawdogging', she was taken aback. But once she understood what it meant, and with a flight to Canada looming, she decided to give this TikTok trend a go.\n\nWhile the concept of this new viral travel sensation is pretty easy - you simply stare into nothingness - it's not for everyone and nor should it be. Abstaining from all forms of entertainment in the air including movies, music and social interaction is being hailed as an \"extreme dopamine detox\" design to help travellers embrace the unfiltered reality of human existence.\n\nViral rawdogging videos have been popping up all over social media, showing people - mostly men - sitting and staring at the seat in front for the duration of their journey. In fact, the most entertaining option available to those who rawdog is staring at the in-flight map.\n\nREAD MORE: I went to the 'Venice of the Cotswolds', had a paddle and ate the most delicious ice cream\n\nAs someone who appreciates moments of reflection and enjoys meditation, Cyann decided to try out the trend on a recent flight from London Gatwick to Quebec in Canada. Not being a die-hard TikTok content creator, she decided to bend the rules slightly.\n\nCyann would eat, drink and use the toilet if necessary, and wouldn't ignore someone when spoken to including the flight steward asking if she wanted a vegetarian meal. Having decided on no rudeness or fasting, the reporter was committed to styling out the flight with zero mental stimulation.\n\nShe said: \"My flight was scheduled for around 1 pm on a Sunday afternoon - not too late that I would be overly tired, and not too early that my mind would wander to stressful thoughts about whether I had a Canadian plug adapter. It seemed the perfect time to just sit, stare and think.\"\n\nIt didn't take the intrepid traveller very long to realise that she was mistaken.\n\nCyann described her instant regret, saying: \"Despite being hungry and seeing that Wonka was one of the available films on my seat-neighbour's screen, I regretted my decision to try out this seemingly silly trend. However, due to my stubborn nature, I continued with my experiment of stillness and observation.\n\n\"Even before we took off, the other journalists travelling with me were giving me strange looks. I couldn't blame them - the concept of being left alone with your thoughts does seem like an odd hobby, and not one many people regularly engage in. Once I got over the potential embarrassment, I started to enjoy listening to the various languages spoken around me.\"\n\nForced to listen intently to the air stewards and the captain's monotonous tone as he gave his speech, Cyann admitted that \"once you're left alone with your thoughts, there's nothing else to ponder except the inner lives of these aviation employees.\"\n\nBy the time the flight was up among the clouds, the reported was beginning to feel irritable and bored.\n\nShe said: \"I tried to distract myself by thinking about a book I had recently read and mentally drafting a review, but I became frustrated that I couldn't jot down any of my ideas. The arrival of dinner sped up the next half an hour, but post meal, I found myself staring blankly at the flight map every few minutes for the following 45 minutes.\n\n\"My mind was a void. The inability to conjure any thoughts only fuelled my annoyance with the absurd 'rawdogging' trend.\"\n\nOn the brink of tears from boredom, she contemplated giving up on the plan prematurely.\n\nAmong the pioneers of this meditative trend is Australian music producer Torren Foot, who amassed 10 million views documenting his transpacific journey from LA to Melbourne. Producer wudini received praise for surviving an \"insane dopamine detox\" when he endured a seven-hour flight devoid of any entertainment.\n\n\"The power of my mind knows no bounds,\" he confidently asserted.\n\nOnline culture analyst Josh Stuart however has raised doubts about the actual mental value of rawdogging, questioning if it's more of a macho display. \"This is the ice bath of the sky,\" he informed ABC \"It's like a feat of strength. It's being portrayed online as the ultimate act of tapping into your 'locked-in' mentality.\"\n\nNot wanting to fall into any such toxically masculine-traps, but set on making it to some sort of significant marker point, Cyann decided to see if she could make it to Iceland. When the small plane on the map in front of her came into line with mid-Iceland, she called it quits.\n\nOverjoyed with her decision, she said \"With a sigh of relief, I very quickly switched on Wonka and questioned why so many people claim to enjoy rawdogging.

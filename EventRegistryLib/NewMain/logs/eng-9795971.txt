Blinken, Secretary of State\n\nAnnapolis, Maryland\n\nU.S. Naval Academy\n\n*SECRETARY BLINKEN:* Well, good morning, everyone. It's a great pleasure - both professional and personal - to welcome Penny, to welcome Richard, to welcome the entire team here for AUSMIN. I think we don't need much proof, but here is more evidence of it, that the United States and Australia get along swimmingly. We've seen that in Paris; we see that - (laughter) - again here today. (Laughter.) Yeah.\n\n*FOREIGN MINISTER WONG:* Yeah, we know. We know. (Laughter.)\n\n*DEPUTY SECRETARY CAMPBELL: *This should be closed to press. (Laughter.)\n\n*FOREIGN MINISTER WONG:* You're so provocative. (Laughter.)\n\n*SECRETARY BLINKEN:* But we - no, we swim together. (Laughter.) And here we are. (Laughter.)\n\nTo both of you, and all - to everyone here, thank you, thank you, thank you for coming together for AUSMIN. We are building on Prime Minister Albanese's visit in October of last year. We're building on the last AUSMIN we had, where you so graciously hosted us, and we wanted to return - more than return the favor.\n\nAs the President said last October, our alliance - the alliance between Australia and the United States - is an anchor to peace and prosperity in the Indo-Pacific, and not just the Indo-Pacific - globally. Deepening cooperation across the pillars of our alliance - security, economic, climate, clean energy - these have been the hallmarks of the work that we've done over the last few years.\n\nOn security, we're working together to advance stability, prosperity in the Indo-Pacific and beyond, and we stand together in addressing threats to peace and security. We've made extraordinary progress under AUKUS, as well as bilaterally, toward having seamless defense cooperation and innovation between our countries. And we deeply appreciate Australia's commitments as well at the NATO summit to Ukraine's defense.\n\nEconomically, Australia and the United States are simply essential partners. The United States is the largest foreign investor in Australia, and the largest recipient of outbound FDI from Australia. This relationship is genuinely an innovation alliance, as our leaders stated in October. We have the public and private sectors cooperating in emerging technology, from quantum to AI. We're working together to facilitate high-quality infrastructure in Southeast Asia and the Pacific, and of course we co-hosted the first Pacific Banking Forum in July in the United States to ensure banking services in the Pacific.\n\nAnd finally, on climate and clean energy, we're partnering together for the clean energy transition. Our Critical Minerals Taskforce is working to ensure sustainable, resilient, secure critical minerals and clean energy not just for us, but for the entire world.\n\nSo in these and so many other areas, our countries are bound together. But this meeting, bringing together our foreign policy and security teams, is a foundational element of the relationship and all the work that we're doing together. We couldn't be more pleased to have you here. So welcome. We look forward to the work.\n\nPenny?\n\n*FOREIGN MINISTER WONG:* Thank you, Tony. Thank you, Lloyd. It is such a great pleasure for Richard and I and our teams to be here with you. And I start by reflecting again on our relationship and the alliance, which is about who we are, it's about what we stand for, and it's also about what we want in the world. And if you look through the agenda we have, the work that we are doing together across the different lines of effort in our partnership, it is wide and it is deep, and it is being renewed over and again.\n\nObviously, I will say we also meet today in the shadow of the deteriorating situation in the Middle East. I want to - we want to acknowledge your leadership and your work on that, the extraordinary efforts, Tony, you've engaged in to broker peace and to advance President Biden's ceasefire proposal. It's - a ceasefire has been urgent for months; it's never been more urgent than it is now.\n\nThat is only one domain in which the United States and others, but particularly the U.S., is having to show leadership. Obviously Ukraine too, and in the Indo-Pacific. In the Indo-Pacific, the security guarantee by the United - of the United States has enabled a long period of prosperity and peace that we have enjoyed. And it has never been more vital. It's never been more vital.\n\nWe see this AUSMIN as another opportunity for us to, together, work at how we rise to the challenges for today to ensure that our alliance, our partnership, our work together is fit for the times, delivers for our shared objections and aspirations and for the region that we live in and we trade in.\n\nWe are stronger together. And at a personal level, can I say how much we appreciate our personal friendships, and how much as an ally and friend we respect and appreciate the work of the both of you and this administration, and the priority you have given and continue to give to alliances and partnerships. It is an extraordinary achievement to date and ongoing.\n\n*SECRETARY AUSTIN:* Thanks, Penny. Deputy Prime Minister Marles and Foreign Minister Wong, welcome to Annapolis. You can tell by looking at the faces of all these sailors in the room that they're delighted to be here at what they believe is the center of the universe. (Laughter.) And welcome to the 34th Australia-U.S. Ministerial Consultations. And it's great to be here with my friend and colleague, Secretary Blinken. Thanks to the United States Naval Academy for hosting us.\n\nThis is our third AUSMIN together, and each time we've made historic strides and strengthened our alliance. And I'm confident that we'll continue to deliver today. We're poised to advance our - advance major force posture initiatives. We'll take steps to deepen our defense industrial cooperation on co-development, co-production, and co-sustainment, and that includes supporting Australia's Guided Weapons and Explosive Ordnance Enterprise. We'll also identify new opportunities with likeminded allies and partners, including Japan, India, and the Philippines.\n\nFor more than a century, the United States and Australia have worked shoulder to shoulder. Australia remains an indispensable ally. We're working together today to tackle shared security challenges, from coercive behavior by the PRC, to Russia's war of choice against Ukraine, to the turmoil in the Middle East. And I know that this year's AUSMIN will deliver results for both of our peoples.\n\nAnd so Richard and Penny, thanks for making the trip. And I look forward to some great discussions.\n\n*DEPUTY PRIME MINISTER MARLES:* Well, thank you, Lloyd. Thank you, Tony. It's great for Penny and I to be here. Great to be here at the Naval Academy. It's - we have a new chief of defense force since when we last met you. Admiral Johnston is the first admiral - first member of the navy - to be our chief of defense force for quite some time. So as we are experiencing a navy takeover of our defense force - (laughter) - it feels particularly apt that we are here at Annapolis.\n\nThis is the 34th AUSMIN. It's the third that the four of us have had the honor of being the custodians of, and as we meet today, when we think about the last couple of years in which we've been working so closely together, it really has been a period of intense activity but intense achievement. I mean, we now have a pathway forward in terms of Australia acquiring a nuclear-powered submarine capability from the United States and the United Kingdom under the banner of AUKUS, and we're making progress in terms of AUKUS Pillar II as well.\n\nIf you look at the force posture of the United States on the Australian continent, we've seen a growth in Marine rotation in Darwin. We look forward in the coming years to the Submarine Rotational Force in Perth. But in fact, that force posture lay down of the United States in Australia is across all domains, from U.S. Army border craft through to logistics at Bandiana. These are all decisions that we've taken in past AUSMINs, but we're actually implementing; like, there's a real change. And it is a significant contribution to integrated deterrence within in our region, but it's a really significant contribution to the peace of the Indo-Pacific.\n\nWe're working more closely together in our industrial bases. The legislation that went through the Congress last year, which was complemented by the legislation that went through our parliament in March of this year, has transformed the seamless ecosystem between our two defense industrial bases, which are now yielding real dividends in guided weapons, for example.\n\nAnd we are seeing a blossoming of relationships within the Indo-Pacific - trilaterals between ourselves and Japan; the work that you've been doing with Japan and Korea and what that has unlocked in terms of the ability for us to work with those countries as well. And all of that is giving rise to a much safer region.\n\nI really want to echo the point that Penny made. I mean, as a global power, you've got so much on your plate. We look to your leadership in the Middle East. We very much look to your leadership in Ukraine. But we could not be happier with the extent of your presence in the Indo-Pacific. It - I mean, it's been wonderful, genuinely wonderful, and for that we thank you.\n\nBut it needs to be the case, because we are living in a difficult and fraught world, where your alliances with the countries in the Indo-Pacific like Korea, and like Japan, and of course your alliance with us is completely central to our worldview, to our national security. But we really want to thank you for making those alliances the heart of the way in which you've been going about positioning America in the world. It really is what differentiates the U.S. from everyone else, and we are very much pleased and proud to be a partner in that, and we look forward to the discussions today.\n\nbody { font-size: 1em;

Austin III reaffirmed the impenetrable bond between the U.S. and Australia after hosting high-level talks today with key Australian officials.\n\nAustin and Secretary of State Antony Blinken hosted their Australian counterparts, Defense Minister Richard Marles and Minister for Foreign Affairs Penny Wong, at the U.S. Naval Academy in Annapolis, Maryland, for the 34th Australia-U.S. Ministerial Consultations, or AUSMIN.\n\nThe officials announced new steps to enhance force posture and defense industrial cooperation between the U.S. and Australia, further building upon recent strides in the longstanding alliance.\n\n\"Today's meetings have once again demonstrated the extraordinary strength of our unbreakable alliance with Australia,\" Austin said during a joint news conference following the talks.\n\nHe added that today's discussions were guided by the U.S. and Australia's common vision for a free and open Indo-Pacific.\n\nAustin also announced the two countries are taking steps to deepen force posture cooperation with upgrades to critical air bases in Western Australia and the Northern Territory.\n\n\"We're also increasing the presence of rotational U.S. Forces in Australia,\" he said. \"All this will mean more maritime patrol aircraft and reconnaissance aircraft operating from bases across northern Australia. It will also mean more frequent rotational bomber deployments.\"\n\nThe U.S. and Australia are also increasing defense industrial base cooperation.\n\nAustin announced that the two countries are aiming to sign memorandums of understanding by the end of the year that will support in the production of critical munitions.\n\nOne agreement would support the manufacturing of Guided Multiple Launch Rocket Systems in Australia by 2025.\n\nA second agreement would support the co-production, co-sustainment and co-development of the Precision Strike Missile. The two countries have agreed to stand up a joint program office for that endeavor in early 2025.\n\n\"Together, these efforts will help ensure that we have the capability and the capacity that we'll need for decades to come,\" Austin said.\n\nAustin said both countries will also continue to advance their defense ties with other regional allies and partners throughout the Indo-Pacific and build upon the trilateral AUKUS security partnership with the U.K.\n\n\"We got a lot done today,\" Austin said. \"We'll keep building on our joint achievements over the past 3 1/2 years. And we'll keep charting an ambitious course forward.\"\n\nToday's talks in Annapolis cap a series of engagements with key allies in the Indo-Pacific over the past 10 days as the Defense Department continues to strengthen partnerships to support a shared vision for peace, stability and deterrence throughout the region.\n\nLast week, Austin concluded his 11th visit to the region with stops in Japan and the Philippines where he met alongside Blinken with key allies throughout the region.\n\nWhile in Japan, the two U.S. officials met with Japanese Defense Minister Minoru Kihara and Foreign Minister Yoko Kamikawa as part of this year's U.S.-Japan Security Consultative Committee meeting in Tokyo.\n\nAustin and Kihara also met separately with South Korea's defense minister for a trilateral Ministerial Meeting, a key component of the U.S., South Korea and Japan security cooperation dialogue.\n\nFrom Tokyo, Austin and Blinken traveled to Manila, the Philippines, where they met with Defense Secretary Gilberto Teodoro and Foreign Secretary Enrique Manalo as part of the dialogue as part of the fourth Philippines-United States 2+2 Ministerial Dialogue.\n\nThe series of engagements mark a continuation of President Joe Biden's strategy of sustained engagement in the United States' priority theater of operations.\n\nIn previewing Austin's trip, a senior defense official remarked that it would represent \"the 10 most consequential days for U.S. defense ties in the Indo-Pacific since the start of the administration.\"\n\n\"AUSMIN marks Day 10, and I think you'll find that, amid a crowded news cycle, we were right,\" the official said yesterday ahead today's talks in Annapolis.\n\n\"This administration has spent the past three-and-a-half years delivering major results with Indo-Pacific allies and partners, and these 10 days are all about taking that work to the next level,\" he said.", "source": {"uri": "defense.gov", "dataType": "news", "title": "U.S. Department of

Austin III met today at the Pentagon with Australian Defense Minister Richard Marles to discuss the historic military-to-military progress between the two nations.\n\nAustin just returned last week from a trip to the Indo-Pacific, his 11th visit to the region as secretary. He told Marles he was proud of what the two nations have accomplished in the last three years.\n\n\"We share with Australia a vision for a free, open and secure Indo-Pacific,\" Austin said. \"Together, our unbreakable alliance is helping to make that vision a reality. We're delivering on major force posture initiatives, deepening our defense industrial cooperation and expanding efforts with our regional allies and partners.\"\n\nIncluded in those efforts, Austin said, is the historic trilateral Australia, U.K. and U.S. partnership, called AUKUS. The partnership, announced in September 2021, involves two pillars. The first pillar aims to deliver a conventionally armed, nuclear-powered submarine capability to Australia. The second pillar involves enhancing joint capabilities and interoperability.\n\n\"Today and tomorrow, we'll keep building on the historic results that we've achieved together,\" Austin said. \"[And] we'll chart our path to strengthen our alliance over the coming years.\"\n\nThe secretary acknowledged his counterpart as a driving force behind the momentum and progress of the partnership between the U.S. and Australia.\n\nSince Austin has been the U.S. secretary of defense, Marles said, the partnership between the two nations has grown significantly.\n\n\"So much has happened over the last few years,\" Marles said. \"You mentioned AUKUS, which is transforming Australia's military capability. That can't happen but for the partnership that we have. We're seeing America's force posture in Australia grow really significantly, AUKUS is part of that, but it's not the only part of that. The marine rotation in Darwin is growing across all the domains. We're now seeing more activities, which has been really fantastic. We are doing more industrially and the breakthrough legislation that went through the Congress at the end of last year in terms of defense export controls is again a transformational change in terms of our relationship.\"\n\nMarles also thanked Austin for his leadership in other areas around the globe, including in Asia, the Middle East and Europe.\n\nAs an example, Marles pointed to the important U.S.-led trilateral partnership developing with Japan and South Korea; and also, to the quadrilateral partnership between U.S., Japan, Australia and the Philippines, aimed at advancing a shared vision for a free, open, secure and prosperous Indo-Pacific.\n\nThe world remains a challenging place, with a complex security environment, Marles said.\n\n\"We're witnessing that literally play out by the day,\" Marles said. \"Our relationship with the United States has always been important, but it's never been more important than now.\"\n\nSecretary of State Antony Blinken and Australian Minister for Foreign Affairs Penny Wong will be joining the two defense leaders in Annapolis, Maryland.", "source": {"uri": "defense.gov", "dataType": "news", "title": "U.S. Department of

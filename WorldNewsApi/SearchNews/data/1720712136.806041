In 2023, there was an incident involving a knife on average more than once a week, Avon and Somerset Police figures suggest. Two teenagers, Max Dixon, 16, and Mason Rist, 15, died from stab wounds when they were attacked by a number of people in Ilminster Avenue in Knowle West in January. Since then, there has been growing concerns about the amount of knife crime in east Bristol. Hubert Brown, 61, from Easton, died from a stab wound when he was attacked in St Pauls in October 2023. In March, two men were injured in Riverside Park in Easton. A 30-year-old man also died in March after he was stabbed in St Pauls. In February, 16-year-old Darrian Williams was fatally stabbed in Rawnsley Park, Easton.

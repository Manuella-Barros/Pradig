Her comments to state news agency RIA followed a statement from Russian president Vladimir Putin yesterday that the country could make adjustments to its nuclear doctrine. \u201cWe did not stop any dialogue with anyone. We did not cut ties. We did not, by the way, cut energy ties. We did not cut off dialogue platforms,\u201d Zakharova said. \u201cWe have always declared that even in the most difficult situations there is room for dialogue \u2026 Therefore, there is no sense in calling us to dialogue, we have never refused it.\u201d This outlined a policy shift aimed at pressing Moscow and Beijing to reverse rejections of US calls for arsenal limitation talks. Putin, in his speech yesterday, said that he did not rule out changes to Russia\u2019s nuclear doctrine, which sets out the conditions under which such weapons could be used. If necessary, Putin said, Russia could test a nuclear weapon, adding that he saw no need to do so at the present time. Since Putin ordered troops into Ukraine in February 2022, he has said on several occasions that Russia would use such weapons if necessary to defend itself \u2015 comments the West says are nuclear sabre-rattling. \u201cYesterday the president said everything. There is a nuclear doctrine. If there is a need to adjust it, adjustments will be made,\u201d Zakharova said.", "summary": "<p>MOSCOW \u2015 Russia will keep dialogue lines open with nuclear powers, but will respond accordingly if the United States deploys more strategic nuclear weapons, foreign ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said on Saturday.

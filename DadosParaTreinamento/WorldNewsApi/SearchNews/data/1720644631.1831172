TMC MP Derek O'Brien has been elected as the leader of party in Rajya Sabha, while Sagarika Ghose, a prominent party leader, will take on the responsibility of Deputy leader. Nadimul Haque has been designated as the Chief Whip in the upper house, as announced by the Trinamool Congress.After the party meet, TMC chief Mamata Banerjee said the Citizenship Amendment Act has to be revoked and that her party will raise the demand in Parliament. \"PM Modi's intention was two get two-third majority in Lok Sabha elections 2024. However, they (BJP) didn't even cross the majority mark. They are nowhere near to that number (272 seats). How will they amend the Constitution without two-third majority? Last time, they had passed bills without discussions but won't be able to do it this time,\" she said.The West Bengal chief minister also took several jibes at the NDA government, stating that the \"country needs change\".\"We are keeping a watch on the situation let's see how long this NDA government lasts ... Today INDIA bloc may not have staked claim to form government, that doesn't mean it won't tomorrow,\" the CM said, adding that the mandate was against the BJP and that \"Narendra Modi should not become PM\".She added that her party will observe the situation closely and would be pleased if the \"weak and unstable\" BJP-led NDA government is removed from power.\"The country needs change; the country wants change. This mandate was for change. We are waiting and keeping a watch on the situation. This mandate was against Narendra Modi, so he should not become the prime minister this time. Someone else should have been allowed to take over,\" she said after a meeting with newly-elected TMC MPs.Banerjee also announced that the Trinamool Congress will not participate in the swearing-in ceremony of the new government. She criticized the BJP for forming the government in an undemocratic and illegal manner. However, she remained optimistic about the future prospects of the INDIA bloc, saying, \"Let's wait for some time.\"", "summary": "Mamata Banerjee has been elected as All India Trinamool Congress Parliamentary Party Chairperson with Sudip Bandyopadhyay leading in Lok Sabha and Derek O'Brien in Rajya Sabha.

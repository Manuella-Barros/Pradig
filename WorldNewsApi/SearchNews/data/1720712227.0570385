{"id": 231968346, "title": "Uzbekistan to allocate subsidies and compensation for labor migrants", "text": "The Ministry of Poverty Alleviation and Employment of Uzbekistan has published a draft order on approval of the regulation on the procedure for allocating subsidies and compensation to labor migrants. This order outlines the financial support mechanisms for Uzbek citizens engaged in temporary labor activities abroad, following the President's decision on April 4, 2024, which aimed at enhancing labor migration processes and providing additional support to temporary labor migrants. The order specifies the procedures for allocating subsidies and compensation to Uzbek citizens registered in the \"Work Abroad\" labor migration electronic software complex. The subsidies and compensation are designed to cover various expenses related to labor migration, including foreign language and professional qualification exams, work visa issuance, and travel expenses. To cover expenses related to passing exams, provided they are successfully passed and a certificate is obtained, citizens can receive up up to UZS 1.02 mn ($80). For expenses related to issuing a work visa for working abroad UZS 1.7 mn ($133) can be provided. The order also includes provisions for health and life insurance coverage for citizens recognized as low-income families through the \"Unified Register of Social Protection\" information system or those included in the \"Iron Register,\" \"Women's Register,\" or \"Youth Register.\" These citizens, going on organized labor migration, will have their health and life insurance premiums covered, as well as other associated risks. Applications for subsidies or compensation may be rejected under certain conditions. These include if the citizen does not have the status of \"person employed abroad\" in the \"Work Abroad\" electronic software complex, if the labor migration was not organized through an agency or licensed private employment agencies, if the applicant is not recognized as a low-income family through the \"Unified Register of Social Protection\" or is not included in one of the designated registers, if the insurance risks are not fully formalized, or if the application is submitted more than once for each insured citizen within a 12-month period. If an application is rejected, the citizen can re-apply after addressing the deficiencies. The Foreign Labor Migration Agency has sent 70,000 people to developed countries over the past two years. In the first quarter of 2024, 58,000 people returned from labor migration, with another 57,000 returning in April. It is anticipated that 250,000-300,000 more will return by the end of the year. The government has assigned tasks to ensure the employment of these returning citizens.", "summary": "<a href=\"https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiY2h0dHBzOi8vZGFyeW8udXovZW4vMjAyNC8wNi8wOS91emJla2lzdGFuLXRvLWFsbG9jYXRlLXN1YnNpZGllcy1hbmQtY29tcGVuc2F0aW9uLWZvci1sYWJvci1taWdyYW50c9IBAA?oc=5\" target=\"_blank\">Uzbekistan to allocate subsidies and compensation for labor migrants</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<font color=\"#6f6f6f\">DARYO.UZ - CENTRAL ASIA & AFGHANISTAN NEWS</font>", "url": "https://daryo.uz/en/2024/06/09/uzbekistan-to-allocate-subsidies-and-compensation-for-labor-migrants", "image": "https://daryo.uz/static/2024/06/medium-6665a78ad8dc0.jpeg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-09 13:02:36", "author": "Daryo.uz", "authors": ["Daryo.uz"], "language": "en", "catgory": "politics", "source_country": "uz", "sentiment": -0.37}

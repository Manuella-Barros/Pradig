The leaders both used those engagements used to underscore the urgent need to support Kyiv's fight against Russia's invasion.But Macron and Biden have often chafed at the pace of support for Ukraine, especially as the United States, by far the largest contributor to Kyiv's defense, was forced to pause aid shipments for months while congressional Republicans held up an assistance package.The state visit began with a ceremony at the Arc de Triomphe, including a wreath-laying at France's tomb of the unknown soldier, and a military parade along the Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es leading to the \u00c9lys\u00e9e Palace, where the two held official meetings and delivered public statements. Later, there is a state dinner at the palace for Biden and his wife, Jill.Also read | Biden will link fight for Ukraine with allied effort on D-DayBiden and Macron put the war in Ukraine at the top of Saturday\u2019s agenda, but it was the strength of the countries' long alliance, fortified at Normandy 80 years ago but with roots far deeper, that was the centerpiece of the weekend.Calling himself a student of French history, Biden said the visit was a \u201cgreat honor\u201d and he noted that America\u2019s ties to France date to the Revolutionary War.\u201cFrance was our first friend,\u201d Biden said. \u201cIt remains one of our best friends.\u201dMacron praised Biden as not just the leader of a world power but also for bringing the \"clarity and loyalty of a partner that loves and respects the Europeans.\u201dIt appeared to be a subtle criticism of former President Donald Trump, whose \u201cAmerica First\u201d foreign policy has shaken European leaders. They are now contending, gingerly, with the possibility of his return to power next year should the presumptive Republican nominee defeat the Democratic incumbent in November's election.Macron hosted Trump for Bastille Day in 2017, and the French president came to Washington for a state visit in 2018 before their relationship soured.Despite disagreements over whether to send allies trainers onto Ukrainian soil to support the country's defense against Russia's invasion, Macron insisted that, \u201cI think we see eye to eye on this war raging in Ukraine. He tempered his previous concerns about US commitment to Europe \u2014 which he has used to argue that the continent must do more to provide for its own defense \u2014 to praise Biden's leadership: \u201cThank you for being at Europe\u2019s side.\u201dMacron expressed hope that when the Group of Seven leaders meet this coming week in Italy they will agree to a $50 billion \u201csolidarity fund\u201d for Ukraine that will be backed by sanctioned Russian assets.The two leaders also celebrated the rescue Saturday by Israeli forces of four hostages taken by Hamas. \u201cWe won\u2019t stop working until all the hostages come home and a cease-fire is reached,\" Biden said as Macron called out the Israeli government for not doing more to get humanitarian assistance into Gaza.Macron said he supported a Biden-promoted cease-fire proposal that would allow a surge of humanitarian assistance into the territory and allow for the release of more hostages. The US has said it is awaiting Hamas' formal response to the potential deal.The French leader raised the issue of US trade practices that he has often criticized, including the Inflation Reduction Act, which favors American-made climate technology such as electric vehicles. Macron said the US, like China, has \u201cdecided not to respect the rules of global trade\u201d by shoring up protections and subsidies while Europe\u2019s industry remains open and is stuck in overregulation.As the pair met outside the palace, Biden appeared to suggest to his host that that the US and Europe could \u201ccoordinate together,\u201d and he was heard telling Macron about his most recent conversation with Chinese President Xi Jinping, who was objecting to steep US tariffs on Chinese electric vehicles.Biden hosted Macron in December 2022 at the White House for the first state visit of his presidency as the COVID-19 pandemic receded.As the president's trip draws to a close, the far right is likely to emerge as one of the biggest winners in Sunday's European Parliament election while Macron\u2019s pro-European Union movement is flagging.", "summary": "", "url": "https://indianexpress.com/article/world/biden-france-first-friend-ally-macron-us-france-state-visit-9380477/", "image": "https://images.indianexpress.com/2024/06/Biden-Macron-.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-08 17:25:34", "author": null, "language": "en", "catgory": "politics", "source_country": "in", "sentiment": 0.624}

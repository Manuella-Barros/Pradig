TMC didn\u2019t attend the swearing-in ceremony.Echoing CM Mamata Banerjee\u2019s earlier comments, TMC also said that it doubted whether the NDA govt would last more than a fortnight. Kolkata mayor Firhad Hakim labelled the swearing-in \u201ctemporary\u201d.\u201cThis has been a mandate against BJP and PM Narendra Modi,\u201d a senior Trinamool MP said on Sunday, adding, \u201cINDIA bloc partners like SP, Sena (UBT) and AAP also did not attend the swearing-in-ceremony.\u201d The MP also said that the formal invites to Trinamool reached the party\u2019s New Delhi office as late as on Sunday, around 12.45 pm. \u201cToday being a Sunday, there was no one at the office,\u201d the MP added.Responding to BJP\u2019s comment that Trinamool skipping the ceremony was \u201cdiscourteous\u201d, the MP said: \u201cBJP should be the last party speaking on political courtesies.\u201d He added: \u201cPM Narendra Modi led a deeply divisive campaign in the 2024 polls, a campaign marked by hatred. This has been rejected by people. Even if this govt lasts, it will face its biggest challenge in the winter of 2024 when Maharashtra goes to polls (for its state assembly).\u201d\u201cThe INDIA bloc is being proactive. We are not merely sitting in the lobby, but we are actively pacing in the lobby,\u201d he went on to add.Meanwhile, TMC MPs flew down to New Delhi on Sunday and received their Parliament ID cards.TMC\u2019s LS leader Sudip Bandyopadhyay on Sunday rubbished comparisons between Modi and former PM Jawaharlal Nehru, saying that while Modi might be taking oath for a third term, he didn\u2019t have Nehru\u2019s mandate. Nehru was sworn in as the PM for the third time in 1962, when Congress won 361 seats, 10 down from the Lok Sabha polls of 1957.Bandyopadhyay also said the opposition would play a positive role in the functioning of Parliament.", "summary": "", "url": "https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/half-pant-ministers-tmc-as-bengal-gets-only-2-minister-of-state/articleshow/110851510.cms", "image": "https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/resizemode-4,width-1280,height-720,msid-110851585/110851585.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-09 16:58:13", "author": "TNN & Agencies", "authors": ["TNN & Agencies"], "language": "en", "catgory": "politics", "source_country": "IN", "sentiment": -0.494}

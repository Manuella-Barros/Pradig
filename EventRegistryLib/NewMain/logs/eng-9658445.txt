Nvidia, long known in the niche gaming community for its graphics chips, is now the most valuable public company in the world.\n\nChipmaker Nvidia's share price climbed 3.6% on Tuesday, lifting the company's market cap to $3.34 trillion, surpassing Microsoft. Nvidia is now valued at $3.32 trillion. Earlier this month, Nvidia hit $3 trillion for the first time, and surpassed Apple.\n\nNvidia most valuable company\n\nNvidia has about 80% of the market for AI chips used in data centers, a business that's ballooned as OpenAI, Microsoft, Alphabet, Amazon, Meta and others have raced to snap up the processors needed to build AI models and run increasingly large workloads.\n\nFounded in 1991, Nvidia spent its first few decades primarily as a hardware company that sold chips for gamers to run 3D titles. It's also dabbled in cryptocurrency mining chips and cloud gaming subscriptions.\n\nNvidia revenue\n\nFor the most recent quarter, revenue in Nvidia's data center business rose 427% from a year earlier to $22.6 billion, accounting for about 86% of the chipmaker's total sales.\n\nBut over the past two years, Nvidia shares have skyrocketed as Wall Street came to recognize the company's technology as the engine behind an explosion in AI that shows no signs of slowing. The rally has lifted co-founder and CEO Jensen Huang's net worth to about $117 billion, making him the 11th wealthiest person in the world, according to Forbes.\n\nMicrosoft and Nvidia\n\nMicrosoft shares are up about 20% so far this year. The software giant has also been a major beneficiary of the AI boom, after it took a significant stake in OpenAI and integrated the startup's AI models into its most important products, including Office and Windows. Microsoft is one of the biggest buyers of Nvidia's graphics processing units (GPUs) for its Azure cloud service. The company just released a new generation of laptops that are designed to run its AI models, called Copilot+.\n\nRapid rise of Nvidia\n\nNvidia is a newcomer to the title of most valuable U.S. company. For the past few years, Apple and Microsoft have been trading the title.\n\nNvidia's ascent has been so rapid that the company has yet to be added to the Dow Jones Industrial Average, the stock benchmark of 30 of the most valuable U.S. companies. Alongside its earnings release last month, Nvidia announced a 10-for-1 stock split, which went into effect on June 7.\n\nThe split gives Nvidia a better shot at being added to the Dow, which is a price-weighted index, meaning that companies with higher stock prices rather than market caps have outsized influence on the benchmark.\n\nStock update\n\nNvidia share price is up more than 170% so far this year, and went a leg higher after the company reported first-quarter earnings in May. Nvidia share price has multiplied by more than nine times since the end of 2022, a rise that's coincided with the emergence of generative artificial intelligence.\n\nApple shares fell 1.1% on Tuesday, giving the iPhone maker a $3.29 trillion market value.", "source": {"uri": "industryleadersmagazine.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Industry Leaders Magazine"}, "authors": [{"uri": "mia_garcia@industryleadersmagazine.com", "name": "Mia Garcia", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nvidia", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nvidia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_center", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Data center"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphics_processing_unit", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Graphics processing unit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta_Platforms", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Meta Platforms"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenAI", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "OpenAI"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alphabet_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Alphabet Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_(company)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Amazon (company)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_company", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Public company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_capitalization", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Market capitalization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_gaming", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cloud gaming"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptocurrency", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cryptocurrency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3D_computer_graphics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "3D computer graphics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forbes", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Forbes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wall_Street", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Wall Street"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Software"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Generative artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Azure", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft Azure"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock_split", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Stock split"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benchmark_(computing)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Benchmark (computing)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_value", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Market value"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_computing", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cloud computing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPhone", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "IPhone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laptop", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Laptop"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks_and_Bonds", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks and Bonds", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Major_Companies", "label": "dmoz/Business/Major Companies", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Anti-Corporation", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Anti-Corporation", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Information_Technology/Marketing_and_Advertising", "label": "dmoz/Business/Information Technology/Marketing and Advertising", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 53}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 47}], "image": "https://www.industryleadersmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Nvidias-Market-Cap-Soars-Becomes-Worlds-Most-Valuable-Company.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9658445", "eventUri": "eng-9658445", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-07", "textStart": 2519, "textEnd": 2525}], "sentiment": 0.3411764705882352, "wgt": 211, "relevance": 1}

This milestone comes just two weeks after Nvidia surpassed Apple to secure the second-most valuable company position.\n\nOn Tuesday, Nvidia's shares surged by 3.6%, pushing its market cap to an impressive $3.34 trillion. This leap allowed Nvidia to surpass Microsoft, now valued at $3.32 trillion. Earlier this month, Nvidia achieved a market value of $3 trillion for the first time, overtaking Apple. In contrast, Apple's shares dipped by 1.1% on Tuesday, reducing the iPhone maker's market value to $3.29 trillion.\n\nThis achievement highlights the increasing demand and influence of artificial intelligence (AI). Nvidia controls about 80% of the AI chip market for data centers, a sector that has expanded rapidly as companies like OpenAI, Microsoft, Alphabet, Amazon, and Meta scramble to acquire the necessary processors to build AI models and manage growing workloads.\n\nIn the latest quarter, Nvidia's data center revenue soared by 427% from the previous year, reaching $22.6 billion. This segment now represents approximately 86% of Nvidia's total sales, according to a report from CNBC.\n\nNvidia's rise to the top is a relatively recent phenomenon. For years, Apple and Microsoft have alternated as the most valuable U.S. company. Nvidia's rapid ascent has been so swift that it hasn't yet been included in the Dow Jones Industrial Average, the index of 30 of the most valuable U.S. companies. Last month, Nvidia announced a 10-for-1 stock split, which took effect on June 7.\n\nDespite Nvidia's impressive gains, Microsoft shares have also seen a 20% increase this year. The tech giant has benefited significantly from the AI boom, thanks to its substantial investment in OpenAI and the integration of AI models into key products like Office and Windows. Microsoft is one of Nvidia's largest customers, utilizing its GPUs for its Azure cloud service and releasing a new generation of AI-optimized laptops called Copilot+.\n\nThe Secret to Nvidia's Success\n\nWhat drives Nvidia's extraordinary growth? The surging demand for generative AI tools like ChatGPT has played a crucial role. Nvidia's advanced chip technology has positioned it at the forefront of the AI industry, which is poised to have a profound impact on the future.\n\nNvidia's GPUs are essential for running generative AI platforms such as OpenAI's ChatGPT and Google's Bard. While Nvidia has long dominated the discrete GPU market, primarily associated with high-performance gaming, its GPUs are now crucial in AI and machine learning.\n\nThe success of ChatGPT has caught the attention of major tech companies like Alphabet and Microsoft, who are now leveraging the potential of generative AI. These sophisticated systems can engage in human-like conversations and create various content, ranging from jokes to poetry.\n\nA Legacy of Innovation\n\nFounded in 1991 by CEO Jensen Huang, Chris Malachowsky, and Curtis Priem, Nvidia has a rich history of GPU design and manufacturing innovation. Initially focused on gaming, Nvidia has broadened its scope to make significant advancements in artificial intelligence. The company's contributions to AI and the gaming industry have established it as a tech powerhouse.\n\nFor many years, Nvidia primarily sold chips for gamers to run 3D titles. It also ventured into cryptocurrency mining chips and cloud gaming subscriptions. However, over the past two years, Nvidia's shares have skyrocketed as Wall Street recognized the company's technology as the driving force behind the explosive growth of AI. According to Forbes, this rally has increased co-founder and CEO Jensen Huang's net worth to approximately $117 billion, placing him as the 11th wealthiest person globally.\n\nAs Nvidia continues to innovate and lead the AI chip market, its future looks even brighter.

This dramatic increase was further fueled by the company's robust first-quarter earnings reported in May. The stock has multiplied more than ninefold since the end of 2022, a rise that coincided with the rapid advancement and adoption of generative artificial intelligence (AI).\n\nApple, on the other hand, saw its shares dip by 1.1% on Tuesday, resulting in a market value of $3.29 trillion.\n\nNvidia has captured approximately 80% of the market for AI chips used in data centers, a sector that has expanded rapidly. Major tech companies such as OpenAI, Microsoft, Alphabet, Amazon, and Meta have been acquiring these processors in large quantities to develop AI models and manage increasingly substantial workloads.\n\nFor the most recent quarter, Nvidia's data center revenue skyrocketed by 427% from the previous year, reaching $22.6 billion. This revenue accounts for about 86% of the company's total sales, underscoring its dominance in this critical market segment.\n\nFrom Gaming Hardware to AI Powerhouse\n\nFounded in 1991, Nvidia initially focused on producing hardware, specifically chips for gamers to enhance 3D gaming experiences. The company also explored other ventures such as cryptocurrency mining chips and cloud gaming subscriptions.\n\nHowever, the last two years have seen Nvidia's stock soar as the market recognized the company's critical role in the AI revolution. This surge has significantly boosted the net worth of Nvidia's co-founder and CEO, Jensen Huang, to approximately $117 billion, positioning him as the 11th wealthiest individual globally, according to Forbes.\n\nMicrosoft's AI Integration\n\nMicrosoft has also benefited from the AI boom, with its shares rising by about 20% this year. The software giant has invested heavily in AI, notably by taking a substantial stake in OpenAI and incorporating the startup's AI models into its flagship products like Office and Windows. Microsoft is one of the largest purchasers of Nvidia's graphics processing units (GPUs), which are essential for its Azure cloud service. Recently, Microsoft launched a new generation of laptops designed to run its AI models, branded as Copilot+.\n\nNvidia's Rapid Ascent\n\nNvidia's rapid rise to the top is particularly notable given that it is a newcomer to the title of the most valuable U.S. company. For the past few years, Apple and Microsoft have vied for this position. Nvidia's swift ascent has been so recent that it has not yet been added to the Dow Jones Industrial Average, a stock index comprising 30 of the most valuable U.S. companies.\n\nAlongside its earnings announcement last month, Nvidia declared a 10-for-1 stock split, effective June 7. This stock split enhances Nvidia's prospects of being included in the Dow, which is a price-weighted index, meaning companies with higher stock prices have a greater influence on the benchmark.\n\nBroader Market Impact and Potential Challenges\n\nThe rapid appreciation of Nvidia's stock is a reflection of broader market trends, particularly the growing importance of AI in various sectors. The company's GPUs are not only central to gaming but have become indispensable in fields such as autonomous driving, scientific research, and deep learning. This diverse applicability has positioned Nvidia as a critical supplier in the tech industry's AI revolution.\n\nDespite its remarkable success, Nvidia faces significant challenges.

The chipmaker's market cap surged to $3.341 trillion. While its stock performance has bolstered the S&P 500, analysts caution over potential corrections if demand for AI slows.\n\nNvidia became the world's most valuable company on Tuesday, dethroning tech heavyweight Microsoft as its high-end processors play a central role in a scramble to dominate artificial intelligence technology. Shares of the chipmaker climbed 3.7% to $135.87, lifting its market capitalization to $3.341 trillion, just days after overtaking iPhone maker Apple to become the second most valuable company.\n\nMicrosoft's stock market value was $3.314 trillion as its shares dipped 0.5%. Apple's stock slipped 1.2%, putting its value at $3.280 trillion.\n\nNvidia's stunning surge in market value over the past year has become emblematic of a Wall Street frenzy driven by optimism about emerging AI technology. Nvidia's rally has lifted the S&P 500 and Nasdaq to record highs, some investors worry that unbridled optimism about AI could evaporate if signs emerge of a slowdown in spending on the technology.\n\n\"It's Nvidia's market; we're all just trading in it,\" said Steve Sosnick, chief market strategist at Interactive Brokers. Nvidia has also become by far the most traded company on Wall Street, with daily turnover recently averaging $50 billion, compared to around $10 billion each for Apple, Microsoft and Tesla, according to LSEG data. The chipmaker now accounts for about 16% of all trading in S&P 500 companies.\n\nNvidia's stock has nearly tripled so far this year, compared with a rise of about 19% in Microsoft shares, with demand for its top-of-the-line processors outpacing supply. Tech giants Microsoft, Meta Platforms and Google-owner Alphabet are competing to build out their AI computing capabilities and add the technology to their products and services.\n\nAn insatiable appetite for Nvidia's AI processors, viewed as far superior to competitors' offerings, has left them in tight supply, and many investors view Nvidia as the greatest winner to date from surging AI development. \"Nvidia has been getting a lot of positive attention and has been doing a lot of things very correctly, but a small misstep is likely to cause a major correction in the stock, and investors should be careful,\" said Oliver Pursche, senior vice president at Wealthspire Advisors in New York.\n\nTuesday's gain lifted Nvidia's stock to a record high and added over $100 billion to its market capitalization. The company's market value expanded from $1 trillion to $2 trillion in just nine months in February, while taking just over three months to hit $3 trillion in June.\n\nSince its blowout forecast about a year ago, the company has consistently breezed past Wall Street's lofty expectations for revenue and profit, with demand for its graphics processors far outstripping supply as companies rush to embed AI applications. Nvidia executives said in May that demand for its Blackwell AI chips could exceed supply \"well into next year.\"\n\nSharp increases in analysts' expectations for Nvidia's future earnings have outpaced its stellar stock gains, resulting in a fall in the stock's earnings valuation. Nvidia recently traded at 44 times expected earnings, down from over 84 about a year ago, LSEG data showed.\n\nIncreasing the appeal for its highly valued stock among individual investors, Nvidia last week split its stock 10-for-one.\n\n(This story has not been edited by Devdiscourse staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)", "source": {"uri": "devdiscourse.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Devdiscourse"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S&P_500_Index", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "S&P 500 Index"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nvidia", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nvidia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_capitalization", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Market capitalization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wall_Street", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Wall Street"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_value", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Market value"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPhone", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "IPhone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock_market", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stock market"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta_Platforms", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Meta Platforms"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nasdaq", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nasdaq"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tesla,_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tesla, Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alphabet_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Alphabet Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computing", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Computing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revenue", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Revenue"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valuation_(finance)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Valuation (finance)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_president", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Vice president"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphics_processing_unit", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Graphics processing unit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks_and_Bonds", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks and Bonds", "wgt": 24}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Research_and_Analysis", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Research and Analysis", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Day_Trading", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Day Trading", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Education_and_Training", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Education and Training", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 78}], "image": "https://www.devdiscourse.com/remote.axd?https://devdiscourse.blob.core.windows.net/aiimagegallery/31_05_2024_14_35_16_3178377.png?width=920&format=jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9658445", "eventUri": "eng-9658445", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.388235294117647, "wgt": 202, "relevance": 1}

Earlier this month, Nvidia hit a $3 trillion market cap for the first time, and passed Apple.\n\nNvidia shares are up more than 170% so far this year, and went a leg higher after the company reported first-quarter earnings in May. The stock has multiplied by more than ninefold since the end of 2022, a rise that's coincided with the emergence of generative artificial intelligence.\n\nNvidia has about 80% of the market for AI chips used in data centers, a business that's ballooned as OpenAI, Microsoft, Alphabet, Amazon, Meta and others have raced to snap up the processors needed to build AI models and run increasingly large workloads.\n\nFor the most recent quarter, revenue in Nvidia's data center business rose 427% from a year earlier to $22.6 billion, accounting for about 86% of the chipmaker's total sales.\n\nApple shares were down about 1% during trading on Tuesday, giving it a $3.28 trillion market value. Microsoft shares slid less than a percentage point for a market cap of $3.32 trillion.\n\nFounded in 1991, Nvidia spent its first few decades primarily as a hardware company that sold chips for gamers to run 3D titles. It's also dabbled in cryptocurrency mining chips and cloud gaming subscriptions.\n\nBut over the past two years, Nvidia shares have skyrocketed as Wall Street came to recognize the company's technology as the engine behind an explosion in AI that shows no signs of slowing. The rally has lifted co-founder and CEO Jensen Huang's net worth to about $117 billion, making him the 11th wealthiest person in the world, according to Forbes.\n\nMicrosoft shares are up about 20% so far this year. The software giant has also been a major beneficiary of the AI boom, after it took a significant stake in OpenAI and integrated the startup's AI models into its most important products, including Office and Windows. Microsoft is one of the biggest buyers of Nvidia's graphics processing units (GPUs) for its Azure cloud service. The company just released a new generation of laptops that are designed to run its AI models, called Copilot+.\n\nNvidia is a newcomer to the title of most valuable U.S. company. For the past few years, Apple and Microsoft have been trading the title.\n\nNvidia's ascent has been so rapid that the company has yet to be added to the Dow Jones Industrial Average, the stock benchmark of 30 of the most valuable U.S. companies. Alongside its earnings release last month, Nvidia announced a 10-for-1 stock split, which went into effect on June 7.\n\nThe split gives Nvidia a better shot at being added to the Dow, which is a price-weighted index, meaning that companies with higher stock prices -- rather than market caps -- have outsized influence on the benchmark.", "source": {"uri": "nbcchicago.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NBC Chicago"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nvidia", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nvidia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_capitalization", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Market capitalization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Generative artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_center", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Data center"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenAI", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "OpenAI"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_company", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Public company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphics_processing_unit", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Graphics processing unit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta_Platforms", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Meta Platforms"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alphabet_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Alphabet Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_gaming", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cloud gaming"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_(company)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Amazon (company)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptocurrency", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cryptocurrency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3D_computer_graphics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "3D computer graphics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_value", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Market value"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wall_Street", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Wall Street"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Azure", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft Azure"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock_split", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Stock split"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benchmark_(computing)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Benchmark (computing)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_computing", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cloud computing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forbes", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Forbes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laptop", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Laptop"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Windows", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft Windows"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dow_Jones_Industrial_Average", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dow Jones Industrial Average"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Software"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks_and_Bonds", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks and Bonds", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Marketing_and_Advertising", "label": "dmoz/Business/Marketing and Advertising", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Marketing_and_Advertising/Consulting", "label": "dmoz/Business/Marketing and Advertising/Consulting", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Information_Technology/Marketing_and_Advertising", "label": "dmoz/Business/Information Technology/Marketing and Advertising", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 63}], "image": "https://media.nbcchicago.com/2024/06/107424719-17176127832024-06-04t091759z_144177173_rc2748aozrse_rtrmadp_0_taiwan-computex.jpeg?quality=85&strip=all&resize=1200%2C675", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9658445", "eventUri": "eng-9658445", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-07", "textStart": 2846, "textEnd": 2852}], "sentiment": 0.3490196078431373, "wgt": 199, "relevance": 1}

Nvidia commands more than 80% of the market share for AI chips, making it a major winner from surging AI development. Since its blowout forecast about a year ago, the company has consistently breezed past Wall Street's lofty expectations for revenue and profit, with demand for its graphics processors far outstripping supply as companies rush to embed AI applications.\n\nNvidia executives said in May that demand for its Blackwell AI chips could exceed supply \"well into next year.\" Increasing the appeal for its highly valued stock among individual investors, Nvidia recently split its stock 10-for-one, effective June 7. \"A stock split can reduce the price per share, making it more affordable for individual investors to buy. With Nvidia doing a 10:1 stock split, retail investors are the real winners here,\" said Sam North, market analyst at investment platform eToro.\n\nThe company's market value expanded from $1 trillion to $2 trillion in just nine months in February, while taking just over three months to hit $3 trillion in June. Sharp increases in analysts' expectations for Nvidia's future earnings have outpaced its stellar stock gains, resulting in a fall in the stock's earnings valuation.\n\nNvidia is trading at 44 times expected earnings, down from over 84 times expected earnings about a year ago, LSEG data showed.\n\n(This story has not been edited by Devdiscourse staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)", "source": {"uri": "devdiscourse.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Devdiscourse"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nvidia", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nvidia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_value", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Market value"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPhone", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "IPhone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_capitalization", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Market capitalization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta_Platforms", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Meta Platforms"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alphabet_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Alphabet Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computing", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Computing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wall_Street", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Wall Street"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_share", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Market share"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock_market", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Stock market"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EToro", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "EToro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock_split", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Stock split"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valuation_(finance)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Valuation (finance)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphics_processing_unit", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Graphics processing unit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Investor", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Investor"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks_and_Bonds", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks and Bonds", "wgt": 28}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Research_and_Analysis", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Research and Analysis", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Education_and_Training", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Education and Training", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Games", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Games", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 91}], "image": "https://www.devdiscourse.com/remote.axd?https://devdiscourse.blob.core.windows.net/aiimagegallery/31_05_2024_14_35_16_3178377.png?width=920&format=jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9658445", "eventUri": "eng-9658445", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-07", "textStart": 1908, "textEnd": 1914}], "sentiment": 0.4588235294117646, "wgt": 199, "relevance": 1}

Success is driven by demand for GPUs in AI systems as well as a recent 10-for-1 stock split. Forecasts predict Nvidia's value could reach $10 trillion by 2030.\n\npocketlint video of the day\n\nSCROLL TO CONTINUE WITH CONTENT\n\nMove over Microsoft and Apple, there's a new company at the top of the pile. On June 18, Nvidia's stock rose by 4%, taking its market cap beyond that of Microsoft, and making the chip manufacturer the most valuable company on the planet.\n\nNvidia snuck past Apple into second place on this list earlier this month and has now claimed the top spot. Nvidia hit a market cap of $3.335 trillion, surpassing the $3.326 trillion of Microsoft.\n\nRelated\n\nNvidia RTX 40-series Super GPUs: Specs, availability, and performance\n\nNvidia's 40-series Super GPUs promise improved performance and, in one case, a big price cut. Here's everything we know about them.\n\nWhat's fueling Nvidia's growth?\n\nFocus on AI chips is paying off\n\nNvidia\n\nThere are a couple of reasons why Nvidia has seen its stock price soar in recent months. The first is that the demand for the firm's processors is exceeding supply.\n\nNvidia was founded as a company that wanted to bring 3D graphics to the gaming market. It developed the graphics processing unit (GPU) which is a dedicated chip that handles the intensive calculations needed for rendering graphics. However, in recent years, GPUs have proved highly capable for other uses, including crypto mining.\n\nNvidia recognized that GPUs were also going to be in demand for the complex calculations needed to power machine learning and AI models. Nvidia is now the leading manufacturer of the powerful GPUs that are used to power AI systems such as ChatGPT. The enormous rise in popularity of AI chatbots has seen a huge surge in demand for these chips.\n\nNvidia is now the leading manufacturer of the powerful GPUs that are needed to power AI systems such as ChatGPT.\n\nNvidia also recently carried out a 10-for-1 stock split, which helped boost its value even further. A stock split is when a company increases the number of its shares to bring down the price of a single share, making it a more affordable investment. After this split, someone who held a single share worth $1000 would now own ten shares, each worth $100. This has made the stock more attractive to individual investors, boosting the value of the company even further.\n\nNvidia's growth shows no sign of slowing down\n\nDemand for AI chips is only going to grow\n\nPocket-lint\n\nCurrently, it doesn't look like Nvidia will be slowing down any time soon. The company's value only passed $2 trillion in February and is already well on its way to doubling that. With demand for AI chips continuing to increase, the company's stock is likely to soar even further.\n\nAnalyst Beth Kindig predicted in 2021 that Nvidia would overtake Apple's valuation within five years. After the chip maker managed that in less than four years, she's now predicting that Nvidia stock could reach a market cap of $10 trillion by 2030. To put it into perspective, that would make Nvidia three times as valuable as Microsoft and Apple are currently.\n\nNot everyone is in agreement, however. Some analysts point to longer term drops in the Nvidia share price after previous stock splits, with others speculating that the AI boom could be another dot-com bubble that could come crashing down. Even if AI continues to grow, the valuations of these companies may still be overblown, and may end up falling significantly.

Is it Too Late to Invest? | The Motley Fool", "body": "Nvidia's dominance in the artificial intelligence (AI) chip market has helped earnings soar.\n\nNvidia's (NVDA 3.51%) recent stock split lowered the price of each individual share after the high-flying stock reached beyond $1,000 and ever since that split a little more than a week ago, the shares have advanced about 12%. This momentum has helped the chip designer reach an enormous milestone. Nvidia just passed Microsoft to become the world's most valuable company with a market value topping $3.33 trillion as of market close on Tuesday -- that's compared to the rival software giant's $3.31 trillion market capitalization.\n\nThere's been a good reason for Nvidia's standout performance in recent times: its dominance in the billion-dollar artificial intelligence (AI) chip market. The company holds an 80% share and this has helped earnings -- and clearly share price -- to soar. After the enormous gain, and as Nvidia steps ahead of Microsoft, the question now is: Is it too late to invest in this AI chip giant? Let's find out.\n\nNvidia's graphics processing units (GPUs) once were best known for powering video games and this helped Nvidia remain financially successful over time. But the AI boom marked a turning point for the company as potential customers realized how particularly well-suited Nvidia's GPUs were to crucial AI tasks. This is thanks to the GPU's ability to process many jobs simultaneously, making this chip ideal for things like the training and inferencing of AI models.\n\nBut Nvidia hasn't stopped with the GPU and instead created a broad range of products and services -- such as enterprise software -- to support AI customers along the development path. And this has resulted in triple-digit increases in revenue and profit in recent quarters. For example, in the past quarter, Nvidia's revenue reached a new record high of $26 billion -- and revenue linked to AI customers made up a whopping 86% percent of that.\n\nAs mentioned above, all of this boosted the stock price and prompted Nvidia to announce a 10-for-1 stock split. The goal? To bring the stock to a level that would make it easier for employees and investors to access it. From the announcement in late May to the actual operation earlier this month, Nvidia shares climbed nearly 30%, and they've continued to add to gains.\n\nNow, let's return to our question. Since Nvidia has climbed to a value above technology powerhouse Microsoft's, is it too late to get in on the stock? A look at valuation shows us that Nvidia is considerably more expensive than it was only a month ago. Today, the stock trades for more than 51x forward earnings estimates compared with about 30 in May.\n\nSo does this mean you should hold off on buying this skyrocketing stock? Not necessarily. Yes, Nvidia is more expensive than it was a few weeks ago, but the stock is worth the premium for two reasons: its current leadership in the high-growth AI chip market, and most importantly, the steps it's taking to remain in that position.\n\nNvidia has committed to updating its GPUs annually, recently saying that after the launch of its new Blackwell architecture and chip later this year, \"other Blackwells\" will follow. This means that even if rivals release new chips, Nvidia, already in the lead, should remain ahead in terms of product performance.\n\nOn top of this, it's important to remember two other things. First, Nvidia already has secured its reputation as an expert in the AI chip market, and demand for its products and services is surpassing supply -- so it's already in a position of strength. And the innovation I just mentioned could keep this going. Second, the AI growth story is in its early days, with today's $200 billion AI market expected to reach more than $1 trillion by the end of the decade. As a result, Nvidia's AI growth may have a lot farther to go.\n\nAll of this means that today, even with Nvidia soaring past Microsoft, the investment opportunity is far from over -- and Nvidia still is a top stock to buy and hold for the long term.", "source": {"uri": "fool.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Motley Fool"}, "authors": [{"uri": "adria_cimino@fool.com", "name": "Adria Cimino", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nvidia", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nvidia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphics_processing_unit", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Graphics processing unit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock_split", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Stock split"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Software"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Share_price", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Share price"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_value", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Market value"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_capitalization", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Market capitalization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_game", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Video game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valuation_(finance)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Valuation (finance)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks_and_Bonds", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks and Bonds", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Research_and_Analysis", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Research and Analysis", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Education_and_Training", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Education and Training", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence/Games", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence/Games", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 81}], "image": "https://g.foolcdn.com/editorial/images/781023/gettyimages-171351254.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9658445", "eventUri": "eng-9658445", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.4823529411764707, "wgt": 196, "relevance": 1}

With that, it finally overtook Microsoft, whose stock fell 0.5% today, leaving it with a market cap of $3.32 trillion.\n\nThe new milestone comes just days after Nvidia's market cap topped $3 trillion for the first time, lifting it above Apple Inc.\n\nNvidia's stock has been on a seemingly unstoppable rise lately, gaining more than 170% in the year to date. After reporting a blowout first quarter earnings call in May, the stock soared above the $1,000 mark for the first time in the company's history. That prompted the chipmaker to announce a 10-for-1 forward stock split that went into effect earlier this month. The stock has continued making gains since then, and with the split, its shares were priced at $135.38 at the market close today.\n\nThe rise of Nvidia has coincided with the explosion of interest in generative artificial technology. Nvidia commands an 80% share of the market for AI chips used in data centers, and that industry has mushroomed as hyperscale data center operators like Microsoft, Google Cloud, Amazon Web Services Inc. and Meta Platforms Inc. race to buy up the powerful graphics processing units they need to power their AI workloads.\n\nAll told, Nvidia's stock has multiplied by more than ninefold since the generative AI era kicked off in late 2022 with the launch of OpenAI's ChatGPT. The company's pricey chips are widely seen as essential for developing and training large language models such as ChatGPT, and running AI applications. In its most recent financial report, Nvidia said its data center revenue topped $22.6 billion, up by a stunning 427% from a year earlier, accounting for 86% of its total sales.\n\nNvidia has become synonymous with the generative AI industry and its stock is seen as a yardstick to gauge the strength of that market. With its massive gains, Nvidia's chief executive Jensen Huang has seen his net worth explode, and Forbes says his net worth of $117 billion makes him the 11th wealthiest person in the world.\n\nPrior to the rise of generative AI, Nvidia's GPUs mostly powered expensive graphics cards for use in the gaming industry. Its GPUs are also widely used by cryptocurrency miners.\n\nMicrosoft has also benefited from the growth of AI, albeit not to the same extent as Nvidia has. Its stock is up about 20% in the year to date, thanks in part to its decision to become the most important backer of OpenAI. The company has invested billions of dollars into the most prominent AI model maker, and that close association has enabled it to emerge at the forefront of the generative AI revolution. It has integrated OpenAI's models into several of its most important products, including its Windows operating system and the Office productivity suite. The company is also one of Nvidia's biggest customers, snapping up thousands of GPUs for the Azure cloud computing service.\n\nNvidia has never been rated as the world's most valuable company before. In the last few years, that crown has been exclusively traded between Microsoft and Apple. But neither company has been able to match the meteoric rise of the chipmaker. In the case of Apple, its stock is up just 16% in the year to date. It ended the day as the world's third-richest company, behind Microsoft, after its stock fell 1.1% today, leaving it with a market cap of $3.29 trillion.", "source": {"uri": "siliconangle.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "SiliconANGLE"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nvidia", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nvidia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_capitalization", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Market capitalization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_center", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Data center"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Generative artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ChatGPT", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "ChatGPT"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_company", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Public company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphics_processing_unit", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Graphics processing unit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large_language_model", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Large language model"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta_Platforms", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Meta Platforms"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenAI", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "OpenAI"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_model", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Generative model"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Applications_of_artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Applications of artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Cloud_Platform", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Google Cloud Platform"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_Web_Services", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Amazon Web Services"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphics_card", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Graphics card"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Azure", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft Azure"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jensen_Huang", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jensen Huang"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptocurrency", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cryptocurrency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Productivity", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Productivity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_computing", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cloud computing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forbes", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Forbes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Windows", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft Windows"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks_and_Bonds", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks and Bonds", "wgt": 25}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Research_and_Analysis", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Research and Analysis", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Day_Trading", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Day Trading", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Education_and_Training", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Education and Training", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 83}], "image": "https://d15shllkswkct0.cloudfront.net/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2024/03/nvidiaparalelllogo.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9658445", "eventUri": "eng-9658445", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3803921568627451, "wgt": 194, "relevance": 1}

This achievement follows its recent overtaking of Apple to become the second most valuable company.\n\nThe company, once primarily focused on producing video game chips, has now evolved into a global powerhouse in the technology industry. Its profits have significantly increased due to the growing demand for artificial intelligence technology, leading major companies to turn to Nvidia for their products that form the foundation of AI systems.\n\nNvidia's remarkable growth has outpaced industry giants like Google and Apple, sparking a wave of investment and market speculation. The stock has surged by 173% this year, far exceeding the 19% increase in Microsoft shares. The high demand for Nvidia's top-tier processors has caused a supply shortage, further driving up the stock price.\n\nIn response to the soaring stock price, Nvidia recently implemented a 10-for-one stock split, effective on June 7th. This move aims to make the stock more accessible to individual investors by reducing the price per share. Market analysts, such as Sam North from eToro, believe that the stock split benefits retail investors, making it easier for them to purchase Nvidia shares.\n\nNvidia's chips are integral to various AI tools in the industry, including OpenAI's ChatGPT chatbot. The company's increasing stock price and influence have turned its earnings reports and announcements into highly anticipated events for investors in Silicon Valley. The growing demand for Nvidia's chips has driven the price per unit to around $30,000, leading to a surge in revenue for the company.\n\nCEO Jensen Huang, at 61 years old, has seen his net worth skyrocket by $93 billion over the past year and a half, making him one of the world's wealthiest individuals with a total worth exceeding $100 billion. Nvidia's market value has expanded from $1 trillion to $2 trillion in just nine months, reaching $3 trillion in June in a little over three months.\n\nAs Nvidia continues to lead the market with its advancements in artificial intelligence, the company's exceptional growth trajectory and innovation show no signs of slowing down. Investors and industry experts are closely watching as Nvidia cements its position as a key player in the future of technology.", "source": {"uri": "usanews.net", "dataType": "news", "title": "USANews Press Release Network"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nvidia", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nvidia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock_split", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stock split"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_value", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Market value"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_game", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Video game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_capitalization", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Market capitalization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EToro", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "EToro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Investor", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Investor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Google"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ChatGPT", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "ChatGPT"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenAI", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "OpenAI"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chatbot", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chatbot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silicon_Valley", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Silicon Valley"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks_and_Bonds", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks and Bonds", "wgt": 26}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Research_and_Analysis", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Research and Analysis", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Information_Technology/Marketing_and_Advertising", "label": "dmoz/Business/Information Technology/Marketing and Advertising", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Education_and_Training", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Education and Training", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 55}], "image": "https://usanews.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/news-18062024-114412.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9658445", "eventUri": "eng-9658445", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-07", "textStart": 1197, "textEnd": 1205}], "sentiment": 0.4666666666666666, "wgt": 194, "relevance": 1}

Earlier this month, Nvidia hit $3 trillion for the first time and passed Apple.\n\nNvidia shares are up more than 170 per cent so far this year and went a leg higher after the company reported first-quarter earnings in May.\n\nThe stock has multiplied by more than ninefold since the end of 2022, a rise that's coincided with the emergence of generative artificial intelligence.\n\nTheNightlyGet in front of tomorrow's news for FREE\n\nJournalism for the curious Australian across politics, business, culture and opinion.\n\nREAD NOW\n\nApple shares fell 1.1 per cent on Tuesday, giving the iPhone maker a $3.29 trillion market value.\n\nNvidia has about 80 per cent of the market for AI chips used in data centres, a business that's ballooned as OpenAI, Microsoft, Alphabet, Amazon, Meta and others have raced to snap up the processors needed to build AI models and run increasingly large workloads.\n\nFor the most recent quarter, revenue in Nvidia's data centre business rose 427 per cent from a year earlier to $22.6 billion, accounting for about 86 per cent of the chipmaker's total sales.\n\nFounded in 1991, Nvidia spent its first few decades primarily as a hardware company that sold chips for gamers to run 3D titles. It's also dabbled in cryptocurrency mining chips and cloud gaming subscriptions.\n\nBut over the past two years, Nvidia shares have skyrocketed as Wall Street came to recognize the company's technology as the engine behind an explosion in AI that shows no signs of slowing.\n\nThe rally has lifted co-founder and CEO Jensen Huang's net worth to about $117 billion, making him the 11th wealthiest person in the world, according to Forbes.\n\nMicrosoft shares are up about 20 per cent so far this year. The software giant has also been a major beneficiary of the AI boom, after it took a significant stake in OpenAI and integrated the startup's AI models into its most important products, including Office and Windows.\n\nMicrosoft is one of the biggest buyers of Nvidia's graphics processing units (GPUs) for its Azure cloud service. The company just released a new generation of laptops that are designed to run its AI models, called Copilot+.\n\nNvidia is a newcomer to the title of most valuable U.S. company. For the past few years, Apple and Microsoft have been trading the title.\n\nNvidia's ascent has been so rapid that the company has yet to be added to the Dow Jones Industrial Average, the stock benchmark of 30 of the most valuable U.S. companies. Alongside its earnings release last month, Nvidia announced a 10-for-1 stock split, which went into effect on June 7.\n\nThe split gives Nvidia a better shot at being added to the Dow, which is a price-weighted index, meaning that companies with higher stock prices -- rather than market caps -- have outsized influence on the benchmark.\n\nGet the latest news from thewest.com.au in your

Is it Too Late to Invest?", "body": "Nvidia's (NASDAQ: NVDA) recent stock split lowered the price of each individual share after the high-flying stock reached beyond $1,000 and ever since that split a little more than a week ago, the shares have advanced about 12%. This momentum has helped the chip designer reach an enormous milestone. Nvidia just passed Microsoft to become the world's most valuable company with a market value topping $3.33 trillion as of market close on Tuesday -- that's compared to the rival software giant's $3.31 trillion market capitalization.\n\nThere's been a good reason for Nvidia's standout performance in recent times: its dominance in the billion-dollar artificial intelligence (AI) chip market. The company holds an 80% share and this has helped earnings -- and clearly share price -- to soar. After the enormous gain, and as Nvidia steps ahead of Microsoft, the question now is: Is it too late to invest in this AI chip giant? Let's find out.\n\nNvidia's graphics processing units (GPUs) once were best known for powering video games and this helped Nvidia remain financially successful over time. But the AI boom marked a turning point for the company as potential customers realized how particularly well-suited Nvidia's GPUs were to crucial AI tasks. This is thanks to the GPU's ability to process many jobs simultaneously, making this chip ideal for things like the training and inferencing of AI models.\n\nBut Nvidia hasn't stopped with the GPU and instead created a broad range of products and services -- such as enterprise software -- to support AI customers along the development path. And this has resulted in triple-digit increases in revenue and profit in recent quarters. For example, in the past quarter, Nvidia's revenue reached a new record high of $26 billion -- and revenue linked to AI customers made up a whopping 86% percent of that.\n\nAs mentioned above, all of this boosted the stock price and prompted Nvidia to announce a 10-for-1 stock split. The goal? To bring the stock to a level that would make it easier for employees and investors to access it. From the announcement in late May to the actual operation earlier this month, Nvidia shares climbed nearly 30%, and they've continued to add to gains.\n\nNow, let's return to our question. Since Nvidia has climbed to a value above technology powerhouse Microsoft's, is it too late to get in on the stock? A look at valuation shows us that Nvidia is considerably more expensive than it was only a month ago. Today, the stock trades for more than 51x forward earnings estimates compared with about 30 in May.\n\nNVDA PE Ratio (Forward) data by YCharts\n\nSo does this mean you should hold off on buying this skyrocketing stock? Not necessarily. Yes, Nvidia is more expensive than it was a few weeks ago, but the stock is worth the premium for two reasons: its current leadership in the high-growth AI chip market, and most importantly, the steps it's taking to remain in that position.\n\nNvidia has committed to updating its GPUs annually, recently saying that after the launch of its new Blackwell architecture and chip later this year, \"other Blackwells\" will follow. This means that even if rivals release new chips, Nvidia, already in the lead, should remain ahead in terms of product performance.\n\nOn top of this, it's important to remember two other things. First, Nvidia already has secured its reputation as an expert in the AI chip market, and demand for its products and services is surpassing supply -- so it's already in a position of strength. And the innovation I just mentioned could keep this going. Second, the AI growth story is in its early days, with today's $200 billion AI market expected to reach more than $1 trillion by the end of the decade. As a result, Nvidia's AI growth may have a lot farther to go.\n\nAll of this means that today, even with Nvidia soaring past Microsoft, the investment opportunity is far from over -- and Nvidia still is a top stock to buy and hold for the long term.\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Nvidia wasn't one of them.

Nvidia passed Microsoft on Tuesday, June 18, 2024, to become the most valuable company in the S&P 500.\n\nNvidia's startling ascent in the stock market reached another milestone Tuesday as the chipmaker rose to become the most valuable company in the S&P 500. Investors now say the company is worth over $3.3 trillion.\n\nNvidia has seen soaring demand for its semiconductors, which are used to power artificial intelligence applications. Revenue more than tripled in the latest quarter from the same period a year earlier.\n\nThe company's journey to be one of the most prominent players in AI has produced some eye-popping numbers. Here's a look:\n\n$3.334 Trillion\n\nNvidia's total market value as of the close Tuesday. It edged past Microsoft ($3.317 trillion). Apple is the third most-valuable company ($3.286 trillion).

That gave each investor nine additional shares for every share they already owned. Companies with a high stock price often conduct stock splits to make the stock more affordable for investors.\n\n$119.9 billion\n\nAnalysts' estimate for Nvidia's revenue for the fiscal year that ends in January 2025. That would be about double its revenue for fiscal 2024 and more than four times its receipts the year before that.\n\n53.4%\n\nNvidia's estimated net margin, or the percentage of revenue that gets turned into profit. Looked at another way, about 53 cents of every $1 in revenue Nvidia took in last year went to its bottom line.

for its top-of-the-line processors outpacing supply.\n\nTech giants Microsoft, Meta Platforms (META.O) and Google-owner Alphabet (GOOGL.O) are competing to build out their AI computing capabilities

Nvidia has seen soaring demand for its semiconductors, which are used to power artificial intelligence applications. (Associated Press/Chiang Ying-ying, File)\n\nNvidia's startling ascent in the stock market reached another milestone June 18 as the chipmaker rose to become the most valuable company in the S&P 500. Investors now say the company is worth over $3.3 trillion.\n\nNvidia has seen soaring demand for its semiconductors, which are used to power artificial intelligence applications. Revenue more than tripled in the latest quarter from the same period a year earlier.\n\nNvidia has been a strategic investor in autonomous trucking company Waabi, which said June 18 that it wrapped up a $200 million funding round that will carry it through the commercial launch of fully self-driving trucks in 2025.\n\nNvidia's journey to be one of the most prominent players in AI has produced some eye-popping numbers. Here's a look:\n\n$3.334 trillion\n\nNvidia's total market value as of the close June 18. It edged past Microsoft ($3.317 trillion). Apple is the third most valuable company ($3.286 trillion). One year ago, the company had just crossed the $1 trillion threshold.\n\n$113 billion\n\nThe one-day increase in Nvidia's market value June 18.\n\n$135.58\n\nNvidia's closing stock price Tuesday. Two weeks ago the stock traded at more than $1,200, but the company completed a 10-for-1 stock split after trading closed on June 7. That gave each investor nine additional shares for every share they already owned. Companies with a high stock price often conduct stock splits to make the stock more affordable for investors.\n\n$119.9 billion\n\nAnalysts' estimate for Nvidia's revenue for the fiscal year that ends in January 2025. That would be about double its revenue for fiscal 2024 and more than four times its receipts the year before that.\n\n53.4%\n\nNvidia's estimated net margin, or the percentage of revenue that gets turned into profit. Looked at another way, about 53 cents of every $1 in revenue Nvidia took in last year went to its bottom line. By comparison, Apple's net margin was 26.3% in its most recent quarter and Microsoft's was 36.4%. Both those companies have significantly higher revenue than Nvidia, however.\n\n32%\n\nHow much of the S&P 500's gain for the year through May came only from Nvidia.\n\n11\n\nThe number of companies other than Nvidia that were once the most valuable in the S&P 500, going back to 1926, according to S&P Dow Jones Indices.

Apple also experienced a decline, with its stock slipping over 1%, bringing its market capitalisation down to US$3.286 trillion.\n\nThis reshuffling at the top highlights the competitive nature of the tech industry, especially in areas driving advancements in artificial intelligence (AI).\n\nThe increase in Nvidia's stock has significantly impacted major indices. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq have reached record highs, supported by the strong performance of tech stocks, with Nvidia leading the way.\n\nDespite this positive trend, some investors are cautious. They worry that the current enthusiasm for AI might decrease if spending on the technology slows down.\n\nSteve Sosnick, Interactive Brokers' chief market strategist, noted, \"It's Nvidia's market; we're all just trading in it.\"\n\nOne notable aspect of Nvidia's rise is its dominance in trading volume. Nvidia has become the most traded company on Wall Street, with daily turnover averaging around US$50 billion.\n\nIn comparison, trading volumes for Apple, Microsoft, and Tesla are significantly lower, each averaging around US$10 billion.\n\nThis high trading volume means Nvidia now accounts for about 16% of all trading activity among S&P 500 companies, highlighting its central role in the current market landscape.\n\nTuesday's gain propelled Nvidia's stock to an all-time high, adding over US$110 billion to its market capitalization. This increase is roughly equivalent to the entire market value of Lockheed Martin.\n\nNvidia's market capitalization also rose from US$1 trillion to US$2 trillion within nine months, reaching US$2 trillion in February, and then took just over three months to surpass US$3 trillion in June.\n\nHowever, the rapid rise of Nvidia and the overall excitement for AI have led some market watchers to urge caution.\n\nThe technology sector is known for its volatility, and market sentiment can change quickly. While Nvidia's current growth is promising, the sustainability of this growth remains a subject of discussion among analysts and investors.\n\nOliver Pursche, Wealthspire Advisors' senior vice president in New York, noted:\n\n\"Nvidia has been getting a lot of positive attention and has been doing a lot of things very correctly, but a small misstep is likely to cause a major correction in the stock, and investors should be careful.\" /TISG\n\nRead also: NVIDIA's 10-for-1 stock split: Should you or should you not buy into the illusion", "source": {"uri": "theindependent.sg", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Independent"}, "authors": [{"uri": "mary_alavanza@theindependent.sg", "name": "Mary Alavanza", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nvidia", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nvidia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_dollar", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States dollar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_capitalization", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Market capitalization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology_company", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Technology company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S&P_500_Index", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "S&P 500 Index"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_value", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Market value"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nasdaq", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nasdaq"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tesla,_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tesla, Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wall_Street", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Wall Street"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revenue", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Revenue"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Stock"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock_split", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Stock split"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volatility_(finance)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Volatility (finance)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sustainability", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sustainability"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lockheed_Martin", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lockheed Martin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_president", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Vice president"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reuters", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Reuters"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks_and_Bonds", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks and Bonds", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Research_and_Analysis", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Research and Analysis", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Day_Trading", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Day Trading", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Information_Technology/Marketing_and_Advertising", "label": "dmoz/Business/Information Technology/Marketing and Advertising", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 57}], "image": "https://theindependentsg.s3.ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/27130848/Depositphotos_377430980_L-2-e1716791658560.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9658445", "eventUri": "eng-9658445", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.4431372549019608, "wgt": 187, "relevance": 1}

The stock market has a new king.\n\nOn Tuesday, Nvidia leapfrogged two of tech's most storied names to become the world's most valuable public company, according to data from S&P Global. Its ascent has been powered by the boom in generative artificial intelligence and surging demand for the company's chips -- known as graphics processing units, or GPUs -- which have made it possible to create artificial intelligence (AI) systems.\n\nNvidia's rise is among the fastest in market history. Just two years ago, the company's market valuation was a little over US$400 billion. Now, in the span of a year, it has gone from $1 trillion to more than $3 trillion.\n\nOn Tuesday, Nvidia's share price rose 3.6%, lifting its value to $3.34 trillion. Microsoft and Apple both fell, ending the day trailing the Silicon Valley chipmaker.\n\nNvidia's ascent is a testament to how much AI has upended the world's biggest companies. The rise of the powerful technology first elevated Microsoft to the biggest market capitalisation in January, dethroning Apple, before pushing Nvidia to take the crown. Last week, Apple said it, too, was getting into the AI game and will add the technology to its products, including the iPhone, this fall.\n\nYears before other big chip companies, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang bet that GPUs would be essential to building AI, and he tailored his company to accommodate what he believed would be tech's next big boom.\n\nHis big bet is paying off. By some measurements, Nvidia controls more than 80% of the market for the chips used in AI systems. Nvidia's biggest customers regularly jockey for orders for chips to run computers in their giant data centres and are building their own AI chips so they are not so dependent on one supplier.\n\n\"No one else fully saw or appreciated this,\" said Daniel Newman, CEO of the Futurum Group, a tech research firm. \"They saw the trend, built for the trend and enabled the market. They can effectively charge whatever they want.\"\n\nNvidia's ascent has made Huang a celebrity in the tech world. After a computer conference in Taiwan this month, he was surrounded by attendees who wanted his autograph, including a woman who asked him to sign her chest.\n\nThe company's rise is reminiscent of dot-com era titans like Cisco and Juniper Networks, which built the equipment that ran communications networks for the internet. Cisco's shares increased more than a thousandfold between its initial public offering in 1990 and 2000, when it briefly became the world's most valuable company.\n\nThe speed at which Nvidia's value has grown has been startling. Apple crossed $1 trillion in August 2018 and became the first $3 trillion company last June. Microsoft also took nearly five years to climb from $1 trillion to $3 trillion.\n\nNvidia's investors are betting more on its potential than on its current profits. Microsoft and Apple each generated more than $21 billion in profit during the three months that ended in March. Nvidia generated $14.88 billion in profit in its most recent quarter, which ended in April, but that was up more than 600% from a year earlier.\n\n\"The numbers have gotten so big so quickly that people worry: Is this sustainable?\" said Stacy Rasgon, an analyst with Bernstein Research. \"If the return on AI turns out to not be there, then the whole thing comes crumbling down.\"\n\nJust 12 companies have led the S&P 500 by market valuation since the index was created in 1926: AT&T, Apple, Cisco, DuPont, Exxon Mobil, General Electric, General Motors, IBM, Microsoft, Philip Morris, Walmart and now Nvidia, according to S&P Dow Jones Indices.\n\nNvidia's rise has been fuelled by its ability to consistently exceed Wall Street expectations. Sales in its last quarter tripled from a year earlier to $26 billion. It also projected that it would double sales in the current quarter.\n\nNvidia sells everything from chips, and the software needed to build AI systems with those chips, to supercomputers. The machines, which have 35,000 parts and are packed with the company's GPUs, sell for $250,000 or more. A new supercomputer that Nvidia is bringing to the market could sell for more than $1 million, Rasgon said.\n\n\"Even though the cost of the system is going up, the performance per dollar is getting better with every generation, and that's how they're able to keep customers buying,\" Rasgon said.\n\nWall Street has been watching for signs of a slowdown. Microsoft, Meta, Google and Amazon have all developed their own chips that can be used for AI, and traditional chip rivals such as Advanced Micro Devices and Intel have tried to cut into Nvidia's business with their own AI processors.\n\nBut Huang believes that it will take time for anyone to catch up to Nvidia. The company has a decade head start and has cultivated a large community of AI programmers who prefer its technology.\n\n\"We are fundamentally changing how computing works and what computers can do,\" Huang said in a conference call with analysts in May. \"The next industrial revolution has begun.\"", "source": {"uri": "bangkokpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Bangkok Post"},

The company makes graphics processing units (GPUs), the chips that fuel the speed and action needed to make games come alive on the screen. But Nvidia only took center stage in recent years, when it became clear its GPUs also would be gamechangers for something else: artificial intelligence (AI).\n\nThough Nvidia still serves the gaming industry, revenue from that area today is a fraction of overall revenue -- while revenue from AI represents the lion's share. Earnings have grown in the triple digits in the past several quarters, and revenue continues to reach new records. Nvidia's stock price has followed, soaring more than 3,500% over the past five years -- and it even roared past $1,000 a few weeks ago.\n\nMost recently, Nvidia completed a 10-for-1 stock split, bringing the share price down from those levels to make it more accessible to a broader range of investors. This means right now Nvidia trades for about $130 a share, and this does make it easier for those with smaller budgets -- or those who want to open a small position -- to invest in the stock. That's positive. Now, though, the question is whether Nvidia can once again take off and deliver great returns to investors in the coming years. Is it too late to buy this high-flying stock now? Let's find out.\n\nNvidia has climbed for one big reason: the top performance of its products. The tech giant sells the fastest chip around, which means customers can train large language models and complete other AI tasks quickly -- more quickly than if they relied on a rival chip. This is positive because it speeds up the time to commercialization for their products and services, allowing them to generate revenue sooner rather than later from their AI platforms.\n\nAnd, as Nvidia chief executive officer Jensen Huang emphasizes, this time saved also equals lower expenses. It's costly to run a data center, so any element that can speed up operations can reduce various expenses -- from energy to workforce. This means it may be worth it for a company to pay more for an Nvidia GPU rather than go for a bargain chip from another player -- over time, this investment may actually lead to cost savings for the customer.\n\nImportantly, customers are recognizing this. Demand is high for Nvidia chips as well as the company's full range of other AI products and services, and this has driven the earnings growth I mentioned earlier. In the most recent quarter, Nvidia reported record revenue of $26 billion, net income of $14.8 billion, and gross margin that's expanded to more than 78% from about 64% in the year-earlier period.\n\nSeeing the strength of Nvidia's products and how they're driving earnings growth, investors have been eager to get in on this success story. This is great, but it's important to look ahead for clues about whether this success story can continue.\n\nAnd here, the situation looks promising, thanks to Nvidia's commitment to innovation. Nvidia pledges to update its GPUs on an annual basis, gaining in speed and capabilities. It plans to launch the Blackwell architecture later this year along with its best chip ever -- and it aims to follow with \"other Blackwells\" thereafter. Nvidia says customers are in the early days of this AI build out, and forecasts for AI market growth corroborate the idea that we're just at the start of AI growth. Today, the AI market is about $200 billion, and it's expected to increase to more than $1 trillion by the end of the decade.\n\nSo, Nvidia's commitment to innovation, current leadership, and the general forecasts for market growth all suggest the company's earnings growth will continue for quite some time.\n\nNvidia's valuation has increased over the past several weeks, and now the stock trades at 50x times forward earnings estimates, up from around 35 earlier this year. So the stock has become more expensive -- but considering the strengths I mention above, for the long-term investor, Nvidia is worth the price.\n\nOf course, following the recent stock split, the shares might not immediately soar. Investors may wait for catalysts like the next earnings report or the launch of Blackwell to get in on the stock. But, over the long run, Nvidia has what it takes to roar higher again -- and that means it isn't too late to buy this top AI stock.", "source": {"uri": "fool.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Motley Fool"}, "authors": [{"uri": "adria_cimino@fool.com", "name": "Adria Cimino", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nvidia", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nvidia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphics_processing_unit", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Graphics processing unit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_game_industry", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Video game industry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Share_price", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Share price"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jensen_Huang", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jensen Huang"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock_split", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Stock split"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_center", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Data center"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gross_margin", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gross margin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valuation_(finance)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Valuation (finance)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Net_income", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Net income"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks_and_Bonds", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks and Bonds", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Research_and_Analysis", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Research and Analysis", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Education_and_Training", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Education and Training", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence/Games", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence/Games", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://g.foolcdn.com/editorial/images/780801/gettyimages-1199696916.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9658445", "eventUri": "eng-9658445", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3490196078431373, "wgt": 186, "relevance": 1}

More than $2 trillion of that value has been added this year. The year was 1999. Steve Jobs had recently returned to lead Apple. Intel was the dominant force in semiconductors. And a little-known chipmaker named Nvidia made its debut on the Nasdaq stock exchange.\n\nIt took less than three years for Nvidia Corp. to ascend into the S&P 500 -- replacing the disgraced oil-trading conglomerate Enron, no less.\n\nBut even then, few people would have bet that the company would go on to become the best performing stock of the last quarter-century, posting a total return of 591,078% since its initial public offering, including reinvested dividends. It's a difficult number to comprehend and a testament, in part, to the financial mania brewing around artificial intelligence and how investors have come to see Nvidia -- which makes the cutting-edge chips powering the technology -- as the single-biggest winner of the boom.\n\nOn Tuesday, that run culminated in Nvidia unseating Microsoft Corp. as the world's most valuable company with a market capitalization of $3.34 trillion. More than $2 trillion of that value has been added this year.\n\nThe company's rise was by no means assured -- and neither is its staying power at the top of the S&P 500. Long-time investors in Nvidia have had to stomach three annual collapses of 50% or more in the stock. Sustaining the current rally will require customers to keep spending billions of dollars a quarter on AI equipment, whose returns on investment are so far relatively small.\n\nWhat ultimately paved the way for Nvidia to climb to the top, though, was the company's big bet on graphics chips and the vision of co-founder and Chief Executive Officer Jensen Huang that the industry would shift to what he calls \"accelerated computing,\" something his chips are inherently better at than the competition.\n\n\"You have to give the management team, I think, an enormous amount of credit,\" said Brian Mulberry, client portfolio manager at Zacks Investment Management. \"They have caught each wave of innovation in hardware perfectly well.\"\n\nHere's a look at Nvidia from its IPO to now.\n\nEarly years\n\nNvidia got off to a hot start.\n\nBetween its debut and the time it entered the S&P 500, the stock gained more than 1,600%, giving it a market value of about $8 billion. That rise came as many other technology stocks were cratering in the aftermath of the dot-com bubble, which peaked in March 2000.\n\nThe company's key to early success: getting its technology in video-game consoles like Microsoft's Xbox and Sony's PlayStation. Nvidia's GeForce graphics processing units, or GPUs, became objects of desire among gamers because they consistently offered the most realistic experience.\n\n\"Jensen was always a great communicator, told a good story, and clearly GPUs were becoming more important,\" said Rhys Williams, chief strategist at Wayve Capital Management, who was a buyer in the IPO. \"Each successive generation of hardware gave a lot better performance, a lot more realistic picture and then PC gaming really came into being.\"\n\nLitigation and competition\n\nThe next six years weren't kind to Nvidia. The stock plunged in 2008 as the financial crisis weakened demand and long-struggling rival Advanced Micro Devices Inc. started turning things around.\n\nMeanwhile, an agreement between Nvidia and Intel that allowed the companies to use each other's capabilities went sour, forcing Nvidia out of one of its biggest markets. The two settled in 2011, with Intel agreeing to pay Nvidia $1.5 billion.\n\nThe following year, Nvidia unveiled graphics chips for servers inside data centers. They could help sophisticated computing work such as oil and gas exploration and weather prediction, giving Nvidia a foothold in what would become a lucrative market. However, those chips did not immediately fly off the shelf. It would take nearly nine years for Nvidia shares to surpass their 2007 high.\n\nCrypto and Covid\n\nNvidia shares took off again in 2015. During that period, the company's chips were becoming the foundation of emerging technologies, from advanced graphics interfaces to autonomous vehicles to a new wave of AI products.\n\nThat's when Shana Sissel, chief executive officer at Banrion Capital Management, first really took note of the company. She described a 2017 conference where Nvidia was more like a pageant winner than an investment idea.\n\n\"Every single speaker talked about Nvidia being the most important company,\" Sissel said. \"At that point, it was really on my radar screen.\"\n\nEven after demand from cryptocurrency miners dried up, data-center sales continued to grow. The Covid-19 pandemic boosted that business, as companies needed to purchase additional computing power to support remote work. Nvidia's data-center revenue rose by a multiple of eight from fiscal 2017 to fiscal 2021.\n\nAI sales explode\n\nNvidia's shares slumped in 2022 along with the rest of the technology sector, which was reeling from soaring interest rates and falling demand after the Covid-era boom.\n\nOpenAI's release of ChatGPT in late-2022 made an instant splash but it took time for investors to realize how Nvidia might benefit. Eventually, interest in ChatGPT and other generative AI products exploded, triggering a frantic surge in orders for Nvidia's chips.\n\nWhen the company reported first-quarter 2023 earnings, the scale of the jump in its business shocked nearly everyone on Wall Street. Nvidia gave a forecast for quarterly sales that was more than 50% above the average projection.\n\nNvidia's data-center sales eclipsed its gaming revenue for the first time in fiscal 2023. In Nvidia's current fiscal year, analysts expect those sales to top $100 billion.\n\n\"They have a very defensible place in the industry,\" said Williams, the strategist at Wayve Capital Management. \"They're not gonna be 95% of market share forever, obviously, but it would be almost impossible for anybody to replace them.\"", "source": {"uri": "telecom.economictimes.indiatimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ETTelecom.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S&P_500_Index", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "S&P 500 Index"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nvidia", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nvidia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphics_processing_unit", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Graphics processing unit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_capitalization", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Market capitalization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intel", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Intel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Initial_public_offering", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Initial public offering"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nasdaq", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nasdaq"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enron", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Enron"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Jobs", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Steve Jobs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conglomerate_(company)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Conglomerate (company)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computing", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Computing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semiconductor", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Semiconductor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dividend", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dividend"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dot-com_bubble", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dot-com bubble"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_crisis", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Financial crisis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PlayStation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "PlayStation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Return_on_investment", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Return on investment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xbox_(console)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Xbox (console)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PC_game", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "PC game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_center", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Data center"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_value", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Market value"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_game_console", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Video game console"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sony", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sony"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks_and_Bonds", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks and Bonds", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Research_and_Analysis", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Research and Analysis", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Brokerages", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Brokerages", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Major_Companies", "label": "dmoz/Business/Major Companies", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://etimg.etb2bimg.com/thumb/msid-111101739,imgsize-62676,width-1200,height=765,overlay-ettelecom/devices/nvidias-591078-rally-to-most-valuable-stock-came-in-waves.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9658445", "eventUri": "eng-9658445", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2000-03-", "textStart": 2650, "textEnd": 2660}], "sentiment": 0.2313725490196079, "wgt": 186, "relevance": 1}

The company makes graphics processing units (GPUs), the chips that fuel the speed and action needed to make games come alive on the screen. But Nvidia only took center stage in recent years, when it became clear its GPUs also would be gamechangers for something else: artificial intelligence (AI).\n\nThough Nvidia still serves the gaming industry, revenue from that area today is a fraction of overall revenue -- while revenue from AI represents the lion's share. Earnings have grown in the triple digits in the past several quarters, and revenue continues to reach new records. Nvidia's stock price has followed, soaring more than 3,500% over the past five years -- and it even roared past $1,000 a few weeks ago.\n\nMost recently, Nvidia completed a 10-for-1 stock split, bringing the share price down from those levels to make it more accessible to a broader range of investors. This means right now Nvidia trades for about $130 a share, and this does make it easier for those with smaller budgets -- or those who want to open a small position -- to invest in the stock. That's positive. Now, though, the question is whether Nvidia can once again take off and deliver great returns to investors in the coming years. Is it too late to buy this high-flying stock now? Let's find out.\n\nNvidia has climbed for one big reason: the top performance of its products. The tech giant sells the fastest chip around, which means customers can train large language models and complete other AI tasks quickly -- more quickly than if they relied on a rival chip. This is positive because it speeds up the time to commercialization for their products and services, allowing them to generate revenue sooner rather than later from their AI platforms.\n\nAnd, as Nvidia chief executive officer Jensen Huang emphasizes, this time saved also equals lower expenses. It's costly to run a data center, so any element that can speed up operations can reduce various expenses -- from energy to workforce. This means it may be worth it for a company to pay more for an Nvidia GPU rather than go for a bargain chip from another player -- over time, this investment may actually lead to cost savings for the customer.\n\nImportantly, customers are recognizing this. Demand is high for Nvidia chips as well as the company's full range of other AI products and services, and this has driven the earnings growth I mentioned earlier.

That means, the AI chip-making giant has surpassed Microsoft at $3.32 trillion and Apple at $3.29 trillion at market close on Tuesday.\n\nThe dramatic turn of events happened roughly a week after Apple reclaimed its spot as the world's most valuable company.

Encouraged by IT behemoths like Microsoft, Meta and Google's insatiable demand for its chips, the company's stock price has increased by more than 182 percent this year alone, following a more than threefold increase in 2023.\n\nNvidia has reached new heights as a result of the generative artificial intelligence boom, which was sparked by the introduction of OpenAI's ChatGPT in late 2022 and increased demand for the company's specialized AI processors. Since then, the company's worth has increased on an almost vertical rise from around $400 billion in late 2022 to $1 trillion by mid-2023, $2 trillion by early 2024, and $3 trillion by mid-2024.\n\nThis change in the rankings emphasizes how crucial AI is to investors.

Nvidia's stock surged 3.5% to $135.58, pushing its market capitalization to a staggering $3.34 trillion. This ascent marks a significant moment in financial history, as Nvidia, known for its cutting-edge AI chips, overtakes Microsoft's $3.32 trillion and Apple's $3.29 trillion in market value.\n\nNvidia's meteoric rise is emblematic of the fervent optimism surrounding artificial intelligence (AI). The company's high-performance processors are the cornerstone of the AI revolution, powering technologies from autonomous vehicles to sophisticated data analysis tools. Demand for these AI processors has outpaced supply, driving Nvidia's stock to nearly triple in value this year, a feat unmatched by other tech heavyweights. In comparison, Microsoft's shares have risen by 19%, while Apple's have seen an 11% increase.\n\nThe rapid appreciation in Nvidia's market cap is fueled by its superior AI chips, which are considered unparalleled in the industry. This has led to a scramble among tech giants like Microsoft, Meta Platforms, and Alphabet to integrate Nvidia's processors into their AI infrastructures. The resultant surge in demand has seen Nvidia's revenue and profitability soar, consistently surpassing Wall Street's high expectations.\n\nAdding to its appeal, Nvidia recently executed a 10-for-1 stock split, significantly lowering the price per share and making it more accessible to individual investors. This move has not only democratized its ownership but also further bolstered its market value.

Apple and Microsoft, which for years have swapped positions as the world's most valuable company, were worth slightly less - around $3.29 trillion and $3.31 trillion, respectively, at the end of trading.\n\nNvidia's computer chips and software are crucial to training the AI algorithms behind image generators and chatbots like OpenAI's ChatGPT. As the tech and business worlds throw themselves into the AI boom, demand for the chips has skyrocketed, pushing Nvidia's revenue up to $26 billion in the first quarter of this year, up from just $7.2 billion a year ago.\n\nThe AI boom has been reshuffling the world's biggest companies in the past two years. In January, Microsoft surged past Apple to become the world's most valuable company as investors have poured money into the hot technology.\n\nNvidia, which was already a large company, has had the \"most remarkable growth story,\" in tech, said Gene Munster, managing partner at Deepwater Asset Management.\n\nRelated:Nvidia Unveils Next-Generation Rubin AI Platform for 2026\n\n\"I don't think this is done,\" he said. \"If you believe that AI is going to be as transformative as some believe, this will continue to rise.\"\n\nNvidia's rise to become the world's most valuable company underlines how strongly investors believe Big Tech executives' claims that AI will overhaul whole swaths of modern life. The technology demands more processing power from computers than other kinds of software, and business leaders are busy building new data centers and filling them with chips from Nvidia and other companies to handle new AI tasks.\n\nProfessional investment funds and individual retail investors alike have thrown their money into Nvidia's shares, pushing up the price even faster than the company's revenue has grown. Since OpenAI kicked off the wave of interest in AI with the launch of ChatGPT at the end of November 2022, Nvidia's stock price has grown about 700 percent.\n\nNvidia controls about 70 percent of the market for AI chips, making the company a kingmaker in the industry. That has brought new scrutiny from regulators.\n\nNvidia declined to comment Tuesday.\n\nBefore the AI boom, Nvidia was best known for making computer chips used in video game consoles and computers. But the special characteristics of these \"graphics processing units\" that made them useful for gaming also made them well-suited to crunching the giant calculations needed to train AI algorithms.\n\nRelated:HPE Introduces 'Turnkey' AI Data Center Solution With Nvidia\n\nIn the mid-2010s, researchers at artificial intelligence labs began using Nvidia GPUs as they tinkered with evermore capable AI. The company took notice and began improving the software used to program its chips to make it more suited to AI work. By the time the AI boom happened, most of the industry was accustomed to using Nvidia's chips and software. Other chip companies, like AMD and Intel, have scrambled to catch up, but industry analysts and AI researchers say Nvidia will continue to benefit from its head start for years.", "source": {"uri": "datacenterknowledge.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Data Center Knowledge"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nvidia", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nvidia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_circuit", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Integrated circuit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AI_boom", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "AI boom"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ChatGPT", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "ChatGPT"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenAI", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "OpenAI"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chatbot", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chatbot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_company", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Public company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Algorithm"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Washington_Post", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Washington Post"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Software"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock_market", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stock market"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_capitalization", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Market capitalization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Tech", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Big Tech"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_center", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Data center"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Computer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AMD", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "AMD"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intel", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Intel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphics_processing_unit", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Graphics processing unit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_game_console", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Video game console"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Investor", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Investor"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence/Natural_Language", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence/Natural Language", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence/Publications", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence/Publications", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence/Games", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence/Games", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence/Philosophy", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence/Philosophy", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 63}], "image": "https://eu-images.contentstack.com/v3/assets/blt8eb3cdfc1fce5194/blt9e8fc83e5cfecc06/6672a485133b2974ff260fc5/240619-Nvidia-Bloomberg.jpg?disable=upscale&width=1200&height=630&fit=crop", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9658445", "eventUri": "eng-9658445", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-18", "textStart": 283, "textEnd": 290}], "sentiment": 0.3725490196078431, "wgt": 184, "relevance": 1}

The chip designer took an early lead in the AI hardware race, leading to incredible business results and skyrocketing stock prices.\n\nThe stock traded at a split-adjusted $14 per share when OpenAI released the ChatGPT generative AI engine, powered by thousands of Nvidia AI accelerator chips. Today, Nvidia's share price has soared to $131. With a $3.2 trillion market cap, it's one of the three most valuable companies in the stock market.\n\nDid you miss the boat on Nvidia's AI-based opportunity, or can the stock continue to rise from this lofty plateau? Let's find out.\n\nNvidia's upsides\n\nNvidia's financial success is indisputable. Revenues more than tripled year-over-year in the last two earnings reports. Free cash flows are consistently growing by about 500% in the same time frame. Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) and Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) are still more profitable than Nvidia, but the chip expert is catching up.\n\nMany market observers like to point out that the generative AI revolution is only getting started. ChatGPT is less than two years old. Only a couple of tech giants have come up with comparably powerful large language models (LLMs) so far, though many are working on their own long-term generative AI plans. Until further notice, Nvidia's accelerator chips are the gold standard against which other solutions must be measured. If you're building a strong AI system, Nvidia's solutions are the default and the industry standard. Others must develop and then prove some sort of unique advantage before winning AI contracts against Nvidia's killer products.\n\nImagine Nvidia maintaining its lead as the generative AI market grows. It's not hard to see the stock soaring even higher over the next few years.\n\nNvidia's potential downsides\n\nOn the other hand, the goodfinancial newsand a whole lot of forward-looking expectations are already priced into Nvidia's stock. Shares are changing hands at glossy valuation ratios such as 82 times free cash flow and 40 times sales -- levels usually reserved for small-cap start-ups with more sizzle than substance.\n\nAt the same time, Nvidia doesn't stand unchallenged in the AI accelerator market. Arch rival Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD) has its Instinct line of cost-effective AI chips. The Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) Gaudi series boasts impressive performance per watt of electric power. And that's just the top of a large heap. There's more than one way to design an AI-crunching system, and rival solutions may offer compelling alternatives for specific use cases. Who's to say that Nvidia will hang on to its market-defining lead in the long run?\n\nSeparately, the issues of high valuation and strong competition should be enough to give most investors pause before slamming that \"buy\" button on Nvidia stock. Together, it's a high-wire act with a long way down. Nvidia's stock is priced for perfection and any misstep -- such as a major AI contract lost to Intel or AMD -- will probably result in a quick and painful price drop.\n\nShould you buy, sell, or hold Nvidia?\n\nI'm not saying you should sell every Nvidia share right now and never look back. The company could very well stave off the army of rivals and continue to innovate on a hard-to-match level. Indeed, a bit of Nvidia exposure could serve your portfolio well over the years.\n\nMeanwhile, I highly recommend taking some profits off the table by selling a portion of your long-term Nvidia holdings. The gains are more than substantial and I'm sure you can find more stable and secure ways to invest that money in the AI market.\n\nSo on the scale of buy, sell, or hold, I see Nvidia as a stock to hold for the long run. I'd rather sell a few shares than buy more at these nosebleed-inducing share prices. Your mileage may vary, depending on your appetite for market risk and AI-driven excitement. Feel free to do your own research and reach different conclusions. Just don't say I didn't warn you if or when Nvidia's big price correction comes.\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Nvidia wasn't one of them.

It took the chipmaker less than five months to reach the $3 trillion mark in June.\n\nThe company had anticipated hefty demand for its data center chips and Graphic Processing Units (GPUs) which only grew as other firms scrambled to expand their AI offerings. In 2023, Nvidia became the most profitable semiconductor firm, surpassing Intel, Samsung, and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC).

Six years later, it debuted on the NASDAQ stock exchange after inventing the GPU. In 2001, Nvidia joined the S&P 500 and, 11 years later, joined the AI revolution by powering the AlexNet neural network.\n\nCurrently, Nvidia is the most traded company on Wall Street, accounting for about 16 per cent of all trading in S&P 500 companies. According to data, the company's daily turnover recently averaged $50 billion, compared to Apple, Microsoft, and Tesla's average of around $10 billion each.\n\nSHARE Copy linkEmailFacebookTwitterTelegramLinkedInWhatsAppRedditPublished on June 19, 2024", "source": {"uri": "thehindubusinessline.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "@businessline"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nvidia", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nvidia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_capitalization", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Market capitalization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TSMC", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "TSMC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_center", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Data center"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intel", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Intel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semiconductor", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Semiconductor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samsung", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Samsung"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphics_processing_unit", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Graphics processing unit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta_Platforms", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Meta Platforms"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nasdaq", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nasdaq"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tesla,_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tesla, Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S&P_500_Index", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "S&P 500 Index"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alphabet_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Alphabet Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_(company)", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Amazon (company)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silicon", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Silicon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3D_computer_graphics", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "3D computer graphics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_neural_network", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Artificial neural network"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multimedia", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Multimedia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Marketing_and_Advertising", "label": "dmoz/Business/Marketing and Advertising", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Marketing_and_Advertising/Consulting", "label": "dmoz/Business/Marketing and Advertising/Consulting", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Major_Companies", "label": "dmoz/Business/Major Companies", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Anti-Corporation", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Anti-Corporation", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Information_Technology/Marketing_and_Advertising", "label": "dmoz/Business/Information Technology/Marketing and Advertising", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 61}], "image": "https://bl-i.thgim.com/public/incoming/kkc2ow/article68198678.ece/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1200/2024-05-20T093951Z_372881672_RC2YD5AFOT31_RTRMADP_3_NVIDIA-RESULTS-PREVIEW.JPG", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9658445", "eventUri": "eng-9658445", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2019-06-", "textStart": 2072, "textEnd": 2079}], "sentiment": 0.3254901960784313, "wgt": 183, "relevance": 1}

Microsoft is now in second place with a valuation of $3.32 trillion, followed by Apple at $3.28 trillion.\n\nThe price surge was triggered by news that the chipmaker may secure a 20% weighting in the technology select sector SPDR Fund (XLK) in the S&P 500 based on valuation rules. This could potentially lead to more than $10 billion of Nvidia's shares being acquired by the Exchange Traded Fund (ETF).\n\nNvidia's share price has climbed 12% since its 10-for-1 share split started trading on 10th June, and is up 170% year-to-date, while Microsoft's shares have risen by 20% and Apple's stocks by 15% this year. Its shares have soared approximately 591,000% since the company went public in 1999.\n\nNvidia has emerged as the biggest AI winner since 2023, thanks to its advanced Graphic Processing Units (GPUs), which specialise in supercomputing capabilities supporting generative AI training. Its revenue nearly quadrupled in the fiscal first quarter of 2025.\n\nThe company holds a monopolistic position in AI chip manufacturing, accounting for approximately 80% of the market share. Its customers include all the major tech players, including Microsoft, Amazon, Meta Platforms, Alphabet, and OpenAI. CFO Colette Kress revealed that approximately 45% of Nvidia's data centre revenue stemmed from these cloud providers.\n\nNvidia has launched a new supercomputing AI GPU, Blackwell, which is expected to spearhead the company's growth in the coming year. CEO Jessen Huang also expressed his ambition to advance its product offerings across various sectors, including consumer internet companies, automotive manufacturers, and healthcare providers, rather than solely focusing on cloud businesses.\n\nNvidia was founded in 1993 in Sunnyvale, California, United States. CEO Jensen Huang is one of the three co-founders, who was the director of CoreWare and a microprocessor designer at Advanced Micro Devices (AMD). The company's core product is its graphics processing units (GPUs), specialised electronic circuits designed to accelerate the rendering of images and videos in the early years.\n\nInstead of relying on prominent sales revenue from its data centre, Nvidia initially gained market share in the gaming industry through deals with Microsoft's Xbox in 2000 and Sony's PlayStation in 2004. Nvidia joined the S&P 500 in 2001. However, the dot-com bubble crashed its shares by nearly 90% between January and September 2002. After several years of recovery, boosted by GPU sales and the creation of the CUDA platform, Nvidia's shares soared by 635% from late 2004 to a peak in 2008 before the GFC happened.\n\nCUDA, a parallel computing platform and programming model introduced in 2006, enabled Nvidia to enter the data centre market by leveraging Nvidia GPUs for general computing tasks, crucial for AI and deep learning applications. Nvidia's sales of supercomputing chips were once again bolstered by cryptocurrency mining in 2017 and 2020. During the covid period, revenue from its gaming sector surged, pushing its market valuation to surpass Intel.\n\nNvidia's shares fell by 67% from their peak in 2021 to October 2022, when the Fed began its aggressive rate hikes. However, the AI frenzy initiated by Microsoft in 2023 caused sales of its advanced AI chips to explode in the past year.\n\nNvidia holds a Price-to-Earnings Ratio of 78, the highest among the trillion-dollar market cap club. Meanwhile, its dividend yield is as low as 0.03%, marking it as a typical growth company. Nvidia has to keep billions of dollars in investment to maintain its market share. Some analysts believe its market value could surpass $4 trillion in the foreseeable future.\n\nWith annual revenue growth exceeding 200%, Nvidia's shares are considered reasonably valued. However, the company's shares have rallied too rapidly, which could lead to a profit-taking moment.", "source": {"uri": "euronews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Euronews English"}, "authors": [],

Apple and Microsoft, which for years have swapped positions as the world's most valuable company, were worth slightly less - around $3.29 trillion and $3.31 trillion, respectively, at the end of trading.\n\nNvidia's computer chips and software are crucial to training the AI algorithms behind image generators and chatbots like OpenAI's ChatGPT. As the tech and business worlds throw themselves into the AI boom, demand for the chips has skyrocketed, pushing Nvidia's revenue up to $26 billion in the first quarter of this year, up from just $7.2 billion a year ago.\n\nThe AI boom has been reshuffling the world's biggest companies in the past two years. In January, Microsoft surged past Apple to become the world's most valuable company as investors have poured money into the hot technology.\n\nNvidia, which was already a large company, has had the \"most remarkable growth story,\" in tech, said Gene Munster, managing partner at Deepwater Asset Management.\n\n\"I don't think this is done,\" he said. \"If you believe that AI is going to be as transformative as some believe, this will continue to rise.\"\n\nNvidia's rise to become the world's most valuable company underlines how strongly investors believe Big Tech executives' claims that AI will overhaul whole swaths of modern life. The technology demands more processing power from computers than other kinds of software, and business leaders are busy building new data centers and filling them with chips from Nvidia and other companies to handle new AI tasks.\n\nProfessional investment funds and individual retail investors alike have thrown their money into Nvidia's shares, pushing up the price even faster than the company's revenue has grown. Since OpenAI kicked off the wave of interest in AI with the launch of ChatGPT at the end of November 2022, Nvidia's stock price has grown about 700 percent.\n\nNvidia controls about 70 percent of the market for AI chips, making the company a kingmaker in the industry. That has brought new scrutiny from regulators.\n\nNvidia declined to comment Tuesday.\n\nBefore the AI boom, Nvidia was best known for making computer chips used in video game consoles and computers. But the special characteristics of these \"graphics processing units\" that made them useful for gaming also made them well-suited to crunching the giant calculations needed to train AI algorithms.\n\nIn the mid-2010s, researchers at artificial intelligence labs began using Nvidia GPUs as they tinkered with evermore capable AI. The company took notice and began improving the software used to program its chips to make it more suited to AI work. By the time the AI boom happened, most of the industry was accustomed to using Nvidia's chips and software. Other chip companies, like AMD and Intel, have scrambled to catch up, but industry analysts and AI researchers say Nvidia will continue to benefit from its head start for years.\n\nShira Ovide contributed to this report.", "source": {"uri": "unionleader.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "UnionLeader.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nvidia", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nvidia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_circuit", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Integrated circuit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AI_boom", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "AI boom"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ChatGPT", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "ChatGPT"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenAI", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "OpenAI"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chatbot", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chatbot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_company", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Public company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Algorithm"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Software"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock_market", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stock market"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_capitalization", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Market capitalization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "San Francisco"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "San Francisco"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Tech", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Big Tech"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_center", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Data center"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Computer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AMD", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "AMD"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intel", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Intel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphics_processing_unit", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Graphics processing unit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_game_console", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Video game console"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Major_Companies", "label": "dmoz/Business/Major Companies", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence/Publications", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence/Publications", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence/Games", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence/Games", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence/Philosophy", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence/Philosophy", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 53}], "image": "https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/unionleader.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/e/cc/eccb3ecc-9c17-5495-befe-16c55eccaa27/66721804b13be.image.jpg?crop=1765%2C927%2C0%2C124&resize=438%2C230&order=crop%2Cresize", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9658445", "eventUri": "eng-9658445", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "San Francisco"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3725490196078431, "wgt": 182, "relevance": 1}

The chip designer took an early lead in the AI hardware race, leading to incredible business results and skyrocketing stock prices.\n\nThe stock traded at a split-adjusted $14 per share when OpenAI released the ChatGPT generative AI engine, powered by thousands of Nvidia AI accelerator chips. Today, Nvidia's share price has soared to $131. With a $3.2 trillion market cap, it's one of the three most valuable companies in the stock market.\n\nDid you miss the boat on Nvidia's AI-based opportunity, or can the stock continue to rise from this lofty plateau? Let's find out.\n\nNvidia's financial success is indisputable. Revenues more than tripled year-over-year in the last two earnings reports. Free cash flows are consistently growing by about 500% in the same time frame. Microsoft (MSFT -0.02%) and Apple (AAPL -0.32%) are still more profitable than Nvidia, but the chip expert is catching up.\n\nMany market observers like to point out that the generative AI revolution is only getting started. ChatGPT is less than two years old. Only a couple of tech giants have come up with comparably powerful large language models (LLMs) so far, though many are working on their own long-term generative AI plans. Until further notice, Nvidia's accelerator chips are the gold standard against which other solutions must be measured. If you're building a strong AI system, Nvidia's solutions are the default and the industry standard. Others must develop and then prove some sort of unique advantage before winning AI contracts against Nvidia's killer products.\n\nImagine Nvidia maintaining its lead as the generative AI market grows. It's not hard to see the stock soaring even higher over the next few years.\n\nOn the other hand, the good financial news and a whole lot of forward-looking expectations are already priced into Nvidia's stock. Shares are changing hands at glossy valuation ratios such as 82 times free cash flow and 40 times sales -- levels usually reserved for small-cap start-ups with more sizzle than substance.\n\nAt the same time, Nvidia doesn't stand unchallenged in the AI accelerator market. Arch rival Advanced Micro Devices (AMD -1.71%) has its Instinct line of cost-effective AI chips. The Intel (INTC 0.63%) Gaudi series boasts impressive performance per watt of electric power. And that's just the top of a large heap. There's more than one way to design an AI-crunching system, and rival solutions may offer compelling alternatives for specific use cases. Who's to say that Nvidia will hang on to its market-defining lead in the long run?\n\nSeparately, the issues of high valuation and strong competition should be enough to give most investors pause before slamming that \"buy\" button on Nvidia stock. Together, it's a high-wire act with a long way down. Nvidia's stock is priced for perfection and any misstep -- such as a major AI contract lost to Intel or AMD -- will probably result in a quick and painful price drop.\n\nI'm not saying you should sell every Nvidia share right now and never look back. The company could very well stave off the army of rivals and continue to innovate on a hard-to-match level. Indeed, a bit of Nvidia exposure could serve your portfolio well over the years.\n\nMeanwhile, I highly recommend taking some profits off the table by selling a portion of your long-term Nvidia holdings. The gains are more than substantial and I'm sure you can find more stable and secure ways to invest that money in the AI market.\n\nSo on the scale of buy, sell, or hold, I see Nvidia as a stock to hold for the long run. I'd rather sell a few shares than buy more at these nosebleed-inducing share prices. Your mileage may vary, depending on your appetite for market risk and AI-driven excitement.

Find out how we test here.\n\nNvidia has become the world's most valuable company due to its dominance in the market for AI chips. The company's stock price has skyrocketed over the past year, driven by the surge in demand for its GPUs used in building AI systems. Nvidia's rise has been incredibly fast.\n\nJust two years ago, the company was valued at a little over $400 billion. Now, it's worth more than $3 trillion. This rapid growth is largely due to Nvidia's CEO, Jensen Huang, who saw the potential of AI early on and built his company around this technology.\n\nNvidia currently controls over 80% of the market for AI chips, hitting $3.336 trillion market value on June 18 for the first time. The company's chips are in high demand by big tech companies like Microsoft, Apple, and Google, all of which are building their own AI systems. However, these companies are also developing their own AI chips to reduce their dependence on Nvidia.\n\nDespite the competition, Nvidia's future looks bright. The company has a significant head start in the AI chip market and a large community of AI programmers who prefer its technology. Nvidia is also investing in new areas like supercomputers, which are powerful machines used for scientific research and other demanding tasks.\n\nWhile tech giants like Microsoft, Google, Amazon, and Meta along with chipmakers AMD and Intel are all pushing their own AI chip designs, Nvidia's CEO remains confident. He sees their head start of a decade and a strong base of AI programmers comfortable with their technology as a significant advantage that won't be easily overcome. While some analysts are concerned about the sustainability of Nvidia's growth, the company is confident that it can maintain its lead in the AI chip market. Nvidia's rise to the top is a sign of how much artificial intelligence is transforming the tech industry.\n\nNvidia is not finished for this year yet, with its 'Blackwell' GPU architecture and a gaming-focus RTX 50 series expected between now and the end of the year.", "source": {"uri": "pcguide.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "PC Guide"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nvidia", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nvidia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indie_game", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Indie game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_computer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Personal computer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Software"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jensen_Huang", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jensen Huang"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programmer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Programmer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphics_processing_unit", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Graphics processing unit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Google"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AMD", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "AMD"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta_Platforms", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Meta Platforms"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nvidia_RTX", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nvidia RTX"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology_company", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Technology company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_(company)", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Amazon (company)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supercomputer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Supercomputer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intel", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Intel"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Marketing_and_Advertising/Consulting", "label": "dmoz/Business/Marketing and Advertising/Consulting", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Information_Technology/Marketing_and_Advertising", "label": "dmoz/Business/Information Technology/Marketing and Advertising", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence/Publications", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence/Publications", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence/Games", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence/Games", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence/Philosophy", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence/Philosophy", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 89}], "image": "https://www.pcguide.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Samsung-TV-remote-codes-featured-image-128.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9658445", "eventUri": "eng-9658445", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-18", "textStart": 903, "textEnd": 910}], "sentiment": 0.2627450980392156, "wgt": 181, "relevance": 1}

That was certainly exciting for shareholders, as it turned a 50-share holding into 500 shares and a 100-share position into a 1,000-share one. (Of course, the stock price was immediately adjusted down proportionately, leaving everyone's total holding value largely unchanged. Stock splits are mostly nothing burgers.)\n\nThere are far more interesting and/or amazing things to know about Nvidia, though. Here's a review of seven of them.\n\nIt was only in 2018 when Apple was being hailed as the first American trillion-dollar company. Well, here we are, with Nvidia valued at more than $3 trillion at the time of this writing. Indeed, as of mid-March, Nvidia had added $1 trillion to its market value in just the previous 50 days. Oh, and by the way -- the company was only founded in 1993.\n\n2. Nvidia's stock has been a phenomenal performer\n\nAs you might suspect, if you didn't already know, Nvidia's stock has grown at an incredible pace in recent years. Consider that the overall stock market has averaged annual gains close to 10% over many decades. Nvidia has had a shorter run, of course, but its average annual gain over the last 15 years was a whopping 50%, as of this writing. Over the past 10 years, it has averaged 75%, and over the past five years, the stock has averaged 104%, roughly doubling annually. (In the past year, the stock has more than tripled.)\n\nThose numbers might have you rushing to visit your brokerage to order shares of Nvidia, but never do so based solely on past returns. They don't necessarily dictate future returns, after all, and the bigger a company gets, the harder it can often be to grow rapidly. Plus, some phenomenal growth stocks can end up overvalued for a while.\n\n3. Nvidia has pivoted its business effectively\n\nNvidia made a name for itself as a titan in the gaming-chip business -- introducing the world's first graphics processing unit (GPU), GeForce, in 1999 and launching an industry. But things have changed recently. Whereas Nvidia used to get most of its revenue from gaming chips, it got fully 80% of its revenue from its data-center-related technology, as of its third quarter. That's quite a pivot.\n\nThe reason behind the pivot is that Nvidia's data center platform is heavily used for artificial intelligence (AI) endeavors, which need a lot of computing power. Nvidia is investing in AI companies on its own, as well.\n\nLooking at Nvidia's business performance shows that its stock surge isn't whimsy -- it's based on stunning revenue growth:\n\nData source: Morningstar.com, as of mid-June, 2024.\n\n4. Nvidia's co-founder and CEO Jensen Huang is impressive, too\n\nIt should be clear that Nvidia's leader Jensen Huang is a standout, as any leader would have to be to oversee such a success story. But there's much more to the Taiwan-born American.\n\nFor one thing, he's now on lists of the richest people in the world, but as a youth, he attended the Oneida Baptist Institute in Kentucky, which was a religious reform school -- by accident. (His uncle had mistaken the school for a prestigious boarding school.) There's now a Huang girls' dormitory and classroom building at the school.\n\nHuang understands hard work, having had to clean bathrooms at his boarding school and later working at a Denny's in California, where he and his friends came up with the idea of Nvidia.\n\n5. Nvidia is a fairly flat organization\n\nIn many major companies, it's common for a CEO to have fairly few direct reports. At Nvidia, Huang had 50 direct reports as of late 2023, explaining that \"The more direct reports the CEO has, the less layers are in the company... It allows us to keep information fluid, allows us to make sure that everyone is empowered by information.\"\n\n6. Nvidia nearly went bankrupt in its early years\n\nFew great companies never encounter serious challenges and setbacks, and Nvidia is no exception. The company nearly went bankrupt in its first few years. As Huang has explained: \"I think when you build a company from the ground up, and you've experienced real adversity, and you really experienced nearly going out of business several times, that feeling stays with you...\" adding, \"I don't wake up proud and confident. I wake up worried and concerned.\"\n\nHuang has also said: \"I think during adversity you're more focused. And when you're more focused, you could perform better.\"\n\n7. Nvidia, after its great run, may still be worth buying\n\nAfter Nvidia's colossal gains, it's certainly not the bargain it once was, and those who bought earlier will enjoy bigger total gains than those who buy today. Plenty of people actually think the stock is not the best bet right now, for various reasons -- including a valuation that some see as less compelling than those of some other stocks.\n\nBut if you plan to be a long-term holder of Nvidia shares, buying at recent levels can end up rewarding you -- even if the stock pulls back for a while.\n\nWhether you buy now, add the company to your watchlist, or just pass, you can't deny that Nvidia is an amazing company -- for many reasons. If you're on the fence about buying, consider doing so in installments.\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Nvidia wasn't one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years.\n\nConsider when Nvidia made this list on April 15, 2005... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you'd have $808,105!*\n\nStock Advisor provides investors with an easy-to-follow blueprint for success, including guidance on building a portfolio, regular updates from analysts, and two new stock picks each month.

Meanwhile, Microsoft's market cap is currently at $3.32 trillion, and Apple's is at $3.28 trillion. Nvidia's stock is up 181.7% so far this year.\n\nEarlier this month, Nvidia briefly passed Apple in total market cap, reaching the $3 trillion threshold for the first time. In February, Nvidia became the first semiconductor company to reach a $2 trillion valuation after it reported record fourth-quarter earnings.\n\nIn May, Nvidia beat Wall Street's expectations, reporting record first-quarter revenue of $26 billion for fiscal year 2025 -- up 262% from the previous year. After its first-quarter earnings report, Nvidia's stock price opened above $1,000, but it has since initiated a 10-for-1 stock split.\n\nNvidia's Hopper chips, which are used for training and inferencing some of the world's most powerful artificial intelligence models, have propelled the company's revenue and value amid the generative AI boom. In March, Nvidia unveiled Hopper's successor, Blackwell, which it said will start shipping in the second quarter of this year, and be with customers in the fourth quarter. Nvidia chief executive Jensen Huang said the company will see revenue from its Blackwell AI platform this year.\n\nEarlier this month, Huang announced Blackwell's successors, the Blackwell Ultra chip for 2025, and next-generation AI chip platform, Rubin, coming in 2026. He said Nvidia plans to announce new chips on a \"one-year rhythm.\"", "source": {"uri": "qz.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Quartz"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nvidia", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nvidia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_capitalization", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Market capitalization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_company", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Public company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valuation_(finance)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Valuation (finance)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semiconductor", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Semiconductor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wall_Street", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Wall Street"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiscal_year", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fiscal year"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hopper_(microarchitecture)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hopper (microarchitecture)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Generative artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jensen_Huang", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jensen Huang"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock_split", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Stock split"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks_and_Bonds", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks and Bonds", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Marketing_and_Advertising", "label": "dmoz/Business/Marketing and Advertising", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Marketing_and_Advertising/Consulting", "label": "dmoz/Business/Marketing and Advertising/Consulting", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Information_Technology/Marketing_and_Advertising", "label": "dmoz/Business/Information Technology/Marketing and Advertising", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 89}], "image": "https://i.kinja-img.com/image/upload/c_fill,h_675,pg_1,q_80,w_1200/4c9cd5e50c8383a44cb83e82f7e5a94e.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9658445", "eventUri": "eng-9658445", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2392156862745098, "wgt": 181, "relevance": 1}

Steve Jobs had recently returned to lead Apple. Intel was the dominant force in semiconductors. And a little-known chipmaker named Nvidia made its debut on the Nasdaq stock exchange.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nIt took less than three years for Nvidia Corp. to ascend into the S&P 500 -- replacing the disgraced oil-trading conglomerate Enron, no less.\n\nBut even then, few people would have bet that the company would go on to become the best performing stock of the last quarter-century, posting a total return of 591,078% since its initial public offering, including reinvested dividends. It's a difficult number to comprehend and a testament, in part, to the financial mania brewing around artificial intelligence and how investors have come to see Nvidia -- which makes the cutting-edge chips powering the technology -- as the single-biggest winner of the boom.\n\nOn Tuesday, that run culminated in Nvidia unseating Microsoft Corp. as the world's most valuable company with a market capitalization of $3.34 trillion.\n\nThe company's rise was by no means assured -- and neither is its staying power at the top of the S&P 500. Long-time investors in Nvidia have had to stomach three annual collapses of 50% or more in the stock. Sustaining the current rally will require customers to keep spending billions of dollars a quarter on AI equipment, whose returns on investment are so far relatively small.\n\nWhat ultimately paved the way for Nvidia to climb to the top, though, was the company's big bet on graphics chips and the vision of co-founder and Chief Executive Officer Jensen Huang that the industry would shift to what he calls \"accelerated computing,\" something his chips are inherently better at than the competition.\n\n\"You have to give the management team, I think, an enormous amount of credit,\" said Brian Mulberry, client portfolio manager at Zacks Investment Management. \"They have caught each wave of innovation in hardware perfectly well.\"\n\nBetween its debut and entering the S&P 500, Nvidia had gained more than 1,600%, giving it a market value of about $8 billion. That rise came as many other technology stocks were cratering in the aftermath of the dot-com bubble, which peaked in March 2000.\n\nThe company's key to early success: getting its technology in video-game consoles like Microsoft's Xbox and Sony's PlayStation. Nvidia's GeForce graphics processing units, or GPUs, became objects of desire among gamers because they consistently offered the most realistic experience.\n\n\"Jensen was always a great communicator, told a good story, and clearly GPUs were becoming more important,\" said Rhys Williams, chief strategist at Wayve Capital Management, who was a buyer in the IPO. \"Each successive generation of hardware gave a lot better performance, a lot more realistic picture and then PC gaming really came into being.\"\n\nLitigation and Competition\n\nThe next six years weren't kind to Nvidia. The stock plunged in 2008 as the financial crisis weakened demand and long-struggling rival Advanced Micro Devices Inc. started upping its game.\n\nMeanwhile, an agreement between Nvidia and Intel that allowed the companies to use each other's capabilities went sour, forcing Nvidia out of one of its biggest markets. The two settled in 2011, with Intel agreeing to pay Nvidia $1.5 billion.\n\nThe following year, Nvidia unveiled graphics chips for servers inside data centers. They could help sophisticated computing work such as oil and gas exploration and weather prediction, giving Nvidia a foothold in what would become a lucrative market. However, those chips did not immediately fly off the shelf. It would take nearly nine years for Nvidia shares to surpass their 2007 high.\n\nCrypto and Covid\n\nNvidia shares were taking off again in 2015. During that period, Nvidia chips were becoming the foundation of emerging technologies, from advanced graphics interfaces to autonomous vehicles to a new wave of AI products.\n\nThat's when Shana Sissel, chief executive officer at Banrion Capital Management, first really took note of the company. She described a 2017 conference where Nvidia was more like a pageant winner than an investment idea.\n\n\"Every single speaker talked about Nvidia being the most important company,\" Sissel said. \"At that point, it was really on my radar screen.\"\n\nEven after demand from cryptocurrency miners dried up, data-center sales continued to grow. The Covid-19 pandemic boosted that business, as companies needed to purchase additional computing power to support remote work. Nvidia's data-center revenue rose by a multiple of eight from fiscal 2017 to fiscal 2021.\n\nAI Sales Explode\n\nNvidia's shares slumped in 2022 along with the rest of the technology sector, which was reeling from soaring interest rates and falling demand after the Covid-era boom.\n\nOpenAI's release of ChatGPT in late-2022 made an instant splash but it took time for investors to realize how Nvidia might benefit. Eventually, an explosion of interest in generative AI products including ChatGPT sent orders for Nvidia's chips through the roof.\n\nThe scale shocked nearly everyone in May 2023 when Nvidia's results beat even the most optimistic Wall Street estimates. The company gave a forecast for quarterly sales that was more than 50% above the average projection.\n\nNvidia's data-center sales eclipsed its gaming revenue for the first time in fiscal 2023. In Nvidia's current fiscal year, which ends in January, analysts expect those sales to top $100 billion.\n\n\"They have a very defensible place in the industry,\" said Williams. \"They're not gonna be 95% of market share forever, obviously, but it would be almost impossible for anybody to replace them.\"", "source": {"uri": "finance.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo!

The chip designer took an early lead in the AI hardware race, leading to incredible business results and skyrocketing stock prices.\n\nThe stock traded at a split-adjusted $14 per share when OpenAI released the ChatGPT generative AI engine, powered by thousands of Nvidia AI accelerator chips. Today, Nvidia's share price has soared to $131. With a $3.2 trillion market cap, it's one of the three most valuable companies in the stock market.\n\nDid you miss the boat on Nvidia's AI-based opportunity, or can the stock continue to rise from this lofty plateau? Let's find out.\n\nNvidia's financial success is indisputable. Revenues more than tripled year-over-year in the last two earnings reports. Free cash flows are consistently growing by about 500% in the same time frame. Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) and Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) are still more profitable than Nvidia, but the chip expert is catching up.\n\nMany market observers like to point out that the generative AI revolution is only getting started. ChatGPT is less than two years old. Only a couple of tech giants have come up with comparably powerful large language models (LLMs) so far, though many are working on their own long-term generative AI plans. Until further notice, Nvidia's accelerator chips are the gold standard against which other solutions must be measured. If you're building a strong AI system, Nvidia's solutions are the default and the industry standard. Others must develop and then prove some sort of unique advantage before winning AI contracts against Nvidia's killer products.\n\nImagine Nvidia maintaining its lead as the generative AI market grows. It's not hard to see the stock soaring even higher over the next few years.\n\nOn the other hand, the good financial news and a whole lot of forward-looking expectations are already priced into Nvidia's stock. Shares are changing hands at glossy valuation ratios such as 82 times free cash flow and 40 times sales -- levels usually reserved for small-cap start-ups with more sizzle than substance.\n\nAt the same time, Nvidia doesn't stand unchallenged in the AI accelerator market. Arch rival Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD) has its Instinct line of cost-effective AI chips. The Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) Gaudi series boasts impressive performance per watt of electric power. And that's just the top of a large heap. There's more than one way to design an AI-crunching system, and rival solutions may offer compelling alternatives for specific use cases. Who's to say that Nvidia will hang on to its market-defining lead in the long run?\n\nSeparately, the issues of high valuation and strong competition should be enough to give most investors pause before slamming that \"buy\" button on Nvidia stock. Together, it's a high-wire act with a long way down. Nvidia's stock is priced for perfection and any misstep -- such as a major AI contract lost to Intel or AMD -- will probably result in a quick and painful price drop.\n\nI'm not saying you should sell every Nvidia share right now and never look back. The company could very well stave off the army of rivals and continue to innovate on a hard-to-match level. Indeed, a bit of Nvidia exposure could serve your portfolio well over the years.\n\nMeanwhile, I highly recommend taking some profits off the table by selling a portion of your long-term Nvidia holdings. The gains are more than substantial and I'm sure you can find more stable and secure ways to invest that money in the AI market.\n\nSo on the scale of buy, sell, or hold, I see Nvidia as a stock to hold for the long run. I'd rather sell a few shares than buy more at these nosebleed-inducing share prices. Your mileage may vary, depending on your appetite for market risk and AI-driven excitement. Feel free to do your own research and reach different conclusions. Just don't say I didn't warn you if or when Nvidia's big price correction comes.\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Nvidia wasn't one of them.

Investors now say the company is worth over $3.3 trillion.\n\nNvidia has seen soaring demand for its semiconductors, which are used to power artificial intelligence applications. Revenue more than tripled in the latest quarter from the same period a year earlier.\n\nThe company's journey to be one of the most prominent players in AI has produced some eye-popping numbers. Here's a look:\n\nNvidia's total market value as of the close Tuesday. It edged past Microsoft ($3.317 trillion). Apple is the third most-valuable company ($3.286 trillion). One year ago, the company had just crossed the $1 trillion threshold.\n\nThe one-day increase in Nvidia's market value on Tuesday.\n\nNvidia's closing stock price Tuesday. Two weeks ago the stock traded at more than $1,200, but the company completed a 10-for-1 stock split after trading closed on June 7. That gave each investor nine additional shares for every share they already owned. Companies with a high stock price often conduct stock splits to make the stock more affordable for investors.\n\nAnalysts' estimate for Nvidia's revenue for the fiscal year that ends in January 2025. That would be about double its revenue for fiscal 2024 and more than four times its receipts the year before that.\n\nNvidia's estimated net margin, or the percentage of revenue that gets turned into profit. Looked at another way, about 53 cents of every $1 in revenue Nvidia took in last year went to its bottom line.

Learn about their strategic moves and market impact.\n\nNvidia has overtaken Microsoft, becoming the most valuable company globally, driven by an insatiable demand for AI-driven computing power. As of now, Nvidia's stock is trading at $135.87, giving it a market capitalization of $3.34 trillion. This latest surge places it ahead of Microsoft, which is trailing closely with a market cap of $3.33 trillion.\n\nNvidia's ascent reflects broader market trends. While Nvidia experienced a 3.7% rise, Microsoft saw a 0.53% decrease, trading at $446.00. Apple, another tech giant, saw a dip of 1.26%, with its market cap now at $3.28 trillion. These shifts underscore Nvidia's increasing influence and the pivotal role AI technology is playing in the market.\n\nNvidia's announcement of a partnership with Hewlett Packard marks a significant milestone. The collaboration aims to introduce NVIDIA AI Computing and Private Cloud AI services. According to Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang, this venture will provide enterprises and AI professionals with cutting-edge computing resources, further enhancing AI's potential across industries.\n\nEarlier in January, Nvidia leapfrogged Apple to claim the second spot behind Microsoft. February saw Nvidia reporting an astounding $22.1 billion in revenue for Q4 2023 -- a 265% increase from the previous year. This financial success is bolstered by advanced GPUs like the Blackwell, which caters to the massive AI computing needs and partnerships with tech giants like Google, Meta, and OpenAI.\n\nNvidia is also making strides in robotics, a sector poised for significant growth. CEO Jensen Huang mentioned the company's focus on humanoid robotics, leveraging projects named Gr00t and Jetson Thor. Collaborations with manufacturing and automotive companies further highlight the expansive scope of Nvidia's technological leadership.\n\nThe climb to the top for Nvidia signifies more than just financial success; it reflects an industry-wide transformation driven by AI and advanced computing. As Huang noted, the future of robotics and AI promises to reshape every conceivable industry, making operations safer and more efficient.\n\nNvidia's remarkable journey to becoming the world's most valuable company heralds a new era in technology. The company's strategic partnerships, impressive financials, and forward-thinking innovations place it at the forefront of a rapidly evolving market, setting the stage for continued dominance in AI and computing.", "source": {"uri": "en.coinotag.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "COINOTAG NEWS"}, "authors": [{"uri": "marisol_navaro@en.coinotag.com", "name": "Marisol Navaro", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nvidia", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nvidia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computing", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Computing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_capitalization", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Market capitalization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jensen_Huang", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jensen Huang"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robotics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Robotics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_computing", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cloud computing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hewlett-Packard", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hewlett-Packard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta_Platforms", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Meta Platforms"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenAI", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "OpenAI"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphics_processing_unit", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Graphics processing unit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Google"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automotive_industry", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Automotive industry"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Information_Technology", "label": "dmoz/Business/Information Technology", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Information_Technology/Marketing_and_Advertising", "label": "dmoz/Business/Information Technology/Marketing and Advertising", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence/Publications", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence/Publications", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence/Games", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence/Games", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence/Philosophy", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence/Philosophy", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 59}], "image": "https://en.coinotag.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/cryptocurrencies-7.webp", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9658445", "eventUri": "eng-9658445", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1764705882352942, "wgt": 178, "relevance": 1}

Google parent company Alphabet ($2.169 trillion) and Amazon ($1.90 trillion) round out the top five.\n\nPart of what's led to Nvidia's recent success on the stock market is companies buying up its chips under the belief that artificial intelligence will play a major role in the future of the world's economy. Nvidia's stock price has climbed by more than 200% in the past year. The 3.2% increase in Nvidia's share price so far today, June 18, added more than $100 billion to the company's total market cap.\n\nEarlier in June, Nvidia conducted a 10:1 stock split that reduced the price per share, thus making shares more affordable. Nvidia's stock price is sitting at around $135 as of this writing.\n\nSome believe Nvidia still has a lot of growth ahead, with one analyst telling Bloomberg the company could reach a valuation of $5 trillion. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said earlier this month that generative AI could lead a new industrial revolution.\n\n\"Generative AI is reshaping industries and opening new opportunities for innovation and growth,\" he said. \"Today, we're at the cusp of a major shift in computing. The intersection of AI and accelerated computing is set to redefine the future.\"\n\nWhile many in the business world are hyping generative AI, it remains to be seen if lawmakers could get involved to try to regulate the market amid concerns by experts that AI is an extinction-level concern.\n\nIn the video game industry, Microsoft is pushing hard on generative AI and is working with ChatGPT company OpenAI to help put AI into every product it makes, including Xbox. One of the many concerns around the proliferation of AI in video game development is how it could impact the people who make games.

Steve Jobs had recently returned to lead Apple. Intel was the dominant force in semiconductors. And a little-known chipmaker named Nvidia made its debut on the Nasdaq stock exchange.\n\nIt took less than three years for Nvidia Corp. to ascend into the S&P 500 -- replacing the disgraced oil-trading conglomerate Enron, no less.\n\nBut even then, few people would have bet that the company would go on to become the best performing stock of the last quarter-century, posting a total return of 591,078% since its initial public offering, including reinvested dividends. It's a difficult number to comprehend and a testament, in part, to the financial mania brewing around artificial intelligence and how investors have come to see Nvidia -- which makes the cutting-edge chips powering the technology -- as the single-biggest winner of the boom.\n\nOn Tuesday, that run culminated in Nvidia unseating Microsoft Corp. as the world's most valuable company with a market capitalization of $3.34 trillion. More than $2 trillion of that value has been added this year.\n\nThe company's rise was by no means assured -- and neither is its staying power at the top of the S&P 500. Long-time investors in Nvidia have had to stomach three annual collapses of 50% or more in the stock. Sustaining the current rally will require customers to keep spending billions of dollars a quarter on AI equipment, whose returns on investment are so far relatively small.\n\nWhat ultimately paved the way for Nvidia to climb to the top, though, was the company's big bet on graphics chips and the vision of co-founder and Chief Executive Officer Jensen Huang that the industry would shift to what he calls \"accelerated computing,\" something his chips are inherently better at than the competition.\n\n\"You have to give the management team, I think, an enormous amount of credit,\" said Brian Mulberry, client portfolio manager at Zacks Investment Management. \"They have caught each wave of innovation in hardware perfectly well.\"\n\nHere's a look at Nvidia from its IPO to now.\n\nEarly Years\n\nNvidia got off to a hot start.\n\nBetween its debut and the time it entered the S&P 500, the stock gained more than 1,600%, giving it a market value of about $8 billion. That rise came as many other technology stocks were cratering in the aftermath of the dot-com bubble, which peaked in March 2000.\n\nThe company's key to early success: getting its technology in video-game consoles like Microsoft's Xbox and Sony's PlayStation. Nvidia's GeForce graphics processing units, or GPUs, became objects of desire among gamers because they consistently offered the most realistic experience.\n\n\"Jensen was always a great communicator, told a good story, and clearly GPUs were becoming more important,\" said Rhys Williams, chief strategist at Wayve Capital Management, who was a buyer in the IPO. \"Each successive generation of hardware gave a lot better performance, a lot more realistic picture and then PC gaming really came into being.\"\n\nLitigation and Competition\n\nThe next six years weren't kind to Nvidia. The stock plunged in 2008 as the financial crisis weakened demand and long-struggling rival Advanced Micro Devices Inc. started turning things around.\n\nMeanwhile, an agreement between Nvidia and Intel that allowed the companies to use each other's capabilities went sour, forcing Nvidia out of one of its biggest markets. The two settled in 2011, with Intel agreeing to pay Nvidia $1.5 billion.\n\nThe following year, Nvidia unveiled graphics chips for servers inside data centers. They could help sophisticated computing work such as oil and gas exploration and weather prediction, giving Nvidia a foothold in what would become a lucrative market. However, those chips did not immediately fly off the shelf. It would take nearly nine years for Nvidia shares to surpass their 2007 high.\n\nCrypto and Covid\n\nNvidia shares took off again in 2015. During that period, the company's chips were becoming the foundation of emerging technologies, from advanced graphics interfaces to autonomous vehicles to a new wave of AI products.\n\nThat's when Shana Sissel, chief executive officer at Banrion Capital Management, first really took note of the company. She described a 2017 conference where Nvidia was more like a pageant winner than an investment idea.\n\n\"Every single speaker talked about Nvidia being the most important company,\" Sissel said. \"At that point, it was really on my radar screen.\"\n\nEven after demand from cryptocurrency miners dried up, data-center sales continued to grow. The Covid-19 pandemic boosted that business, as companies needed to purchase additional computing power to support remote work. Nvidia's data-center revenue rose by a multiple of eight from fiscal 2017 to fiscal 2021.\n\nAI Sales Explode\n\nNvidia's shares slumped in 2022 along with the rest of the technology sector, which was reeling from soaring interest rates and falling demand after the Covid-era boom.\n\nOpenAI's release of ChatGPT in late-2022 made an instant splash but it took time for investors to realize how Nvidia might benefit. Eventually, interest in ChatGPT and other generative AI products exploded, triggering a frantic surge in orders for Nvidia's chips.\n\nWhen the company reported first-quarter 2023 earnings, the scale of the jump in its business shocked nearly everyone on Wall Street. Nvidia gave a forecast for quarterly sales that was more than 50% above the average projection.\n\nNvidia's data-center sales eclipsed its gaming revenue for the first time in fiscal 2023. In Nvidia's current fiscal year, analysts expect those sales to top $100 billion.\n\n\"They have a very defensible place in the industry,\" said Williams, the strategist at Wayve Capital Management. \"They're not gonna be 95% of market share forever, obviously, but it would be almost impossible for anybody to replace them.\"", "source": {"uri": "economictimes.indiatimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Economic Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S&P_500_Index", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "S&P 500 Index"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nvidia", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nvidia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Initial_public_offering", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Initial public offering"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphics_processing_unit", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Graphics processing unit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intel", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Intel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nasdaq", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nasdaq"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enron", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Enron"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Jobs", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Steve Jobs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Return_on_investment", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Return on investment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conglomerate_(company)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Conglomerate (company)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computing", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Computing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semiconductor", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Semiconductor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_capitalization", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Market capitalization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dividend", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dividend"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AMD", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "AMD"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dot-com_bubble", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dot-com bubble"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_crisis", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Financial crisis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PlayStation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "PlayStation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xbox_(console)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Xbox (console)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PC_game", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "PC game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_center", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Data center"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_value", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Market value"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sony", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sony"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks_and_Bonds", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks and Bonds", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Research_and_Analysis", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Research and Analysis", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Brokerages", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Brokerages", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Major_Companies", "label": "dmoz/Business/Major Companies", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://img.etimg.com/thumb/msid-111098354,width-1200,height-630,imgsize-62676,overlay-etmarkets/photo.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9658445", "eventUri": "eng-9658445", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2000-03-", "textStart": 2355, "textEnd": 2365}], "sentiment": 0.1843137254901961, "wgt": 178, "relevance": 1}

On June 18, Nvidia's shares climbed over 3%, boosting Huang's net worth to approximately $119 billion.\n\nHuang now ranks just behind former Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer on the Forbes rich list.\n\nThis marks his highest ranking yet, driven by Nvidia's status as the world's most valuable public company following a surge in artificial intelligence.\n\nHuang owns a 3% stake in Nvidia. At the beginning of 2024, Forbes estimated his net worth at $77 billion. Since then, Nvidia's market cap has soared by 177%, reaching $3.33 trillion.\n\nBack in 2019, Jensen Huang was ranked 546th on Forbes' list of the world's richest people.\n\nMost Valuable Company\n\nNvidia has become the world's most valuable company following a staggering rally in its shares, underlining the outsized role investors expect artificial intelligence to play in the global economy over the coming years.\n\nNvidia shares rose 3.5% on Tuesday, giving it a market value of about $3.34 trillion. That pushed the semiconductor bellwether past Microsoft and Apple, which had been jostling for the top spots in recent days.\n\nThe surge in Nvidia's market value has been driven by demand for its chips, which are the gold standard in the AI space. The company's shares are up more than 170% this year and have risen about 1,100% since their October 2022 low, news agency Reuters reported.\n\nBlockbuster earnings and broadening investor enthusiasm over AI are supercharging Nvidia's rally. That fervour has been reflected in Nvidia's market value, which took only 96 days to go from $2 trillion to $3 trillion.\n\nMicrosoft, one of the two other companies to reach those rarefied levels, took 945 days to go from $2 trillion to $3 trillion while Apple took 1,044 days to leap, according to Bespoke Investment Group.\n\nPreviously, just 11 U.S. companies since 1925 have reached the top spot in market value on a closing basis, according to Howard Silverblatt, senior index analyst at S&P Dow Jones Indices.\n\nFortunes have diverged for past holders of the top position in recent decades. Microsoft reached No. 1 in the late 1990s but then its shares struggled for years during the early 2000s following the dotcom bubble, only to come roaring back in the latter half of the last decade.\n\nExxon Mobil became the world's most valuable company in the 2000s but its shares retreated following a downturn in oil prices.\n\nTo some, Cisco is the cautionary tale. The company's shares peaked at over $80 in March 2000 in the midst of the dotcom boom, during which investors often assigned dizzying valuations to internet-related companies.\n\nBespoke's analysts recently contrasted the trajectories of Nvidia and Cisco, whose products were seen as essential in supporting the internet's infrastructure.\n\n\"Nvidia's run has been incredible, but it will need to keep growing from here and stave off competition if its stock is going to keep putting up stellar returns,\" Bespoke said in a recent note.\n\nFor now, Nvidia's earnings are supporting its stock price. Revenue more than tripled to $26 billion in the latest quarter, while net income jumped seven-fold to $14.9 billion.\n\nRevenue for the current fiscal year is expected to roughly double to $120 billion, and then rise another 33% in fiscal 2026, to $160 billion, according to LSEG data.\n\nNvidia's impressive financial performance and forecasts have led its stock valuation, by some measures, to moderate despite the surge in its share price. For example, Nvidia's forward price-to-earnings ratio last stood at 43, according to LSEG Datastream.\n\nThat is higher than the 25 level it stood at to start the year but below levels it reached for much of last year. By contrast, the S&P 500 trades at 21 times earnings.\n\nWhile Nvidia has been the standout performer, it is not the only stock to benefit from enthusiasm about the profit potential for AI. Shares of other technology companies, including Super Micro Computer and Arm Holdings, have also risen sharply this year.", "source": {"uri": "news18.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "News18"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jensen_Huang", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jensen Huang"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nvidia", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nvidia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_value", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Market value"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forbes", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Forbes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Net_worth", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Net worth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real-time_computing", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Real-time computing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Ballmer", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Steve Ballmer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_company", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Public company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billionaire", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Billionaire"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_capitalization", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Market capitalization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cisco", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cisco"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S&P_Dow_Jones_Indices", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "S&P Dow Jones Indices"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dot-com_bubble", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dot-com bubble"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semiconductor", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Semiconductor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_standard", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gold standard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_economy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "World economy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arm_(company)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Arm (company)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Price_of_oil", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Price of oil"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S&P_500_Index", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "S&P 500 Index"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock_valuation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Stock valuation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ExxonMobil", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "ExxonMobil"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valuation_(finance)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Valuation (finance)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Net_income", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Net income"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiscal_year", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fiscal year"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks_and_Bonds", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks and Bonds", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Research_and_Analysis", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Research and Analysis", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Major_Companies", "label": "dmoz/Business/Major Companies", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Major_Companies/Company_Rankings", "label": "dmoz/Business/Major Companies/Company Rankings", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://images.news18.com/ibnlive/uploads/2024/02/untitled-design-2024-02-18t235258.724-2024-02-2a2bd86a94d2edf73ca48f81123ddf48-16x9.jpg?impolicy=website&width=1200&height=675", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9658445", "eventUri": "eng-9658445", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-18", "textStart": 246, "textEnd": 253}, {"amb": false, "date": "2000-03-", "textStart": 2685, "textEnd": 2695}], "sentiment": 0.4823529411764707, "wgt": 177, "relevance": 1}

Last week, Nvidia surpassed Apple in market value for the first time since 2002, following a month-long battle for the top spot among tech stocks.\n\nInvestors have increasingly focused on Nvidia's pivotal role in AI, viewing it as the primary beneficiary of the technology's expansion. The company's revenue soared by over 125% last year, driven by robust demand for its H100 accelerators crucial for AI computing tasks.\n\nAccording to Daniel Ives of Wedbush Securities, the race to a $4 trillion market cap in tech will intensify between Nvidia, Apple, and Microsoft over the coming year. Microsoft, known for its investments in AI through partnerships like OpenAI, and Apple, which recently unveiled its AI strategy, are also seen as key players in the AI sector.\n\nNvidia's meteoric rise has not only bolstered its market position but also made its co-founder and CEO, Jensen Huang, one of the world's wealthiest individuals, with his net worth soaring to $119 billion. Analysts and investors highlight Nvidia's diversified offerings beyond chips, including proprietary software and a robust development ecosystem, as key factors driving its market leadership.\n\nWith Nvidia's GPU chips increasingly seen as essential in the tech sector amid the ongoing Fourth Industrial Revolution, analysts like Daniel Ives emphasize that Nvidia has positioned itself akin to \"the new gold or oil\" in technology.\n\n-With contributions from Bre Bradham and Kristine Owram", "source": {"uri": "naija247news.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Naija247news"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nvidia", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nvidia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semiconductor", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Semiconductor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_capitalization", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Market capitalization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computing", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Computing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_center", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Data center"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_value", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Market value"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Stock"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenAI", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "OpenAI"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jensen_Huang", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jensen Huang"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proprietary_software", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Proprietary software"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphics_processing_unit", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Graphics processing unit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petroleum", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Petroleum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gold"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourth_Industrial_Revolution", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fourth Industrial Revolution"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks_and_Bonds", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks and Bonds", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Information_Technology/Marketing_and_Advertising", "label": "dmoz/Business/Information Technology/Marketing and Advertising", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence/Publications", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence/Publications", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence/Games", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence/Games", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence/Philosophy", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence/Philosophy", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 96}], "image": "https://naija247news.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/NewLogoNaija2021-1.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9658445", "eventUri": "eng-9658445", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.4745098039215687, "wgt": 177, "relevance": 1}

The chip designer took an early lead in the AI hardware race, leading to incredible business results and skyrocketing stock prices.\n\nThe stock traded at a split-adjusted $14 per share when OpenAI released the ChatGPT generative AI engine, powered by thousands of Nvidia AI accelerator chips. Today, Nvidia's share price has soared to $131. With a $3.2 trillion market cap, it's one of the three most valuable companies in the stock market.\n\nDid you miss the boat on Nvidia's AI-based opportunity, or can the stock continue to rise from this lofty plateau? Let's find out.\n\nNvidia's financial success is indisputable. Revenues more than tripled year-over-year in the last two earnings reports. Free cash flows are consistently growing by about 500% in the same time frame. Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) and Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) are still more profitable than Nvidia, but the chip expert is catching up.\n\nMany market observers like to point out that the generative AI revolution is only getting started. ChatGPT is less than two years old. Only a couple of tech giants have come up with comparably powerful large language models (LLMs) so far, though many are working on their own long-term generative AI plans. Until further notice, Nvidia's accelerator chips are the gold standard against which other solutions must be measured. If you're building a strong AI system, Nvidia's solutions are the default and the industry standard. Others must develop and then prove some sort of unique advantage before winning AI contracts against Nvidia's killer products.\n\nImagine Nvidia maintaining its lead as the generative AI market grows. It's not hard to see the stock soaring even higher over the next few years.\n\nOn the other hand, the good financial news and a whole lot of forward-looking expectations are already priced into Nvidia's stock. Shares are changing hands at glossy valuation ratios such as 82 times free cash flow and 40 times sales -- levels usually reserved for small-cap start-ups with more sizzle than substance.\n\nAt the same time, Nvidia doesn't stand unchallenged in the AI accelerator market. Arch rival Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD) has its Instinct line of cost-effective AI chips. The Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) Gaudi series boasts impressive performance per watt of electric power. And that's just the top of a large heap. There's more than one way to design an AI-crunching system, and rival solutions may offer compelling alternatives for specific use cases. Who's to say that Nvidia will hang on to its market-defining lead in the long run?\n\nSeparately, the issues of high valuation and strong competition should be enough to give most investors pause before slamming that \"buy\" button on Nvidia stock. Together, it's a high-wire act with a long way down. Nvidia's stock is priced for perfection and any misstep -- such as a major AI contract lost to Intel or AMD -- will probably result in a quick and painful price drop.\n\nI'm not saying you should sell every Nvidia share right now and never look back. The company could very well stave off the army of rivals and continue to innovate on a hard-to-match level. Indeed, a bit of Nvidia exposure could serve your portfolio well over the years.\n\nMeanwhile, I highly recommend taking some profits off the table by selling a portion of your long-term Nvidia holdings. The gains are more than substantial and I'm sure you can find more stable and secure ways to invest that money in the AI market.\n\nSo on the scale of buy, sell, or hold, I see Nvidia as a stock to hold for the long run. I'd rather sell a few shares than buy more at these nosebleed-inducing share prices. Your mileage may vary, depending on your appetite for market risk and AI-driven excitement. Feel free to do your own research and reach different conclusions. Just don't say I didn't warn you if or when Nvidia's big price correction comes.", "source": {"uri": "fool.com.au", "dataType": "news", "title": "Motley Fool Australia"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Generative artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nasdaq", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nasdaq"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nvidia", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nvidia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ChatGPT", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "ChatGPT"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_capitalization", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Market capitalization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AMD", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "AMD"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AI_accelerator", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "AI accelerator"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenAI", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "OpenAI"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_cash_flow", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Free cash flow"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock_market", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stock market"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large_language_model", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Large language model"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_general_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Artificial general intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valuation_(finance)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Valuation (finance)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intel", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Intel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Startup_company", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Startup company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Particle_accelerator", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Particle accelerator"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gold"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Performance_per_watt", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Performance per watt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_power", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Electric power"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks_and_Bonds", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks and Bonds", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Research_and_Analysis", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Research and Analysis", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence/Games", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence/Games", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Major_Companies/Publicly_Traded", "label": "dmoz/Business/Major Companies/Publicly Traded", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 90}], "image": "https://www.fool.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/cash-in-hand-1200x675.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9658445", "eventUri": "eng-9658445", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3254901960784313, "wgt": 177, "relevance": 1}

Apple.\n\nThe top stocks have jockeyed all month for the pole position, with Nvidia finally edging past both of its big-tech peers.\n\nEarlier in the month, Nvidia capped Apple by market value for the first time since 2002, and the two went back and forth in rankings in recent days.\n\nLast week, Apple also overtook Microsoft to trade in the top spot briefly.\n\nThe ranking is yet another reminder that AI is the top focus of many investors.\n\nNvidia is seen as the biggest and earliest beneficiary of the technology as it dominates the market with its highly sought-after chips that help power data centers running complex computing tasks required by AI applications.\n\nDemand for its H100 accelerators are surging and helped drive the chipmaker's sales up by more than 125% last year.\n\nMicrosoft, for its part, is also seen as an early AI winner given its investment and partnership with OpenAI, which created ChatGPT.\n\nAnd, this week, Apple shares rallied after the iPhone

Nvidia has been riding the wave of accelerating adoption of artificial intelligence (AI), providing the graphics processing units (GPUs) that are the gold standard for powering the systems responsible for AI training and inference.\n\nThe company also completed a 10-for-1 stock split that was a hit with investors, driving the stock even higher.\n\nWith gains of that magnitude, it would be easy to conclude that the opportunity has passed, and the easy money has already been made. I think that view could be a costly one, as I predict that Nvidia's market cap is headed to $5 trillion, which would push its share price above $203, representing upside of 50% compared to the Tuesday's closing price.\n\nLet's take a look at how Nvidia could get there in the not-too-distant future.\n\nGenerative AI burst onto the scene last year, touting the ability to streamline and automate time-consuming and mundane tasks. The potential to increase worker productivity was met with cheers from corporate America as companies race to adopt these next-generation algorithms.\n\nNvidia supplies the processors with the computational horsepower necessary to run these AI systems. The company has been scrambling as demand has far outstripped supply. The supply shortages are beginning to ease as Nvidia has worked with its partners to ramp up production.\n\nFurthermore, the company has a virtual monopoly on machine learning (an earlier branch of AI) with an estimated 95% share of the market, according to data compiled by New Street Research. This helps explain why demand for generative AI quickly became a boon to Nvidia, given its proven expertise in the area.\n\nThere's more: The need to upgrade data centers to handle the rigors of AI has been at the heart of the current demand cycle, which is expected to continue. The vast majority of generative AI processing takes place in data centers and in the cloud, and it's estimated Nvidia controls 92% of the data center GPU market, according to IoT Analytics.\n\nRobust growth is expected to continue across the data center market, climbing from $302 billion in 2023 to $622 billion by 2030, according to Prescient and Strategic Intelligence Market Research. As the leading provider of data center GPUs, this trend favors Nvidia.\n\nLet's not forget, however, that it all began with the humble GPUs used to render lifelike images in video games, another area Nvidia dominates. Despite growing competition, it maintains a healthy lead in the industry it pioneered. In the first quarter of 2024, it controlled an 88% share of the discrete desktop GPU market, according to Jon Peddie Research.\n\nAs inflation subsides, the pent-up demand for new, state-of-the-art graphics cards will drive a new upgrade cycle for Nvidia gaming chips. Sales of gaming GPUs are expected to soar from $2.7 billion in 2023 to $11.7 billion by 2028, according to Mordor Intelligence. As the market leader, this trend also favors Nvidia.\n\nThe company has a number of other opportunities that could take off, including self-driving cars, professional visualization, and quantum computing, which currently make up just a small percentage of the company's overall sales.\n\nLastly, the Nvidia GB200 Grace Blackwell Superchip will be released later this year, setting a new standard for AI processing. The largest hyperscale cloud-infrastructure providers are already lining up to pay top dollar for these state-of-the-art AI platforms, which suggests the company will remain as the AI market leader.\n\nNvidia currently has a market cap of roughly $3.34 trillion, which means it will require stock price gains of roughly 50% to drive its value to $5 trillion. That seems like small change compared to its 2024 year-to-date gains of 174%, so it's likely just a matter of time.\n\nAccording to Wall Street's consensus estimates, the company is expected to generate revenue of $120.5 billion in fiscal 2025 (which began in January). That gives the stock a forward price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of roughly 28. If that P/S remains constant, Nvidia will need to generate annual revenue of roughly $180 billion to support a $5 trillion market cap.\n\nCoincidentally, Wall Street is already guiding for revenue growth of 98% in fiscal 2025 (this calendar year) and 33% in fiscal 2026. If the company hits those targets, it could achieve a $5 trillion market cap as early as 2026.\n\nDon't take my word for it. Rosenblatt Securities analyst Hans Mosesmann just reaffirmed his buy rating on Nvidia stock and assigned a Street-high $200 price target, citing greater demands for AI software and the release of the Blackwell architecture later this year.\n\nIt's important to note that there are no guarantees. Any failure to achieve investors' lofty ambitions -- real or perceived -- would likely be met with a quick and potentially brutal sell-off. On the other hand, it's just as likely that Nvidia's market dominance could continue, and the timeline calculated above could end up being conservative.\n\nThe stock is currently selling for 51 times forward earnings, which might seem expensive, but that doesn't take into consideration the stock's 27,570% gains over the past decade. To be clear, there's little chance the next decade will be as lucrative as the past 10 years have been.\n\nThat said, given Nvidia's dominant place in the industry and the gale-force secular tailwinds at its back, the chances it will be a market-beating investment in the coming years are exceptional.\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Nvidia wasn't one of them.

The portfolio is called Nvidia AI Computing by HPE.\n\n\"Generative AI and accelerated computing are fueling a fundamental transformation as every industry races to join the industrial revolution,\" Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said in a statement.\n\nHe further added, \"Never before have Nvidia and HPE integrated our technologies so deeply - combining the entire Nvidia AI computing stack along with HPE's private cloud technology - to equip enterprise clients and AI professionals with the most advanced computing infrastructure and services to expand the frontier of AI.\"\n\nNvidia specializes in making hardware mainly for video game consoles, GPUs for graphics cards, and processors for the AI industry. Its GPUs have also been deployed to mine cryptocurrencies such as Ethereum (ETH), Monero (XMR), and Zcash (ZEC).\n\nOver the last few years, the processors have been widely used in the AI industry to run large language models, the technology behind chatbots like ChatGPT, and several other AI applications. Nvidia's powerful A100 GPU, which reportedly cost $15,000 each in 2023, has been previously used by Microsoft to power advanced LLMs for its cloud customers.\n\nA report released by research firm TrendForce in March last year revealed that the number of Nvidia's graphics processing units that OpenAI's GPT model needed to process training data in 2020 came to about 20,000. As ChatGPT continues to evolve, that figure is also expected to continue to grow, it said.\n\nAlso read: Tech firms form alliances to challenge Nvidia in AI chip market\n\nAnalysts expect this demand to drive Nvidia's earnings going forward.

Earlier in the month, Nvidia's market cap reached $3 trillion for the first time, overtaking Apple.\n\nThis meteoric rise in Nvidia's stock, which has increased by over 170% year-to-date, gained a further boost following the company's robust first-quarter earnings report in May. The stock price has soared by more than ninefold since the end of 2022, a period that has coincided with the rapid development and integration of generative artificial intelligence technologies.\n\nNvidia has not only become the first chip company to surpass $3 trillion in market value but also marks the first $3 trillion company founded by an ethnic Chinese.

Today, Nvidia spans CPUs, GPUs, DPUs, and AI software, dominating the GPU and accelerated computing sector with over 90% global market share.\n\nAs Nvidia's market value surges, CEO Jensen Huang's personal wealth has also risen significantly. Ranked 12th on Bloomberg's global billionaire list with a net worth of $115 billion, Huang's leadership shows Nvidia's influence and market dominance in the AI and semiconductor sectors.\n\nMoreover, Nvidia executives, including Huang, have capitalized on the company's success, with substantial stock sales totaling over $700 million in the first half of this year.

Steve Jobs had recently returned to lead Apple (AAPL). Intel was the dominant force in semiconductors. And a little-known chipmaker named Nvidia (NVDA) made its debut on the Nasdaq stock exchange.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nIt took less than three years for Nvidia Corp. to ascend into the S&P 500 -- replacing the disgraced oil-trading conglomerate Enron, no less.\n\nBut even then, few people would have bet that the company would go on to become the best performing stock of the last quarter-century, posting a total return of 591,078% since its initial public offering, including reinvested dividends. It's a difficult number to comprehend and a testament, in part, to the financial mania brewing around artificial intelligence and how investors have come to see Nvidia -- which makes the cutting-edge chips powering the technology -- as the single-biggest winner of the boom.\n\nOn Tuesday, that run culminated in Nvidia unseating Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) as the world's most valuable company with a market capitalization of $3.34 trillion.\n\nThe company's rise was by no means assured -- and neither is its staying power at the top of the S&P 500. Long-time investors in Nvidia have had to stomach three annual collapses of 50% or more in the stock. Sustaining the current rally will require customers to keep spending billions of dollars a quarter on AI equipment, whose returns on investment are so far relatively small.\n\nWhat ultimately paved the way for Nvidia to climb to the top, though, was the company's big bet on graphics chips and the vision of co-founder and Chief Executive Officer Jensen Huang that the industry would shift to what he calls \"accelerated computing,\" something his chips are inherently better at than the competition.\n\n\"You have to give the management team, I think, an enormous amount of credit,\" said Brian Mulberry, client portfolio manager at Zacks Investment Management. \"They have caught each wave of innovation in hardware perfectly well.\"\n\nBetween its debut and the time it entered the S&P 500, the stock gained more than 1,600%, giving it a market value of about $8 billion. That rise came as many other technology stocks were cratering in the aftermath of the dot-com bubble, which peaked in March 2000.\n\nThe company's key to early success: getting its technology in video-game consoles like Microsoft's Xbox and Sony's PlayStation. Nvidia's GeForce graphics processing units, or GPUs, became objects of desire among gamers because they consistently offered the most realistic experience.\n\n\"Jensen was always a great communicator, told a good story, and clearly GPUs were becoming more important,\" said Rhys Williams, chief strategist at Wayve Capital Management, who was a buyer in the IPO. \"Each successive generation of hardware gave a lot better performance, a lot more realistic picture and then PC gaming really came into being.\"\n\nLitigation and Competition\n\nThe next six years weren't kind to Nvidia. The stock plunged in 2008 as the financial crisis weakened demand and long-struggling rival Advanced Micro Devices Inc. started turning things around.\n\nMeanwhile, an agreement between Nvidia and Intel that allowed the companies to use each other's capabilities went sour, forcing Nvidia out of one of its biggest markets. The two settled in 2011, with Intel agreeing to pay Nvidia $1.5 billion.\n\nThe following year, Nvidia unveiled graphics chips for servers inside data centers. They could help sophisticated computing work such as oil and gas exploration and weather prediction, giving Nvidia a foothold in what would become a lucrative market. However, those chips did not immediately fly off the shelf. It would take nearly nine years for Nvidia shares to surpass their 2007 high.\n\nCrypto and Covid\n\nNvidia shares took off again in 2015. During that period, the company's chips were becoming the foundation of emerging technologies, from advanced graphics interfaces to autonomous vehicles to a new wave of AI products.\n\nThat's when Shana Sissel, chief executive officer at Banrion Capital Management, first really took note of the company. She described a 2017 conference where Nvidia was more like a pageant winner than an investment idea.\n\n\"Every single speaker talked about Nvidia being the most important company,\" Sissel said. \"At that point, it was really on my radar screen.\"\n\nEven after demand from cryptocurrency miners dried up, data-center sales continued to grow. The Covid-19 pandemic boosted that business, as companies needed to purchase additional computing power to support remote work. Nvidia's data-center revenue rose by a multiple of eight from fiscal 2017 to fiscal 2021.\n\nAI Sales Explode\n\nNvidia's shares slumped in 2022 along with the rest of the technology sector, which was reeling from soaring interest rates and falling demand after the Covid-era boom.\n\nOpenAI's release of ChatGPT in late-2022 made an instant splash but it took time for investors to realize how Nvidia might benefit. Eventually, interest in ChatGPT and other generative AI products exploded, triggering a frantic surge in orders for Nvidia's chips.\n\nWhen the company reported first-quarter 2023 earnings, the scale of the jump in its business shocked nearly everyone on Wall Street. Nvidia gave a forecast for quarterly sales that was more than 50% above the average projection.\n\nNvidia's data-center sales eclipsed its gaming revenue for the first time in fiscal 2023. In Nvidia's current fiscal year, analysts expect those sales to top $100 billion.\n\n\"They have a very defensible place in the industry,\" said Williams, the strategist at Wayve Capital Management. \"They're not gonna be 95% of market share forever, obviously, but it would be almost impossible for anybody to replace them.\"", "source": {"uri": "ca.finance.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo!

Steve Jobs had recently returned to lead Apple. Intel was the dominant force in semiconductors. And a little-known chipmaker named Nvidia made its debut on the Nasdaq stock exchange.\n\nIt took less than three years for Nvidia Corp. to ascend into the S&P 500 -- replacing the disgraced oil-trading conglomerate Enron, no less.\n\nBut even then, few people would have bet that the company would go on to become the best performing stock of the last quarter-century, posting a total return of 591,078 percent since its initial public offering, including reinvested dividends. It's a difficult number to comprehend and a testament, in part, to the financial mania brewing around artificial intelligence and how investors have come to see Nvidia -- which makes the cutting-edge chips powering the technology -- as the single-biggest winner of the boom.\n\nOn Tuesday, that run culminated in Nvidia unseating Microsoft Corp. as the world's most valuable company with a market capitalization of $3.34 trillion. More than $2 trillion of that value has been added this year.\n\nThe company's rise was by no means assured -- and neither is its staying power at the top of the S&P 500. Long-time investors in Nvidia have had to stomach three annual collapses of 50 percent or more in the stock.

That was certainly exciting for shareholders, as it turned a 50-share holding into 500 shares and a 100-share position into a 1,000-share one. (Of course, the stock price was immediately adjusted down proportionately, leaving everyone's total holding value largely unchanged. Stock splits are mostly nothing burgers.)\n\nThere are far more interesting and/or amazing things to know about Nvidia, though. Here's a review of seven of them.\n\nIt was only in 2018 when Apple was being hailed as the first American trillion-dollar company. Well, here we are, with Nvidia valued at more than $3 trillion at the time of this writing. Indeed, as of mid-March, Nvidia had added $1 trillion to its market value in just the previous 50 days. Oh, and by the way -- the company was only founded in 1993.\n\nAs you might suspect, if you didn't already know, Nvidia's stock has grown at an incredible pace in recent years. Consider that the overall stock market has averaged annual gains close to 10% over many decades. Nvidia has had a shorter run, of course, but its average annual gain over the last 15 years was a whopping 50%, as of this writing. Over the past 10 years, it has averaged 75%, and over the past five years, the stock has averaged 104%, roughly doubling annually. (In the past year, the stock has more than tripled.)\n\nThose numbers might have you rushing to visit your brokerage to order shares of Nvidia, but never do so based solely on past returns. They don't necessarily dictate future returns, after all, and the bigger a company gets, the harder it can often be to grow rapidly. Plus, some phenomenal growth stocks can end up overvalued for a while.\n\nNvidia made a name for itself as a titan in the gaming-chip business -- introducing the world's first graphics processing unit (GPU), GeForce, in 1999 and launching an industry. But things have changed recently. Whereas Nvidia used to get most of its revenue from gaming chips, it got fully 80% of its revenue from its data-center-related technology, as of its third quarter. That's quite a pivot.\n\nThe reason behind the pivot is that Nvidia's data center platform is heavily used for artificial intelligence (AI) endeavors, which need a lot of computing power. Nvidia is investing in AI companies on its own, as well.\n\nLooking at Nvidia's business performance shows that its stock surge isn't whimsy -- it's based on stunning revenue growth:\n\nData source: Morningstar.com, as of mid-June, 2024.\n\nIt should be clear that Nvidia's leader Jensen Huang is a standout, as any leader would have to be to oversee such a success story. But there's much more to the Taiwan-born American.\n\nFor one thing, he's now on lists of the richest people in the world, but as a youth, he attended the Oneida Baptist Institute in Kentucky, which was a religious reform school -- by accident. (His uncle had mistaken the school for a prestigious boarding school.) There's now a Huang girls' dormitory and classroom building at the school.\n\nHuang understands hard work, having had to clean bathrooms at his boarding school and later working at a Denny's in California, where he and his friends came up with the idea of Nvidia.\n\nIn many major companies, it's common for a CEO to have fairly few direct reports. At Nvidia, Huang had 50 direct reports as of late 2023, explaining that \"The more direct reports the CEO has, the less layers are in the company... It allows us to keep information fluid, allows us to make sure that everyone is empowered by information.\"\n\nFew great companies never encounter serious challenges and setbacks, and Nvidia is no exception. The company nearly went bankrupt in its first few years. As Huang has explained: \"I think when you build a company from the ground up, and you've experienced real adversity, and you really experienced nearly going out of business several times, that feeling stays with you...\" adding, \"I don't wake up proud and confident. I wake up worried and concerned.\"\n\nHuang has also said: \"I think during adversity you're more focused. And when you're more focused, you could perform better.\"\n\nAfter Nvidia's colossal gains, it's certainly not the bargain it once was, and those who bought earlier will enjoy bigger total gains than those who buy today. Plenty of people actually think the stock is not the best bet right now, for various reasons -- including a valuation that some see as less compelling than those of some other stocks.\n\nBut if you plan to be a long-term holder of Nvidia shares, buying at recent levels can end up rewarding you -- even if the stock pulls back for a while.\n\nWhether you buy now, add the company to your watchlist, or just pass, you can't deny that Nvidia is an amazing company -- for many reasons. If you're on the fence about buying, consider doing so in installments.\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Nvidia wasn't one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years.\n\nConsider when Nvidia made this list on April 15, 2005... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you'd have $808,105!*\n\nStock Advisor provides investors with an easy-to-follow blueprint for success, including guidance on building a portfolio, regular updates from analysts, and two new stock picks each month.

This propelled the company ahead of Microsoft in terms of value, having already leapfrogged fellow tech titan Apple earlier this month, making it the most valuable company globally.\n\nWhat makes the firm so valuable?\n\nPreviously renowned as a computer chip giant specialising in graphics cards, Nvidia has recently dominated the artificial intelligence (AI) chips market - specifically those required to train and operate the powerful AI models that run generative AI software like OpenAI's ChatGPT. Generative AI has emerged as the central battlefield in the tech arena over the past 18 months, with some experts suggesting it could be as transformative an innovation as the internet itself in the coming years.\n\nThe buzz around this technology has ignited a fierce competition among some of the world's largest companies including Apple, Amazon, Google, Meta, Microsoft and others to develop new AI products. As the primary manufacturer of AI chips, Nvidia has seen a significant surge in its sales and profits. The firm's stock price has been further bolstered by some investors' belief that it could climb even higher, given the anticipated increase in AI demand.\n\nHow fast has Nvidia's value grown?\n\nNvidia's share price has been on a steady incline for several years, but it was this year that it truly skyrocketed. The tech giant's value more than doubled in 2024, with shares now priced at nearly 136 US dollars each. In stark contrast, at the start of 2023, shares were valued at less than 15 US dollars each, and five years ago they were worth less than four US dollars.\n\nIs it likely to keep growing?\n\nMany investors are confident that the demand for AI will only continue to grow, suggesting Nvidia's value could climb even higher. Some even believe the company is now neck-and-neck with Microsoft and Apple in the race to be the first to reach a four trillion US dollar valuation within the next year.\n\nHowever, there are those who question whether such significant gains are sustainable in the future, given the intensifying competition Nvidia is likely to face.

Nvidia has been riding the wave of accelerating adoption of artificial intelligence (AI), providing the graphics processing units (GPUs) that are the gold standard for powering the systems responsible for AI training and inference.\n\nThe company also completed a 10-for-1 stock split that was a hit with investors, driving the stock even higher.\n\nWith gains of that magnitude, it would be easy to conclude that the opportunity has passed, and the easy money has already been made. I think that view could be a costly one, as I predict that Nvidia's market cap is headed to $5 trillion, which would push its share price above $203, representing upside of 50% compared to the Tuesday's closing price.\n\nLet's take a look at how Nvidia could get there in the not-too-distant future.\n\nThe Nvidia GB200 Grace Blackwell Superchip. Image source: Nvidia.\n\nMore of the same\n\nGenerative AI burst onto the scene last year, touting the ability to streamline and automate time-consuming and mundane tasks. The potential to increase worker productivity was met with cheers from corporate America as companies race to adopt these next-generation algorithms.\n\nNvidia supplies the processors with the computational horsepower necessary to run these AI systems. The company has been scrambling as demand has far outstripped supply. The supply shortages are beginning to ease as Nvidia has worked with its partners to ramp up production.\n\nFurthermore, the company has a virtual monopoly on machine learning (an earlier branch of AI) with an estimated 95% share of the market, according to data compiled by New Street Research. This helps explain why demand for generative AI quickly became a boon to Nvidia, given its proven expertise in the area.\n\nThere's more: The need to upgrade data centers to handle the rigors of AI has been at the heart of the current demand cycle, which is expected to continue. The vast majority of generative AI processing takes place in data centers and in the cloud, and it's estimated Nvidia controls 92% of the data center GPU market, according to IoT Analytics.\n\nRobust growth is expected to continue across the data center market, climbing from $302 billion in 2023 to $622 billion by 2030, according to Prescient and Strategic Intelligence Market Research. As the leading provider of data center GPUs, this trend favors Nvidia.\n\nLet's not forget, however, that it all began with the humble GPUs used to render lifelike images in video games, another area Nvidia dominates. Despite growing competition, it maintains a healthy lead in the industry it pioneered. In the first quarter of 2024, it controlled an 88% share of the discrete desktop GPU market, according to Jon Peddie Research.\n\nAs inflation subsides, the pent-up demand for new, state-of-the-art graphics cards will drive a new upgrade cycle for Nvidia gaming chips. Sales of gaming GPUs are expected to soar from $2.7 billion in 2023 to $11.7 billion by 2028, according to Mordor Intelligence. As the market leader, this trend also favors Nvidia.\n\nThe company has a number of other opportunities that could take off, including self-driving cars, professional visualization, and quantum computing, which currently make up just a small percentage of the company's overall sales.\n\nLastly, the Nvidia GB200 Grace Blackwell Superchip will be released later this year, setting a new standard for AI processing. The largest hyperscale cloud-infrastructure providers are already lining up to pay top dollar for these state-of-the-art AI platforms, which suggests the company will remain as the AI market leader.\n\nThe path to $5 trillion\n\nNvidia currently has a market cap of roughly $3.34 trillion, which means it will require stock price gains of roughly 50% to drive its value to $5 trillion. That seems like small change compared to its 2024 year-to-date gains of 174%, so it's likely just a matter of time.\n\nAccording to Wall Street's consensus estimates, the company is expected to generate revenue of $120.5 billion in fiscal 2025 (which began in January). That gives the stock a forward price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of roughly 28. If that P/S remains constant, Nvidia will need to generate annual revenue of roughly $180 billion to support a $5 trillion market cap.\n\nCoincidentally, Wall Street is already guiding for revenue growth of 98% in fiscal 2025 (this calendar year) and 33% in fiscal 2026. If the company hits those targets, it could achieve a $5 trillion market cap as early as 2026.\n\nDon't take my word for it. Rosenblatt Securities analyst Hans Mosesmann just reaffirmed his buy rating on Nvidia stock and assigned a Street-high $200 price target, citing greater demands for AI software and the release of the Blackwell architecture later this year.\n\nIt's important to note that there are no guarantees. Any failure to achieve investors' lofty ambitions -- real or perceived -- would likely be met with a quick and potentially brutal sell-off. On the other hand, it's just as likely that Nvidia's market dominance could continue, and the timeline calculated above could end up being conservative.\n\nThe stock is currently selling for 51 times forward earnings, which might seem expensive, but that doesn't take into consideration the stock's 27,570% gains over the past decade. To be clear, there's little chance the next decade will be as lucrative as the past 10 years have been.\n\nThat said, given Nvidia's dominant place in the industry and the gale-force secular tailwinds at its back, the chances it will be a market-beating investment in the coming years are exceptional.\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Nvidia wasn't one of them.

The chipmaker now accounts for about 16 per cent of all trading in S&P 500 companies.\n\nNvidia's stock has nearly tripled so far this year, compared with a rise of about 19% in Microsoft shares, with demand for its top-of-the-line processors outpacing supply.\n\nTech giants Microsoft, Meta Platforms and Google-owner Alphabet are competing to build out their AI computing capabilities and add the technology to their products and services.\n\nAn insatiable appetite for Nvidia's AI processors, viewed as far superior to competitors' offerings, has left them in tight supply, and many investors view Nvidia as the greatest winner to date from surging AI development.\n\n\"Nvidia has been getting a lot of positive attention and has been doing a lot of things very correctly, but a small misstep is likely to cause a major correction in the stock, and investors should be careful,\" said Oliver Pursche, senior vice president at Wealthspire Advisors in New York.\n\nTuesday's gain lifted Nvidia's stock to a record high and added over $110bn to its market capitalisation, equivalent to the entire value of Lockheed Martin.\n\nThe company's market value expanded from $1tn to $2tn in just nine months in February, while taking just over three months to hit $3tn in June.\n\nSince its blowout forecast about a year ago, the company has consistently breezed past Wall Street's lofty expectations for revenue and profit, with demand for its graphics processors far outstripping supply as companies rush to embed AI applications.\n\nNvidia executives said in May that demand for its Blackwell AI chips could exceed supply \"well into next year.\"\n\nSharp increases in analysts' expectations for Nvidia's future earnings have outpaced its stellar stock gains, resulting in a fall in the stock's earnings valuation.\n\nLSEG data showed that Nvidia recently traded at 44 times expected earnings, down from over 84 about a year ago.\n\nIncreasing the appeal for its highly valued stock among

What Makes it Tick?", "body": "Nvidia's Meteoric Rise: How AI Technology Propelled It Beyond Microsoft\n\nNvidia: Previously recognised mostly for its state-of-the-art graphics cards for gaming laptops and PCs, Nvidia has now accomplished the amazing feat of being the most valuable corporation in the world. This Tuesday alone saw a 3.5% increase in Nvidia's stock price, propelling the company to an incredible $3.34 trillion in market value.\n\nThe tremendous demand for Nvidia's AI-optimized processors, which are necessary for creating cutting-edge AI software and solutions, is a major factor driving this remarkable rise. The exponential growth of Nvidia is evidence of both the company's outstanding performance and the revolutionary promise of AI, which is also reflected in its reputation on Wall Street.\n\nNvidia's Unstoppable Growth in AI Technology\n\nNvidia's stock has increased by more than 170% only this year, while it has risen by an astounding 1,100% since its October 2022 low. Nvidia's supremacy in AI technology, particularly its high-performance chips that enable a range of applications from sophisticated data analytics to autonomous cars, is the driving force behind this remarkable rise.\n\nNvidia reported a revenue of $26 billion in its most recent quarterly report, more than doubling its previous statistics, and a seven-fold increase in net income to $14.9 billion. These figures demonstrate not just Nvidia's superiority right now but also its enormous potential going forward in an AI-driven world.\n\nFrom $2 Trillion to $3 Trillion in Record Time\n\nIt is remarkable how quickly Nvidia went from having a $2 trillion market value to $3 trillion in just 96 days. By contrast, Apple reached the same increase in 1,044 days and Microsoft in 945 days. This quick rise highlights the great enthusiasm about AI and Nvidia's pivotal position in this technological revolution.\n\nImpressive Financial Metrics\n\nNvidia has equally strong financial metrics, indicating that its exceptional success may persist in a world driven by artificial intelligence. Analysts project that the company's revenue for the current fiscal year will double to $120 billion, with an additional 33% growth expected by fiscal 2026, reaching $160 billion.

( Image Source :nvidia )\n\nNvidia Corporation has now surpassed Microsoft Corporation to claim the title of the world's most valuable company. This ascent comes on the back of soaring demand for Nvidia's high-performance processors, which are pivotal in the race to dominate artificial intelligence technology. On Tuesday, Nvidia's shares surged by 3.5 per cent to reach $135.58, propelling its market capitalisation to $3.335 trillion. This milestone follows closely on the heels of Nvidia surpassing Apple Inc. to become the second most valuable company just days earlier.\n\nIn contrast, Microsoft saw a slight decline in its market value, settling at $3.317 trillion, while Apple slipped to $3.286 trillion as its stock dipped over 1 per cent, reported Reuters.\n\nALSO READ: News Readers Remain Sceptical On AI-Generated News Content, Reuters Study Finds\n\nNvidia's extraordinary rise in market value reflects the fervent enthusiasm on Wall Street surrounding advancements in AI technology. The company has not only ascended to the pinnacle of market valuation but has also become the most actively traded entity on Wall Street, with daily turnover averaging $50 billion. This significantly outstrips trading volumes for tech giants like Apple, Microsoft, and Tesla, each averaging around $10 billion daily.\n\nNvidia's stock has nearly tripled in value this year alone, driven by insatiable demand for its cutting-edge processors, which are in short supply. This demand surge underscores Nvidia's dominance in AI computing, positioning it ahead of rivals in the tech landscape including Microsoft, Meta Platforms, and Alphabet Inc., all of whom are vying to enhance their AI capabilities.\n\nInvestors have responded to Nvidia's meteoric rise cautiously, mindful of the volatility that often accompanies such rapid growth. Oliver Pursche, Senior Vice President at Wealthspire Advisors, cautioned, \"Nvidia has been getting a lot of positive attention and has been doing a lot of things very correctly, but a small misstep is likely to cause a major correction in the stock, and investors should be careful.\"\n\nALSO READ: Meta Halts Launch Of AI Models In Europe Due To Irish Privacy Regulator's Directive\n\nTuesday's rally propelled Nvidia's stock to a historic high, adding more than $110 billion to its market cap in a single day -- an increase equivalent to the entire market value of Lockheed Martin Corporation.\n\nNvidia's journey to becoming a trillion-dollar company earlier this year underscores its trajectory in the tech sphere, driven by robust financial performances that consistently outstrip market expectations. With demand for its graphics processors far exceeding supply, Nvidia remains a front-runner in embedding AI applications across various sectors.\n\nDespite its stellar performance, Nvidia's price-to-earnings ratio has moderated from previous highs, currently trading at 44 times expected earnings, down from over 84 a year ago, according to LSEG data.\n\nALSO READ: Pope Francis Urges Control Over AI Programs, Stresses 'Human Dignity Depends On It'\n\nLast week, Nvidia further enhanced its appeal to retail investors by executing a 10-for-one stock split, a move aimed at making its shares more accessible.\n\nWhile Nvidia's success has buoyed broader market indices to record highs, concerns linger among some investors about the sustainability of current AI-driven market exuberance. As Steve Sosnick, Chief Market Strategist at Interactive Brokers, remarked, \"It's Nvidia's market; we're all just trading in it.\"\n\nAs Nvidia continues to navigate the competitive landscape of AI technology, its future trajectory remains closely watched by investors and analysts alike, poised for potential shifts in market sentiment and technological developments.", "source": {"uri": "news.abplive.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "english"}, "authors": [{"uri": "shayak_majumder@news.abplive.com", "name": "Shayak Majumder", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nvidia", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nvidia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_value", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Market value"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wall_Street", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Wall Street"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_capitalization", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Market capitalization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta_Platforms", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Meta Platforms"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tesla,_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tesla, Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alphabet_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Alphabet Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computing", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Computing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volatility_(finance)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Volatility (finance)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Vice President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revenue", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Revenue"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock_split", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Stock split"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sustainability", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sustainability"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lockheed_Martin", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lockheed Martin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphics_processing_unit", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Graphics processing unit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Investor", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Investor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pope_Francis", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pope Francis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Europe"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reuters", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Reuters"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks_and_Bonds", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks and Bonds", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Research_and_Analysis", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Research and Analysis", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Marketing_and_Advertising/Consulting", "label": "dmoz/Business/Marketing and Advertising/Consulting", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Information_Technology/Marketing_and_Advertising", "label": "dmoz/Business/Information Technology/Marketing and Advertising", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 93}], "image": "https://feeds.abplive.com/onecms/images/uploaded-images/2024/06/19/4c8f735db7fa3c632db1f208b96400311718761494364685_original.jpg?impolicy=abp_cdn&imwidth=640", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9658445", "eventUri": "eng-9658445", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.4039215686274509, "wgt": 173, "relevance": 1}

The company's share price has increased by more than 3,400% over the past five years and 181% this year alone.\n\nWith a market cap of $3.34 trillion, Nvidia has joined the very exclusive $3 trillion club alongside Apple ($3.29 trillion) and Microsoft ($3.32 trillion). Bloomberg notes that the last time Nvidia was worth more than Apple was in 2002, five years before the first iPhone was released. Both companies' market valuations were less than $10 billion at the time.\n\nWhat's especially impressive is that Nvidia only passed the $2 trillion valuation milestone in February 2024, less than a year after it hit $1 trillion, in May 2023. It means the company's market value has skyrocketed another $1 trillion in just over three months.\n\nNvidia's soaring share price has seen CEO Jensen Huang, who owns 3.79% of the company, continue to rise up the Bloomberg Billionaire's Index.

Today, Huang is in 12th position with a fortune of $115 billion.\n\nThe enormous demand for Nvidia's GPUs from companies going all-in on AI (I.e., all of them) saw its first-quarter sales hit $26 billion, more than three times what it earned during the same period a year earlier. In the high-end AI chip market, it's estimated that Nvidia holds a market share of between 70% to 95%.\n\nHuang announced at Computex that Nvidia's roadmap for its core GPUs is taking on an accelerated pace.

It overtook Apple recently, driven by demand for its processors in AI technology. Nvidia has become the world's most valuable company following a staggering rally in its shares, underlining the outsized role investors expect artificial intelligence to play in the global economy over coming years.\n\nNvidia shares rose about 3% on Tuesday, giving it a market value of about $3.33 trillion. That pushed the semiconductor bellwether past Microsoft and Apple, which had been jostling for the top spots in recent days.\n\nThe surge in Nvidia's market value has been driven by demand for its chips, which are the gold standard in the AI space. The company's shares are up more than 170% this year and have risen about 1,100% since their October 2022 low.\n\nBlockbuster earnings and broadening investor enthusiasm over AI are supercharging Nvidia's rally. That fervor has been reflected in Nvidia's market value, which took only 96 days to go from $2 trillion to $3 trillion.\n\nMicrosoft, one of the two other companies to reach those rarefied levels, took 945 days to go from $2 trillion to $3 trillion while Apple took 1,044 days to make the leap, according to Bespoke Investment Group.\n\nPreviously, just 11 U.S. companies since 1925 have reached the top spot in market value on a closing basis, according to Howard Silverblatt, senior index analyst at S&P Dow Jones Indices.\n\nFortunes have diverged for past holders of the top position in recent decades. Microsoft reached No. 1 in the late 1990s but then its shares struggled for years during the early 2000s following the dotcom bubble, only to come roaring back in the latter half of the last decade.\n\nExxon Mobil became the world's most valuable company in the 2000s but its shares retreated following a downturn in oil prices.\n\nTo some, Cisco is the cautionary tale. The company's shares peaked at over $80 in March 2000 in the midst of the dotcom boom, during which investors often assigned dizzying valuations to internet-related companies.\n\nBespoke's analysts recently contrasted the trajectories of Nvidia and Cisco, whose products were seen as essential in supporting the internet's infrastructure.\n\n\"NVDA's run has been incredible, but it will need to keep growing from here and stave off competition if its stock is going to keep putting up stellar returns,\" Bespoke said in a recent note.\n\nFor now, Nvidia's earnings are supporting its stock price. Revenue more than tripled to $26 billion in the latest quarter, while net income jumped seven-fold to $14.9 billion.\n\nRevenue for the current fiscal year is expected to roughly double to $120 billion, and then rise another 33% in fiscal 2026, to $160 billion, according to LSEG data.\n\nNvidia's impressive financial performance and forecasts have led its stock valuation, by some measures, to moderate despite the surge in its share price. For example, Nvidia's forward price-to-earnings ratio last stood at 43, according to LSEG Datastream. That is higher than the 25 level it stood at to start the year but below levels it reached for much of last year. By contrast, the S&P 500 trades at 21 times earnings.\n\nWhile Nvidia has been the standout performer, it is not the only stock to benefit from enthusiasm about the profit potential for AI.

Steve Jobs had recently returned to lead Apple. Intel was the dominant force in semiconductors. And a little-known chipmaker named Nvidia made its debut on the Nasdaq stock exchange.\n\nIt took less than three years for Nvidia to ascend into the S&P 500 - replacing the disgraced oil-trading conglomerate Enron, no less.\n\nBut even then, few people would have bet that the company would go on to become the best performing stock of the last quarter-century, posting a total return of 591,078 per cent since its initial public offering, including reinvested dividends.\n\nIt is a difficult number to comprehend and a testament, in part, to the financial mania brewing around artificial intelligence and how investors have come to see Nvidia - which makes the cutting-edge chips powering the technology - as the single-biggest winner of the boom.\n\nOn Tuesday (Jun 18), that run culminated in Nvidia unseating Microsoft as the world's most valuable company with a market capitalisation of US$3.34 trillion. More than US$2 trillion of that value has been added this year.\n\nThe company's rise was by no means assured - and neither is its staying power at the top of the S&P 500. Long-time investors in Nvidia have had to stomach three annual collapses of 50 per cent or more in the stock.\n\nSustaining the current rally will require customers to keep spending billions of US dollars a quarter on AI equipment, whose returns on investment are so far relatively small.\n\nWhat ultimately paved the way for Nvidia to climb to the top, though, was the company's big bet on graphics chips and the vision of co-founder and chief executive officer Jensen Huang that the industry would shift to what he calls \"accelerated computing,\" something his chips are inherently better at than the competition.\n\n\"You have to give the management team, I think, an enormous amount of credit,\" said Brian Mulberry, client portfolio manager at Zacks Investment Management. \"They have caught each wave of innovation in hardware perfectly well.\"\n\nBetween its debut and the time it entered the S&P 500, the stock gained more than 1,600 per cent, giving it a market value of about US$8 billion. That rise came as many other technology stocks were cratering in the aftermath of the dot-com bubble, which peaked in March 2000.\n\nThe company's key to early success: getting its technology in video-game consoles like Microsoft's Xbox and Sony's PlayStation. Nvidia's GeForce graphics processing units, or GPUs, became objects of desire among gamers because they consistently offered the most realistic experience.\n\n\"Jensen was always a great communicator, told a good story, and clearly GPUs were becoming more important,\" said Rhys Williams, chief strategist at Wayve Capital Management, who was a buyer in the IPO.\n\n\"Each successive generation of hardware gave a lot better performance, a lot more realistic picture and then PC gaming really came into being.\"\n\nThe next six years were not kind to Nvidia. The stock plunged in 2008 as the financial crisis weakened demand and long-struggling rival Advanced Micro Devices started turning things around.\n\nMeanwhile, an agreement between Nvidia and Intel that allowed the companies to use each other's capabilities went sour, forcing Nvidia out of one of its biggest markets. The two settled in 2011, with Intel agreeing to pay Nvidia US$1.5 billion.\n\nThe following year, Nvidia unveiled graphics chips for servers inside data centres. They could help sophisticated computing work such as oil and gas exploration and weather prediction, giving Nvidia a foothold in what would become a lucrative market. However, those chips did not immediately fly off the shelf. It would take nearly nine years for Nvidia shares to surpass their 2007 high.\n\nNvidia shares took off again in 2015. During that period, the company's chips were becoming the foundation of emerging technologies, from advanced graphics interfaces to autonomous vehicles to a new wave of AI products.\n\nThat was when Shana Sissel, chief executive officer at Banrion Capital Management, first really took note of the company. She described a 2017 conference where Nvidia was more like a pageant winner than an investment idea.\n\n\"Every single speaker talked about Nvidia being the most important company,\" Sissel said. \"At that point, it was really on my radar screen.\"\n\nEven after demand from cryptocurrency miners dried up, data-centre sales continued to grow. The Covid-19 pandemic boosted that business, as companies needed to purchase additional computing power to support remote work. Nvidia's data-centre revenue rose by a multiple of eight from fiscal 2017 to fiscal 2021.\n\nNvidia's shares slumped in 2022 along with the rest of the technology sector, which was reeling from soaring interest rates and falling demand after the Covid-era boom.\n\nOpenAI's release of ChatGPT in late-2022 made an instant splash but it took time for investors to realise how Nvidia might benefit. Eventually, interest in ChatGPT and other generative AI products exploded, triggering a frantic surge in orders for Nvidia's chips.\n\nWhen the company reported first-quarter 2023 earnings, the scale of the jump in its business shocked nearly everyone on Wall Street. Nvidia gave a forecast for quarterly sales that was more than 50 per cent above the average projection.\n\nNvidia's data-centre sales eclipsed its gaming revenue for the first time in fiscal 2023. In Nvidia's current fiscal year, analysts expect those sales to top US$100 billion.\n\n\"They have a very defensible place in the industry,\" said Williams, the strategist at Wayve Capital Management.\n\n\"They're not gonna be 95 per cent of market share forever, obviously, but it would be almost impossible for anybody to replace them.\" BLOOMBERG", "source": {"uri": "businesstimes.com.sg", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Business Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S&P_500_Index", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "S&P 500 Index"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nvidia", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nvidia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphics_processing_unit", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Graphics processing unit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_dollar", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States dollar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intel", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Intel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Initial_public_offering", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Initial public offering"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nasdaq", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nasdaq"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enron", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Enron"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Jobs", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Steve Jobs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Return_on_investment", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Return on investment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conglomerate_(company)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Conglomerate (company)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computing", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Computing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semiconductor", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Semiconductor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_capitalization", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Market capitalization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dividend", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dividend"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AMD", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "AMD"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jensen_Huang", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jensen Huang"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dot-com_bubble", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dot-com bubble"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_crisis", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Financial crisis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PlayStation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "PlayStation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xbox_(console)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Xbox (console)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PC_game", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "PC game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_value", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Market value"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sony", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sony"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks_and_Bonds", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks and Bonds", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Research_and_Analysis", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Research and Analysis", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Major_Companies", "label": "dmoz/Business/Major Companies", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/Investment_Services", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/Investment Services", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/businesstimes/a4e9636bf185ded3924529b8093f7f07009521aa89ab8f0ef575c863ea6084e9", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9658445", "eventUri": "eng-9658445", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-18", "textStart": 872, "textEnd": 878}, {"amb": false, "date": "2000-03-", "textStart": 2293, "textEnd": 2303}], "sentiment": 0.1843137254901961, "wgt": 172, "relevance": 1}

Nvidia Stock Is Still a Keeper.", "body": "Investors shouldn't succumb to bearish sentiment from a handful of Nvidia stock skeptics.\n\nWinning is a way of life for Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) not a temporary mindset. Yet, there will always be critics who might be bitter because they missed out of the Nvidia stock rally. We gave the stock an \"A\" grade at lower prices, hoping you benefited from the gains. There's no reason to change our grade on Nvidia shares today.\n\nAfter all, Nvidia is still an \"A\"-level company and a juggernaut among AI-hardware specialists. Nvidia's move to enact a 10-for-1 share split was brilliant, and now the company's market capitalization easily exceeds $3 trillion. So, will you choose to be in the winner's circle, or waste your time with the bitter critics?\n\nAs we alluded to earlier, Nvidia's skeptics will always find something to complain about. Probably the most common complaint is that Nvidia is overvalued.\n\nThat's a fallacy because Nvidia stock is worth whatever people will pay for it; that's Investing 101. Just as importantly, Nvidia's high-end AI processors are worth whatever the customers will pay for them.\n\nAs long as the demand outpaces the supply, Nvidia can maintain high profits margins on its products.\n\nIt's strange that we have to explain these things to Nvidia's critics, but sometimes you have to revisit the basics.\n\nJust recently, a Fortune commentator characterized Nvidia's growth as a \"problem,\" writing, \"By August of last year, Nvidia's stock was substantially overvalued by most metrics. Now? The problem has nearly tripled.\"\n\nThe naysayers and short sellers were wrong about Nvidia stock in August, and they'd be fools to double down now.\n\nDo we need to remind them that Nvidia's first-quarter fiscal 2025 revenue soared 262% year over year to $26 billion?\n\nShould we bother to point out that the company's adjusted earnings skyrocketed 461% YOY to $6.12 per share?\n\nNvidia's valuation can be justified by the company's growth and by the intense demand for Nvidia's H100 and Blackwell chips. Don't be surprised if the demand intensifies when Nvidia releases its H200 processors in the coming months.\n\nFortunately, the sensible commentators outnumber the perma-bears. For example, Oppenheimer's Rick Schafer listed several factors that justify Nvidia's valuation.\n\nThese factors, which include \"generative AI, DC [data center]/AI accelerators and autonomous vehicles,\" drive \"sustained outsize top-line growth\" for Nvidia.\n\nConsequently, Schafer isn't too worried about Nvidia's valuation. He recently reaffirmed his $150 price target on Nvidia stock.\n\nIn a similar vein, Barclays analyst Tom O'Malley published a $145 price target on Nvidia shares. These aren't unrealistic at all, since the stock broke above $130 not long ago.\n\nNvidia's juggernaut status is indisputable, but a few commentators will still double down on their wrongheaded bearish thesis. Apparently, they're willing to disregard the intense demand for Nvidia's best-in-class products.\n\nFor more sensible investors, it's just a question of how high the Nvidia share price might go. Could it revisit the pre-split price of $1,200 someday?\n\nAnything is possible, but let's not get ahead of ourselves. For now, we can focus on realistic near-term price targets like the ones proposed by Schafer and O'Malley.\n\nWith that in mind, Nvidia stock certainly deserves an \"A\" grade, and there's no need to let the naysayers change your mind in 2024.\n\nOn the date of publication, Louis Navellier had a long position in NVDA.

This significant achievement, reached in June 2024, marks the culmination of a remarkable stock price surge fueled by Nvidia's dominance in the booming field of artificial intelligence (AI).\n\nThe secret sauce behind Nvidia's success lies in its leadership within the AI chip market. These specialized chips are the workhorses that power the development and execution of AI software - a rapidly growing field with applications that span industries like healthcare, finance, and autonomous vehicles.\n\nNvidia's dominance in this critical sector is undeniable. With an estimated 80% market share in the data center AI chip market, the company enjoys a significant advantage. This translates to a constant stream of revenue as companies around the world invest heavily in AI development, all the while relying on Nvidia's cutting-edge technology to make it happen.\n\nInterestingly, Nvidia didn't always focus on AI chips. The company's roots are in developing graphics processing units (GPUs) primarily for the gaming industry. However, under the visionary leadership of CEO Jensen Huang, the company made a pivotal strategic shift in the 2000s. Recognizing the immense potential of AI, Nvidia began heavily investing in developing GPUs specifically tailored for applications beyond gaming. This foresight proved to be a game-changer, positioning Nvidia perfectly to capitalize on the explosive growth of the AI market.\n\nBeyond its strong market position, investor confidence plays a crucial role in Nvidia's skyrocketing valuation. The company has consistently exceeded analyst expectations with robust sales and profit figures, solidifying its reputation as a leader in the AI space. This positive outlook has fueled investor enthusiasm, pushing Nvidia's stock price to record highs. In 2024 alone, the stock price nearly doubled, and the long-term trajectory is even more impressive - a staggering 591,078% increase since the company's IPO in 1999.\n\nWhile Nvidia currently reigns supreme in the AI chip market, some analysts express concerns about the company's ability to maintain its long-term dominance. This high-stakes field is fiercely competitive, with tech giants like Microsoft, Google, and Apple all actively vying for a leading position. As these competitors invest heavily in developing their own AI technologies, Nvidia could face significant pressure to maintain its market share.\n\nAnother potential hurdle on the horizon relates to how Nvidia's customers ultimately plan to monetize AI software. If developers struggle to find profitable applications for their AI creations, it could dampen demand for Nvidia's chips - the hardware backbone of this software. This is a complex issue that could significantly impact the future trajectory of the entire AI landscape.\n\nDespite these potential challenges, Nvidia's current status as the world's most valuable company undeniably reflects its success in capitalizing on the AI revolution. The company's innovative technology and strategic vision have propelled it to the forefront of this transformative field.\n\nWhether Nvidia can maintain its leadership position remains to be seen. However, one thing is certain: the company is a pivotal player in the AI landscape, and its future in this rapidly evolving field promises to be exciting to watch.\n\nQ: How did Nvidia become the world's most valuable company?\n\nA: Nvidia's dominance in the AI chip market, fueled by its cutting-edge technology and strong market share, has been the primary driver behind its surge in value.\n\nQ: What exactly are AI chips?\n\nA: AI chips, also known as AI accelerators, are specialized processors designed to handle the complex computations required for developing and running AI software. These chips offer significant performance advantages over traditional CPUs in tasks involving artificial intelligence.\n\nQ: Why is Nvidia worried about how its customers monetize AI software?\n\nA: Nvidia's business model relies on companies investing in AI development and subsequently purchasing their AI chips to power their AI software. If developers struggle to find profitable applications for their AI creations, it could lead to a decrease in demand for Nvidia's chips, impacting their revenue stream.\n\nQ: What are some potential challenges Nvidia might face in the future?\n\nA: Increased competition from tech giants like Microsoft, Google, and Apple who are heavily investing in their own AI technologies is a major concern. Additionally, the overall growth of the AI market could be hindered if developers struggle to find profitable applications for AI software.\n\nQ: Is Nvidia's future secure even with these challenges?\n\nA: While challenges exist, Nvidia remains a dominant player in the AI landscape. Its innovative technology and strong market position make it a key player in the future of AI. The company's ability to adapt and innovate will be crucial in maintaining its leadership position.\n\nQ: What does this mean for the future of AI?\n\nA: Nvidia's rise highlights the immense potential of AI and its impact across various industries. While challenges remain regarding monetization and competition, the future of AI looks promising with companies like Nvidia leading the charge in developing powerful, efficient AI technology.", "source": {"uri": "phonemantra.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Latest Mobiles / Latest Smartphone Launches | New Mobiles | Technology News"}, "authors": [{"uri": "nirosha_konduru@phonemantra.com", "name": "Nirosha Konduru", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nvidia", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nvidia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphics_processing_unit", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Graphics processing unit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_share", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Market share"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-driving_car", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Self-driving car"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology_company", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Technology company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_center", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Data center"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streaming_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Streaming media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_capitalization", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Market capitalization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valuation_(finance)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Valuation (finance)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Initial_public_offering", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Initial public offering"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Software"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Google"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AI_accelerator", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "AI accelerator"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_processing_unit", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Central processing unit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_model", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Business model"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Future", "label": "dmoz/Society/Future", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Information_Technology/Marketing_and_Advertising", "label": "dmoz/Business/Information Technology/Marketing and Advertising", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence/Publications", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence/Publications", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence/Games", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence/Games", "wgt": 27}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence/Philosophy", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence/Philosophy", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 60}], "image": "https://phonemantra.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Nvidia-Claims-the-Throne-as-Worlds.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9658445", "eventUri": "eng-9658445", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3725490196078431, "wgt": 172, "relevance": 1}

Hard to imagine many at the company do as Nvidia yesterday achieved the remarkable status of \"world's most valuable company\", overtaking Apple and Microsoft.\n\nThat's nice and all, but will somebody please think about PC gamers? Actually, Dave put pretty much that very question directly to His Royal Leather Jacketness, AKA Nvidia's CEO Jensen Huang, after Nvidia's recent Computex keynote. But hold that thought while we cover off some details. That valuation is based on Nvidia's current share price and thus market capitalisation.\n\nObviously, such valuations can change pretty quickly. How long Nvidia will retain its new crown is anyone's guess. But as of market close yesterday, Nvidia's share price of $135.58 works out to a market capitalisation of $3.335 trillion. Yes, trillion.\n\nOf course, both Apple and Microsoft are also worth over $3 trillion in market cap terms. So, it's more a case of a trio of titans than Nvidia being in a class of its own. Its status as the most valuable company on paper is pretty notional if not ephemeral. But still, the symbolism of this development is significant.\n\nIt is, of course, all driven by Nvidia's success in AI. Exactly how that plays out in future is hard to say. Will Nvidia continue to dominate? Will the likes of Microsoft and Google succeed in building their own AI chips, reducing their dependence on Nvidia?\n\nMight the whole AI thing turn out to be a bit of a ruse? Who knows, though it's worth recalling how quickly cryptocurrency mining came and went as a driver of demand for Nvidia GPUs. What we can say is that we remember the early days of what Nvidia used to call GPGPU or general purpose computing on graphics chips and how that slowly transitioned into the AI juggernaut we have today.\n\nFunnily enough, for years and years nary a mention did Nvidia make of AI. They talked about things like physics simulation, prospecting for fossil fuels, folding proteins, that kind of thing.\n\nThe notion of running AI on its GPUs is a relatively recent phenomenon. So, don't believe claims that Nvidia saw this all coming. For sure, the company put the time and effort into parallel computing on GPUs that no other company could be bothered with. So, Nvidia deserves this success. But when it started off down a road originally called GPGPU, Nvidia didn't see AI coming.\n\nOf course, when that journey began Nvidia was very much a gaming graphics company. These days, Nvidia likes to style gaming graphics as merely the first application it happened upon for its massively parallel approach to compute.\n\nPersonally, I think that's a rewriting of history given that Nvidia's early graphics chips were pretty much pure fixed-function raster hardware with virtually no general purpose compute capacity. But history is written by the victorious, so fighting that battle is a guaranteed loss.\n\nMore of a concern is Nvidia's current attitude to PC gaming. No question, the company continues to invest in gaming graphics, and heavily. The problem is that most of the focus seems to be going into the software side in the shape of its DLSS suite of largely AI-accelerated rendering enhancements including upscaling and frame generation.\n\nFor sure, those technologies can be pretty magical. But you could also argue they are being used to deprecate the importance of the actual hardware. That's why the pure rasterisation power of many of Nvidia's latest RTX 40 series GPUs were relatively disappointing. Nvidia now relies to a greater and greater degree on those clever AI features to deliver higher frame rates.\n\nMeanwhile, despite Intel's recent efforts the competition which amounts pretty much exclusively to AMD, which has struggled to compete with Nvidia's DLSS feature set and quality. In that regard, AMD is always a step behind and playing catch up.\n\nIf you take something like AMD's Radeon RX 7800 XT GPU, it's extremely competitive for plain old raster performance. But falls ever further behind as soon as you start factoring in fancier features.\n\nOf course, Nvidia isn't entirely neglecting the hardware. It's been iterating its ray tracing GPU technology for three generations now, another area where it has a clear advantage over AMD.\n\nBut Nvidia's shift in emphasis is clear enough. AMD can compete when it comes to conventional pixel pumping. But Nvidia's huge advantage in AI is something that no company can currently match. So, that's where Nvidia seems to be putting the emphasis with its gaming GPUs.\n\nAs for the future, there's no reason to think Nvidia is going to actually ditch gaming graphics. But it's probably a safe bet to assume that the company will increasingly view gaming through the lens of AI. And that will likely be a blessing and a curse.\n\nThe blessings will be even more remarkable additions to the DLSS family of image-enhancing technologies. The curse will be an even less competitive landscape for gaming graphics where Nvidia can dictate the market to an even greater degree.\n\nThat explains why, if true, Nvidia has very modest plans for its next generation of GPUs in pure hardware terms. If the rumours are to be believed, some members of the next-gen RTX 50 series will actually see regression in terms of things like shader core counts, while memory availability and bus widths look set to stagnate for yet another generation.\n\nIf that happens, it'll be pretty depressing and again it will all comes back to AI. So as a PC gamer, and despite how magical some of Nvidia's gaming technologies undoubtedly are, it's hard not to feel a little uneasy about Nvidia's new status as the world's most valuable company. It's a huge win for Nvidia, but what it means for PC gaming is a lot more ambiguous.", "source": {"uri": "pcgamer.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "pcgamer"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jeremy_laird@pcgamer.com", "name": "Jeremy Laird", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nvidia", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nvidia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphics_processing_unit", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Graphics processing unit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_capitalization", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Market capitalization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AMD", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "AMD"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphics_card", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Graphics card"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jensen_Huang", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jensen Huang"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General-purpose_computing_on_graphics_processing_units", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "General-purpose computing on graphics processing units"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_computer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Personal computer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Google"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_learning_super_sampling", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Deep learning super sampling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fixed-function", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fixed-function"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massively_parallel", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Massively parallel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parallel_computing", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Parallel computing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptocurrency", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cryptocurrency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simulation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Simulation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computing", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Computing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Physics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raster_graphics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Raster graphics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Software"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nvidia_RTX", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nvidia RTX"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rasterisation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rasterisation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intel", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Intel"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Computer_Platforms", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Computer Platforms", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Toys_and_Games/Games", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Toys and Games/Games", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Game_Design", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Game Design", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence/Games", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence/Games", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Developers_and_Publishers", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Developers and Publishers", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 70}], "image": "https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/JbwCz8vcFYaXapSAnwmWxD-1200-80.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9658445", "eventUri": "eng-9658445", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2941176470588236, "wgt": 172, "relevance": 1}

The top stocks have jockeyed all month for the pole position, with Nvidia edging past its big-tech peers.\n\nEarlier in the month, Nvidia capped Apple by market value for the first time since 2002, and the two went back and forth in rankings in recent days. Last week, Apple also overtook Microsoft to trade in the top spot briefly.\n\nThe ranking is yet another reminder that AI is the top focus of many investors. Nvidia is seen as the biggest and earliest beneficiary of the technology as it dominates the market with its highly sought-after chips that help power data centers running complex computing tasks required by AI applications. Demand for its H100 accelerators are surging and helped drive the chipmaker's sales up by more than 125% last year.\n\nMicrosoft, for its part, is also seen as an early AI winner given its investment and partnership with OpenAI, which created ChatGPT.

The stock market has a new king.\n\nOn Tuesday, Nvidia leapfrogged two of tech's most storied names to become the world's most valuable public company, according to data from S&P Global. Its ascent has been powered by the boom in generative artificial intelligence and surging demand for the company's chips -- known as graphics processing units, or GPUs -- which have made it possible to create AI systems.\n\nNvidia's rise is among the fastest in market history. Just two years ago, the company's market valuation was over $400 million. Now, in the span of a year, it has gone from $1 trillion to more than $3 trillion.\n\nOn Tuesday, Nvidia rose 3.6%, lifting its market value to $3.34 trillion. Microsoft and Apple both fell, ending the day trailing the Silicon Valley chipmaker.\n\nYears before other big chip companies, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang bet that GPUs would be essential to building AI, and he tailored his company to accommodate what he believed would be tech's next big boom.\n\nHis big bet is paying off. By some measurements, Nvidia controls more than 80% of the market for the chips used in AI systems. Nvidia's biggest customers regularly jockey for orders for chips to run computers in their giant data centers, and are building their own AI chips so they are not so dependent on one supplier.\n\n\"No one else fully saw or appreciated this,\" said Daniel Newman, CEO of the Futurum Group, a tech research firm. \"They saw the trend, built for the trend and enabled the market. They can effectively charge whatever they want.\"\n\nNvidia's ascent has made Huang a celebrity in the tech world. After a computer conference in Taiwan this month, he was surrounded by attendees who wanted his autograph, including a woman who asked him to sign her chest.\n\nThe company's rise is reminiscent of dot-com era titans like Cisco and Juniper Networks, which built the equipment that ran communications networks for the internet. Cisco's shares increased more than a thousandfold between its initial public offering in 1990 and 2000, when it briefly became the world's most valuable company.\n\nThe speed at which Nvidia's value has grown has been startling. Apple crossed $1 trillion in August 2018 and became the first $3 trillion company last June.

Let's Find Out", "body": "Nvidia stock price: Nvidia Corporation has surpassed Microsoft to become the world's most valuable company, buoyed by a surge in its shares fueled by the growing artificial intelligence (AI) wave. Nvidia's stock rose over 3 per cent on Tuesday, closing at $135.58 per share, which elevated its market valuation by $110 billion to $3.335 trillion.\n\nThis year, Nvidia's stock has nearly tripled in value, significantly outpacing the 19 per cent rise in Microsoft's shares. Nvidia Corp, which went public in 1999 at an initial price of $12 per share, has seen its shares multiply manifold, driven by the demand for gaming and innovative technology chips.\n\nInvestors who purchased Nvidia shares at its IPO in 1999 have seen remarkable returns. An investment of Rs 10,000 at that time, considering the rupee-dollar exchange rate of 43, would have bought about 19 shares. Over the years, Nvidia has rewarded its investors with multiple stock splits. Consequently, one share bought before the stock splits in 2000 has transformed into 480 shares today. Therefore, the 19 shares bought during the IPO would have evolved into 9,120 shares.\n\nAt the current trading price of $135 per share, these shares are now valued at $1.231 million (around Rs 10.3 crore at the present exchange rate of 83.40). This means an initial investment of Rs 10,000 in Nvidia's IPO would have turned an investor into a millionaire within 25 years.\n\nNvidia, known for its ground-breaking GPUs and advancements in AI, robotics, autonomous vehicles, and emerging technologies, has recently climbed past iPhone maker Apple to secure the position of the second-most valuable company globally.\n\nMicrosoft, with a market valuation of approximately $3.317 trillion following a nearly half a per cent drop in its shares, now trails Nvidia. Apple's market valuation fell to $3.286 trillion as its shares decreased by 1 per cent on Tuesday.\n\nNvidia's unprecedented rise underscores the growing influence and demand for AI and advanced technological solutions, positioning the company at the forefront of the tech industry's future.", "source": {"uri": "news.abplive.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "english"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nvidia", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nvidia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Initial_public_offering", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Initial public offering"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock_split", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stock split"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exchange_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Exchange rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_capitalization", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Market capitalization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-driving_car", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Self-driving car"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology_company", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Technology company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robotics", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Robotics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphics_processing_unit", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Graphics processing unit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPhone", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "IPhone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks_and_Bonds", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks and Bonds", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Research_and_Analysis", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Research and Analysis", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Art_and_Literature", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Art and Literature", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work/Job_Sharing", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work/Job Sharing", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 71}], "image": "https://feeds.abplive.com/onecms/images/uploaded-images/2024/06/19/c176a62f4b1dca0a96baa3d98fc52a621718786866900314_original.jpg?impolicy=abp_cdn&imwidth=640", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9658445", "eventUri": "eng-9658445", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.5686274509803921, "wgt": 171, "relevance": 1}

The top stocks have jockeyed all month for the pole position, with Nvidia edging past its big-tech peers.\n\nEarlier in the month, Nvidia capped Apple by market value for the first time since 2002, and the two went back and forth in rankings in recent days. Last week, Apple also overtook Microsoft to trade in the top spot briefly.\n\nThe ranking is yet another reminder that AI is the top focus of many investors. Nvidia is seen as the biggest and earliest beneficiary of the technology as it dominates the market with its highly sought-after chips that help power data centers running complex computing tasks required by AI applications. Demand for its H100 accelerators are surging and helped drive the chipmaker's sales up by more than 125 per cent last year.\n\nMicrosoft, for its part, is also seen as an early AI winner given its investment and partnership with OpenAI, which created ChatGPT. And, this week, Apple shares rallied after the iPhone maker finally unveiled its plan for using the technology, appeasing investors at long last.\n\n\"We believe over the next year the race to $4 Trillion Market Cap in Tech will be front and center between Nvidia, Apple, and Microsoft,\" Daniel Ives analyst at Wedbush Securities wrote in a note.\n\nInvestors and Nvidia Chief Executive Officer Jensen Huang argue that Nvidia is more than a chipmaker.\n\n\"They're not just selling chips, they're selling systems,\" Michael Lippert, vice president and portfolio manager at the Baron Capital Inc., said in an interview, pointing to the company's proprietary software and development ecosystem.\n\nNvidia's swift climb to the top has been record breaking, as the company is one of the few firms to have demonstrated significant revenue growth from AI.

With a 0.3% slide on Tuesday, Microsoft's market cap stood at $3.32 trillion.\n\nShares of Nvidia are up more than 215% over the last 12 months and more than 3,400% over the last five years. Year to date, Nvidia has gained 173%; Microsoft stock is up just less than 19% in 2024.\n\nNvidia's surge has made it a top weighting in the S&P 500 (^GSPC), and the chipmaker has served a pivotal role in the benchmark index hitting record highs in 2024.\n\nUp until May, the S&P 500 had traded with a near-perfect correlation to Nvidia's price movement, meaning that as Nvidia's stock rose, so did the broader index. As of Monday, Nvidia's stock gains alone had contributed about one-third of the S&P 500's year-to-date rise, according to data from Citi's equity research team.\n\nNvidia completed a 10-for-1 split on June 10.\n\nThe company's rise comes amid the generative AI explosion that kicked off when OpenAI debuted its ChatGPT platform in late 2022. Nvidia's chips, modified graphics cards, and CUDA software platform are designed to both train and run AI programs, giving it a strategic advantage that experts say will take rivals AMD and Intel years to overcome.\n\nNvidia is the tech industry's go-to supplier for AI chips and integrated software.\n\nTech behemoths, including Amazon (AMZN), Google (GOOG), Meta (META), Microsoft, Tesla (TSLA), and others, use its hardware to power everything from their cloud-based AI offerings for customers to their own AI models and services.\n\nDuring a keynote at the Computex conference in Taiwan on June 2, CEO Jensen Huang announced that the company will release a high-powered version of its Blackwell chip -- called the Blackwell Ultra -- in 2025, followed by a new AI chip platform, Rubin, in 2026. The company will debut an Ultra version of Rubin in 2027.\n\nIn the first quarter, Nvidia reported adjusted earnings per share of $6.12 on revenue of $26 billion, jumps of 461% and 262%, respectively, from the same period a year ago.\n\nNvidia's Data Center revenue in the most recent quarter increased 427% year over year to $22.6 billion, accounting for 86% of the company's total revenue for the quarter. Nvidia's gaming segment, which was previously its most important business, saw revenue of $2.6 billion.\n\nBut AMD (AMD) and Intel (INTC) are pushing forward with their own AI chips with the goal of outmaneuvering Nvidia. AMD recently announced its MI325X and MI350 will hit the market in 2024 and 2025, respectively, and said its next-generation MI400 AI accelerator platform will land in 2026.\n\nIntel, meanwhile, said its Gaudi 2 and Gaudi 3 AI accelerators will undercut competing chips on price. And with companies spending billions on AI chips, any price savings will certainly be welcome.\n\nNvidia is also contending with growing competition from its own customers, as Amazon, Google, and Microsoft seek to wean themselves off of their dependence on the company's chips and save on capital expenditures while they're at it.\n\nEmail Daniel Howley at dhowley@yahoofinance.com.

That was certainly exciting for shareholders, as it turned a 50-share holding into 500 shares and a 100-share position into a 1,000-share one. (Of course, the stock price was immediately adjusted down proportionately, leaving everyone's total holding value largely unchanged. Stock splits are mostly nothing burgers.)\n\nThere are far more interesting and/or amazing things to know about Nvidia, though. Here's a review of seven of them.\n\nIt was only in 2018 when Apple was being hailed as the first American trillion-dollar company. Well, here we are, with Nvidia valued at more than $3 trillion at the time of this writing. Indeed, as of mid-March, Nvidia had added $1 trillion to its market value in just the previous 50 days. Oh, and by the way -- the company was only founded in 1993.\n\nAs you might suspect, if you didn't already know, Nvidia's stock has grown at an incredible pace in recent years. Consider that the overall stock market has averaged annual gains close to 10% over many decades. Nvidia has had a shorter run, of course, but its average annual gain over the last 15 years was a whopping 50%, as of this writing. Over the past 10 years, it has averaged 75%, and over the past five years, the stock has averaged 104%, roughly doubling annually. (In the past year, the stock has more than tripled.)\n\nThose numbers might have you rushing to visit your brokerage to order shares of Nvidia, but never do so based solely on past returns. They don't necessarily dictate future returns, after all, and the bigger a company gets, the harder it can often be to grow rapidly. Plus, some phenomenal growth stocks can end up overvalued for a while.\n\nNvidia made a name for itself as a titan in the gaming-chip business -- introducing the world's first graphics processing unit (GPU), GeForce, in 1999 and launching an industry. But things have changed recently. Whereas Nvidia used to get most of its revenue from gaming chips, it got fully 80% of its revenue from its data-center-related technology, as of its third quarter. That's quite a pivot.\n\nThe reason behind the pivot is that Nvidia's data center platform is heavily used for artificial intelligence (AI) endeavors, which need a lot of computing power. Nvidia is investing in AI companies on its own, as well.\n\nLooking at Nvidia's business performance shows that its stock surge isn't whimsy -- it's based on stunning revenue growth:\n\nData source: Morningstar.com, as of mid-June, 2024.\n\nIt should be clear that Nvidia's leader Jensen Huang is a standout, as any leader would have to be to oversee such a success story. But there's much more to the Taiwan-born American.\n\nFor one thing, he's now on lists of the richest people in the world, but as a youth, he attended the Oneida Baptist Institute in Kentucky, which was a religious reform school -- by accident. (His uncle had mistaken the school for a prestigious boarding school.) There's now a Huang girls' dormitory and classroom building at the school.\n\nHuang understands hard work, having had to clean bathrooms at his boarding school and later working at a Denny's in California, where he and his friends came up with the idea of Nvidia.\n\nIn many major companies, it's common for a CEO to have fairly few direct reports. At Nvidia, Huang had 50 direct reports as of late 2023, explaining that \"The more direct reports the CEO has, the less layers are in the company... It allows us to keep information fluid, allows us to make sure that everyone is empowered by information.\"\n\nFew great companies never encounter serious challenges and setbacks, and Nvidia is no exception. The company nearly went bankrupt in its first few years. As Huang has explained: \"I think when you build a company from the ground up, and you've experienced real adversity, and you really experienced nearly going out of business several times, that feeling stays with you...\" adding, \"I don't wake up proud and confident. I wake up worried and concerned.\"\n\nHuang has also said: \"I think during adversity you're more focused. And when you're more focused, you could perform better.\"\n\nAfter Nvidia's colossal gains, it's certainly not the bargain it once was, and those who bought earlier will enjoy bigger total gains than those who buy today. Plenty of people actually think the stock is not the best bet right now, for various reasons -- including a valuation that some see as less compelling than those of some other stocks.\n\nBut if you plan to be a long-term holder of Nvidia shares, buying at recent levels can end up rewarding you -- even if the stock pulls back for a while.\n\nWhether you buy now, add the company to your watchlist, or just pass, you can't deny that Nvidia is an amazing company -- for many reasons.

Last week, Apple also overtook Microsoft to trade in the top spot briefly.\n\nThe ranking is yet another reminder that AI is the top focus of many investors. Nvidia is seen as the biggest and earliest beneficiary of the technology as it dominates the market with its highly sought-after chips that help power data centres running complex computing tasks required by AI applications. Demand for its H100 accelerators are surging and helped drive the chipmaker's sales up by more than 125 per cent last year.\n\nMicrosoft, for its part, is also seen as an early AI winner given its investment and partnership with OpenAI, which created ChatGPT. And, this week, Apple shares rallied after the iPhone maker finally unveiled its plan for using the technology, appeasing investors at long last.\n\n\"We believe over the next year the race to US$4 trillion market cap in tech will be front and centre between Nvidia, Apple, and Microsoft,\" Daniel Ives, analyst at Wedbush Securities, wrote in a note.\n\nNvidia's surging stock price has made co-founder and chief executive officer Jensen Huang one of the world's richest people. His net worth has climbed nearly US$75 billion since the beginning of the year to US$119 billion, putting him in 12th place on the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. That's the biggest gain among his billionaire peers.\n\nInvestors, alongside Mr Huang, argue that Nvidia is more than a chipmaker.\n\n\"They're not just selling chips, they're selling systems,\" Michael Lippert, vice president and portfolio manager at the Baron Capital, said in an interview, pointing to the company's proprietary software and development ecosystem.\n\nNvidia's swift climb to the top has been record breaking, as the company is one of the few firms to have demonstrated significant revenue growth from AI.

Apple's share price meanwhile was at $214.29, giving it a market capitalisation of $3.286 trillion.\n\nTop spot\n\nApple's AI announcements at its annual developer conference last week had triggered a three-day stock price rally that saw its market value briefly overtake Microsoft for most valuable listed US firm.\n\nBut now Nvidia has surged to the top spot.\n\nIt comes after the GPU giant earlier this month had briefly overtaken Apple to become the second most valuable tech firm in the world, worth over $3 trillion.\n\nThe achievement of Nvidia's dethroning Microsoft to become the most valuable tech firm in the world comes after it recently completed its 10-for-1 stock split, as it sought to lower its share price to help new investors acquire its highly sought after shares.\n\nNvidia carried out a 10-1 stock split, which meant each share was divided in 10.\n\nThat meant that if an investor previously had 10 Nvidia shares, they now have 100.\n\nNvidia has become a much sought-after target for investors, due to soaring demand for its chips, which are used to power artificial intelligence applications.\n\nMeteoric rise\n\nNvidia's stock price has endured a meteoric rise in recent years, after it more than tripled in 2023.\n\nIndeed in May 2023 Nvidia's market value had surpassed the $1 trillion mark.\n\nAnd so far in 2024, Nvidia's share price has nearly tripled.\n\nIndeed, it was only in February 2024 when Nvidia's Q4 and FY24 results had helped push the firm's market value (market capitalisation) close to the $2 trillion mark.\n\nThen just three months after reaching close to the $2 trillion mark, Nvidia added another $1 trillion in market value to become the most valuable tech firm, which is quite a remarkable achievement.\n\nMeanwhile other big name tech firms are some way behind the big three.\n\nAmazon is currently worth $1.902 trillion, and Alphabet (Google) is now worth $2.171 trillion.\n\nBut the most valuable company in the world is Saudi Arabia's national oil company, Saudi Aramco, which has a market valuation just under $6.703 trillion.\n\nRead also : Elon Musk Wins Shareholder Vote On Pay, Texas Incorporation",

The Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund (NYSEARCA:XLK), for example, is adding more than $10 billion worth of Nvidia shares as it rebalances at the end of the second quarter.\n\nAt the same time, 40 Wall Street analysts rate Nvidia stock a \"strong buy\" and see more upside ahead. There are no \"sell\" ratings on the stock despite the fact that the share price has risen 172% this year and nearly tripled in the last 12 months.\n\nThe outperformance in Nvidia stock is being driven by huge global demand for its microchips and processors, which power AI applications and models.\n\nThe massive demand has translated into escalating sales and profits at Nvidia. The company most recently reported that its revenue in the first quarter of this year rose 268% from a year ago.\n\nAt the same time, the company's profit was up 646% year-over-year.\n\nNvidia reported that sales at its data center unit, which includes it's AI microchips and semiconductors, rose 427% from a year earlier to $22.6 billion. However, Nvidia isn't a one-trick pony.\n\nThe company also highlighted strong sales of its networking parts that are used to connect clusters of microchips and processors. Nvidia said that it had $3.2 billion in networking revenue during Q1, which was three times more than sales recorded during the same period of 2023.\n\nChips used in video games saw their revenue rise 18% during the quarter to $2.65 billion.\n\nWhile Nvidia is getting a boost from all areas of its business, demand for its AI chips is what's driving the company and its share price to new heights.\n\nTo keep pace with the soaring demand, and to keep competitors at bay, Nvidia has been rolling out new artificial intelligence products at a brisk clip. Currently, Nvidia controls about three-quarters (75%) of the worldwide market for AI chips and semiconductors.\n\nIn March of this year, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang introduced new AI graphics processors called the \"Blackwell\" series. The first Blackwell chip called the \"GB200'' will ship later this year.\n\nHowever, Nvidia has already unveiled the next microchip that will eventually replace the Blackwell chip. Called \"Rubin\" chips, the successor to the Blackwell series will be Nvidia's most powerful and energy efficient chip yet.\n\nThe Rubin chips are scheduled to ship in 2026 and highlight the speed at which Nvidia is updating its technology in order to stay a step ahead of rival chipmakers.\n\nNvidia has largely powered the current stock market rally that began in October 2022. The company's shares have nearly tripled in the past year, undergone a mighty 10-for-1 stock split, and maintain a \"strong buy\" rating among analysts.\n\nThe company continues to have a huge growth opportunity ahead of it with its AI microchips and management is doing everything it can to capitalize and meet global demand.

The top stocks have jockeyed all month for the pole position, with Nvidia finally edging past both of its big-tech peers.\n\nEarlier in the month, Nvidia capped Apple by market value for the first time since 2002, and the two went back and forth in rankings in recent days. Last week, Apple also overtook Microsoft to trade in the top spot briefly.\n\nThe ranking is yet another reminder that AI is the top focus of many investors. Nvidia is seen as the biggest and earliest beneficiary of the technology as it dominates the market with its highly sought-after chips that help power data centers running complex computing tasks required by AI applications. Demand for its H100 accelerators are surging and helped drive the chipmaker's sales up by more than 125% last year.\n\nMicrosoft, for its part, is also seen as an early AI winner given its investment and partnership with OpenAI, which created ChatGPT. And, this week, Apple shares rallied after the iPhone maker finally unveiled its plan for using the technology, appeasing investors at long last.\n\n\"We believe over the next year the race to $4 Trillion Market Cap in Tech will be front and center between Nvidia, Apple, and Microsoft,\" Daniel Ives, analyst at Wedbush Securities, wrote in a note.\n\nNvidia's surging stock price has made co-founder and Chief Executive Officer Jensen Huang one of the world's richest people.

Nvidia Stock Is Still a Keeper.", "body": "InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nWinning is a way of life for Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) not a temporary mindset. Yet, there will always be critics who might be bitter because they missed out of the Nvidia stock rally. We gave the stock an \"A\" grade at lower prices, hoping you benefited from the gains. There's no reason to change our grade on Nvidia shares today.\n\nAfter all, Nvidia is still an \"A\"-level company and a juggernaut among AI-hardware specialists. Nvidia's move to enact a 10-for-1 share split was brilliant, and now the company's market capitalization easily exceeds $3 trillion. So, will you choose to be in the winner's circle, or waste your time with the bitter critics?\n\nAs we alluded to earlier, Nvidia's skeptics will always find something to complain about. Probably the most common complaint is that Nvidia is overvalued.\n\nThat's a fallacy because Nvidia stock is worth whatever people will pay for it; that's Investing 101. Just as importantly, Nvidia's high-end AI processors are worth whatever the customers will pay for them.\n\nAs long as the demand outpaces the supply, Nvidia can maintain high profits margins on its products.\n\nIt's strange that we have to explain these things to Nvidia's critics, but sometimes you have to revisit the basics.\n\nJust recently, a Fortune commentator characterized Nvidia's growth as a \"problem,\" writing, \"By August of last year, Nvidia's stock was substantially overvalued by most metrics. Now? The problem has nearly tripled.\"\n\nThe naysayers and short sellers were wrong about Nvidia stock in August, and they'd be fools to double down now.\n\nShould we bother to point out that the company's adjusted earnings skyrocketed 461% YOY to $6.12 per share?\n\nNvidia's valuation can be justified by the company's growth and by the intense demand for Nvidia's H100 and Blackwell chips. Don't be surprised if the demand intensifies when Nvidia releases its H200 processors in the coming months.\n\nFortunately, the sensible commentators outnumber the perma-bears. For example, Oppenheimer's Rick Schafer listed several factors that justify Nvidia's valuation.\n\nThese factors, which include \"generative AI, DC [data center]/AI accelerators and autonomous vehicles,\" drive \"sustained outsize top-line growth\" for Nvidia.\n\nConsequently, Schafer isn't too worried about Nvidia's valuation. He recently reaffirmed his $150 price target on Nvidia stock.\n\nIn a similar vein, Barclays analyst Tom O'Malley published a $145 price target on Nvidia shares. These aren't unrealistic at all, since the stock broke above $130 not long ago.\n\nNvidia's juggernaut status is indisputable, but a few commentators will still double down on their wrongheaded bearish thesis. Apparently, they're willing to disregard the intense demand for Nvidia's best-in-class products.\n\nFor more sensible investors, it's just a question of how high the Nvidia share price might go. Could it revisit the pre-split price of $1,200 someday?\n\nAnything is possible, but let's not get ahead of ourselves. For now, we can focus on realistic near-term price targets like the ones proposed by Schafer and O'Malley.\n\nWith that in mind, Nvidia stock certainly deserves an \"A\" grade, and there's no need to let the naysayers change your mind in 2024.\n\nOn the date of publication, Louis Navellier had a long position in NVDA.

Nvidia shares ended the trading day at nearly $136, up 3.5%, surpassing Microsoft in market value. The company overtook Apple earlier this month.\n\nThe Californian firm's remarkable rise has been driven by its dominance in the production of chips essential for artificial intelligence (AI), referred to by analysts as the \"new gold or oil in the tech sector.\"\n\nNvidia's growth is undeniable, with its stock value now over 100 times higher than eight years ago. At that time, the company was primarily known for its competition with AMD in the graphics card market.\n\nIn recent years, Nvidia has benefited from the surge in demand for chips used to train and run generative AI models, such as OpenAI's ChatGPT. The firm also saw a significant boost in 2020 from increased sales of its graphics cards during the Bitcoin mining rush.\n\nThe rise of Nvidia has been mirrored by the growing prominence of its CEO, Jensen Huang.

The top stocks have jockeyed all month for the pole position, with Nvidia edging past its big-tech peers.\n\nEarlier in the month, Nvidia capped Apple by market value for the first time since 2002, and the two went back and forth in rankings in recent days. Last week, Apple also overtook Microsoft to trade in the top spot briefly.\n\nThe ranking is yet another reminder that AI is the top focus of many investors. Nvidia is seen as the biggest and earliest beneficiary of the technology as it dominates the market with its highly sought-after chips that help power data centers running complex computing tasks required by AI applications. Demand for its H100 accelerators are surging and helped drive the chipmaker's sales up by more than 125% last year.\n\nMicrosoft, for its part, is also seen as an early AI winner given its investment and partnership with OpenAI, which created ChatGPT. And, this week, Apple shares rallied after the iPhone maker finally unveiled its plan for using the technology, appeasing investors at long last.\n\n\"We believe over the next year the race to $4 Trillion Market Cap in Tech will be front and center between Nvidia, Apple, and Microsoft,\" Daniel Ives, analyst at Wedbush Securities, wrote in a note.\n\nNvidia's surging stock price has made co-founder and Chief Executive Officer Jensen Huang one of the world's richest people. His net worth has climbed more than $70 billion since the beginning of the year to $115 billion, putting him in 12th place on the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. That's the biggest gain among his billionaire peers.\n\nInvestors, alongside Huang, argue that Nvidia is more than a chipmaker.\n\n\"They're not just selling chips, they're selling systems,\" Michael Lippert, vice president and portfolio manager at the Baron Capital Inc., said in an interview, pointing to the company's proprietary software and development ecosystem.\n\nNvidia's swift climb to the top has been record breaking, as the company is one of the few firms to have demonstrated significant revenue growth from AI. Through last close, shares have risen more than 160% in 2024, adding more than $2 trillion to its market capitalization.\n\n\"Nvidia's GPU chips are in essence the new gold or oil in the tech sector as more enterprises and consumers quickly head down this path with the 4th Industrial Revolution well underway,\" said Ives.\n\n--With assistance from Bre Bradham and Kristine Owram.\n\n(Updates stock moves throughout, adds detail on CEO Jensen Huang in paragraph seven.)", "source": {"uri": "finance.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo!

Nvidia earlier this month joined the tech giants in becoming the only US companies to cross a $3 trillion market cap.\n\nThe chipmaker's stock has been on a tear for the last year and a half. Nvidia's chips are unmatched in producing processors that power artificial intelligence systems, including for generative AI, the technology backing OpenAI's ChatGPT that can create text, images and other media.\n\nNvidia is the leader of the tech behemoth Magnificent Seven stocks that have driven much of the stock market's returns since the artificial intelligence frenzy overtook Wall Street last year. The company's stock is up roughly 175% for the year and was the S&P 500 index's best performer in 2023.\n\nThe Jensen Huang-led company's dethroning of Microsoft comes as Wall Street's most prominent tech companies battle for the coveted top spot. Apple on June 13 became the most valuable US company as announcements made at its annual Worldwide Developers Conference, including generative AI features for the iPhone, sent the stock climbing. The iPhone maker's market cap slid back below Microsoft's just a day later.\n\nNvidia completed a 10-for-1 stock split on June 7. The chipmaker last month posted yet another blockbuster quarter, noting a 262% increase in revenue and a 462% increase in profits year-over-year.\n\nThe-CNN-Wire\u2122 & \u00a9 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

The Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund (NYSEARCA:XLK), for example, is adding more than $10 billion worth of Nvidia shares as it rebalances at the end of the second quarter.\n\nAt the same time, 40 Wall Street analysts rate Nvidia stock a \"strong buy\" and see more upside ahead. There are no \"sell\" ratings on the stock despite the fact that the share price has risen 172% this year and nearly tripled in the last 12 months.\n\nHuge Demand\n\nThe outperformance in Nvidia stock is being driven by huge global demand for its microchips and processors, which power AI applications and models.\n\nThe massive demand has translated into escalating sales and profits at Nvidia. The company most recently reported that its revenue in the first quarter of this year rose 268% from a year ago.\n\nAt the same time, the company's profit was up 646% year-over-year.\n\nNvidia reported that sales at its data center unit, which includes it's AI microchips and semiconductors, rose 427% from a year earlier to $22.6 billion. However, Nvidia isn't a one-trick pony.\n\nThe company also highlighted strong sales of its networking parts that are used to connect clusters of microchips and processors. Nvidia said that it had $3.2 billion in networking revenue during Q1, which was three times more than sales recorded during the same period of 2023.\n\nChips used in video games saw their revenue rise 18% during the quarter to $2.65 billion.\n\nNew AI Chips\n\nWhile Nvidia is getting a boost from all areas of its business, demand for its AI chips is what's driving the company and its share price to new heights.\n\nTo keep pace with the soaring demand, and to keep competitors at bay, Nvidia has been rolling out new artificial intelligence products at a brisk clip. Currently, Nvidia controls about three-quarters (75%) of the worldwide market for AI chips and semiconductors.\n\nIn March of this year, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang introduced new AI graphics processors called the \"Blackwell\" series. The first Blackwell chip called the \"GB200'' will ship later this year.\n\nHowever, Nvidia has already unveiled the next microchip that will eventually replace the Blackwell chip. Called \"Rubin\" chips, the successor to the Blackwell series will be Nvidia's most powerful and energy efficient chip yet.\n\nThe Rubin chips are scheduled to ship in 2026 and highlight the speed at which Nvidia is updating its technology in order to stay a step ahead of rival chipmakers.\n\nBuy Nvidia Stock\n\nNvidia has largely powered the current stock market rally that began in October 2022.

Indeed, the main reason why Nvidia's stock price continues to go up and up is that its GPUs are used in 80 percent of those AI data centers from Microsoft, Google, OpenAI, and more companies.\n\nEarlier this month, Nvidia went over the $3 trillion market cap for the first time and surpassed Apple to become the second most valuable publicly traded company.

And, this week, Apple shares rallied after the iPhone maker finally unveiled its plan for using the technology, appeasing investors at long last.\n\n\"We believe over the next year the race to $4 Trillion Market Cap in Tech will be front and center between Nvidia, Apple, and Microsoft,\" Daniel Ives, analyst at Wedbush Securities, wrote in a note.\n\nNvidia's surging stock price has made co-founder and Chief Executive Officer Jensen Huang one of the world's richest people. His net worth has climbed nearly $75 billion since the beginning of the year to $119 billion, putting him in 12th place on the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. That's the biggest gain among his billionaire peers.\n\nInvestors, alongside Huang, argue that Nvidia is more than a chipmaker.\n\nALSO READ| Why much of the US is sweltering: 'Heat dome' explained\n\n\"They're not just selling chips, they're selling systems,\" Michael Lippert, vice president and portfolio manager at the Baron Capital Inc., said in an interview, pointing to the company's proprietary software and development ecosystem.\n\nNvidia's swift climb to the top has been record breaking, as the company is one of the few firms to have demonstrated significant revenue growth from AI. Shares have risen more than 170% in 2024 through Tuesday's close, adding more than $2 trillion to its market capitalization.\n\n\"Nvidia's GPU chips are in essence the new gold or oil in the tech sector as more enterprises and consumers quickly head down this path with the 4th Industrial Revolution well underway,\" said Ives.", "source": {"uri": "hindustantimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Hindustan Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nvidia", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nvidia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_value", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Market value"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semiconductor", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Semiconductor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_capitalization", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Market capitalization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stock"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ChatGPT", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "ChatGPT"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travel_visa", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Travel visa"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenAI", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "OpenAI"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computing", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Computing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_center", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Data center"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H-1B_visa", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "H-1B visa"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPhone", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "IPhone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Homeland_Security", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of Homeland Security"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloomberg_Billionaires_Index", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bloomberg Billionaires Index"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Lippert", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Michael Lippert"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jensen_Huang", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jensen Huang"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proprietary_software", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Proprietary software"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billionaire", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Billionaire"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Industrial_Revolution", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Industrial Revolution"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wedbush_Securities", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wedbush Securities"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_president", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Vice president"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphics_processing_unit", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Graphics processing unit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petroleum", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Petroleum"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks_and_Bonds", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks and Bonds", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Research_and_Analysis", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Research and Analysis", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Marketing_and_Advertising/Consulting", "label": "dmoz/Business/Marketing and Advertising/Consulting", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Information_Technology/Marketing_and_Advertising", "label": "dmoz/Business/Information Technology/Marketing and Advertising", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 78}], "image": "https://www.hindustantimes.com/ht-img/img/2024/06/19/1600x900/FILES-US-STOCKS-IT-NVIDIA-0_1718759384267_1718759401104.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9658445", "eventUri": "eng-9658445", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3725490196078431, "wgt": 166, "relevance": 1}

Nvidia has been riding the wave of accelerating adoption of artificial intelligence (AI), providing the graphics processing units (GPUs) that are the gold standard for powering the systems responsible for AI training and inference.\n\nThe company also completed a 10-for-1 stock split that was a hit with investors, driving the stock even higher.\n\nWith gains of that magnitude, it would be easy to conclude that the opportunity has passed, and the easy money has already been made. I think that view could be a costly one, as I predict that Nvidia's market cap is headed to $5 trillion, which would push its share price above $203, representing upside of 50% compared to the Tuesday's closing price.\n\nLet's take a look at how Nvidia could get there in the not-too-distant future.\n\nGenerative AI burst onto the scene last year, touting the ability to streamline and automate time-consuming and mundane tasks. The potential to increase worker productivity was met with cheers from corporate America as companies race to adopt these next-generation algorithms.\n\nNvidia supplies the processors with the computational horsepower necessary to run these AI systems. The company has been scrambling as demand has far outstripped supply. The supply shortages are beginning to ease as Nvidia has worked with its partners to ramp up production.\n\nFurthermore, the company has a virtual monopoly on machine learning (an earlier branch of AI) with an estimated 95% share of the market, according to data compiled by New Street Research. This helps explain why demand for generative AI quickly became a boon to Nvidia, given its proven expertise in the area.\n\nThere's more: The need to upgrade data centers to handle the rigors of AI has been at the heart of the current demand cycle, which is expected to continue. The vast majority of generative AI processing takes place in data centers and in the cloud, and it's estimated Nvidia controls 92% of the data center GPU market, according to IoT Analytics.\n\nRobust growth is expected to continue across the data center market, climbing from $302 billion in 2023 to $622 billion by 2030, according to Prescient and Strategic Intelligence Market Research. As the leading provider of data center GPUs, this trend favors Nvidia.\n\nLet's not forget, however, that it all began with the humble GPUs used to render lifelike images in video games, another area Nvidia dominates. Despite growing competition, it maintains a healthy lead in the industry it pioneered. In the first quarter of 2024, it controlled an 88% share of the discrete desktop GPU market, according to Jon Peddie Research.\n\nAs inflation subsides, the pent-up demand for new, state-of-the-art graphics cards will drive a new upgrade cycle for Nvidia gaming chips. Sales of gaming GPUs are expected to soar from $2.7 billion in 2023 to $11.7 billion by 2028, according to Mordor Intelligence. As the market leader, this trend also favors Nvidia.\n\nThe company has a number of other opportunities that could take off, including self-driving cars, professional visualization, and quantum computing, which currently make up just a small percentage of the company's overall sales.\n\nLastly, the Nvidia GB200 Grace Blackwell Superchip will be released later this year, setting a new standard for AI processing. The largest hyperscale cloud-infrastructure providers are already lining up to pay top dollar for these state-of-the-art AI platforms, which suggests the company will remain as the AI market leader.\n\nNvidia currently has a market cap of roughly $3.34 trillion, which means it will require stock price gains of roughly 50% to drive its value to $5 trillion. That seems like small change compared to its 2024 year-to-date gains of 174%, so it's likely just a matter of time.\n\nAccording to Wall Street's consensus estimates, the company is expected to generate revenue of $120.5 billion in fiscal 2025 (which began in January). That gives the stock a forward price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of roughly 28. If that P/S remains constant, Nvidia will need to generate annual revenue of roughly $180 billion to support a $5 trillion market cap.\n\nCoincidentally, Wall Street is already guiding for revenue growth of 98% in fiscal 2025 (this calendar year) and 33% in fiscal 2026. If the company hits those targets, it could achieve a $5 trillion market cap as early as 2026.\n\nDon't take my word for it. Rosenblatt Securities analyst Hans Mosesmann just reaffirmed his buy rating on Nvidia stock and assigned a Street-high $200 price target, citing greater demands for AI software and the release of the Blackwell architecture later this year.\n\nIt's important to note that there are no guarantees. Any failure to achieve investors' lofty ambitions -- real or perceived -- would likely be met with a quick and potentially brutal sell-off.

That's as the artificial intelligence craze has gripped Wall Street, and Nvidia's quarterly earnings show no sign that the rush to stock up on AI chips isn't slowing down.\n\nBut relying so much on one stock also represents a big risk, Sl\u00f8k warned.\n\n\"Such a high concentration implies that if NVIDIA continues to rise, then things are fine,\" he wrote in a note on Wednesday. \"But if it starts to decline, then the S&P 500 will be hit hard.\"\n\nBecause the S&P 500 is weighted by market cap, even relatively minor wobbles from behemoths like Nvidia, Apple, and Microsoft can move the needle on the broad stock market index.\n\nAnd as retail investors increasingly load up on S&P 500 index funds, that means exposure to Nvidia -- for better or for worse -- is growing as well.\n\n\"The bottom line is that the extreme concentration of returns in the S&P 500 makes investors more vulnerable to single headlines impacting the one stock driving index returns,\" Sl\u00f8k added.\n\nThis isn't the first time he has sounded the alarm on the stock market's dependence on Big Tech.\n\nWhen Nvidia's market cap topped $2 trillion for the first time ever earlier this year, Sl\u00f8k compared tech valuations to the bubble seen during the dot-com era.\n\n\"The top 10 companies in the S&P 500 today are more overvalued than the top 10 companies were during the tech bubble in the mid-1990s,\" he wrote at the time.\n\nOthers on Wall Street are also growing more skeptical about Nvidia's valuation and its attractiveness as an investment after the stock's epic rally.\n\nBut Nvidia stock bulls remain. Beth Kindig, lead tech analyst at the I/O Fund, sees more astronomical gains in the coming years, predicting its market cap will surge more than triple again to $10 trillion by 2030.\n\nMeanwhile, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang continues to surprise Wall Street, most recently by laying out a rapid cadence of new AI platforms.\n\nEarlier this month, he said Nvidia plans to upgrade its AI accelerators every year as he announced the Blackwell Ultra chip for 2025 and a next-generation platform in development called Rubin for 2026.\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com", "source": {"uri": "aol.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Aol"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S&P_500_Index", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "S&P 500 Index"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nvidia", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nvidia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_capitalization", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Market capitalization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valuation_(finance)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Valuation (finance)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apollo_program", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Apollo program"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wall_Street", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wall Street"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economist", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Economist"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Economist", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Economist"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dot-com_bubble", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dot-com bubble"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock_market_index", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Stock market index"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Investor", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Investor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Tech", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Big Tech"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jensen_Huang", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jensen Huang"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fortune_(magazine)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fortune (magazine)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronomy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Astronomy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock_market", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Stock market"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks_and_Bonds", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks and Bonds", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Research_and_Analysis", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Research and Analysis", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Education_and_Training", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Education and Training", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Major_Companies/Company_Rankings", "label": "dmoz/Business/Major Companies/Company Rankings", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 84}], "image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/D3S_w6TqVfNVXGf7d_K2TQ--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD04MDA-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/aol_fortune_385/22a0c278221453d141de84cb0d96e3de", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9658445", "eventUri": "eng-9658445", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.08235294117647052, "wgt": 165, "relevance": 1}

Astonishingly, it took just eight months.\n\nJensen Huang, 61, the Taiwan-born electrical engineering graduate who founded Nvidia alongside microchip designers Chris Malachowsky and Curtis Priem\n\nNvidia originally made computer chips for video game software, but has since expanded its horizons to dominate the AI sector\n\nThe latest surge means the company - whose chips have turbo-charged the meteoric rise of artificial intelligence (AI) - has seen its share price rise from under $4 in June 2019 to almost $136 today. That's an incredible 3,477 per cent increase in five years.\n\nCan British investors still make a profit on Nvidia shares, or have you missed the boat if you don't already own them?\n\nExperts say that there may be more good gains to be had - though the stock is not for the faint-hearted.\n\n'We have for some time thought Nvidia would become the most valuable company in the world,' says Stephen Yiu, who manages the \u00a31.1billion Blue Whale Growth Fund.\n\n'In overtaking Microsoft, it has now achieved that remarkable milestone.'\n\nYiu has put his money where his mouth is - and made 'more than \u00a3100million' backing the AI pioneer in just three years.\n\nBut the company's latest leap has taken even him by surprise.\n\nHe recently thought it might take Nvidia another two years to become the world's biggest company... it took just over two weeks.\n\nSo can Nvidia's amazing run continue? Yiu, for one, is happy to keep it as his fund's biggest single holding.\n\nHe argues that investors are still too focused on the microchips side of the business while overlooking the importance of Nvidia's associated software, where he thinks sales growth is likely to be faster over the next decade.\n\nExperts have been busy upgrading their price targets on the back of Nvidia's latest share spike.\n\nRosenblatt Securities analyst Hans Mosesmann thinks the shares could hit $200, which would put Nvidia's value within touching distance of $5trillion.\n\nHe argues that investors are still too focused on the microchips side of the business while overlooking the importance of Nvidia's associated software, where he thinks sales growth is likely to be faster over the next decade.\n\nCathie Wood of Ark Invest and an early backer of Nvidia reckons the market for AI software could be worth $13trillion by 2030.\n\nWood famously sold out of Nvidia last year, a decision that is estimated to have cost her flagship technology fund up to $800million in potential profits.\n\nCathie Wood of Ark Invest and an early backer of Nvidia reckons the market for AI software could be worth $13trillion by 2030.\n\nWood famously sold out of Nvidia last year, a decision that is estimated to have cost her flagship technology fund up to $800million in potential profits.\n\n'To count the next four largest companies in the world as customers - Apple, Alphabet, Amazon and Microsoft - is surely a sign of a business offering a world-leading product that cannot be ignored,' he adds.\n\nAlthough Nvidia shares don't look ludicrously over-valued at the moment, they 'can't keep going up in a straight line for ever', says Derren Nathan, head of equity research at investment platform Hargreaves Lansdown.\n\nOne risk is that governments - concerned about the risks to society and even humanity itself - may attempt to clamp down on AI.\n\nRather than trying to pick individual winners by putting all your chips on one bet, experts suggest that you spread your risk by putting money into a fund with shares in Nvidia or AI more generally.\n\n'Fortunately, there are plenty of AI-themed investment funds on offer,' says Dan Coatsworth, investment analyst at investment platform AJ Bell.\n\nAs well as the Blue Whale Growth Fund, there is Polar Capital's \u00a3580million AI fund, which has Nvidia as its biggest single holding, making up 6.3 per cent of the portfolio.\n\n'The fund provides broad exposure, prioritising companies that are either key enablers or beneficiaries of AI,' says Coatsworth. These include Microsoft, Amazon, Micron Technology and Advanced Micro Devices.\n\nNvidia is also the biggest constituent of the technology stock-heavy Scottish Mortgage Investment Trust on 8 per cent. Experts say other technology funds to consider include Axa Framlington Global Technology, Fidelity Global Technology, Janus Henderson Global Technology Leaders and Allianz Technology Trust.\n\nInvesting in technology funds is easy through a stocks and shares Isa, a self-invested personal pension (Sipp) or a general investment account.\n\nBritish investors can buy American stocks through an online broker, but may pay a higher trading or administration fee. UK-based shareholders of US companies must also fill in a W-8 BEN form, which allows them to pay a reduced tax rate on the investment.\n\nSo just how did a start-up without a business plan, that was founded in a California diner, conquer all before it? And can British private investors get a slice of the action?\n\nNvidia is the brainchild of Jensen Huang - a Taiwan-born electrical engineering graduate whose parents sent him to the US as a child - and two microchip designers, Chris Malachowsky and Curtis Priem.\n\nThey founded Nvidia in 1993 at a Denny's restaurant in San Jose, in the heart of Silicon Valley.\n\nThe plan was to call their company NVision - until they found out that name was taken by a toilet paper manufacturer. Huang, who once worked as a waiter and dishwasher in a Denny's outlet for $2.65 an hour, suggested Nvidia instead, based on the Latin word 'invidia' meaning 'envy'.\n\nHe has run the company ever since, becoming one of the world's richest people in the process.\n\nNvidia's main product is a graphics-processing unit (GPU) - a wafer-thin circuit board with a powerful microchip at its core. These processors allow lightweight, energy efficient personal computers and laptops to perform a huge number of calculations at high speed.\n\nFor decades the big microchip maker was Intel, but Nvidia differs from its rival in some key ways.\n\nIntel and others make industry-standard general purpose chips known as 'central processing units' (CPUs), which handle all the main functions of a computer, producing one mathematical calculation at a time.\n\nBut Nvidia's GPU can complete complex and repetitive tasks much faster, breaking them down into smaller components before processing them in parallel.\n\nIf CPUs are delivery vehicles dropping off one package at a time, Nvidia's GPUs are more like a fleet of high-speed motorbikes spreading across a city. That made them the perfect processors to power the dawning AI revolution.\n\nUnlike Intel, Nvidia doesn't make its own chips - that's mainly contracted out to the Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company. Crucially, though, Nvidia not only designs the hardware, but also the software on which they run.\n\n'What Nvidia does for a living is not build the chip - we build the entire supercomputer, from the chip to the system, to the interconnects, the NVLinks, the networking, but very importantly the software,' says Huang, 61.\n\nThis secret-sauce software package is called Cuda. Nvidia's chips originally set out to improve the computer graphics used by video gamers. Cuda's creation in 2006 allowed other, all-purpose applications to run on Nvidia's chips, too.\n\nInitially, AI wasn't one of them. In the early 2010s, AI was still a technology backwater where progress in areas such as speech and image recognition was slow.\n\nEven less fashionable were 'neural networks' - computing structures which mimic the workings of the human brain.\n\nNvidia's breakthrough came when the Cuda platform was championed by British-Canadian computer scientist and cognitive psychologist Geoffrey Hinton, dubbed the 'godfather of AI'.\n\nTwo of his students trained a neural network to identify videos of cats using just two of Nvidia's boards. Google boffins needed 16,000 CPUs to perform the feat. Machine learning had arrived.\n\nThe stunning results prompted Huang to go all-in on AI in 2013.\n\nNvidia's GPUs were soon to be found in everything from smart cars to robotics and data centres with customers ranging from Tesla to Microsoft and Amazon. One setback was a failed \u00a331billion bid to buy Cambridge-based chip designer Arm Holdings.\n\nBut Nvidia really came of age a year ago with news that ChatGPT - Open AI's chatbot - was powered by its supercomputers. This propelled the shares into orbit.\n\nThe news led to a frenzy among big tech companies and AI start-ups for Nvidia's processors, leading to shortages that could last into next year.\n\nOn May 23, bumper results that beat market expectations caused the company's value to increase by $200billion in just one day.\n\nTo meet the insatiable demand, Nvidia plans to launch a new generation of AI chips - code-named Blackwell - later this year, costing more than $30,000 each.\n\nIt can charge so much because of its stranglehold on the AI chip market, with a market share of more than 80 per cent.\n\nThis near-monopoly has turned Nvidia into a massive money-making machine, fueling potentially huge future share price rises.", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk", "dataType": "news",

This surpasses Microsoft, which was formerly the most valuable company in the world at $3.15 trillion.\n\nNvidia is now a $3 trillion company - and the second-most-valuable company in the U.S. stock market.\n\nAs CNBC reports, Nvidia shares closed today up 5% to $1,224.40, giving the company a market cap of $3.01 trillion for the first time in its history. That puts it just ahead of Apple with its $3 trillion, making it the second-largest public company behind Microsoft, which has a market cap of $3.15 trillion.\n\nNvidia has seen phenomenal growth in the last few years, thanks in large part to its leadership in the AI race, becoming a leading chip supplier for companies looking to delve into the technology. According to CNBC report from earlier this week, the company's AI accelerators have between 70% and 95% of the market share for artificial intelligence chips.\n\nIn turn, Nvidia's market cap has rapidly skyrocketed over the last two years in particular. The tech company, best known for its gaming and graphics GPUs, reached a market cap of $2 trillion just this past February, becoming the first chipmaker to reach the milestone. That came less than a year after it hit the $1 trillion mark in May 2023.\n\nTo put it in perspective: as CNBC points out, Nvidia stock has soared more than 3,224% over the past five years, and it shows no signs of slowing down. The company reported first-quarter earnings of a whopping $26 billion last month, more than triple its earnings from the same period a year ago.\n\nThe company announced last month that it plans to release a new AI chip once per year, an increase from the previous once every two years cadence.", "source": {"uri": "ign.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "IGN"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nvidia", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nvidia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_capitalization", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Market capitalization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNBC", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "CNBC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloomberg_L.P.", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bloomberg L.P."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Stock_Exchange", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York Stock Exchange"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AI_accelerator", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "AI accelerator"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_company", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Public company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_share", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Market share"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphics_processing_unit", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Graphics processing unit"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Marketing_and_Advertising", "label": "dmoz/Business/Marketing and Advertising", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Marketing_and_Advertising/Consulting", "label": "dmoz/Business/Marketing and Advertising/Consulting", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Industrial_Goods_and_Services/Marketing_and_Advertising", "label": "dmoz/Business/Industrial Goods and Services/Marketing and Advertising", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Food_and_Related_Products/Marketing_and_Advertising", "label": "dmoz/Business/Food and Related Products/Marketing and Advertising", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Information_Technology/Marketing_and_Advertising", "label": "dmoz/Business/Information Technology/Marketing and Advertising", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 73}], "image": "https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/06/05/nvidia-blogroll-logos-1708718418344-1717630971898.jpg?width=1280", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9658445", "eventUri": "eng-9658445", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3803921568627451, "wgt": 164, "relevance": 1}

If you'd like to get this direct to your inbox, every single week, you can sign up here.\n\nHello and welcome back to\u202f's science and tech newsletter. Our series of guest newsletters that try to untangle big issues affecting the twinned worlds of science and technology continue once more. I'm Chris Stokel-Walker, a freelance journalist and regular contributor to\u202f.\n\nThis week, we're looking at the world's most valuable company's prodigious rise. This is the story behind Nvidia, the company that launched on the stock market 25 years ago, only became a trillion-dollar firm last year, and now has supplanted tech titans Apple and Microsoft.\n\nSmall beginnings in a diner\n\nNvidia was the brainchild of first-generation American Jensen Huang, the child of Taiwanese immigrants, and co-founders Chris Malachowsky and Curtis Priem. The trio came up with their idea sitting around a table at the American diner chain Denny's in 1993.\n\nInitially called Nvision, the company first focused on developing a multimedia platform to provide a better gaming experience with more immersive audio, better graphics, and faster performance. This became Nvidia's first graphics card, a piece of computer hardware designed to better render visuals on PCs, called the NV1, released in November 1995.\n\nLater, the company moved away from graphics cards and developed what was called a graphics processing unit, or GPU. This was a specific unit within a computer designed to focus on how to show graphics on devices - to serve the burgeoning computer game market. But researchers quickly realised that the oomph of the processing power could be used to focus on the complex array of calculations required by AI models.\n\nThis proved to be the killer use case for a company that has now seen its share price rise 591,078 per cent since its initial public offering in 1999. The firm is now worth $3.3trn.\n\nBig beneficiaries of the AI boom\n\nWhen ChatGPT became the fastest-growing app in history after its initial release in November 2022, Nvidia was well-placed to benefit. The company is the key provider of the GPU chips that are used by big tech companies to power the artificial intelligence models that sit behind ChatGPT and others.\n\nAnd by being in that position, it stands to benefit - hugely - from the AI boom.\n\nBut Nvidia's position as the main company providing hardware for the AI revolution is worrying, said Mike Katell, ethics fellow at The Alan Turing Institute. \"Considering the growing importance of AI, we're witnessing an astonishing concentration of wealth and power in just one company,\" he explained.\n\nCarissa Veliz, an associate professor in AI ethics at the University of Oxford, added: \"It's a very interesting development, and very telling expression of the AI hype. I do think there's a lot of hype, and it's still to be seen if it will last.\"\n\nThe exact path of the future of AI may not yet be clear, and the major uncertainty is whether AI has been overvalued, rather than whether it is here to stay: Veliz is about to travel to Spain to advise the government there on developing their own AI model, which would likely require chips - including those by Nvidia - to train and run.\n\n\"But most of the AI hype is still based on a promise of how we will solve [a certain] problem rather than how we can solve it,\" she said. Veliz's use of AI models hasn't yet turned up an example that shows how they can live up to the promise such as improving productivity and how we live our lives, while she worries the coming regulatory crackdown on the AI industry could also stymie its growth.\n\nNevertheless, Nvidia has managed to position itself as the de facto supplier of the computer chips integral to operating AI systems. \"Nvidia's GPU chips are, in essence, the new gold or oil in the tech sector,\" said Dan Ives, managing director and senior equity research analyst at Wedbush Securities. The analyst believes \"the fourth Industrial Revolution [is] well under way\".\n\nA note of caution\n\nThere is one thing to bear in mind when considering Nvidia's blockbuster valuation, however - which is beyond the AI hype cycle. The company is often called a computer chip manufacturer. That's not entirely true.\n\nWhile it does design the GPUs that are currently powering the generative AI revolution, it doesn't actually build them. And that's the lingering issue at the back of Nvidia's business model. Nvidia takes orders for its chips - millions of them, with backlogs and waitlists reported - and then passes the manufacturing of them off to other companies to actually produce.\n\nAnd it's there where Nvidia's weakness may lie. The lion's share of Nvidia's chips is made by Taiwan-based chip manufacturer TSMC, whose own share price isn't too shabby: it's risen by 65 per cent so far this year. But the majority of TSMC's factories are located in Taiwan, which lives under the shadow of a potential invasion by China. This could ultimately disrupt supply chains.\n\nThat risk, coupled with the near-monopoly the company has on the market, should worry us all, said Katell. \"Nvidia's enormous size and wealth is troubling on many levels, but first of all is that just one company is currently capable of building sufficiently powerful processors to keep pace with the arms race that's occurring in the AI field,\" he explained.\n\nLeading the way\n\nAs interest in AI has continued to develop - data analysed by me ahead of the release of my book, How AI Ate the World, earlier this year suggested that a new news story about AI was published every 24 seconds in the first four months of this year - so has Nvidia's share price rocketed. The value of the company has nearly doubled since 1 January.\n\nThe big question, of course, is now that Nvidia has reached the top of the mountain and outstripped its competitors, can it stay there? Are we in the middle of the frothiest AI bubble we've ever seen - and is it about to burst? Or is Nvidia likely to go even further?\n\nFor Ives, it's Nvidia's game to lose. \"The godfather of AI Jensen Huang and Nvidia are leading this revolution, and it's a race to $4trn market cap with Nvidia, Microsoft and Apple battling for the top spot.\"\n\nGiven how ubiquitous AI is, and given its central importance to all our lives now, it's likely that Nvidia will manage to overcome any issues. For one thing, it's seen as too big to fail by those who have invested huge amounts of money into the AI revolution. And the company recognises that it's exposed to single points of failure - something it's working hard to avoid. It's already diversifying its production lines outside of Taiwan.\n\nThe fact that Huang is a skilled operator and leader of a business doesn't harm its chances either. So while it's vulnerable, Nvidia, thanks to its uniquely strong standing and intelligent leadership, is still in a strong position to weather the storm and continue its growth unabated.\n\nThere's a global race for the next generation of supercolliders beyond CERN's Large Hadron Collider, and it looks likely that China could come around the corner and pip European development to the post, according to this interesting Nature story.", "source": {"uri": "inews.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "inews.co.uk"}, "authors": [{"uri": "chris_stokel_walker@inews.co.uk", "name": "Chris

The stock has experienced a surge of over nine fold since the conclusion of 2022, a phenomenon that has coincided with the advancement of generative artificial intelligence.\n\nThis industry has experienced substantial growth due to the competition among companies such as Microsoft, Alphabet, Amazon, Meta, and OpenAI for the acquisition of the processors needed to construct AI models and execute escalating workloads.\n\nIn the most recent quarter, Nvidia's data center division generated $22.6 billion in revenue, a 427% increase from the same period a year ago. This accounts for approximately 86% of the organization's total revenue.\n\nApple's stock experienced a nearly one percent decline in trading on Tuesday, resulting in a market value of $3.28 trillion. After the company's shares declined by less than a percentage point, Microsoft's market capitalization was $3.32 trillion.\n\nNvidia's initial decades were primarily characterized by its role as a hardware company, which sold chips to players to enable them to operate 3D games. In 1991, Nvidia was founded. Furthermore, it has experience with cloud gaming subscriptions and cryptocurrency mining processors.\n\nHowever, in the past two years, Nvidia's stock has experienced a meteoric rise as Wall Street has come to recognize the company's technology as the primary force behind an explosion in artificial intelligence that shows no signs of abating. Jensen Huang, the CEO of the company, has increased his net worth to over $117 billion as a consequence of the rally. This elevates him to the eleventh wealthiest individual in the world, according to Forbes.\n\nMicrosoft shares have appreciated by approximately twenty percent since the commencement of the current year. Furthermore, the artificial intelligence boom has been a significant asset to the software colossus. This is due to the fact that it has acquired a substantial stake in OpenAI and has integrated the AI models developed by the company into its most critical products, including Windows and Office.\n\nA new iteration of laptops, known as Copilot+, has been recently introduced by the company. These laptops are designed to operate its artificial intelligence models.\n\nNvidia has become the most highly valued corporation in the United States in recent years. For the past few years, the title has been exchanged between Apple and Microsoft.\n\nAs a result of Nvidia's rapid ascent, the company has yet to be incorporated into the Dow Jones Industrial Average. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is a benchmark that has historically represented the thirty most valuable corporations in the United States. It is composed of thirty equities. On January 7th, Nvidia implemented a 10-for-1 stock split, as previously announced. The company's results report was released concurrently with this announcement.\n\nIt is a price-weighted index, which implies that the benchmark is significantly influenced by companies with higher stock prices, rather than market capitalizations. The division increases Nvidia's likelihood of being included in the Dow, a price-weighted index.\n\nSEE ALSO:", "source": {"uri": "chiangraitimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CTN News l Chiang Rai Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nvidia", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nvidia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_capitalization", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Market capitalization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Generative artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State-owned_enterprise", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "State-owned enterprise"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenAI", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "OpenAI"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphics_processing_unit", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Graphics processing unit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta_Platforms", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Meta Platforms"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alphabet_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Alphabet Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_gaming", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cloud gaming"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_(company)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Amazon (company)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptocurrency", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cryptocurrency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3D_computer_graphics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "3D computer graphics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_center", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Data center"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_value", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Market value"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wall_Street", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Wall Street"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jensen_Huang", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jensen Huang"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock_split", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Stock split"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forbes", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Forbes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laptop", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Laptop"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Windows", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft Windows"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dow_Jones_Industrial_Average", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dow Jones Industrial Average"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Software"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corporation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Corporation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Stock"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks_and_Bonds", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks and Bonds", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Major_Companies", "label": "dmoz/Business/Major Companies", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Information_Technology/Marketing_and_Advertising", "label": "dmoz/Business/Information Technology/Marketing and Advertising", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 89}], "image": "https://www.chiangraitimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Nvidia-3.webp", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9658445", "eventUri": "eng-9658445", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-01-07", "textStart": 3350, "textEnd": 3361}], "sentiment": 0.3568627450980393, "wgt": 164, "relevance": 1}

That's as the artificial intelligence craze has gripped Wall Street, and Nvidia's quarterly earnings show no sign that the rush to stock up on AI chips isn't slowing down.\n\nBut relying so much on one stock also represents a big risk, Sl\u00f8k warned.\n\n\"Such a high concentration implies that if NVIDIA continues to rise, then things are fine,\" he wrote in a note on Wednesday. \"But if it starts to decline, then the S&P 500 will be hit hard.\"\n\nBecause the S&P 500 is weighted by market cap, even relatively minor wobbles from behemoths like Nvidia, Apple, and Microsoft can move the needle on the broad stock market index.\n\nAnd as retail investors increasingly load up on S&P 500 index funds, that means exposure to Nvidia -- for better or for worse -- is growing as well.\n\n\"The bottom line is that the extreme concentration of returns in the S&P 500 makes investors more vulnerable to single headlines impacting the one stock driving index returns,\" Sl\u00f8k added.\n\nThis isn't the first time he has sounded the alarm on the stock market's dependence on Big Tech.\n\nWhen Nvidia's market cap topped $2 trillion for the first time ever earlier this year, Sl\u00f8k compared tech valuations to the bubble seen during the dot-com era.\n\n\"The top 10 companies in the S&P 500 today are more overvalued than the top 10 companies were during the tech bubble in the mid-1990s,\" he wrote at the time.\n\nOthers on Wall Street are also growing more skeptical about Nvidia's valuation and its attractiveness as an investment after the stock's epic rally.\n\nBut Nvidia stock bulls remain. Beth Kindig, lead tech analyst at the I/O Fund, sees more astronomical gains in the coming years, predicting its market cap will surge more than triple again to $10 trillion by 2030.\n\nMeanwhile, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang continues to surprise Wall Street, most recently by laying out a rapid cadence of new AI platforms.\n\nEarlier this month, he said Nvidia plans to upgrade its AI accelerators every year as he announced the Blackwell Ultra chip for 2025 and a next-generation platform in development called Rubin for 2026.", "source": {"uri": "ca.finance.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo!

However, when it comes to Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA), the chip maker's eye-popping valuation may not actually be signs of a bubble. Rather, it might reflect a deeper truth about the rapidly evolving state of artificial intelligence (AI).\n\nNvidia's shares are currently trading at 77.1 times trailing earnings, a lofty valuation by historical standards and rich even for the high-growth tech sector. This has led some investors to question whether it's time to take profits on Nvidia stock. After all, the chipmaker's shares are up by a staggering 206% over the prior 12 months.\n\nImage Source: Getty Images.\n\nHowever, several lines of evidence suggest that Nvidia's growth story is still in the early innings and that AI is on track to fundamentally alter the world. Here is a look at five key tailwinds that should power Nvidia's shares even higher over the next several years.\n\nFive key themes\n\nFirst, the general population remains largely unaware of the true power of AI. This situation is set to change dramatically later this year as Apple integrates AI into its ecosystem and Amazon strives to make Alexa smarter with AI.\n\nAs a broad base of consumers begin to experience the benefits of AI in their daily lives, demand for AI-powered products and services will likely skyrocket, driving substantial revenue growth for companies like Nvidia that provide the architecture behind the technology.\n\nSecond, the pace of AI development is accelerating. The exponential growth of computing power has put humanity on the doorstep of a series of \"Gutenberg moments\", or events that completely upend the status quo.\n\nThis quickening pace of innovation implies that rivals probably won't have time to challenge Nvidia's dominant position in the AI-capable graphics processing unit (GPU) space. While competitors like Advanced Micro Devices and Intel are aiming to cut into Nvidia's dominant market share, the window of opportunity is closing.\n\nThird, the AI arms race between leading American firms, and the U.S. and China more broadly, won't allow developers time to create alternative ecosystems.\n\nThe race to achieve artificial general intelligence (AGI) is on, and Nvidia's superchips like Blackwell will likely be the primary drivers of this transformation. As companies and nations scramble to gain a competitive edge in AI, Nvidia's technology will remain in high demand.\n\nFourth, the advent of AI won't follow any rules established by prior transformational technologies like the internet or cars. AI can potentially alter human society at a fundamental level, and it will happen in less than five years.\n\nTraditional valuation metrics and historical precedents, in turn, may not wholly apply to groundbreaking companies like Nvidia.\n\nFifth, the potential applications of AI are virtually limitless, spanning across industries such as healthcare, finance, transportation, and more. As AI becomes more sophisticated and ubiquitous, it will create entirely new markets - many of which are unimaginable today.\n\nNvidia, with its cutting-edge AI technology and growing customer base, is in the catbird seat.\n\nKey takeaways\n\nNvidia's current valuation may seem high by historical standards. But it's important to consider the company's unique position in the rapidly evolving AI landscape.\n\nWith the general population largely unaware of AI's already incredible capabilities, the quickening pace of development, and an ongoing arms race, Nvidia should continue to post record-breaking revenue growth in the coming years.\n\nAfter all, Nvidia's potential is truly unprecedented as the gatekeeper to a $100 trillion AI-based economy. Viewed in this context, the growing bubble talk around the chip maker's shares seems unjustified.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Nvidia wasn't one of them.

Many investors might not recall that Nvidia's revenue actually declined 13% year over year in the first quarter of its fiscal 2024 (which ended April 30, 2023).\n\nFast-forward to fiscal 2025's first quarter, when revenue exploded higher by more than 260% year over year. In conjunction with that growth, the stock price has more than tripled in the past year, and investors continue to receive positive signs that the business will keep growing. The latest bullish news should have investors thinking Nvidia still has a long runway to increase sales in its data center segment.\n\nAfter such a huge jump in sales over the past year, some investors may be wondering if Nvidia's revenue growth may have peaked. But recent news from its fellow tech company Broadcom suggests that the addressable market for artificial intelligence (AI) equipment is broad and still growing.\n\nBroadcom supplies semiconductor solutions and infrastructure that AI requires. Its products include switching solutions, accelerators, server storage equipment, and on-site and cloud connectivity offerings.\n\nLike Nvidia, Broadcom recently reported strong results for its latest quarter. Revenue from its AI-related products set a record, and made up a quarter of total sales as the top line increased by more than 40% year over year. But it's something Broadcom CEO Hock Tan said during management's conference call with investors that should make Nvidia investors more bullish.\n\nTan admitted that Broadcom wasn't going to try to compete with Nvidia in its leading position as a supplier of graphics processing units (GPUs) to provide AI systems with computing power. He acknowledged, however, that Nvidia was increasingly becoming a competitor to Broadcom on the networking side. Nvidia's next-generation Blackwell platform is just the first step. Speaking of Nvidia, Tan noted, \"They are trying to create a platform that is probably end-to-end very integrated.\"\n\nThat should make Nvidia investors confident that the AI spending being directed to the company can continue to grow for the foreseeable future.\n\nIt's notable how much Nvidia has already dominated its competitors in reaping the investments that companies are making in data center computing power.\n\nNow consider that there is yet another segment of Nvidia's business with the potential to take a similar growth trajectory. Nvidia's automotive and robotics segment has more than doubled its revenues over the last two years. While its automotive segment still contributes only a minor portion of total sales, self-driving technology is advancing and numerous automakers are already Nvidia customers.\n\nSeveral Chinese electric vehicle (EV) makers, autonomous driving technology companies, and global automakers are using Nvidia's Drive platforms. In its latest earnings report, Nvidia also noted that \"an array of partners are using Nvidia generative AI technologies to transform in-vehicle experiences.\"\n\nMost recently, U.S.-based EV maker Rivian Automotive said it would be using Nvidia's Drive Orin processors to increase computing power and improve the performance of its R1 platform vehicles.\n\nWhile the potential remains immense for Nvidia to grow sales and earnings, investors shouldn't ignore the fact that some of that expected growth is already baked into the company's current valuation. Some investors believe the stock has already risen beyond a reasonable valuation and is due for a major correction.\n\nWhile earnings are up by more than 600% so far this year, the stock followed a similar trajectory. With a forward price-to-earnings ratio of about 50 and a price-to-sales ratio of nearly 30 based on this year's projected revenue, Nvidia will need to deliver significantly more growth before the stock looks like a bargain again.\n\nWhile there are realistic paths for that to occur, the stock's rise could pause as the market waits to see what actually happens. The stock could even dip. Aggressive investors still might want to have Nvidia in their portfolios based on both its past successes and the potential for more. However, after its meteoric rise, this stock is a good candidate to buy in stages rather than deploying all the funds you plan to commit to it all at once.\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Nvidia wasn't one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years.\n\nConsider when Nvidia made this list on April 15, 2005... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you'd have $830,777!*\n\nStock Advisor provides investors with an easy-to-follow blueprint for success, including guidance on building a portfolio, regular updates from analysts, and two new stock picks each month.

That pushed the semiconductor bellwether past Microsoft and Apple which had been jostling for the top spots in recent days.\n\nALSO READ: Reports: US regulators to open antitrust inquiries of Microsoft, OpenAI and Nvidia\n\nThe surge in Nvidia's market value has been driven by demand for its chips, which are the gold standard in the AI space. The company's shares are up more than 170 percent this year and have risen about 1,100 percent since their October 2022 low.\n\nPreviously, just 11 US companies since 1925 have reached the top spot in market value on a closing basis, according to Howard Silverblatt, senior index analyst at S&P Dow Jones Indices\n\nBlockbuster earnings and broadening investor enthusiasm over AI are supercharging Nvidia's rally. That fervor has been reflected in Nvidia's market value, which took only 96 days to go from $2 trillion to $3 trillion.\n\nMicrosoft, one of the two other companies to reach those rarefied levels, took 945 days to go from $2 trillion to $3 trillion while Apple took 1,044 days to make the leap, according to Bespoke Investment Group.\n\nALSO READ: Microsoft offers $20 consumer AI subscription to boost business\n\nPreviously, just 11 US companies since 1925 have reached the top spot in market value on a closing basis, according to Howard Silverblatt, senior index analyst at S&P Dow Jones Indices.\n\nFortunes have diverged for past holders of the top position in recent decades. Microsoft reached No. 1 in the late 1990s but then its shares struggled for years during the early 2000s following the dotcom bubble, only to come roaring back in the latter half of the last decade.\n\nExxon Mobi became the world's most valuable company in the 2000s but its shares retreated following a downturn in oil prices.\n\nTo some, Cisco is the cautionary tale. The company's shares peaked at over $80 in March 2000 in the midst of the dotcom boom, during which investors often assigned dizzying valuations to internet-related companies.\n\nBespoke's analysts recently contrasted the trajectories of Nvidia and Cisco, whose products were seen as essential in supporting the internet's infrastructure.\n\nNvidia's impressive financial performance and forecasts have led its stock valuation, by some measures, to moderate despite the surge in its share price\n\n\"NVDA's run has been incredible, but it will need to keep growing from here and stave off competition if its stock is going to keep putting up stellar returns,\" Bespoke said in a recent note.\n\nFor now, Nvidia's earnings are supporting its stock price. Revenue more than tripled to $26 billion in the latest quarter, while net income jumped seven-fold to $14.9 billion.\n\nALSO READ: Experts: AI will boost stock market\n\nRevenue for the current fiscal year is expected to roughly double to $120 billion, and then rise another 33 percent in fiscal 2026, to $160 billion, according to LSEG data.\n\nNvidia's impressive financial performance and forecasts have led its stock valuation, by some measures, to moderate despite the surge in its share price.\n\nFor example, Nvidia's forward price-to-earnings ratio last stood at 43, according to LSEG Datastream. That is higher than the 25 level it stood at to start the year but below levels it reached for much of last year. By contrast, the S&P 500 trades at 21 times earnings.\n\nREAD MORE: Localized model gives company edge in AI battle\n\nWhile Nvidia has been the standout performer, it is not the only stock to benefit from enthusiasm about the profit potential for AI.

The company's chips are at the heart of the AI revolution, providing the computational horsepower that makes it all possible. This, in turn, has sent the stock soaring, up 215% over the past year. These gains led to Nvidia's high-profile 10-for-1 stock split, which was completed just last week.\n\nAfter the stock's epic run to a $3 trillion market cap, Wall Street is reevaluating Nvidia's future prospects. There's a new price target from one analyst that should be of particular interest to shareholders.\n\nRosenblatt Securities analyst Hans Mosesmann reiterated his buy rating on Nvidia stock and increased his price to $200. That represents potential upside for investors of 53% compared to Monday's closing price, and would push Nvidia's market cap within striking distance of $5 trillion. One aspect of Nvidia's business that's being overlooked by investors is the software side. \"The real narrative lies in the software that complements all the hardware goodness,\" the analyst wrote.\n\nHe went on to suggest that demand for software will increase over the course of \"the next decade in terms of overall sales mix.\"\n\nI think the analyst hit the nail on the head. Nvidia's edge lies not only in the hardware but also in the associated software that helps provide peak performance. Cathie Wood of Ark Invest estimates that the total addressable market for AI software could be worth $13 trillion by 2030, helping illustrate the magnitude of the opportunity ahead.\n\nFurthermore, Nvidia will begin shipping its next-generation Blackwell processors later this year, which will cement the company's increasing lead in the AI chip space.\n\nNvidia's stock is currently selling for 51 times forward earnings. While that's a premium valuation, it's an attractive price for a stock that has generated gains of 27,450% over the past 10 years.\n\nThere's a long runway ahead, which is why Nvidia stock is a buy.\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Nvidia wasn't one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years.\n\nConsider when Nvidia made this list on April 15, 2005... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you'd have $802,591!*\n\nStock Advisor provides investors with an easy-to-follow blueprint for success, including guidance on building a portfolio, regular updates from analysts, and two new stock picks each month.

That pushed the semiconductor bellwether past Microsoft and Apple, which had been jostling for the top spots in recent days.\n\nThe surge in Nvidia's market value has been driven by demand for its chips, which are the gold standard in the AI space. The company's shares are up more than 170 percent this year and have risen about 1,100 percent since their October 2022 low.\n\nBlockbuster earnings and broadening investor enthusiasm over AI are supercharging Nvidia's rally. That fervor has been reflected in Nvidia's market value, which took only 96 days to go from $2 trillion to $3 trillion.\n\nMicrosoft, one of the two other companies to reach those rarefied levels, took 945 days to go from $2 trillion to $3 trillion while Apple took 1,044 days to make the leap, according to Bespoke Investment Group.\n\nPreviously, just 11 U.S. companies since 1925 have reached the top spot in market value on a closing basis, according to Howard Silverblatt, senior index analyst at S&P Dow Jones Indices.\n\nFortunes have diverged for past holders of the top position in recent decades. Microsoft reached No. 1 in the late 1990s but then its shares struggled for years during the early 2000s following the dotcom bubble, only to come roaring back in the latter half of the last decade.\n\nExxon Mobil became the world's most valuable company in the 2000s but its shares retreated following a downturn in oil prices.\n\nTo some, Cisco is the cautionary tale. The company's shares peaked at over $80 in March 2000 in the midst of the dotcom boom, during which investors often assigned dizzying valuations to internet-related companies.\n\nBespoke's analysts recently contrasted the trajectories of Nvidia and Cisco, whose products were seen as essential in supporting the internet's infrastructure.\n\n\"NVDA's run has been incredible, but it will need to keep growing from here and stave off competition if its stock is going to keep putting up stellar returns,\" Bespoke said in a recent note.\n\nFor now, Nvidia's earnings are supporting its stock price. Revenue more than tripled to $26 billion in the latest quarter, while net income jumped seven-fold to $14.9 billion.\n\nRevenue for the current fiscal year is expected to roughly double to $120 billion, and then rise another 33 percent in fiscal 2026, to $160 billion, according to LSEG data.\n\nNvidia's impressive financial performance and forecasts have led its stock valuation, by some measures, to moderate despite the surge in its share price. For example, Nvidia's forward price-to-earnings ratio last stood at 43, according to LSEG Datastream. That is higher than the 25 level it stood at to start the year but below levels it reached for much of last year. By contrast, the S&P 500 trades at 21 times earnings.\n\nWhile Nvidia has been the standout performer, it is not the only stock to benefit from enthusiasm about the profit potential for AI. Shares of other technology companies, including Super Micro Computer and Arm Holdings, have also risen sharply this year.", "source": {"uri": "inc.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Inc.com"}, "authors": [{"uri": "reuters@inc.com", "name": "Reuters", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nvidia", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nvidia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_value", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Market value"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jensen_Huang", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jensen Huang"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semiconductor", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Semiconductor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_standard", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gold standard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_economy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "World economy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_capitalization", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Market capitalization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cisco", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cisco"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Price_of_oil", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Price of oil"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S&P_Dow_Jones_Indices", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "S&P Dow Jones Indices"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dot-com_bubble", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dot-com bubble"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ExxonMobil", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "ExxonMobil"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arm_(company)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Arm (company)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S&P_500_Index", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "S&P 500 Index"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock_valuation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Stock valuation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valuation_(finance)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Valuation (finance)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Net_income", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Net income"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiscal_year", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fiscal year"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revenue", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Revenue"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks_and_Bonds", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks and Bonds", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Research_and_Analysis", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Research and Analysis", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Day_Trading", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Day Trading", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Major_Companies/Company_Rankings", "label": "dmoz/Business/Major Companies/Company Rankings", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://img-cdn.inc.com/image/upload/w_1024,h_576,c_fill/images/panoramic/getty_1468619889_qzjcuj.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9658445", "eventUri": "eng-9658445", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2000-03-", "textStart": 1922, "textEnd": 1932}], "sentiment": 0.4352941176470588, "wgt": 161, "relevance": 1}

With Nvidia doing a 10:1 stock split, retail investors are the real winners here,\" said Sam North, market analyst at investment platform eToro.\n\nThe company's market value expanded from $1 trillion to $2 trillion in just nine months in February, while taking just over three months to hit $3 trillion in June.", "source": {"uri": "staradvertiser.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Honolulu Star Advertiser"}, "authors": [{"uri": "reuters@staradvertiser.com", "name": "Reuters", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nvidia", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nvidia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motherboard", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Motherboard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smartphone", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Smartphone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta_Platforms", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Meta Platforms"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alphabet_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Alphabet Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPhone", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "IPhone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_capitalization", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Market capitalization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock_split", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Stock split"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computing", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Computing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Investor", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Investor"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks_and_Bonds", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks and Bonds", "wgt": 27}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Research_and_Analysis", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Research and Analysis", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Information_Technology/Marketing_and_Advertising", "label": "dmoz/Business/Information Technology/Marketing and Advertising", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Education_and_Training", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Education and Training", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 64}], "image": "https://www.staradvertiser.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/web1_2024-06-18T171606Z_736550033_RC2KOZ9XT5GP_RTRMADP_3_USA-STOCKS-NVIDIA-MICROSOFT.JPG", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9658445", "eventUri": "eng-9658445", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-07", "textStart": 1297, "textEnd": 1303}], "sentiment": 0.388235294117647, "wgt": 161, "relevance": 1}

(NASDAQ:NVDA), which had a modest start as a maker of gaming chips in April 1993, has grown by leaps and bounds and has attained the status as the world's most-valued corporation, relegating biggies such as Apple and Microsoft behind.\n\nWhat Happened: Nvidia ended Tuesday's session at $135.58, up 3.51%, according to Benzinga Pro data. This gave the Jensen Huang-led company a market cap of $3.33 trillion compared to Microsoft's $3.317 trillion and Apple's $3.286 trillion. Nvidia's shares have been on a tear since the advent of the AI revolution in early 2023 following the introduction of OpenAI's ChatGPT chatbot.\n\nAhead of this, Nvidia has a so-so year as most growth-focused stocks swooned amid fears of a higher interest-rate environment thwarting demand for their products and services and the inflationary environment pushing up their costs.\n\nThe Nvidia stock fell a little over 50% in 2022 only to bounce back stronger in 2023 as the rising AI tide lifted all boats levered to the technology. It soared 240% in 2023, with the stock surge coming back on profound improvement in fundamentals. The momentum carried forward into 2024, with the year-to-date gains currently at about 174%.\n\nFor the first quarter, Nvidia reported 262% year-over-year revenue growth and 461% earnings per share growth. The company's clout reflects its frontrunner status in the market for high-performance AI accelerators and its full suite of solutions, including hardware, software stack, and services.\n\nNvidia's clout in the stock market is exemplified by a comment by Lumida Wealth's Ram Ahluwalia. The wealth manager blamed Nvidia's strength for the weakness in not only other tech stocks but also stocks of fundamentally sound companies belonging to other sectors.\n\nThe latest feat sent social media into a frenzy. An amateur trader and YouTube said in an X post, \"This is Jensen Huang's world, we just get to live in it.\"\n\nDid Nvidia Make You A Millionaire? Here's a look at a hypothetical situation of an investor making a million with their Nvidia bet made at the start of 2023.\n\nTo achieve a seven-figure investment, you would need approximately 7,375.72 shares. Acquiring these shares during the last trading session of 2022 would have cost you $107,759.26, based on the split-adjusted price of $14.61 per share at that time.\n\nIn other words, Nvidia has generated roughly 830% return since end-2022.\n\nWay Forward: Just as the Fed rate is poised to remain higher for longer, analysts see Nvidia shares staying higher for longer. Deepwater Asset Management's Gene Munster sees the AI revolution lasting at least three to five years, and at least until then, Nvidia can outshine others.\n\nThe company's proactiveness with regard to the launch of new high-performance chips makes it difficult for competitors to catch up, likely supporting further upside in the stock.\n\nRead Next: Nvidia Is 'At The Center' Of Something 'Really Big,' Says Expert As Jensen Huang-Led Chip Giant Beats Microsoft, Apple To Become World's Most Valuable Company\n\nImage from Shutterstock", "source": {"uri": "uk.investing.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Investing.com UK"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nvidia", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nvidia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Stock"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ChatGPT", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "ChatGPT"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenAI", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "OpenAI"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chatbot", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chatbot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corporation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Corporation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_capitalization", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Market capitalization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AI_accelerator", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "AI accelerator"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solution_stack", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Solution stack"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock_market", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Stock market"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earnings_per_share", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Earnings per share"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jensen_Huang", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jensen Huang"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shutterstock", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Shutterstock"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YouTube", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "YouTube"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks_and_Bonds", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks and Bonds", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Research_and_Analysis", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Research and Analysis", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Brokerages", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Brokerages", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Education_and_Training", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Education and Training", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 56}], "image": "https://i-invdn-com.investing.com/news/moved_LYNXNPEK1L01K_L.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9658445", "eventUri": "eng-9658445", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "1993-04-", "textStart": 83, "textEnd": 93}], "sentiment": 0.1764705882352942, "wgt": 160, "relevance": 1}

specifically those needed to train and run the powerful AI models that run generative AI software such as OpenAI's ChatGPT.\n\nGenerative AI has become the key battleground in the tech space over the last 18 months, with some experts saying it could be as pivotal an innovation as the internet itself in the years to come.\n\nThe excitement around the technology has sparked a battle between some of the world's biggest companies - Apple, Amazon, Google, Meta, Microsoft and others - to build new AI products.\n\nWith Nvidia as the key maker of AI chips, this has substantially boosted the firm's sales and profits, with its stock price further helped by some investors believing it could go higher, with demand for AI expected to increase further.\n\n- How fast has Nvidia's value grown?\n\nWhile its share price has been steadily rising for several years now, it has only been this year that it truly took off.\n\nIts value has more than doubled in 2024 to now sit at nearly 136 US dollars a share.\n\nIn contrast, at the beginning of 2023, it was priced at less than 15 US dollars a share, and five years ago it was less than four US dollars.\n\n- Is it likely to keep growing?\n\nMany investors believe the demand for AI is only going to increase, meaning Nvidia's value could rise still further, with some believing the company is now in a direct race with Microsoft and Apple to be the first to reach a four trillion US dollar valuation over the next year.\n\nBut others have questioned whether further big gains in the future are likely, given the increasing competition it is and will likely face in the months and years to come as tech giants begin to build and use their own AI chips, existing rivals catch up and new firms emerge as key players in the AI chip market.", "source": {"uri": "shropshirestar.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Shropshire Star"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nvidia", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nvidia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphics_card", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Graphics card"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_circuit", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Integrated circuit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_dollar", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States dollar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Generative artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_game", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Video game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ChatGPT", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "ChatGPT"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta_Platforms", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Meta Platforms"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenAI", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "OpenAI"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_(company)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Amazon (company)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Software"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Internet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Google"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Information_Technology/Marketing_and_Advertising", "label": "dmoz/Business/Information Technology/Marketing and Advertising", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence/Publications", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence/Publications", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence/Games", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence/Games", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence/Philosophy", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence/Philosophy", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 74}], "image": "https://www.shropshirestar.com/resizer/78SlhFRaMiGGjtvWaX5m4cusTQo=/1200x900/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/mna/O4ETPHZN4NDK3BTN347C7DYXGM.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9658445", "eventUri": "eng-9658445", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.4039215686274509, "wgt": 160, "relevance": 1}

for chips that support generative AI models like OpenAI's ChatGPT.\n\nThis demand has driven a significant portion of the nearly 16 per cent year-to-date increase in the S&P 500 index, which has risen to multiple record highs this year.\n\nNew York's Nasdaq exchange, where Nvidia is listed, has also surged 21 per cent year to date to a record high.\n\nIn May 2023, Nvidia hit a $1 trillion valuation, in February 2024 it reached a $2 trillion valuation and in June its valuation surpassed $3.3t.\n\n\"This can be an exceptionally volatile stock, and much more volatile than the overall market,\" said Kathleen Brooks, research director at XTB. \"However, the volatility in the past 12 months has mostly been to the upside.\n\n\"While momentum is great until it is not, it is also worth noting the financial fundamentals at Nvidia could also drive its stock price higher.\n\n\"The company has a valuation of $3.3 trillion and a debt load of $11bn, which means there is ample room for chunky shareholder returns in the future, which may also attract more people to the stock,\" Brooks explained.\n\nFounded in 1993 by Jensen Huang and two others, Nvidia originally built graphics cards for video gamers.\n\nToday, it dominates the global market for AI chips, counting major tech giants such as Microsoft, Meta and Amazon among its customers.\n\nThe company's data centre chips and

The company's shares are up more than 170% this year and have risen about 1,100% since their October 2022 low. By Lewis Krauskopf\n\nNEW YORK: Nvidia has become the world's most valuable company following a staggering rally in its shares, underlining the outsized role investors expect artificial intelligence to play in the global economy over coming years.\n\nNvidia shares rose 3.5% on Tuesday, giving it a market value of about $3.34 trillion. That pushed the semiconductor bellwether past Microsoft and Apple, which had been jostling for the top spots in recent days.\n\nThe surge in Nvidia's market value has been driven by demand for its chips, which are the gold standard in the AI space. The company's shares are up more than 170% this year and have risen about 1,100% since their October 2022 low.\n\nBlockbuster earnings and broadening investor enthusiasm over AI are supercharging Nvidia's rally. That fervor has been reflected in Nvidia's market value, which took only 96 days to go from $2 trillion to $3 trillion.\n\nMicrosoft, one of the two other companies to reach those rarefied levels, took 945 days to go from $2 trillion to $3 trillion while Apple took 1,044 days to make the leap, according to Bespoke Investment Group.\n\nPreviously, just 11 U.S. companies since 1925 have reached the top spot in market value on a closing basis, according to Howard Silverblatt, senior index analyst at S&P Dow Jones Indices.\n\nFortunes have diverged for past holders of the top position in recent decades. Microsoft reached No. 1 in the late 1990s but then its shares struggled for years during the early 2000s following the dotcom bubble, only to come roaring back in the latter half of the last decade.\n\nExxon Mobil became the world's most valuable company in the 2000s but its shares retreated following a downturn in oil prices.\n\nTo some, Cisco is the cautionary tale. The company's shares peaked at over $80 in March 2000 in the midst of the dotcom boom, during which investors often assigned dizzying valuations to internet-related companies.\n\nBespoke's analysts recently contrasted the trajectories of Nvidia and Cisco, whose products were seen as essential in supporting the internet's infrastructure.\n\n\"NVDA's run has been incredible, but it will need to keep growing from here and stave off competition if its stock is going to keep putting up stellar returns,\" Bespoke said in a recent note.\n\nFor now, Nvidia's earnings are supporting its stock price. Revenue more than tripled to $26 billion in the latest quarter, while net income jumped seven-fold to $14.9 billion.\n\nRevenue for the current fiscal year is expected to roughly double to $120 billion, and then rise another 33% in fiscal 2026, to $160 billion, according to LSEG data.\n\nNvidia's impressive financial performance and forecasts have led its stock valuation, by some measures, to moderate despite the surge in its share price. For example, Nvidia's forward price-to-earnings ratio last stood at 43, according to LSEG Datastream. That is higher than the 25 level it stood at to start the year but below levels it reached for much of last year. By contrast, the S&P 500 trades at 21 times earnings.\n\nWhile Nvidia has been the standout performer, it is not the only stock to benefit from enthusiasm about the profit potential for AI.

While almost everyone expects one of the three largest U.S. companies -- Microsoft MSFT, Apple AAPL and Nvidia NVDA as of June 14 -- to be the first to hit that milestone, it isn't necessarily a given.\n\nTrue, if the shares of these three Big Tech companies were to appreciate at no faster than the U.S. market's average historical rate, they would each hit the $4 trillion market in just over three years. Yet many Wall Street analysts expect each of these three companies to grow much faster than that, and pass the $4 trillion mark much sooner.\n\nMost Read from MarketWatch\n\nBut they are extrapolating the recent past into the future. If Nvidia's stock in the coming months were to continue appreciating at the same rate as it has over the past year, for example, its market cap would hit the $4 trillion mark by year-end. One Wall Street analyst is even projecting that Nvidia will do just that and reach the $5 trillion mark next year.\n\nThese analysts are getting ahead of themselves. Not only is it unrealistic to extrapolate the recent past into the future, it's unrealistic to expect that these market-cap leaders will grow at the market's average rate. After stocks make it to the top of the market cap rankings, they proceed to grow at a below-market rate, on average.\n\nThis is illustrated in the accompanying chart, which plots the performance of a hypothetical strategy that each year invested in the U.S. stock with the largest market cap at the end of the prior year. Notice that the strategy significantly lags the S&P 500 SPX.\n\nFans of Nvidia in particular are incredulous when I present this data to them. Don't I know that the AI revolution is just beginning? It's obvious (to them) that not only will the AI wave continue for many years to come, but also that Nvidia will be at the head of that wave, producing double-digit, if not triple-digit, annualized returns.\n\nWhat these true believers fail to realize is that if something is obvious, it's already reflected in the market. For Nvidia to grow at the rates they are anticipating, the company would have to perform far better than they are already expecting. And that's expecting a lot, as I recently discussed: Nvidia's current price assumes that its earnings per share will grow at a 70% annualized rate over the next five years. Hardly any large-cap stock earnings in U.S. history have grown that fast for that long.\n\nEven if AI stocks continue taking Wall Street by storm, it's unlikely that Nvidia's stock in coming years will be the AI leader. That's the implication of a 2019 study conducted by investment company Research Affiliates, entitled \"Standing Alone Against the Crowd.\" The study's authors focused on stocks that, at any point over the prior 40 years, had the largest market caps \"in each sector of the nine largest stock markets in the world\" -- stocks they referred to as \"top dogs.\"\n\nThey found that \"nearly 80% [of the top dogs] underperformed their own sector over the next decade, falling short of the average return for that sector in each country by an average of 9.7% a year.\"\n\nThis is why we shouldn't be surprised if a dark horse stock is the first to $4 trillion. It's impossible to know which stock it will be, since if we knew, the stock would already be trading close to that level. But there are many stocks that are lower down the market cap ranking that are in the running. All it would take would be for fortune to smile on one of them the same way it has for Nvidia.\n\nTo appreciate this point, imagine yourself three years ago trying to predict which company would first hit the $3 trillion mark. At the time (June 30, 2021), Apple was at the top of the market-cap rankings, at $2.28 trillion. Microsoft was in second place at $2.04 trillion, while Amazon.com AMZN was third at $1.73 trillion. Nvidia's market cap then was $498 billion. Few would have guessed that three years later, Nvidia's market cap would surpass Apple's, as happened earlier this month.\n\nTo identify which dark horse stocks might end up with bragging rights as the first $4 trillion company, I took Nvidia's return over the past three years and calculated what each stock in the S&P 500 SPX would be worth in three years if it grew at that same rate until then. On this assumption, eight stocks besides today's big three would be worth more than $4 trillion in June 2027:\n\nIt would be no more surprising for any one of these stocks to rise to the top of the market cap rankings than it was for Nvidia to have done so.\n\nMark Hulbert is a regular contributor to MarketWatch.

This follows just days after it beat tech giant Apple as the second most valuable company.\n\nThe trio's shares are tight: Apple's stock decreased by 1% to $3.286, and Microsoft, which is now the second most valuable company in the world, saw a dip of 0.45%, with a valuation of $3.317 trillion.\n\nWhat's put Nvidia, the American chip maker, at the top? Artificial intelligence, and its accompanying frenzy, have turned the chip maker into an indispensable centre of technological futures.\n\nWhile it has its competitors, Nvidia is the main chip maker in the AI space, with its products powering OpenAI's wildly successful LLMs, including ChatGPT.\n\nAs tech giants compete to offer the best in AI as we know it - Apple most notably just entered the race, rather late - Nvidia continues to benefit as companies vie for the AI-capable processors.\n\nThis fierce competition, and Nvidia's market dominance, has seen its stock surge about 180% just this year. Microsoft, on the other hand, saw its shares grow about 19% in the same time span.\n\nOn Tuesday, the chip maker's shares reached a record high of $103bn, and demand for the stock only increased as Nvidia decided to split its stock 10-for-one.\n\nThis reduced the price per share, making the highly-valuable stock more affordable to individual investors.\n\nNvidia is also now the most traded company on Wall Street, seeing an average daily turnover of $50bn. Apple and Microsoft see about $10bn each, for reference, according to LSEG.\n\nThe move to split shares likely contributed to the chip maker now accounting for 16% of all trading in S&P 500 companies.\n\nDemand for its products have also seen prices surge: the price per unit for an AI-capable chip from Nvidia is about $30,000 (\u00a32,3567). The chip maker has reportedly struggled to meet this demand, which could cause companies to turn to alternative chip makers.\n\nHowever, this appears to not have dampened Nvidia's market appeal.", "source": {"uri": "digit.fyi", "dataType": "news", "title": "Digit"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nvidia", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nvidia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valuation_(finance)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Valuation (finance)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_circuit", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Integrated circuit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock_market", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stock market"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_capitalization", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Market capitalization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ChatGPT", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "ChatGPT"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenAI", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "OpenAI"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Futures_contract", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Futures contract"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S&P_500_Index", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "S&P 500 Index"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wall_Street", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wall Street"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revenue", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Revenue"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks_and_Bonds", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks and Bonds", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Food_and_Related_Products/Snack_Foods", "label": "dmoz/Business/Food and Related Products/Snack Foods", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Day_Trading", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Day Trading", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Education_and_Training", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Education and Training", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 87}], "image": "http://www.digit.fyi/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Untitled-design-2024-06-19T093227.706.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9658445", "eventUri": "eng-9658445", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.4431372549019608, "wgt": 159, "relevance": 1}

The Taipei-listed stock closed more than 2% higher at market close on Wednesday. The Taiwanese giant has partnered with Nvidia to build a specialized set of AI data centers using the U.S. behemoth's chips to develop a variety of AI applications including robotics platforms, electric vehicles and large language models (LLMs).\n\nNvidia on Tuesday claimed the title of the world's most valuable public company, overtaking tech giant Microsoft just weeks after it snatched second place from iPhone maker Apple. The achievement caps Nvidia's rise from a respected maker of video game hardware to the purveyor of one of tech's hottest commodities: specialized AI chips. The pivot has seen Nvidia dramatically transform its fortunes in a matter of years, growing from a market capitalization of around $16 billion in 2016 to just under $800 billion towards the end of 2021 before dropping to around $300 billion in 2022 amid poor demand for gaming chips and a wider rout on U.S. stock markets. The boom in generative artificial intelligence, kickstarted by the release of OpenAI's ChatGPT in late 2022, has helped propel Nvidia to new heights as demand for its specialized AI chips soared. Since then, the company's value has multiplied from around $400 billion in late 2022 to $1 trillion by mid 2023, $2 trillion by early 2024 and $3 trillion by the middle of 2024 on a near vertical climb. Nvidia shares are up more than 170% this year alone and its stratospheric growth shows little sign of stopping as tech firms duel it out to dominate the nascent market for AI.\n\nThe AI boom has not only catapulted Nvidia into a rare position of wealth and power. CEO Jensen Huang, who cofounded the chipmaker in 1993, has also seen his wealth grow astronomically in recent years. After the recent bump in Nvidia stock, Forbes estimates Huang is worth $118.7 billion, up $4 billion on Tuesday alone. He is now the 11th richest person in the world, ahead of Indian billionaire Mukesh Ambani and approximately $12 billion away from entering Forbes' ranking of the world's top ten richest people. He trails Microsoft billionaires Steve Balmer, who owns the Los Angeles Clippers, and Bill Gates, respectively worth $130.6 billion and $133.5 billion.", "source": {"uri": "forbes.com", "dataType":

What is behind Nvidia's rise?\n\nNvidia has become the world's most valuable company after the chipmaker's share price rose to an all-time high on Tuesday 18 June.\n\nThe Californian company, which started life in 1993 as a specialist provider of 3D graphics for computer games, overtook Microsoft on the back of its share price nearly doubling since the start of this year. In February, Nvidia became the fourth biggest company in the world.\n\nA boom in artificial intelligence (AI), and billions of pounds worth of sales to the biggest tech companies, has seen Nvidia take the top spot ahead of Microsoft, Apple, Alphabet, which owns Google, and the state-owned oil giant Saudi Aramco.\n\nChristopher Rossbach, investment head at J Stern & Co, says: \"We believe that AI and the metaverse will have a transformative impact on the global economy and on the companies driving innovation and growth.\n\n\"Nvidia has been our strongest position year-to-date and we continue to believe that it has extraordinary prospects for growth and value creation.\"\n\nNvidia has easily been the best performing of the Magnificent Seven tech stocks in recent years. Over the past five years, it has grown by more than 3,000%.\n\nInvestors looking to profit from the rising tide of AI have been snapping up the stock, making it one of the most popular investments on DIY platforms. This, combined with a string of impressive results, has propelled its rise.\n\nThe company reported its most recent earnings on 22 May - and they were impressive. First-quarter revenue was $26 billion, up 18% from the previous quarter and up 262% compared to a year ago.\n\nIn addition to its chips, growth in the company's data centre business has been driving its strong performance. Data centres made up 87% of overall revenues in the first quarter.\n\nThe company's ascent is \"remarkable\", says Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell, \"particularly as it is now considered to be more valuable than one of the most lauded electronic device makers in the world\".\n\nHe adds: \"There is a feeling that as long as Nvidia's share price is rising, investors are happy and everything is fine on the markets.\"\n\nAs far as the S&P 500 is concerned, this has quite literally become the case in recent years. Nvidia has accounted for around a third of the S&P 500's overall return so far this year. This makes concentration risk a concern for many investors - something we have explored elsewhere when looking at whether it's time to ditch tracker funds.\n\nNvidia's share price continues to reach record highs - and investors on the sidelines will be disappointed they didn't snap it up earlier. But there are risks associated with investing at the top of the market. This begs the question, will Nvidia continue to soar?\n\n\"Such stratospheric share price rises can come with a drawback,\" says Richard Hunter, head of markets at interactive investor. \"The bar has now been raised, meaning that the shares could be vulnerable to disappointment, with increasing pressure on the company to surprise to the upside.\"\n\nGenerative AI requires enormous computing power to work, and Nvidia's chips facilitate this. They can carry out technical processes faster and with greater energy efficiency than many competing chips. The company describes itself as having \"pioneered accelerated computing to tackle challenges no one else can solve\".\n\nSome valuation-focused investors might worry that Nvidia - and Big Tech in general - has entered a bit of a bubble. But investors believe AI will revolutionise the world around us. It's these future opportunities that they are pricing in.\n\nOf course, there are risks associated and a regulatory clampdown could create headwinds. There are also concerns that AI is too energy-hungry, and that electricity grids might not be able to cope.

Since then, Nvidia's relentless stock surge has propelled the chipmaker to the top of the tech world, briefly claiming the title of the world's most valuable company. This ascent reflects the booming interest in artificial intelligence (AI), where Nvidia's graphics processing units (GPUs) are seen as a key driver.\n\nRead: Ajax Smart Security System Review: Aware and armed alarm\n\nOn Tuesday, Nvidia's stock closed at $135.58, pushing its market capitalization to a staggering $3.3 trillion and surpassing both Microsoft and Apple. This capped a month-long jockeying match for the top spot, with Nvidia edging past its mega-cap peers.\n\nThe dominance of AI in investor focus is undeniable. Nvidia is considered the prime beneficiary of this trend, as its powerful GPUs are in high demand for powering the complex computations required by AI applications.\n\nAnalysts predict a heated race between these tech giants for the coveted $4 trillion market cap milestone.\n\nNvidia's ascent has been nothing short of phenomenal. Here's what fuelled their meteoric climb:\n\nNvidia's journey is a remarkable tale of foresight and adaptation. Founded in 1999, the company quickly rose to prominence, replacing Enron in the S&P 500 within three years. Since its IPO, Nvidia's stock has delivered a total return of a mind-boggling 591,078%, a testament to its successful navigation of technological shifts and its prominent role in the AI boom.\n\nWhile Nvidia currently reigns supreme, its future at the top is not guaranteed. The company has weathered several 50% stock price drops in the past, and sustaining the current rally will hinge on continued heavy investment in AI hardware by customers.\n\nUltimately, Nvidia's success can be attributed to its strategic focus on graphics processing and CEO Jensen Huang's vision of a future dominated by \"accelerated computing,\" a domain perfectly suited for Nvidia's technology. As Brian Mulberry of Zacks Investment Management puts it, \"the management team deserves enormous credit for riding each wave of hardware innovation perfectly well.\"", "source": {"uri": "bandwidthblog.co.za", "dataType": "news", "title": "Bandwidth Blog"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nvidia", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nvidia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphics_processing_unit", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Graphics processing unit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_capitalization", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Market capitalization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S&P_500_Index", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "S&P 500 Index"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jensen_Huang", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jensen Huang"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enron", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Enron"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computing", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Computing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Navigation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Navigation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Initial_public_offering", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Initial public offering"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Investment_management", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Investment management"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks_and_Bonds", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks and Bonds", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Research_and_Analysis", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Research and Analysis", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Future", "label": "dmoz/Society/Future", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence/Games", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence/Games", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 89}], "image": "https://bandwidthblog.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/nvidia-market-cap-microsoft-worlds-most-valuable-company.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9658445", "eventUri": "eng-9658445", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3960784313725489, "wgt": 157, "relevance": 1}

Rising a further 3.5% to a record US$135.58 per share, Nvidia is now the most valuable company in the world.\n\nWhile Nvidia has pipped its peers, the lead is narrow. Apple, Microsoft, and Nvidia all hover around the US$3.3 trillion mark. A measly 1.6% gain in Apple shares would put it back in the pole position from the third spot.\n\nArtificial Intelligence (AI) is the term on everyone's lips this year. Tens of billions of dollars have been spent upgrading data centres worldwide with AI-enabling hardware to meet AI-powered productivity, product optimisation, and performance.\n\nNo one has benefitted more from this spending than Nvidia. Recent data suggests the company, led by Jensen Huang, holds a market share of between 70% and 95% in AI chips. A feat that has delivered incredible growth in Nvidia's revenue, profits, and shares in recent years.\n\nFor the 12 months ending April 2024, Nvidia recorded revenue of US$79.8 billion and net profits after tax (NPAT) of US$42.6 billion, respectively, an increase of 208% and 789%. Yet, the appetite for AI hardware appears to be as strong as ever.\n\nIn the company's first-quarter 2024 earnings call last month, Nvidia chief financial officer Colette Kress said:\n\nDemand for H200 [an accelerated computing graphics processing unit] and Blackwell is well ahead of supply, and we expect demand may exceed supply well into next year.\n\nSuch a strong outlook has pushed earnings estimates among analysts for FY25 to around US$63 billion. For context, Apple earned US$100 billion in net profits during its last four quarters, while computer giant Microsoft generated US$86 billion.\n\nHowever, some investors see Nvidia as the backbone of AI for years to come.\n\nDespite being the most expensive company in the US$3 trillion league based on the price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio, several analysts still see blue skies ahead for the green graphics card company.\n\nRosenblatt, a New York-based broker, remains bullish on Nvidia shares after its newfound number-one status. Last night, the broker upgraded the shares' price target to US$200. The improved target rides on Nvidia obtaining greater market share in high-margin areas with its Blackwell, Rubin, and Hopper lineup.\n\nThe beefed-up Nvidia price target suggests an additional 47.5% upside.\n\nHowever, Oliver Pursche of Wealthspire Advisors warns of what a slipup would entail:", "source": {"uri": "fool.com.au", "dataType": "news", "title": "Motley Fool Australia"}, "authors": [{"uri": "mitchell_lawler@fool.com.au", "name": "Mitchell Lawler", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nvidia", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nvidia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_dollar", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States dollar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nasdaq", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nasdaq"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_center", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Data center"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jensen_Huang", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jensen Huang"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Productivity", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Productivity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_optimization", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mathematical optimization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_share", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Market share"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_financial_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chief financial officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hopper_(microarchitecture)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hopper (microarchitecture)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphics_card", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Graphics card"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_Rosenblatt", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Frank Rosenblatt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computing", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Computing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_trend", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Market trend"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphics_processing_unit", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Graphics processing unit"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Major_Companies", "label": "dmoz/Business/Major Companies", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence/Games", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence/Games", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Major_Companies/Publicly_Traded", "label": "dmoz/Business/Major Companies/Publicly Traded", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work/Job_Sharing", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work/Job Sharing", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Hardware/Retailers", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Hardware/Retailers", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 90}], "image": "https://www.fool.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/On-top-of-the-world-16_9-1200x675.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9658445", "eventUri": "eng-9658445", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3333333333333333, "wgt": 156, "relevance": 1}

But is it too late for new investors to jump on the bandwagon?\n\nStock splits can be exciting for retail investors, particularly those whose brokerages might not offer them the option of purchasing fractional shares. I have lost count of the number of non-finance people suddenly asking me about Nvidia (NVDA 1.75%) stock now that it's trading for \"just\" $130 a share.\n\nBut while splits can make a stock appear cheaper, they have no impact on a company's valuations -- how the market prices it relative to sales, earnings, etc. -- nor on its market cap, which is the value of all its outstanding shares combined. In the case of Nvidia, that market cap is $3.2 trillion, making it the third-largest company in the world today, just a hair behind the one that makes iPhones.\n\nIs Nvidia stock still a buy at its current lofty market cap? Here are two reasons to continue hitting the buy button and one reason to consider jumping ship.\n\nIt has only been around two years since OpenAI took the world by storm with ChatGPT, a generative artificial intelligence (AI) chatbot capable of producing high-quality responses to user queries based on training data. Analysts are feverishly optimistic about the AI industry's potential, with Bloomberg Intelligence estimating it could be worth $1.3 trillion by 2032.\n\nIf that forecast proves close to accurate, this will be an incredible opportunity for Nvidia, which is the leading maker of the specific types of powerful graphics processing units (GPUs) needed to run and train these advanced algorithms. Currently, it holds a market share of more than 80% in that hot niche, where demand is outstripping supply.\n\nWhile Nvidia will face growing competition from rival chipmakers such as Advanced Micro Devices (AMD -0.17%) and Intel, it's protecting its market share via software solutions like CUDA (Compute Unified Device Architecture), a computing platform and programming interface that's bespoke for use with its hardware, and by constantly improving its offerings. According to CEO Jensen Huang, the company will henceforth release a new family of updated AI chips every single year (up from its prior pace of once every two years), making it even harder for rivals to keep up.\n\nThe second bullish fact about Nvidia is its valuation. Despite rising by over 3,000% in the last five years, shares are still reasonably priced relative to the company's remarkable growth rate.\n\nWith a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple of just 48, Nvidia's shares are not much more expensive than other popular AI hardware stocks like AMD, which has a P/E of 47. To put this in context, in the first quarter, AMD's sales grew by just 2% year over year, while Nvidia's exploded by 262%.\n\nThis valuation suggests Nvidia's stock could have more room to run if the AI industry lives up to analysts' expectations. But hold your horses -- there is one big risk factor new investors should be aware of.\n\nCisco Systems (CSCO 0.35%) is a computer hardware company that sold the routers and switches needed to build out the internet in the late 1990s. It was the \"picks and shovels\" way for investors to bet on what the smart money saw as a transformative new industry. And by the peak of the dot-com bubble in 2000, Cisco's market cap had hit $500 billion. Then the bubble burst, and it dropped by a staggering 88% within two years. The stock still hasn't recovered to its previous highs.\n\nInvestors should take this as a cautionary tale, because Nvidia occupies a similar role in the AI space today, and any hit to its growth rate or pricing power could lead to a rapid collapse in its valuation, just like what happened to Cisco. While Nvidia investors have a lot to be excited about, they should also be aware of the potential risks this company faces before buying the stock, especially at its current valuation.", "source": {"uri": "fool.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Motley Fool"}, "authors": [{"uri": "will_ebiefung@fool.com", "name": "Will Ebiefung", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nvidia", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nvidia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_capitalization", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Market capitalization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AMD", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "AMD"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CUDA", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "CUDA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broker", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Broker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valuation_(finance)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Valuation (finance)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphics_processing_unit", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Graphics processing unit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPhone", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "IPhone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_share", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Market share"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Investor", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Investor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Price", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Price"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Generative artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ChatGPT", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "ChatGPT"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenAI", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "OpenAI"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chatbot", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chatbot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jensen_Huang", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jensen Huang"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Niche_market", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Niche market"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computing_platform", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Computing platform"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intel", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Intel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloomberg_L.P.", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bloomberg L.P."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Algorithm"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Software"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cisco", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cisco"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks_and_Bonds", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks and Bonds", "wgt": 27}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Research_and_Analysis", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Research and Analysis", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Education_and_Training", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Education and Training", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Games", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Games", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 89}], "image": "https://g.foolcdn.com/editorial/images/780575/gettyimages-1433587895.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9658445", "eventUri": "eng-9658445", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1764705882352942, "wgt": 156, "relevance": 1}

By Benzinga", "body": "The valuation of semiconductor company NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) has surged from $1 trillion in May 2023 to more than $3 trillion in June 2024.\n\nAs Nvidia cements its place in history as the most valuable company in the world as of June 18, here's a look at how the company stacks up against Apple for retail investors.\n\nWhat Happened: Nvidia posted strong first-quarter financial results and guidance. A recent stock split has further fueled excitement around the company, making whole shares more accessible to a larger number of investors.\n\nNvidia had been nearing the market capitalizations of Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) in recent months, and finally took over the title as the most valuable company in the world on Tuesday.\n\nWhile the title may be fleeting or signify the start of a new era, the company's stock performance over the past year and five years has been remarkable.\n\nBenzinga recently asked followers on social media platform X if they would rather invest in Apple or Nvidia. The poll did not include a time horizon and was done to gauge overall interest in two of the largest companies in the world.\n\n\"NVDA. They are innovating at much faster pace than Apple. Moreover, the AI hype so it's a millionaire maker,\" user @hataf_news replied to the poll.\n\nWhile the stock performance of Apple has lagged Nvidia over the past year and five-year periods, many investors still favored the iPhone maker.\n\n\"Long term, if you have to go with Apple as competition came they have delivered,\" user @UltimateTrad8r replied to the poll.\n\nIt was recently announced that the Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund (NYSE:XLK) will rebalance and make Nvidia the largest weighting at around 20% with Apple shares representing 4.5% of the fund.\n\nRelated Link: Nvidia Stock Split: What Investors Need To Know, What Past History Shows, What's Next For Chip Giant\n\nWhy It's Important: The poll comes as artificial intelligence continues to be a key topic on the minds of analysts and investors, with Nvidia one of the top names in the sector.\n\nAnalysts are bullish on the future of Nvidia after the first-quarter financial results and guidance.\n\nOn Tuesday, Wells Fargo raised their price target on Nvidia from $125 to $155. Rosenblatt took their price target from $140 to $200.\n\nApple's recent Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC) event saw mixed reactions from analysts, with some believing the company failed to adequately highlight its AI developments and future plans.\n\nThe upcoming iPhone launches and integration of AI technology could be keys for Apple's future.\n\nNvidia shares have surged 209% over the past year and are up 174% year-to-date in 2024. Over the last five years, Nvidia's stock has skyrocketed an astonishing 5,797%.\n\nApple shares are up 15% over the last year and up 11% year-to-date in 2024, trailing the performance of many technology stocks and broad market indexes.

Like Nvidia, Cisco also surpassed Microsoft to become the most valuable company.\n\nJohn Chambers, who was chief executive of Cisco during the dot-com boom, said there are some parallels, but the dynamics of the AI revolution are different from previous ones such as the internet and cloud computing. Chambers, now a venture investor, has made big bets on AI in cybersecurity and other arenas.\n\n\"The implications in terms of the size of the market opportunity is that of the internet and cloud computing combined,\" he said. \"The speed of change is different, the size of the market is different, the stage when the most valuable company was reached is different.\"\n\nNvidia, a 31-year-old company, became the world's most valuable firm on Tuesday. The stock closed at $135.58, giving the chip maker a valuation of $3.335 trillion, just above Microsoft at $3.317 trillion.\n\nIt marks the first time a company other than Microsoft or Apple has held the title of largest company since February 2019 when Amazon.com briefly topped the list. Nvidia was ranked fifth largest by market valuation a year ago and was ranked 10th largest two years ago. Five years ago, it wasn't in the top 20 largest companies.\n\nThe scramble among tech giants such as Microsoft, Meta and Amazon to lead the way in AI's development and capture its hoped-for benefits has led to a chip-buying spree that lifted Nvidia's revenue to unprecedented heights. In its latest quarter, the company brought in $26 billion, more than triple the same period a year before.\n\nNvidia's stock was the best performer in the S&P 500 in 2023, and has more than tripled in value over the past 12 months. The company's value hit $3 trillion this month, less than four months after it reached the $2 trillion mark.\n\nNvidia split its shares 10-for-1 this month, a move aimed at lowering the price of each share and making it more accessible to investors.\n\nThe stunning rise has won plaudits from analysts who agree with Chief Executive Jensen Huang's assertion that AI is the foundation of a new industrial revolution to which the company is the key supplier. Huang says Nvidia is building \"AI factories\" that take in data and churn out intelligence.\n\nNvidia \"will be the most important company to our civilization over the next decade as the world becomes more AI-driven,\" CFRA Research analyst Angelo Zino said recently. The chips Nvidia pioneered will be the most important invention of this century, he said.\n\nThe insatiable flow of money into AI has raised eyebrows among investors uncertain the boom can continue without pause. Some $50 billion has been invested in Nvidia's chips since the boom began, according to a Sequoia Capital estimate in March, but generative-AI startups have only brought in $3 billion in sales.\n\nThat imbalance, Sequoia partner Sonya Huang said at the time, meant \"we've got some real problems to fix.\"\n\nCapital Economics chief economist Neil Shearing on Monday said the AI bubble would likely help keep U.S. stocks rising for the next year and a half, although it would eventually burst, with the U.S. market \"destined for a period of significant underperformance\" to follow.\n\nNvidia and its chief, Huang, are showing few signs of concern, despite an array of challenges around them, from feisty competitors to regulators increasingly scrutinizing the company's dominance in the AI-chip market, where analysts suggest it has a share of above 80%.\n\nHuang early this month was in Taiwan, where he gave an address and announced new details about a future generation of AI chips set to arrive in 2026.\n\nWith the rise of the stock, he has taken on an aura of stardom usually reserved for pop singers and athletes, not 61-year-old tech executives. At the company's annual conference in March, Huang gave his keynote speech from a stage at an 11,000-capacity arena; in Taiwan, he was pictured autographing the chest area of a woman's shirt.\n\nChambers said Huang was working from a different playbook than Cisco but was facing some similar challenges. Nvidia has a dominant market share, much like Cisco did with its products as the internet grew, and is also fending off rising competition. Also like Nvidia, Cisco benefited from investments before the industry became profitable.\n\n\"We were absolutely in the right spot at the right time, and we knew it, and we went for it,\" Chambers said.", "source": {"uri": "livemint.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "mint"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cisco", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cisco"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dot-com_bubble", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dot-com bubble"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nvidia", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nvidia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Internet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_computing", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Cloud computing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_T._Chambers", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "John T.

Its graphics processing units (GPUs), which crunch AI workloads, are best in class by a wide margin and have been used by practically every company interested in AI.\n\nBut are there any companies that could dethrone Nvidia?\n\nNvidia's direct competitors aren't even close\n\nPart of the fear of investing in Nvidia is wondering what will happen if and when the music stops. Right now, the company is firing on all cylinders. But the question remains: What happens when enough GPUs have been purchased to satisfy AI demand?\n\nThere are some factors influencing the answer to that question, such as the average lifespan of a GPU used for server computing. That is estimated to be around three to five years, which would mean there will be a replacement cycle. But if the demand for Nvidia GPUs is met, then the next round of AI technology might look somewhat different.\n\nIf that happens, which company could take the spot atop the AI mountain? Some might point to Advanced Micro Devices as a potential successor. AMD competes directly with Nvidia in the data center GPU space but has been getting smoked.\n\nHowever, AMD has recently generated momentum with various cloud-computing providers starting to add its GPUs as an alternative. They don't want to be devoted solely to Nvidia hardware because that would give it too much pricing power over them. But because Nvidia still has much better technology, AMD will likely only be considered as an alternative.\n\nAnother candidate is Taiwan Semiconductor, (TSMC for short), the chip foundry that supplies Nvidia and thereby makes its products possible. But TSMC also supplies chips to AMD and other companies, which makes it a neutral factor in the AI investment race.\n\nBesides, TSMC expects massive growth driven by AI demand over the next few years. In its latest conference call, management said, \"For the next five years, we forecast [AI revenue] to grow at 50% [compound annual growth rate] and increase to higher than 20% of our revenue by 2028.\" That's strong growth, but it also means Nvidia could continue its dominance since it's a key customer for TSMC.\n\nThe companies applying AI depend on Nvidia\n\nBut all of the above is just the hardware side; what about application and use?\n\nMicrosoft and Alphabet are both massive customers for Nvidia's GPUs. Not only do they have internal uses for them, but they also buy them to power their respective cloud computing services.\n\nThey also started designing their own AI chips, so they don't have to buy them from Nvidia. However, these chips are highly workload-specific, so general-purpose GPUs like Nvidia's will still account for the lion's share of computing power.\n\nSoftware companies like Palantir are also bringing AI capabilities to the masses. Its clients still need plenty of computing power to run its models, and it gives them the tools to create them. This could make the company a potential successor to Nvidia as a leading AI investment, since it will continue to see demand for its platform long after AI computing capacity is built out.\n\nBut all roads lead back to Nvidia, which is why it has been and will continue to be the most popular AI investment. Nvidia is on top of the AI world right now, and there currently doesn't appear to be any company that can dethrone it.\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Nvidia wasn't one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years.\n\nConsider when Nvidia made this list on April 15, 2005... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you'd have $808,105!*\n\nStock Advisor provides investors with an easy-to-follow blueprint for success, including guidance on building a portfolio, regular updates from analysts, and two new stock picks each month.

Be it, Google, Microsoft or Meta, Nvidia has signed deals with each of these companies to accelerate the capabilities of the former.\n\nOn year-to-date basis, the shares of the chip maker have delivered a return of more than 180 per cent on NASDAQ.\n\nIn February, Nvidia's market value soared from $1 trillion to $2 trillion in just nine months. By June, it skyrocketed to $3 trillion in a little over three months. According to their latest quarterly report, the company recorded quarterly revenue of $26 billion, marking an 18 per cent rise from the previous quarter and a massive 262 per cent surge compared to the corresponding period of last year.\n\nThe robust financial figures of the company were perhaps, more than enough to bestow the crown of 'most valuable company' on Nvidia. However, more than the revenue sheet it was the AI boom that won the confidence of investors and users around the world.\n\nThe start\n\nNvidia was originally started in 1993 by founders Jensen Huang, Curtis Priem, and Chris Malachowsky. The company majorly focused on designing graphics accelerator chips for computers. Just six years later, they rolled out an IPO.\n\nThe company known for its GPUs (graphics processing units), quickly became synonymous with video games and computer graphics. However, over time, Nvidia diversified into other segments like GenAI, automotive, professional visualisation and data centers.\n\nUnlike regular CPUs in PCs, GPUs are way more efficient and are better suited for complex computing tasks.\n\nNVIDIA's growth widely came on stage in 2007 when it was named Forbes \"Company of the Year.\" However, the company also faced some legal challenges later on.\n\nTicking away from gaming\n\nJust a few years back, gaming used to be the company's main moneymaker, bringing in more revenue than its data center segment. However, post-pandemic, the company's primary focus started shifting. Today, majority of the company's revenue comes from data centers rather than just gaming.\n\nIn the first quarter of this year, the company's data center segment hit a new high with revenue reaching $22.6 billion. This marked a 23 per cent rise from the previous quarter and a whopping 427 per cent surge compared to the same period last year.\n\nDuring the same quarter, gaming revenue saw a dip of 8 per cent as compared to last quarter and stood at around $2.6 billion. However, as compared to the corresponding quarter of last year, the revenue was up by 18 per cent.\n\nA risk at backhand\n\nNvidia relies heavily on TSMC (Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company) and other chip manufacturers. Given the pricing levels at which Nvidia sells its products, an increase in TSMC's rates could potentially eat up Nvidia's margins.\n\nAlthough Nvidia continues to enjoy robust customer confidence, it might lose its competitive edge if rivals like AMD and Intel introduce similar impressive products.\n\nInvestors are also concerned about Nvidia's massive bull run, with its ever-increasing share price raising not only Wall Street's hopes but the risk aspect as well. Before the first quarter's earnings call, a Goldman Sachs analyst even called Nvidia's stock as the \"most important stock on planet Earth.\"\n\nHowever, for now, Nvidia continues to stay at the top as AI hype remains in momentum. But the fate of the company might not be turbulent-free as other players in the market are still well-present in the AI race", "source": {"uri": "business.outlookindia.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Outlook"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nvidia", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nvidia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphics_processing_unit", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Graphics processing unit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_center", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Data center"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large_language_model", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Large language model"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta_Platforms", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Meta Platforms"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nasdaq", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nasdaq"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leverage_(finance)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Leverage (finance)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Google"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Malachowsky", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chris Malachowsky"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curtis_Priem", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Curtis Priem"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jensen_Huang", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jensen Huang"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TSMC", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "TSMC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computing", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Computing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_processing_unit", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Central processing unit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Initial_public_offering", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Initial public offering"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forbes", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Forbes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_computer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Personal computer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_game", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Video game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_graphics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Computer graphics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Computer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automotive_industry", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Automotive industry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AMD", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "AMD"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intel", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Intel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wall_Street", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wall Street"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Earth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goldman_Sachs", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Goldman Sachs"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Small_Business/Start_Up", "label": "dmoz/Business/Small Business/Start Up", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Major_Companies", "label": "dmoz/Business/Major Companies", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence/Games", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence/Games", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Government/Companies_Registries", "label": "dmoz/Society/Government/Companies Registries", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Major_Companies/Company_Rankings", "label": "dmoz/Business/Major Companies/Company Rankings", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 45}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 54}], "image": "https://media.assettype.com/outlookbusiness%2Fimport%2Fuploadimage%2Flibrary%2F16_9%2F16_9_5%2Fnvidia_1651928213.webp?w=1200&ar=40%3A21&auto=format%2Ccompress&ogImage=true&mode=crop&enlarge=true&overlay=false&overlay_position=bottom&overlay_width=100", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9658445", "eventUri": "eng-9658445", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2313725490196079, "wgt": 154, "relevance": 1}

I have lost count of the number of non-finance people suddenly asking me about Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) stock now that it's trading for \"just\" $130 a share.\n\nBut while splits can make a stock appear cheaper, they have no impact on a company's valuations -- how the market prices it relative to sales, earnings, etc. -- nor on its market cap, which is the value of all its outstanding shares combined. In the case of Nvidia, that market cap is $3.2 trillion, making it the third-largest company in the world today, just a hair behind the one that makes iPhones.\n\nIs Nvidia stock still a buy at its current lofty market cap? Here are two reasons to continue hitting the buy button and one reason to consider jumping ship.\n\nIt has only been around two years since OpenAI took the world by storm with ChatGPT, a generative artificial intelligence (AI) chatbot capable of producing high-quality responses to user queries based on training data. Analysts are feverishly optimistic about the AI industry's potential, with Bloomberg Intelligence estimating it could be worth $1.3 trillion by 2032.\n\nIf that forecast proves close to accurate, this will be an incredible opportunity for Nvidia, which is the leading maker of the specific types of powerful graphics processing units (GPUs) needed to run and train these advanced algorithms. Currently, it holds a market share of more than 80% in that hot niche, where demand is outstripping supply.\n\nWhile Nvidia will face growing competition from rival chipmakers such as Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD) and Intel, it's protecting its market share via software solutions like CUDA (Compute Unified Device Architecture), a computing platform and programming interface that's bespoke for use with its hardware, and by constantly improving its offerings. According to CEO Jensen Huang, the company will henceforth release a new family of updated AI chips every single year (up from its prior pace of once every two years), making it even harder for rivals to keep up.\n\nThe second bullish fact about Nvidia is its valuation. Despite rising by over 3,000% in the last five years, shares are still reasonably priced relative to the company's remarkable growth rate.\n\nWith a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple of just 48, Nvidia's shares are not much more expensive than other popular AI hardware stocks like AMD, which has a P/E of 47. To put this in context, in the first quarter, AMD's sales grew by just 2% year over year, while Nvidia's exploded by 262%.\n\nThis valuation suggests Nvidia's stock could have more room to run if the AI industry lives up to analysts' expectations. But hold your horses -- there is one big risk factor new investors should be aware of.\n\nCisco Systems (NASDAQ: CSCO) is a computer hardware company that sold the routers and switches needed to build out the internet in the late 1990s. It was the \"picks and shovels\" way for investors to bet on what the smart money saw as a transformative new industry. And by the peak of the dot-com bubble in 2000, Cisco's market cap had hit $500 billion. Then the bubble burst, and it dropped by a staggering 88% within two years. The stock still hasn't recovered to its previous highs.\n\nInvestors should take this as a cautionary tale, because Nvidia occupies a similar role in the AI space today, and any hit to its growth rate or pricing power could lead to a rapid collapse in its valuation, just like what happened to Cisco. While Nvidia investors have a lot to be excited about, they should also be aware of the potential risks this company faces before buying the stock, especially at its current valuation.\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Nvidia wasn't one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years.\n\nConsider when Nvidia made this list on April 15, 2005... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you'd have $808,105!*\n\nStock Advisor provides investors with an easy-to-follow blueprint for success, including guidance on building a portfolio, regular updates from analysts, and two new stock picks each month.

The demand for Nvidia's industry-leading AI chips has catapulted its shares up by over 170% this year and an astonishing 1,100% since October 2022. This surge places Nvidia ahead of tech giants Microsoft and Apple in market value. Notably, Nvidia hit a $1 trillion increase in just 96 days, a feat that took longer for Microsoft and Apple. Historically, only 11 US companies have topped the market value charts since 1925, each with varying fortunes.\n\nNvidia's success spotlights escalating investment in AI, reshaping market dynamics. The company's booming earnings and the enthusiasm around AI continue to fuel its stock rally. Nvidia's quarterly results reflect this momentum, with revenue at $26 billion and net income of $14.9 billion. Projections suggest revenue could double to $120 billion this fiscal year and rise by another 33% by fiscal 2026. Tech companies like Super Micro Computer and Arm Holdings are also benefiting, with sharp increases in their share prices.\n\nThe bigger picture: Sustaining the golden streak.\n\nNvidia's journey mirrors historic market feats, but its ability to maintain this trajectory depends on continued growth and competitive advantage.

However, other big tech companies that might transition from customers to competitors could still challenge its prime position.\n\nREAD NEXT: Nvidia Faces Boycott Calls in China After CEO Jensen Huang Refers to Taiwan as a 'Country'\n\nThe meteoric rise of Nvidia's stock value also meant that it was massive enough to contribute to and influence market trends.\n\nIts surge made it a top contender in the S&P 500 for achieving index-hitting record highs in 2024. This also meant Nvidia's rapid acceleration positively pulled the broader index's stocks upward.\n\nForbes explained that the primary factor that reportedly contributed to the chipmaker's stellar market performance so far was the fact that it was creating semiconductors that could support sophisticated artificial intelligence (AI) software, such as OpenAI's ChatGPT and Elon Musk's xAI, making the company the tech industry's go-to supplier for AI chips and integrated software.\n\nEarlier this month, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang announced during the keynote speech at the Computex conference in Taipei that his firm would release Blackwell Ultra, a high-powered version of its Blackwell semiconductor, in 2025. He also announced the company would release a new AI chip platform called Rubin in 2026, with an Ultra version planned for 2027.\n\nHowever, it is also understood that the Chinese AI startup DeepSeek's generative AI tool Coder, which is considered at par with ChatGPT, might not consider Nvidia as its semiconductor provider after the tech firm faced weak demand in China, and recently, after Huang, who was born in Taiwan in 1963, called the island a \"country,\" a prospect that officials in Beijing refuse to recognize since the People's Republic in the mainland was founded in 1949.\n\nAnother limiting factor for Nvidia is the current economic and geopolitical conflict between China and the United States.", "source": {"uri": "vcpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Venture Capital Post"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jose_resurreccion@vcpost.com", "name": "Jose Resurreccion", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nvidia", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nvidia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yahoo!_Finance", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Yahoo!

Its graphics processing units (GPUs), which crunch AI workloads, are best in class by a wide margin and have been used by practically every company interested in AI.\n\nBut are there any companies that could dethrone Nvidia?\n\nPart of the fear of investing in Nvidia is wondering what will happen if and when the music stops. Right now, the company is firing on all cylinders. But the question remains: What happens when enough GPUs have been purchased to satisfy AI demand?\n\nThere are some factors influencing the answer to that question, such as the average lifespan of a GPU used for server computing. That is estimated to be around three to five years, which would mean there will be a replacement cycle. But if the demand for Nvidia GPUs is met, then the next round of AI technology might look somewhat different.\n\nIf that happens, which company could take the spot atop the AI mountain? Some might point to Advanced Micro Devices as a potential successor. AMD competes directly with Nvidia in the data center GPU space but has been getting smoked.\n\nHowever, AMD has recently generated momentum with various cloud-computing providers starting to add its GPUs as an alternative. They don't want to be devoted solely to Nvidia hardware because that would give it too much pricing power over them. But because Nvidia still has much better technology, AMD will likely only be considered as an alternative.\n\nAnother candidate is Taiwan Semiconductor, (TSMC for short), the chip foundry that supplies Nvidia and thereby makes its products possible. But TSMC also supplies chips to AMD and other companies, which makes it a neutral factor in the AI investment race.\n\nBesides, TSMC expects massive growth driven by AI demand over the next few years. In its latest conference call, management said, \"For the next five years, we forecast [AI revenue] to grow at 50% [compound annual growth rate] and increase to higher than 20% of our revenue by 2028.\" That's strong growth, but it also means Nvidia could continue its dominance since it's a key customer for TSMC.\n\nBut all of the above is just the hardware side; what about application and use?\n\nMicrosoft and Alphabet are both massive customers for Nvidia's GPUs. Not only do they have internal uses for them, but they also buy them to power their respective cloud computing services.\n\nThey also started designing their own AI chips, so they don't have to buy them from Nvidia. However, these chips are highly workload-specific, so general-purpose GPUs like Nvidia's will still account for the lion's share of computing power.\n\nSoftware companies like Palantir are also bringing AI capabilities to the masses. Its clients still need plenty of computing power to run its models, and it gives them the tools to create them. This could make the company a potential successor to Nvidia as a leading AI investment, since it will continue to see demand for its platform long after AI computing capacity is built out.\n\nBut all roads lead back to Nvidia, which is why it has been and will continue to be the most popular AI investment. Nvidia is on top of the AI world right now, and there currently doesn't appear to be any company that can dethrone it.\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Nvidia wasn't one of them.

Company", "body": "American multinational technology company, Nvidia has emerged as the world's most valuable company following the rise in its share price to an all-time high on Tuesday.\n\nNvidia's stock ended the trading day at nearly $136, up by 3.5% to become more valuable than Microsoft after the firm surpassed Apple earlier in the month.\n\nBBC reports that Nvidia makes computer chips needed for artificial intelligence (AI) software, and demand for its products has boosted its sales and profits over the last few years.\n\nInvestors are of the view that Nvidia's earnings can grow even more, and this has caused its share price to soar, though some have questioned its sky-high valuation.\n\nTuesday's share price rally means the market now values the company at $3.34tn (\u00a32.63tn), with the price having nearly doubled since the start of this year.\n\nNvidia stock was worth less than 1% of its current price eight years ago, however, competition among AI developers is fierce.\n\nMicrosoft, Google-owner Alphabet, Meta and Apple are just some of the tech heavyweights battling to create a world-beating product.\n\nThis competition according to BBC, benefits Nvidia, which dominates the vast majority of the AI chip market.\n\nAs such, investors believe the company will continue to surge in value as Nvidia's sales and profit figures have surpassed many analyst expectations in recent years.\n\nIn May, after its latest set of financial results were published, Quilter Cheviot technology analyst Ben Barringer said the company had \"once again cleared a very high hurdle,\" adding that \"demand is showing no signs of switching off either.\"\n\nHowever, a minority are more cautious with Barclays credit analyst Sandeep Gupta arguing in February, that

Pythagoras explained that the universe is nothing but numbers. If our world is made up of numbers, common extrapolation posits that making sense of numbers will be a great business since the world is numbers.\n\nYes, across human history, the greatest empires have been built around tools, mechanisms, systems, etc which make it easier to compute, process, manipulate, and make sense of numbers. Nvidia has entered the temple and its era has started.\n\nNvidia's stock has experienced an extraordinary rise, increasing by over 170% this year alone. This dramatic increase was further fueled by the company's robust first-quarter earnings reported in May. The stock has multiplied more than ninefold since the end of 2022, a rise that coincided with the rapid advancement and adoption of generative artificial intelligence (AI).\n\nApple, on the other hand, saw its shares dip by 1.1% on Tuesday, resulting in a market value of $3.29 trillion.\n\nLinkedIn News: It's official: Nvidia has become the world's most valuable public company. Its market cap climbed to $3.34 trillion on Tuesday, surpassing LinkedIn parent Microsoft and Apple, which had been jockeying for the top spots in recent weeks. Corporate and investor enthusiasm for generative artificial intelligence has helped its stock surge over 170% so far this year, reflecting a gain of over $2 trillion. Nvidia is seen as major beneficiary of the AI boom, since it currently has about 80% of the market for the chips used in data centers.

On Tuesday, Nvidia's market capitalization reached $3.332 trillion. Analysts, according to the Financial Times, are still surprised by Nvidia's meteoric rise. The company's share price has increased by over 170 percent since the beginning of the year. Nvidia's chips have become critical for training and operating the large language models that are foundational to the current AI surge.

The rapid increase in Nvidia's stock value highlights the market's recognition of the strategic importance of advanced processors in enabling sophisticated AI applications. These processors are essential for the computational demands of large language models, which require substantial processing power for training and inference tasks.\n\nThe widespread adoption of Nvidia's Hopper GPU series by leading tech companies for AI cloud services illustrates the critical nature of these processors in supporting AI infrastructure. The Hopper GPUs are designed to handle the intensive computational workloads associated with AI, making them a key component for companies looking to enhance their AI capabilities.\n\nDespite Nvidia's impressive growth and market position, there are concerns about the long-term sustainability of the AI-driven market boom. The rapid rise in Nvidia's stock price has contributed significantly to its market capitalization, but analysts warn that such growth may not be sustainable indefinitely. The AI industry is still evolving, and while Nvidia is well-positioned to capitalize on current trends, the market dynamics could shift, affecting the company's valuation and market standing.\n\nThe strategic partnerships and acquisitions by major tech companies like Google, Microsoft, and Amazon further emphasize Nvidia's integral role in the AI ecosystem. These companies are investing heavily in AI technologies and infrastructure, and Nvidia's processors are a crucial part of their strategies. The ongoing demand for advanced AI capabilities ensures that Nvidia's products will continue to be in high demand, reinforcing the company's market leadership.\n\nSource: financial times", "source": {"uri": "guru3d.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Guru3D.com"}, "authors": [{"uri": "hilbert_hagedoorn@guru3d.com", "name": "Hilbert Hagedoorn", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nvidia", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nvidia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphics_processing_unit", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Graphics processing unit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_capitalization", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Market capitalization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large_language_model", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Large language model"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Generative artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ChatGPT", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "ChatGPT"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_Times", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Financial Times"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_computing", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cloud computing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Applications_of_artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Applications of artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_(company)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Amazon (company)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inference", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Inference"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semiconductor_industry", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Semiconductor industry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Google"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Marketing_and_Advertising", "label": "dmoz/Business/Marketing and Advertising", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Marketing_and_Advertising/Consulting", "label": "dmoz/Business/Marketing and Advertising/Consulting", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Marketing_and_Advertising/Strategic", "label": "dmoz/Business/Marketing and Advertising/Strategic", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Information_Technology/Marketing_and_Advertising", "label": "dmoz/Business/Information Technology/Marketing and Advertising", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence/Games", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence/Games", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 46}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 53}], "image": "https://www.guru3d.com/data/themes/Guru3D/images/logo_large.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9658445", "eventUri": "eng-9658445", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3803921568627451, "wgt": 152, "relevance": 1}

In less than two years, it has been transformed from a $300bn company, grappling with a chip glut exacerbated by a cryptocurrency bust, into one of the most powerful tech companies in the world, with other Silicon Valley giants lining up to secure its latest products.\n\nIts huge share price gains have single-handedly driven about a third of the 14 per cent year-to-date increase in the benchmark S&P 500 index, in a rally that has shocked even bullish observers.\n\n\"This is animal spirits now, it's human emotion taking over,\" said Ted Mortonson, a tech strategist at Baird. \"Nvidia is a fantastic company, don't get me wrong. There are lots of drivers [for the stock]\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009but 40 per cent in a month, that's not normal.\"\n\nFounded 31 years ago to build PC graphics cards for video gamers, the Silicon Valley-based company has in the past year seen successive quarters of huge revenue growth, announcing a 265 per cent year-on-year increase in February and 262 per cent in May. Its shares are up roughly 170 per cent since the start of the year.\n\nNvidia chief executive Jensen Huang has declared that the company is at the centre of a new \"industrial revolution\", unleashing the power of generative AI to transform all sectors of the global economy with intelligent computing.\n\nGoogle, Microsoft and Amazon have all purchased its \"Hopper\" series of graphic processing units for their cloud services. Nvidia's software ecosystem, Cuda, which offers tools for developers using its chips, cements its dominance.\n\nIt is meanwhile rolling out its new generation of more powerful \"Blackwell\" chips, with Huang promising a \"one-year rhythm\" of new releases. Competitors such as AMD and Intel have launched their own competing AI chips but have yet to meaningfully eat into Nvidia's commanding market share.\n\n\"Somebody's got to be number one, and it's not like the stock for Nvidia has run up all by itself -- the financials have run up even more,\" said Stacy Rasgon, a chip analyst at Bernstein. \"I've never seen anything quite like this in terms of the actual economics that are driving it. It's pretty amazing.\"\n\nThe race to capitalise on the opportunity from generative AI has swept across the tech sector. At its annual developers conference last week, Apple joined in, announcing that its own suite of generative models would be embedded in its new operating systems, and signing a major partnership deal with OpenAI.\n\nNvidia's growing sway over broader stock indices has stoked concerns about the long-term sustainability of the market rally, but few analysts or investors are predicting a reversal in the short term.\n\nOf the 72 Nvidia analysts tracked by Bloomberg, just one rated the stock as a \"sell\".\n\n\"This top-heaviness of the market is really concerning\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009we're at levels of concentration that we haven't had since 1999 -- that's problematic,\" said Hans Olsen, chief investment officer at Fiduciary Trust, the $23bn wealth manager.\n\n\"But if you think back to the tech bubble, that went from 1997 until March 2000, it had a long runway. This one still has runway too,\" he added.\n\nNvidia has joined the dominant duo of Apple and Microsoft, which have been vying for the position of the most valuable company in the US -- and often the world -- for more than a decade. The last time a US company was worth more than both of them was in 2011 when ExxonMobil was the most valuable company in the country.", "source": {"uri": "ft.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

The soaring demand for its AI-optimised chips, crucial for the development of advanced AI software and products.\n\nNvidia's meteoric rise is a clear indicator of AI's transformative potential and the company's stellar run also reflects it on Wall Street.\n\nThe company's shares have skyrocketed over 170% this year alone, and 1,100% since their October 2022 low.\n\nThis growth has been driven by Nvidia's dominance in AI technologies, especially chips, powering everything from advanced data analytics to autonomous vehicles.\n\nIn its latest quarterly report, revenue more than tripled to $26 billion, while net income surged seven-fold to $14.9 billion.\n\nThese figures not only highlight Nvidia's current strength but also reinforce its future potential in an AI-driven world.\n\nNvidia's journey from a market value of $2 trillion to $3 trillion in just 96 days is unprecedented.\n\nFor context, it took Microsoft 945 days and Apple 1,044 days to make the same leap, according to Bespoke Investment Group.\n\nThis highlights the frenzied enthusiasm surrounding AI and Nvidia's pivotal role in this space.\n\nNvidia's financial metrics are also impressive, indicating that its dream run may continue in the AI-fuelled world.\n\nAnalysts project the company's revenue for the current fiscal year to double to $120 billion, with an additional 33% growth expected in fiscal 2026, reaching $160 billion, according to LSEG data quoted in a Reuters report.\n\nMeanwhile, Nvidia's net margin stands at a strong 53.4%, significantly higher than Apple's 26.3% and Microsoft's 36.4%.\n\nDespite the rapid rise in its share price, Nvidia's forward price-to-earnings ratio is at 43.

That pushed the semiconductor bellwether past Microsoft and Apple, which had been jostling for the top spots in recent days.\n\nThe surge in Nvidia's market value has been driven by demand for its chips, which are the gold standard in the AI space. The company's shares are up more than 170 per cent this year and have risen about 1,100 per cent since their October 2022 low.\n\nBlockbuster earnings and broadening investor enthusiasm over AI are supercharging Nvidia's rally. That fervor has been reflected in Nvidia's market value, which took only 96 days to go from $2 trillion to $3 trillion.\n\nMicrosoft, one of the two other companies to reach those rarefied levels, took 945 days to go from $2 trillion to $3 trillion while Apple took 1,044 days to make the leap, according to Bespoke Investment Group.\n\nPreviously, just 11 U.S. companies since 1925 have reached the top spot in market value on a closing basis, according to Howard Silverblatt, senior index analyst at S&P Dow Jones Indices.\n\nFortunes have diverged for past holders of the top position in recent decades. Microsoft reached No. 1 in the late 1990s but then its shares struggled for years during the early 2000s following the dotcom bubble, only to come roaring back in the latter half of the last decade.\n\nExxon Mobil became the world's most valuable company in the 2000s but its shares retreated following a downturn in oil prices.\n\nTo some, Cisco is the cautionary tale. The company's shares peaked at over $80 in March 2000 in the midst of the dotcom boom, during which investors often assigned dizzying valuations to internet-related companies.\n\nBespoke's analysts recently contrasted the trajectories of Nvidia and Cisco, whose products were seen as essential in supporting the internet's infrastructure.\n\n\"NVDA's run has been incredible, but it will need to keep growing from here and stave off competition if its stock is going to keep putting up stellar returns,\" Bespoke said in a recent note.\n\nFor now, Nvidia's earnings are supporting its stock price. Revenue more than tripled to $26 billion in the latest quarter, while net income jumped seven-fold to $14.9 billion.\n\nRevenue for the current fiscal year is expected to roughly double to $120 billion, and then rise another 33 per cent in fiscal 2026, to $160 billion, according to LSEG data.\n\nNvidia's impressive financial performance and forecasts have led its stock valuation, by some measures, to moderate despite the surge in its share price. For example, Nvidia's forward price-to-earnings ratio last stood at 43, according to LSEG Datastream. That is higher than the 25 level it stood at to start the year but below levels it reached for much of last year. By contrast, the S&P 500 trades at 21 times earnings.\n\nWhile Nvidia has been the standout performer, it is not the only stock to benefit from enthusiasm about the profit potential for AI. Shares of other technology companies, including Super Micro Computer and Arm Holdings, have also risen sharply this year.", "source": {"uri": "channelnewsasia.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CNA"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nvidia", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nvidia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_value", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Market value"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dot-com_bubble", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dot-com bubble"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semiconductor", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Semiconductor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_standard", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gold standard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_economy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "World economy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cisco", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cisco"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Price_of_oil", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Price of oil"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S&P_Dow_Jones_Indices", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "S&P Dow Jones Indices"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ExxonMobil", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "ExxonMobil"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arm_(company)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Arm (company)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S&P_500_Index", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "S&P 500 Index"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock_valuation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Stock valuation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valuation_(finance)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Valuation (finance)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Share_price", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Share price"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Net_income", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Net income"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiscal_year", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fiscal year"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revenue", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Revenue"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks_and_Bonds", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks and Bonds", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Research_and_Analysis", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Research and Analysis", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Day_Trading", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Day Trading", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Major_Companies/Company_Rankings", "label": "dmoz/Business/Major Companies/Company Rankings", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://onecms-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/s--N-kw2svb--/fl_relative,g_south_east,l_mediacorp:cna:watermark:2024-04:reuters_1,w_0.1/f_auto,q_auto/c_fill,g_auto,h_676,w_1200/v1/one-cms/core/2024-06-18t184800z_1_lynxmpek5h0p1_rtroptp_3_usa-stocks-nvidia-microsoft.jpg?itok=L2ycBLwN", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9658445", "eventUri": "eng-9658445", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2000-03-", "textStart": 1810, "textEnd": 1820}], "sentiment": 0.3960784313725489, "wgt": 151, "relevance": 1}

As analysts continue to raise their price targets to keep up with NVDA's progress, let's see if this high-flying tech stock is still a good buy right now.\n\nNvidia is Growing at a Fast Pace\n\nDespite its massive size, Nvidia is growing at a remarkable clip. In fiscal Q1 of 2025 (ended in April), Nvidia reported revenue of $26.04 billion and adjusted earnings per share of $6.12, higher than Wall Street's consensus estimates of $24.65 billion and $5.59 per share, respectively.\n\nThe chip giant also forecast sales of $28 billion in fiscal Q2, above estimates of $26.6 billion. While sales grew 262% year over year, its operating leverage enabled Nvidia to increase earnings by 461% in the last 12 months.\n\nNvidia is at the epicenter of the artificial intelligence (AI) megatrend, as Big Tech giants such as Microsoft, Google (GOOGL) (GOOG), Amazon (AMZN), and Meta (META) are all investing billions into this niche of the market to gain a first-mover advantage. These mega-cap giants are buying Nvidia's graphics processing units or GPUs, which are chips required to deploy AI-powered applications.\n\nDuring Q1, Nvidia's data center sales, which include AI chips, grew by 427% year over year to $22.6 billion. Prior to the AI boom, Nvidia generated the majority of its sales from gaming chips. Notably, Nvidia is even more optimistic about demand for its next-generation AI GPU, Blackwell, which will be added to data centers by Q4 of fiscal 2025.\n\nWhat Could Drive Nvidia Stock Higher?\n\nAccording to a CNBC report, the upcoming rebalancing of the Technology Select SPDR Fund (XLK) could attract around $10 billion in fund flows to NVDA. While Microsoft, Apple and Nvidia are all trading around a similar market cap, the diversification rules of the ETF mean that there's a limit on the cumulative weight of the stocks that account for more than 5% of the fund.\n\nAs a result, Nvidia's weight in the XLK ETF could increase from 6% to 21%. Alternatively, Apple's weight will fall from 22% to 4.5%.\n\nNVDA Stock Scores New Street-High Target Prices\n\nJust today, Rosenblatt analyst Hans Mosesmann set a new Street-high price target of $200 for NVDA, up from his prior target of $140. The new target implies expected upside of 48.6% from Monday's closing price.\n\nAccording to Mosesmann, \"the real narrative lies in the software that complements all the hardware goodness,\" and \"We anticipate this software aspect will significantly increase in the next decade in terms of overall sales mix, with an upward bias to valuation due to sustainability.\" The analyst's price target is based on a multiple of 40x forward earnings.\n\nPreviously, Susquehanna's Christopher Rolland had upped the ante on Monday to $165 from $145, based on an even richer 51.5x earnings multiple - which the analyst said is \"warranted as [Nvidia] is well-positioned to take advantage of flourishing end markets.\"\n\nBefore this week's rush of new Street-high price targets, the high-water mark belonged to investment firm Oppenheimer, which raised its 12-month target price for Nvidia to $150 from $100 on June 11, shortly after the stock's 10-for-1 stock split. Analyst Rick Schafer said the firm updated its financial model to account for the higher number of outstanding shares and the attractive roadmap for Nvidia's compute and networking businesses.\n\nOut of the 40 analysts covering NVDA stock, 35 recommend \"strong buy,\" two recommend \"moderate buy,\" and three recommend \"hold.\" Given this bullish configuration, there may be more price-target increases still to come.\n\nNvidia is valued at a premium due to its stellar sales and earnings growth. Wall Street expects Nvidia to end fiscal 2029 with adjusted earnings per share of $7.25. So, if NVDA stock is priced at 30x forward earnings, it should trade around $225 by May 2028.\n\nOn the date of publication, Aditya Raghunath did not have (either directly or indirectly) positions in any of the securities mentioned in this article.

The only other company close to Nvidia in market cap is Apple, which is now valued at $3.28 trillion.\n\n[Related: Analysis: As Nvidia Takes AI Victory Lap, AMD Doubles The Trouble For Intel]\n\nNvidia couldn't have reached the apex of the corporate world without the support of the cloud service providers, server vendors, data center infrastructure software providers and independent software vendors who have increasingly embraced the company's growing portfolio of GPUs, CPUs, networking gear, server platforms and software.\n\nWhile Nvidia has long stood out due to continuous advances in its GPUs -- which have been key to providing the accelerated performance needed to make generative AI advancements possible -- a great deal of its recent success has come from its focus on evolving from a chip designer to what CEO Jensen Huang calls a \"full-stack\" computing company.\n\nStarting with the foundation of its CUDA programming model that has allowed developers to embrace GPUs for a growing number of demanding workloads, Nvidia has spent the past several years building out this stack, either by acquiring companies or developing internal capabilities, so that it could tightly integrate and tune each component, with the goal of optimizing performance and efficiency while keeping development barriers low.\n\nThese components range from GPUs and CPUs to data processing units (DPUs) and high-speed interconnects, and the company is packaging them into its own server platform designs, such as the HGX, for cloud service providers and OEMs to adopt for their own products.\n\nThis has increasingly put Nvidia behind the steering wheel when it comes to the way servers and data centers are designed.\n\nTake, for instance, Amazon Web Services' Project Ceiba, which the company said in March will become \"one of the world's fastest AI supercomputers.\" This supercomputer will be made up of Nvidia's GB200 NVL72 systems, which are multi-node, liquid-cooled, rack-scale servers that each contain 36 of Nvidia's upcoming GB200 Grace Blackwell as well as its BlueField-3 DPUs.\n\nThe GB200 NVL72 systems will also become the basis for instances powered by Nvidia's upcoming Blackwell GPU architecture from the likes of Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud and Oracle Cloud Infrastructures. And these cloud service providers plan to offer Nvidia's DGX Cloud service, which includes the company's Nvidia AI Enterprise commercial software platform as well as enterprise support, on top to aid with AI development.\n\nNvidia's influence is also strong with server OEMs, and that was most recently demonstrated by Hewlett Packard Enterprise, which on Tuesday launched a comprehensive generative AI solutions portfolio co-developed and co-branded by the AI chip giant.\n\nCalled \"Nvidia AI Computing By HPE,\" the portfolio's name further underscores how central Nvidia has become to modern data center infrastructure offerings, covering products not just for compute but also storage and networking. It even comes with a joint enablement and training program with combined market development funds for channel partners.\n\nIt's this kind of influence that allowed sales of Nvidia's data center GPUs and platforms to skyrocket last year, which led to the company surpassing semiconductor stalwart Intel in annual revenue. The company's latest earnings results show that it's not losing momentum yet.\n\nBut can Nvidia keep this up for the foreseeable future? There are several companies hoping to chip away at Nvidia's influence, and they include AMD and Intel, who both believe the market is looking for more open alternatives for powering AI and other demanding workloads. Even AWS, Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud are building competitive data center accelerator chips.\n\nEven if Nvidia loses some influence in the long run, it will have succeeded in remaking the IT infrastructure world in its image and forcing others to figure out how they can do things better.", "source": {"uri": "crn.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CRN"}, "authors": [{"uri":

Is It a Buy Around $130?", "body": "One of the big debates among Wall Street followers lately has been just how far Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) stock can run. A new report from one analyst leads the charge on how high shares will go.\n\nSusquehanna senior semiconductor analyst Chris Rolland just raised his firm's price target from $145 to $160 per share. That would represent a gain of more than 20% from recent levels to a market cap of $3.94 trillion. The question for investors is how bold an outlook seems reasonable for Nvidia.\n\nIt's all about the software\n\nNvidia shares have soared by nearly 600% since January 2023, thanks to insatiable demand for its graphics processing units (GPUs). Customers can't get enough of those industry-leading processors, which they require to meet the massive computing power needs of artificial intelligence (AI) applications. Nvidia already has its next-generation chips in production, and henceforth plans to introduce new versions every year.\n\nNvidia also plans to integrate software to give customers more end-to-end solutions for data center servers. Rolland thinks that software will be a key factor that drives Nvidia's share price to his Street-high estimate.\n\nNvidia's CUDA (Compute Unified Device Architecture) toolkit allows users to develop, enhance, and deploy applications on multiple types of GPU-accelerated embedded systems. Rolland said that CUDA is \"the operating system for large language model processing and/or training as of right now.\"\n\nAggressive investing math\n\nIt makes sense to focus on software and other products beyond GPUs as potential drivers of Nvidia's future gains. After all, while demand outpaces supply for chips, production capacity remains a limitation on how much revenue Nvidia can generate from its hardware. Competition is also likely to chip away at market share.\n\nBut Rolland's valuation still appears a bit aggressive. He based that target on the stock being valued at a ratio of 51.5 times his 2025 forecast for adjusted earnings per share. I don't doubt Nvidia will keep growing its top and bottom lines. However, while it's a stock worth owning for the long term, it might not get that valuation as soon as next year.\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Nvidia wasn't one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years.\n\nConsider when Nvidia made this list on April 15, 2005... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you'd have $802,591!*\n\nStock Advisor provides investors with an easy-to-follow blueprint for success, including guidance on building a portfolio, regular updates from analysts, and two new stock picks each month.

Nvidia on Tuesday surpassed Microsoft to become the most valuable company in the world, reaching a market capitalization of $3.34 trillion to edge out Microsoft's $3.32 trillion.\n\nIn the first week of June, CEO Jensen Huang saw his firm hit a $3 trillion market cap for the first time, surpassing Apple. The Santa Clara, Calif.-based chipmaker, whose highly sought-after semiconductors help power AI-related computing tasks at massive data centers, has dominated the market. Over the past year, shares of Nvidia have surged more than 200%.\n\n\"The Godfather of AI, Jensen, and Nvidia are leading this AI revolution, and it's a race to $4 trillion market cap -- with Nvidia, Microsoft, and Apple battling for the No. 1 spot,\" Dan Ives, managing partner at Wedbush Securities, told me on Tuesday.\n\nHuang cofounded Nvidia in 1993 with Chris Malachowsky and Curtis Priem. About 34.5% of the S&P 500's market cap gains so far this year can be attributed to Nvidia alone, according to Apollo Global Management chief economist Torsten Sl\u00f8k, Fortune previously reported.\n\nOn May 22, Nvidia reported results for the quarter ended April 28, and it showed no signs of slowing down. On the earnings call, Nvidia EVP and CFO Colette Kress said revenue for the quarter was $26 billion, up 18% sequentially and up 262% year on year, and well above the company's outlook of $24 billion.\n\n\"The CFO leadership at Nvidia from Colette Kress has been instrumental in Nvidia's success with Wall Street, and is key to Jensen's vision,\" Ives told me. \"She is extremely well respected both internally at Nvidia and across the tech industry.\"\n\nKress joined Nvidia in 2013 as CFO after serving nearly 25 years in a range of finance roles at major technology companies. She previously was CFO of Cisco's Business Technology and Operations Finance organization, and she spent 13 years at Microsoft, including four years as CFO of the server and tools division.\n\nI had the opportunity to sit down with Kress in 2022, and we discussed how the rest of her career prepared her to move to Nvidia.\n\nHere's what she told me:\n\n\"My career background did serve me well. When I started at Nvidia, it was the smallest company that I'd ever worked for. It's gotten quite large, but the focus is on how do you think about the future and make sure we're ready for it to scale?\n\n\"Some of the techniques and processes have to be transformed over time as the company scales. How do we digitize manual processes? Our fast growth rate has put that front and center for us. Particularly, in my role leading finance, and the sister and brother organizations around me, I'm looking to them to say, 'Hey, we need to revise a process, how the functions work together, to create digital solutions.'\n\n\"When looking back at my career of 30-plus years, what's fascinating now is there are so many different ways to do things that never existed -- even at some of the largest companies that I've worked at in the past.\"\n\nShe now works at the largest company. And she's clearly a big reason why.", "source": {"uri": "ca.finance.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo!

from the previous $98.50 to the current $170 - for the next 12 months, maintaining its 'buy' rating.\n\nAt the same time, Wells Fargo (NYSE: WFC) has updated his Nvidia stock target price, increasing it from $125 to $155, and Wedbush estimated that over the next year, the race to a $4 trillion market cap in the technology sector would continue to revolve around Nvidia, Apple, and Microsoft.\n\nAt the same time, Rosenblatt Securities went all-bullish on NVDA stock, raising its Nvidia price target from $140 to $200, projecting Nvidia to achieve $5.00 earnings per share (EPS) or more by 2026 and arguing that:\n\n\"We see Nvidia's Hopper, Blackwell, and Rubin series driving 'value' market share in one of Silicon Valley's most successful silicon/platform product cycles.\"\n\nFor now, the NVDA stock is changing hands at the price of $135.58, which indicates an increase of 2.92% on the day, adding up to the weekly gain of 5.14%, as well as the 43.05% advance on its monthly chart, as it grew a whopping 181.47% this year alone, as per data on June 19.\n\nIt is also worth noting that market expert Louis Navellier has shared his view that despite NVDA's already-staggering rise, the AI company's stock has significantly more room to grow and that it will soon target an unprecedented market cap of $5 trillion, as Finbold reported on June 7.\n\nAll things considered, Wall Street analysts' views regarding the future performance of Nvidia shares seem to be growing bullish, albeit not many of them have yet jumped on the bandwagon of increasing their price targets for the next 12 months, but current developments might push them in this direction.\n\nBuy stocks now with eToro -

That pushed the semiconductor bellwether past Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), which had been jostling for the top spots in recent days.\n\nThe surge in Nvidia's market value has been driven by demand for its chips, which are the gold standard in the AI space. The company's shares are up more than 170% this year and have risen about 1,100% since their October 2022 low.\n\nBlockbuster earnings and broadening investor enthusiasm over AI are supercharging Nvidia's rally. That fervor has been reflected in Nvidia's market value, which took only 96 days to go from $2 trillion to $3 trillion.\n\nMicrosoft, one of the two other companies to reach those rarefied levels, took 945 days to go from $2 trillion to $3 trillion while Apple took 1,044 days to make the leap, according to Bespoke Investment Group.\n\nPreviously, just 11 U.S. companies since 1925 have reached the top spot in market value on a closing basis, according to Howard Silverblatt, senior index analyst at S&P Dow Jones Indices.\n\nFortunes have diverged for past holders of the top position in recent decades. Microsoft reached No. 1 in the late 1990s but then its shares struggled for years during the early 2000s following the dotcom bubble, only to come roaring back in the latter half of the last decade.\n\nExxon Mobil (NYSE:XOM) became the world's most valuable company in the 2000s but its shares retreated following a downturn in oil prices.\n\nTo some, Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO) is the cautionary tale. The company's shares peaked at over $80 in March 2000 in the midst of the dotcom boom, during which investors often assigned dizzying valuations to internet-related companies.\n\nBespoke's analysts recently contrasted the trajectories of Nvidia and Cisco, whose products were seen as essential in supporting the internet's infrastructure.\n\n\"NVDA's run has been incredible, but it will need to keep growing from here and stave off competition if its stock is going to keep putting up stellar returns,\" Bespoke said in a recent note.\n\nFor now, Nvidia's earnings are supporting its stock price. Revenue more than tripled to $26 billion in the latest quarter, while net income jumped seven-fold to $14.9 billion.\n\nRevenue for the current fiscal year is expected to roughly double to $120 billion, and then rise another 33% in fiscal 2026, to $160 billion, according to LSEG data.\n\nNvidia's impressive financial performance and forecasts have led its stock valuation, by some measures, to moderate despite the surge in its share price. For example, Nvidia's forward price-to-earnings ratio last stood at 43, according to LSEG Datastream. That is higher than the 25 level it stood at to start the year but below levels it reached for much of last year. By contrast, the S&P 500 trades at 21 times earnings.\n\nWhile Nvidia has been the standout performer, it is not the only stock to benefit from enthusiasm about the profit potential for AI. Shares of other technology companies, including Super Micro Computer (NASDAQ:SMCI) and Arm Holdings (NASDAQ:ARM), have also risen sharply this year.", "source": {"uri": "investing.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Investing.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nvidia", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nvidia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_value", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Market value"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dot-com_bubble", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dot-com bubble"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semiconductor", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Semiconductor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_standard", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gold standard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_economy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "World economy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cisco", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cisco"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Price_of_oil", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Price of oil"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S&P_Dow_Jones_Indices", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "S&P Dow Jones Indices"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ExxonMobil", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "ExxonMobil"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arm_(company)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Arm (company)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S&P_500_Index", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "S&P 500 Index"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock_valuation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Stock valuation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valuation_(finance)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Valuation (finance)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Share_price", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Share price"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Net_income", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Net income"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiscal_year", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fiscal year"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revenue", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Revenue"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reuters", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Reuters"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks_and_Bonds", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks and Bonds", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Research_and_Analysis", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Research and Analysis", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Major_Companies", "label": "dmoz/Business/Major Companies", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Major_Companies/Publicly_Traded", "label": "dmoz/Business/Major Companies/Publicly Traded", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://i-invdn-com.investing.com/trkd-images/LYNXMPEK5H0P1_M.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9658445", "eventUri": "eng-9658445", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2000-03-", "textStart": 1863, "textEnd": 1873}], "sentiment": 0.3960784313725489, "wgt": 148, "relevance": 1}

However, when it comes to Nvidia (NVDA 1.75%), the chip maker's eye-popping valuation may not actually be signs of a bubble. Rather, it might reflect a deeper truth about the rapidly evolving state of artificial intelligence (AI).\n\nNvidia's shares are currently trading at 77.1 times trailing earnings, a lofty valuation by historical standards and rich even for the high-growth tech sector. This has led some investors to question whether it's time to take profits on Nvidia stock. After all, the chipmaker's shares are up by a staggering 206% over the prior 12 months.\n\nHowever, several lines of evidence suggest that Nvidia's growth story is still in the early innings and that AI is on track to fundamentally alter the world. Here is a look at five key tailwinds that should power Nvidia's shares even higher over the next several years.\n\nFirst, the general population remains largely unaware of the true power of AI. This situation is set to change dramatically later this year as Apple integrates AI into its ecosystem and Amazon strives to make Alexa smarter with AI.\n\nAs a broad base of consumers begin to experience the benefits of AI in their daily lives, demand for AI-powered products and services will likely skyrocket, driving substantial revenue growth for companies like Nvidia that provide the architecture behind the technology.\n\nSecond, the pace of AI development is accelerating. The exponential growth of computing power has put humanity on the doorstep of a series of \"Gutenberg moments\", or events that completely upend the status quo.\n\nThis quickening pace of innovation implies that rivals probably won't have time to challenge Nvidia's dominant position in the AI-capable graphics processing unit (GPU) space. While competitors like Advanced Micro Devices and Intel are aiming to cut into Nvidia's dominant market share, the window of opportunity is closing.\n\nThird, the AI arms race between leading American firms, and the U.S. and China more broadly, won't allow developers time to create alternative ecosystems.\n\nThe race to achieve artificial general intelligence (AGI) is on, and Nvidia's superchips like Blackwell will likely be the primary drivers of this transformation. As companies and nations scramble to gain a competitive edge in AI, Nvidia's technology will remain in high demand.\n\nFourth, the advent of AI won't follow any rules established by prior transformational technologies like the internet or cars. AI can potentially alter human society at a fundamental level, and it will happen in less than five years.\n\nTraditional valuation metrics and historical precedents, in turn, may not wholly apply to groundbreaking companies like Nvidia.\n\nFifth, the potential applications of AI are virtually limitless, spanning across industries such as healthcare, finance, transportation, and more. As AI becomes more sophisticated and ubiquitous, it will create entirely new markets - many of which are unimaginable today.\n\nNvidia, with its cutting-edge AI technology and growing customer base, is in the catbird seat.\n\nNvidia's current valuation may seem high by historical standards. But it's important to consider the company's unique position in the rapidly evolving AI landscape.\n\nWith the general population largely unaware of AI's already incredible capabilities, the quickening pace of development, and an ongoing arms race, Nvidia should continue to post record-breaking revenue growth in the coming years.\n\nAfter all, Nvidia's potential is truly unprecedented as the gatekeeper to a $100 trillion AI-based economy. Viewed in this context, the growing bubble talk around the chip maker's shares seems unjustified.", "source": {"uri": "fool.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Motley Fool"}, "authors": [{"uri": "george_budwell@fool.com", "name": "George Budwell", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nvidia", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nvidia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock_market", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stock market"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AMD", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "AMD"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_general_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Artificial general intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_Alexa", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Amazon Alexa"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_(company)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Amazon (company)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Status_quo", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Status quo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computing", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Computing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exponential_growth", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Exponential growth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intel", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Intel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphics_processing_unit", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Graphics processing unit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_share", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Market share"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arms_race", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Arms race"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finance", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Finance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Health care"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Internet"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Future/Transhumanism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Future/Transhumanism", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence/Natural_Language", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence/Natural Language", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence/Publications", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence/Publications", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence/Games", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence/Games", "wgt": 24}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence/Philosophy", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence/Philosophy", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 57}], "image": "https://g.foolcdn.com/editorial/images/780701/time-to-buy.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9658445", "eventUri": "eng-9658445", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.388235294117647, "wgt": 148, "relevance": 1}

The stock market has a new king.\n\nOn Tuesday, Nvidia leapfrogged two of tech's most storied names to become the world's most valuable public company, according to data from S&P Global. Its ascent has been powered by the boom in generative artificial intelligence and surging demand for the company's chips -- known as graphics processing units, or GPUs -- which have made it possible to create A.I. systems.\n\nNvidia's rise is among the fastest in market history. Just two years ago, the company's market valuation was over $400 million. Now, in the span of a year, it has gone from $1 trillion to more than $3 trillion.\n\nOn Tuesday, Nvidia's share price rose 3.6 percent, lifting its value above $3.3 trillion. Microsoft and Apple both fell, ending the day trailing the Silicon Valley chip maker.\n\nYears before other big chip companies, Nvidia's chief executive, Jensen Huang, bet that GPUs would be essential to building artificial intelligence, and he tailored his company to accommodate what he believed would be tech's next big boom.\n\nHis big bet is paying off. By some measurements, Nvidia controls more than 80 percent of the market for the chips used in A.I. systems. Nvidia's biggest customers regularly jockey for orders for chips to run computers in their giant data centers, and are building their own A.I. chips so they are not so dependent on one supplier.\n\n\"No one else fully saw or appreciated this,\" said Daniel Newman, chief executive of the Futurum Group, a tech research firm. \"They saw the trend, built for the trend and enabled the market. They can effectively charge whatever they want.\"\n\nNvidia's ascent has made Mr. Huang a celebrity in the tech world. After a computer conference in Taiwan early this month, he was surrounded by attendees who wanted his autograph, including a woman who asked him to sign her chest.\n\nThe company's rise is reminiscent of dot-com era titans like Cisco and Juniper Networks, which built the equipment that ran communications networks for the internet. Cisco's shares increased more than a thousandfold between its initial public offering in 1990 and 2000, when it briefly became the world's most valuable company.\n\nThe speed at which Nvidia's value has grown has been startling. Apple crossed $1 trillion in August 2018 and became the first $3 trillion company last June. Microsoft also took nearly five years to climb from $1 trillion to $3 trillion.\n\nBut Nvidia's investors are betting more on its potential than on its current profits. Microsoft and Apple generate more than $85 billion in annual profits, while Nvidia generates $42.6 billion.\n\n\"The numbers have gotten so big so quickly that people worry: Is this sustainable?\" said Stacy Rasgon, an analyst with Bernstein Research. \"If the return on A.I. turns out to not be there, then the whole thing comes crumbling down.\"\n\nThis is a developing story.

That pushed the semiconductor bellwether past Microsoft and Apple, which had been jostling for the top spots in recent days.\n\nThe surge in Nvidia's market value has been driven by demand for its chips, which are the gold standard in the AI space. The company's shares are up more than 170% this year and have risen about 1,100% since their October 2022 low.\n\nBlockbuster earnings and broadening investor enthusiasm over AI are supercharging Nvidia's rally. That fervor has been reflected in Nvidia's market value, which took only 96 days to go from $2 trillion to $3 trillion.\n\nMicrosoft, one of the two other companies to reach those rarefied levels, took 945 days to go from $2 trillion to $3 trillion while Apple took 1,044 days to make the leap, according to Bespoke Investment Group.\n\nPreviously, just 11 U.S. companies since 1925 have reached the top spot in market value on a closing basis, according to Howard Silverblatt, senior index analyst at S&P Dow Jones Indices.\n\nFortunes have diverged for past holders of the top position in recent decades. Microsoft reached No. 1 in the late 1990s but then its shares struggled for years during the early 2000s following the dotcom bubble, only to come roaring back in the latter half of the last decade.\n\nExxon Mobil became the world's most valuable company in the 2000s but its shares retreated following a downturn in oil prices.\n\nTo some, Cisco is the cautionary tale. The company's shares peaked at over $80 in March 2000 in the midst of the dotcom boom, during which investors often assigned dizzying valuations to internet-related companies.\n\nBespoke's analysts recently contrasted the trajectories of Nvidia and Cisco, whose products were seen as essential in supporting the internet's infrastructure.\n\n\"NVDA's run has been incredible, but it will need to keep growing from here and stave off competition if its stock is going to keep putting up stellar returns,\" Bespoke said in a recent note.\n\nFor now, Nvidia's earnings are supporting its stock price. Revenue more than tripled to $26 billion in the latest quarter, while net income jumped seven-fold to $14.9 billion.\n\nRevenue for the current fiscal year is expected to roughly double to $120 billion, and then rise another 33% in fiscal 2026, to $160 billion, according to LSEG data.\n\nNvidia's impressive financial performance and forecasts have led its stock valuation, by some measures, to moderate despite the surge in its share price. For example, Nvidia's forward price-to-earnings ratio last stood at 43, according to LSEG Datastream. That is higher than the 25 level it stood at to start the year but below levels it reached for much of last year. By contrast, the S&P 500 trades at 21 times earnings.\n\nWhile Nvidia has been the standout performer, it is not the only stock to benefit from enthusiasm about the profit potential for AI. Shares of other technology companies, including Super Micro Computer and Arm Holdings, have also risen sharply this year.\n\n(Reporting by Lewis Krauskopf in New York; Additional reporting by Saqib Iqbal Ahmed in New York and Noel Randewich in Oakland, California; Editing by Ira Iosebashvili and Matthew Lewis)", "source": {"uri": "usnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "U.S. News & World Report"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nvidia", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nvidia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_value", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Market value"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dot-com_bubble", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dot-com bubble"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semiconductor", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Semiconductor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_standard", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gold standard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_economy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "World economy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reuters", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Reuters"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cisco", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cisco"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Price_of_oil", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Price of oil"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S&P_Dow_Jones_Indices", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "S&P Dow Jones Indices"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ExxonMobil", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "ExxonMobil"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valuation_(finance)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Valuation (finance)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revenue", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Revenue"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S&P_500_Index", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "S&P 500 Index"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock_valuation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Stock valuation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Share_price", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Share price"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Net_income", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Net income"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiscal_year", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fiscal year"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oakland,_California", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Oakland, California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Oakland, California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks_and_Bonds", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks and Bonds", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Research_and_Analysis", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Research and Analysis", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Day_Trading", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Day Trading", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Major_Companies/Company_Rankings", "label": "dmoz/Business/Major Companies/Company Rankings", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://www.usnews.com/dims4/USNEWS/d8799fe/2147483647/thumbnail/970x647/quality/85/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.usnews.com%2Fcmsmedia%2F3f%2F0391f623aaf1b990dccd1848fe7693%2Ftag%3Areuters.com%2C2024%3Anewsml_LYNXMPEK5H0P1%3A12024-06-18T184800Z_1_LYNXMPEK5H0P1_RTROPTP_3_USA-STOCKS-NVIDIA-MICROSOFT.JPG", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9658445", "eventUri": "eng-9658445", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2000-03-", "textStart": 1796, "textEnd": 1806}], "sentiment": 0.411764705882353, "wgt": 147, "relevance": 1}

Should You?", "body": "When key insiders buy shares of their company, they're probably confident about its future. Sure, that confidence could be misplaced. However, most investors see insider buying as a positive sign.\n\nBut it can be a much different story when key insiders sell shares. In some cases, such moves could hint that they aren't optimistic about the stock's future -- at least over the near term.\n\nThat leads me to Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA). The stock has been on a roll, skyrocketing more than seven times over the last three years and soaring more than 160% so far in 2024. However, Insiders are selling their shares of Nvidia. Should you?\n\nSince the beginning of May, 10 Form 144 filings have been reported by Nvidia to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). There are two important things to know about Form 144. First, it's a notice of the proposed sale of securities. Second, it's only used when there's a planned sale of 5,000 or more shares or an aggregate amount of over $50,000.\n\nThe most prominent person selling Nvidia stock is the company's CEO, Jensen Huang. Nvidia notified the SEC that Huang planned to sell 120,000 shares on June 13, 2024. At the market close on that date, this transaction would have been worth around $15.5 million.\n\nHuang wasn't the only Nvidia executive selling shares. Executive vice president of operations Deborah Shoquist sold 41,140 shares worth more than $45 million on June 3, 2024.\n\nSeveral members of Nvidia's board of directors also got in on the action. Dawn Hudson sold a total of 25,000 shares on three separate occasions since May 29, 2024. Board members Tench Coxe, John Dabiri, Michael McCaffery, Brooke Seawell, and Mark Stevens also sold some of their Nvidia shares in recent weeks.\n\nThese insider sales could be alarming to some investors. To use an old saying: Are the rats fleeing a sinking ship? Nope. There's more to the story.\n\nThe shares Huang sold were part of his executive compensation package. Specifically, they were restricted stock units (RSU) and performance stock units (PSU). Company CEOs frequently sell such shares when they're allowed to do so.\n\nImportantly, Huang owned nearly 93.5 million shares of Nvidia as of March 25, 2024. That's almost 3.8% of the company's outstanding shares. His recent sales were only a drop in the bucket compared to his total holdings. Huang still has plenty of skin in the game.\n\nMost of the other sales (including the ones by Shoquist and several board members) were also of restricted stock units. Investors shouldn't be too concerned about these transactions.\n\nI don't think the recent insider sales of Nvidia are a reason for outsiders to sell the stock. However, there could be some reasons for you to consider selling.\n\nNvidia's jaw-dropping gains might have caused the stock to make up a worrisome percentage of your overall portfolio. Some investors might want to trim their positions as a result.\n\nMy colleague Sean Williams predicts that Nvidia stock is poised to plunge by at least 50%. If you agree with his rationale, selling soon makes sense.\n\nHowever, Nvidia's underlying business remains strong. The company continues to execute exceptionally well. The demand for its graphics processing units isn't waning. Those are great reasons to hang on to a stock.\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Nvidia wasn't one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years.\n\nConsider when Nvidia made this list on April 15, 2005... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you'd have $808,105!*\n\nStock Advisor provides investors with an easy-to-follow blueprint for success, including guidance on building a portfolio, regular updates from analysts, and two new stock picks each month.

The company's chips are at the heart of the AI revolution, providing the computational horsepower that makes it all possible. This, in turn, has sent the stock soaring, up 215% over the past year. These gains led to Nvidia's high-profile 10-for-1 stock split, which was completed just last week.\n\nAfter the stock's epic run to a $3 trillion market cap, Wall Street is reevaluating Nvidia's future prospects. There's a new price target from one analyst that should be of particular interest to shareholders.\n\nRosenblatt Securities analyst Hans Mosesmann reiterated his buy rating on Nvidia stock and increased his price to $200. That represents potential upside for investors of 53% compared to Monday's closing price, and would push Nvidia's market cap within striking distance of $5 trillion. One aspect of Nvidia's business that's being overlooked by investors is the software side. \"The real narrative lies in the software that complements all the hardware goodness,\" the analyst wrote.\n\nHe went on to suggest that demand for software will increase over the course of \"the next decade in terms of overall sales mix.\"\n\nI think the analyst hit the nail on the head. Nvidia's edge lies not only in the hardware but also in the associated software that helps provide peak performance.

Its graphics processing units (GPUs), which crunch AI workloads, are best in class by a wide margin and have been used by practically every company interested in AI.\n\nBut are there any companies that could dethrone Nvidia?\n\nPart of the fear of investing in Nvidia is wondering what will happen if and when the music stops. Right now, the company is firing on all cylinders. But the question remains: What happens when enough GPUs have been purchased to satisfy AI demand?\n\nThere are some factors influencing the answer to that question, such as the average lifespan of a GPU used for server computing. That is estimated to be around three to five years, which would mean there will be a replacement cycle. But if the demand for Nvidia GPUs is met, then the next round of AI technology might look somewhat different.\n\nIf that happens, which company could take the spot atop the AI mountain? Some might point to Advanced Micro Devices as a potential successor. AMD competes directly with Nvidia in the data center GPU space but has been getting smoked.\n\nHowever, AMD has recently generated momentum with various cloud-computing providers starting to add its GPUs as an alternative. They don't want to be devoted solely to Nvidia hardware because that would give it too much pricing power over them. But because Nvidia still has much better technology, AMD will likely only be considered as an alternative.\n\nAnother candidate is Taiwan Semiconductor, (TSMC for short), the chip foundry that supplies Nvidia and thereby makes its products possible. But TSMC also supplies chips to AMD and other companies, which makes it a neutral factor in the AI investment race.\n\nBesides, TSMC expects massive growth driven by AI demand over the next few years. In its latest conference call, management said, \"For the next five years, we forecast [AI revenue] to grow at 50% [compound annual growth rate] and increase to higher than 20% of our revenue by 2028.\" That's strong growth, but it also means Nvidia could continue its dominance since it's a key customer for TSMC.\n\nBut all of the above is just the hardware side; what about application and use?\n\nMicrosoft and Alphabet are both massive customers for Nvidia's GPUs. Not only do they have internal uses for them, but they also buy them to power their respective cloud computing services.\n\nThey also started designing their own AI chips, so they don't have to buy them from Nvidia. However, these chips are highly workload-specific, so general-purpose GPUs like Nvidia's will still account for the lion's share of computing power.\n\nSoftware companies like Palantir are also bringing AI capabilities to the masses. Its clients still need plenty of computing power to run its models, and it gives them the tools to create them. This could make the company a potential successor to Nvidia as a leading AI investment, since it will continue to see demand for its platform long after AI computing capacity is built out.\n\nBut all roads lead back to Nvidia, which is why it has been and will continue to be the most popular AI investment. Nvidia is on top of the AI world right now, and there currently doesn't appear to be any company that can dethrone it.", "source": {"uri": "fool.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Motley Fool"}, "authors": [{"uri": "keithen_drury@fool.com", "name": "Keithen Drury", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AMD", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "AMD"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TSMC", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "TSMC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nvidia", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nvidia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphics_processing_unit", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Graphics processing unit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computing", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Computing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Server_(computing)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Server (computing)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semiconductor_fabrication_plant", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Semiconductor fabrication plant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_center", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Data center"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_computing", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cloud computing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alphabet_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Alphabet Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_industry", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Software industry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Hardware/Components", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Hardware/Components", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence/Publications", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence/Publications", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence/Games", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence/Games", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence/Philosophy", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence/Philosophy", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 55}], "image": "https://g.foolcdn.com/editorial/images/780009/nvidia-voyager-headquarters.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9658445", "eventUri": "eng-9658445", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.05882352941176472, "wgt": 147, "relevance": 1}

The impact was so major that Nvidia's hardware is now found in all Tesla vehicles.\n\nThe company was also able to use its dominant and advanced position on GPUs to steal a march on its rivals, producing its chips more quickly and in larger volumes.\n\nHowever, it was the company's early gamble with AI, such as through developing machine-learning features in its products, which propelled it to the top.\n\nMr Huang told Sky News' US partner NBC News in an interview last year: \"We just believed that someday something new would happen, and the rest of it requires some serendipity.\"\n\nWhen asked if the company's subsequent success with AI was the result of luck or prescience, he replied: \"It wasn't foresight. The foresight was accelerated computing.\"\n\nBryan Catanzaro, who began working on AI when he joined Nvidia in 2008, told NBC News: \"For 10 years, Wall Street asked Nvidia, 'Why are you making this investment? No one's using it'.\"\n\nFrom billions to trillions\n\nThe company's journey to the king of the stock market has not been without its stumbles.\n\nIn 2010 it made an unsuccessful attempt to muscle in on the smartphone market - with Mr Huang admitting that he has made \"a lot\" of mistakes over the years.\n\nBut by the time of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, firms began increasingly turning to AI - and Nvidia's bet started to pay off.\n\nAmong the firms using its technology was ChatGPT, which was soon followed by a rush of imitators.\n\nA Wall Street analyst told the New Yorker last year: \"There's a war going on out there in AI, and Nvidia is the only arms dealer.\"\n\nToday, seemingly every major company in Silicon Valley, including Amazon, Google, Meta and Microsoft, has made use of its chips, and it is estimated to control more than 80% of the market for the tech used in AI systems.\n\nNvidia's success has only accelerated in recent months. It hit a market valuation of $2tn in February and then overtook Apple for the number two spot earlier this month.\n\nIt finally climbed to the summit of the stock market on Tuesday after adding more than $100bn (\u00a379bn) to its market value in just one day.\n\nRead more on Sky News:\n\nMicroplastics found in penises for first time, researchers say\n\nMcDonald's ditches AI after order

Nvidia's products is currently outstripping supply, its top spot will likely continue to be threatened in the coming months and years as firms such as Microsoft invest heavily in AI in an attempt to catch up.", "source": {"uri": "news.sky.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sky News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nvidia", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label":

A 3.7% rise early in the day put the California-based company ahead of Microsoft, which remains a close second with a $3.33 trillion market capitalization.\n\nThe milestone came as Nvidia announced a partnership with Hewlett Packard, launching NVIDIA AI Computing and Private Cloud AI with the legacy tech firm.\n\n\"Generative AI and accelerated computing are fueling a fundamental transformation as every industry races to join the industrial revolution,\" NVIDIA CEO Jensen Huang said in a statement, saying the HP collaboration would \"equip enterprise clients and AI professionals with the most advanced computing infrastructure and services to expand the frontier of AI.\"\n\nIn January, Nvidia flipped Apple to take second place behind Windows developer Microsoft. In February, Nvidia reported $22.1 billion in revenue from the fourth quarter of 2023, which was 265% higher than the year before.\n\nFueling Nvidia's rise to the top was not only a profitable 2023 but a focus on serving the massive demand for computing power with optimized chips like the new Blackwell GPU, which the company announced in March, as well as projects with rival AI developers including Google, Meta, Microsoft, and OpenAI, using Nvidia technology.\n\nNvidia also highlighted advances it was making in the field of robotics.\n\n\"We are starting to do some really great work in the next generation of robotics,\" Huang said at the time. \"The next generation of robotics will likely be humanoid robotics, [and] we now have the necessary technology to imagine generalized human robotics.\"\n\nWith sci-fi inspired project names like Gr00t and Jetson Thor, the company said it was partnering with manufacturing and automotive companies.\n\n\"Everything that moves will be robotic, there's no question about that, it's safer, it's more convenient,\" Huang explained.", "source": {"uri": "decrypt.co", "dataType": "news", "title": "Decrypt"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jason_nelson@decrypt.co", "name": "Jason Nelson", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nvidia", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nvidia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computing", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Computing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_capitalization", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Market capitalization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yahoo!_Finance", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Yahoo!

The company's AI-centric chips are in high demand, fueling this meteoric growth. Nvidia's rapid climb from a $2 trillion to a $3 trillion market value took just 96 days, compared to the 945 and 1,044 days it took Microsoft and Apple, respectively. Historically, only 11 US companies have held the top market value spot since 1925, including Exxon Mobil and Microsoft. Nvidia's recent financial results are staggering: revenue tripled to $26 billion, and net income soared seven-fold to $14.9 billion. Projections show revenue doubling to $120 billion this fiscal year and rising another 33% by fiscal 2026. However, Nvidia's forward price-to-earnings ratio stands at 43, significantly higher than the S&P 500's 21, suggesting a moderated valuation despite the stock's surge.\n\nThe incredible demand for AI technologies is boosting not only Nvidia's stock but also other firms like Super Micro Computer and Arm Holdings. Investors should keep an eye on these rising stocks as the profit potential in AI continues to unfold. Nvidia's rise highlights a significant shift in market dynamics, underscoring the immense value and future potential of AI-centric technologies.\n\nThe bigger picture: AI-driven economic shifts.\n\nNvidia's ascent reflects broader economic trends and a pivotal shift toward AI technologies globally. This momentum suggests that AI could play a crucial role in future economic strategies and policies.

We're just at the beginning\" Nvidia Global Head of Business Development Chris Penrose commented as reported by BBC.\n\nHe opined that the company achieved the record valuation as a result of more than 30 years of dedicated work in the AI field.\n\nHowever, Analysts believe the meteoric rise was fueled by Nvidia's dominance of what they call the \"new gold or oil in the tech sector\" - the chips needed for artificial intelligence (AI).\n\nNvidia has reaped out well from the global boost in demand for chips that train and run generative AI models, the most well-known to be OpenAI's ChatGPT.\n\nThe firm has also benefitted significantly from a rush to mine Bitcoin in 2020, which saw a sharp uptick in sales of its graphics cards, according to BBC.\n\nMoreover, Nvidia's value has also come from its competition with rival AMD, in a race to make the best graphics cards. Eight years ago, the stock was worth less than 1% of its current price.\n\nThe rise and rise of the tech giant are also mirrored by the increasingly high profile of its leader, Jensen Huang.\n\nPeople have dubbed the 61-year-old electrical engineer the \"Taylor Swift of tech\" for the celebrity status he has achieved.", "source": {"uri": "dailymirror.lk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Mirror"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nvidia", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nvidia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "BBC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Generative artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_dollar", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States dollar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petroleum", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Petroleum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gold"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AMD", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "AMD"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ChatGPT", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "ChatGPT"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphics_card", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Graphics card"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenAI", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "OpenAI"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jensen_Huang", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jensen Huang"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_Swift", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Taylor Swift"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrical_engineering", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Electrical engineering"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitcoin", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bitcoin"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks_and_Bonds", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks and Bonds", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Economic", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Economic", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence/Publications", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence/Publications", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence/Games", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence/Games", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 55}], "image": "https://bmkltsly13vb.compat.objectstorage.ap-singapore-1.oraclecloud.com/cdn.sg.dailymirror.lk/assets/uploads/image_4378ee0c30.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9658445", "eventUri": "eng-9658445", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.388235294117647, "wgt": 145, "relevance": 1}

The Nasdaq-100 Technology Sector is up 32% in the past 12 months, outperforming the S&P 500's growth of 24% in that period. The rise brings to mind the old proverb, \"The best time to plant a tree was 20 years ago, but the second best time is now.\" The same sentiment applies to the stock market, especially tech stocks.\n\nThe tech industry has a reputation for delivering significant gains over the long term, benefiting from its innovative nature and consistent demand for upgraded products and software. Meanwhile, recent advances in markets such as artificial intelligence (AI), self-driving cars, and virtual/augmented (VR/AR) reality indicate the tech market is nowhere near hitting its ceiling. As a result, there's no time like the present to invest in tech.\n\nHere are two hypergrowth tech stocks to buy in 2024 and beyond.\n\nShares in Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) have hit record heights over the last year, rising 207% alongside soaring earnings. Stellar growth has seen the company become the first chipmaker to achieve a market cap above $3 trillion, making it the world's third most valuable company this year, only after Microsoft and Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL).\n\nNvidia's success comes down to its dominant position in AI graphics processing units (GPUs), the chips crucial to performing AI tasks and running AI platforms. While competitors such as Intel and Advanced Micro Devices prioritized central processing units (CPUs) in recent years, Nvidia's focus on GPUs gave it a head start in AI and perfectly positioned it to become the go-to chip supplier for AI developers worldwide.\n\nIn its most recent quarter, the first quarter of fiscal 2025, Nvidia's revenue increased by 262% year over year while operating income rose nearly 700%. The company enjoyed impressive growth in its data center segment, which posted revenue gains of 427%, illustrating a healthy boost to AI GPU sales.\n\nHowever, its diverse business model is the best reason to invest in this hypergrowth tech stock. In addition to AI chips, Nvidia has positions in consumer PCs, video games, self-driving cars, and more.\n\nIn Q1 2025, revenue in the company's automotive segment increased by 17% sequentially and 11% year over year. Nvidia CFO Colette Kress has expressed massive potential in automotive as advances in self-driving cars increase chip demand. On a recent earnings call, Kress said that she expects automotive to be the \"largest enterprise vertical\" within the data center segment in 2024.\n\nNvidia has delivered an impressive growth year but could have much more to offer investors as the tech market develops and the company continues to be a leading chipmaker. And with a price/earnings-to-growth ratio of less than 1, this hypergrowth tech stock is too good to pass up this year.\n\nShares of Apple are up 341% over the past five years, while annual revenue and operating income have soared 47% and 79%. The company has often been praised as one of the best growth stocks to invest in over the long term.\n\nHowever, Apple has been in a slump over the past 12 months. The company has a reputation for consistently outperforming the S&P 500. Yet while the renowned index has risen 24% since last June, Apple's stock price has increased by 16%. Investors have grown weary of Apple's products business after repeated sales declines.\n\nMeanwhile, the emergence of AI has highlighted the disparity in Apple's AI technology compared with some of its rivals. The iPhone giant isn't leading in the AI space today. However, recent developments and its Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC) on June 10 have made Wall Street bullish again.\n\nApple's stock jumped 10% after the conference, where the company debuted new AI services that could boost product sales in the coming months. At WWDC, the tech giant unveiled Apple Intelligence, a new AI platform that will bring generative updates across its product lineup. iPhone 15 Pro models, Apple Silicon Macs, and iPads equipped with M1 through M4 chips will give users access to Apple Intelligence, including features such as image and language generation, editing tools, an updated Siri, and much more.\n\nApple Intelligence could motivate millions of consumers to upgrade to the company's more recent devices, providing the boost that its product business needs to overcome recent headwinds.\n\nShares in Apple are trading at a premium, with its forward price-to-earnings ratio at 32. However, as the table shows, this figure is below the same metric for AI rivals Microsoft and Amazon, indicating that Apple's stock is a better value than both companies.\n\nApple also significantly outperforms both companies in free cash flow, which could mean it is better equipped to catch up with its competitors in AI and keep investing in its business. In addition to a solid growth history, Apple strikes me as a screaming buy in 2024 and beyond.\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Nvidia wasn't one of them.

As reported by Financial Times, Nvidia has transformed from a $300 billion company grappling with a chip surplus due to a cryptocurrency bust to a dominant force in the tech industry, with its products in high demand from other Silicon Valley giants.\n\nJensen Huang, Nvidia's CEO, describes this period as a new \"industrial revolution,\" where the power of generative AI is set to revolutionize the global economy through intelligent computing, according to Financial Times. Nvidia's cutting-edge technology has seen adoption by major players like Google, Microsoft, and Amazon, who have incorporated Nvidia's \"Hopper\" series of graphic processing units into their cloud services, as reported by Reuters.\n\nNvidia's financial performance has been nothing short of extraordinary. In February and May, the company reported revenue increases of 265% and 262% year-on-year, respectively, according to Financial Times. Its stock price has soared roughly 170% since the beginning of the year, driving about a third of the 14% year-to-date increase in the benchmark S&P 500 index, as noted by Reuters.\n\nDespite concerns about market sustainability, the enthusiasm surrounding Nvidia remains robust, as highlighted by Reuters. \"This is animal spirits now, it's human emotion taking over,\" said Ted Mortonson, a tech strategist at Baird, reflecting on the company's phenomenal rise. Nvidia's revenue for the latest quarter more than tripled to $26 billion, while net income surged seven-fold to $14.9 billion, as reported by Financial Times.\n\nThe company's future looks promising, with forecasts predicting revenue to roughly double to $120 billion in the current fiscal year and rise by another 33% to $160 billion by fiscal 2026, as noted by Reuters. Nvidia's forward price-to-earnings ratio stands at 43, higher than the S&P 500's 21 times earnings, indicating investor confidence in its continued growth, according to Financial Times.\n\nThe FT report also states the company must continue to innovate and fend off competition to maintain its stellar returns and solidify its position as the leader in the AI-driven future of technology.", "source": {"uri": "ibtimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "International Business Times"}, "authors": [{"uri": "litty_simon@ibtimes.com", "name": "Litty Simon", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nvidia", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nvidia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_Times", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Financial Times"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Generative artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ChatGPT", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "ChatGPT"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenAI", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "OpenAI"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock_market", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stock market"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_capitalization", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Market capitalization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology_company", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Technology company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jensen_Huang", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jensen Huang"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_(company)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Amazon (company)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptocurrency", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cryptocurrency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computing", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Computing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Industrial_Revolution", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Industrial Revolution"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_computing", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cloud computing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silicon_Valley", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Silicon Valley"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Google"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S&P_500_Index", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "S&P 500 Index"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benchmark_(computing)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Benchmark (computing)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sustainability", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sustainability"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Net_income", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Net income"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiscal_year", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fiscal year"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reuters", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Reuters"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Major_Companies", "label": "dmoz/Business/Major Companies", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/Information_Services", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/Information Services", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Major_Companies/Company_Information", "label": "dmoz/Business/Major Companies/Company Information", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Major_Companies/Company_Rankings", "label": "dmoz/Business/Major Companies/Company Rankings", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/Education_and_Training", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/Education and Training", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 74}], "image": "https://d.ibtimes.com/en/full/4527197/nvidia-says-nations-interested-building-their-own-sovereign-ai-are-among-customers-driving.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9658445", "eventUri": "eng-9658445", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3647058823529412, "wgt": 145, "relevance": 1}

That pushed the semiconductor bellwether past Microsoft and Apple, which had been jostling for the top spots in recent days.\n\nThe surge in Nvidia's market value has been driven by demand for its chips, which are the gold standard in the AI space. The company's shares are up more than 170% this year and have risen about 1,100% since their October 2022 low.\n\nBlockbuster earnings and broadening investor enthusiasm over AI are supercharging Nvidia's rally. That fervor has been reflected in Nvidia's market value, which took only 96 days to go from $2 trillion to $3 trillion.\n\nMicrosoft, one of the two other companies to reach those rarefied levels, took 945 days to go from $2 trillion to $3 trillion while Apple took 1,044 days to make the leap, according to Bespoke Investment Group.\n\nPreviously, just 11 U.S. companies since 1925 have reached the top spot in market value on a closing basis, according to Howard Silverblatt, senior index analyst at S&P Dow Jones Indices.\n\nFortunes have diverged for past holders of the top position in recent decades. Microsoft reached No. 1 in the late 1990s but then its shares struggled for years during the early 2000s following the dotcom bubble, only to come roaring back in the latter half of the last decade.\n\nExxon Mobil became the world's most valuable company in the 2000s but its shares retreated following a downturn in oil prices.\n\nTo some, Cisco is the cautionary tale. The company's shares peaked at over $80 in March 2000 in the midst of the dotcom boom, during which investors often assigned dizzying valuations to internet-related companies.\n\nBespoke's analysts recently contrasted the trajectories of Nvidia and Cisco, whose products were seen as essential in supporting the internet's infrastructure.\n\n\"NVDA's run has been incredible, but it will need to keep growing from here and stave off competition if its stock is going to keep putting up stellar returns,\" Bespoke said in a recent note.\n\nFor now, Nvidia's earnings are supporting its stock price. Revenue more than tripled to $26 billion in the latest quarter, while net income jumped seven-fold to $14.9 billion.\n\nRevenue for the current fiscal year is expected to roughly double to $120 billion, and then rise another 33% in fiscal 2026, to $160 billion, according to LSEG data.\n\nNvidia's impressive financial performance and forecasts have led its stock valuation, by some measures, to moderate despite the surge in its share price.\n\nFor example, Nvidia's forward price-to-earnings ratio last stood at 43, according to LSEG Datastream. That is higher than the 25 level it stood at to start the year but below levels it reached for much of last year. By contrast, the S&P 500 trades at 21 times earnings.\n\nWhile Nvidia has been the standout performer, it is not the only stock to benefit from enthusiasm about the profit potential for AI.

Nvidia is riding the wave of a more specific tech surge, this time in artificial intelligence.\n\nNvidia's chips are helping to develop AI, which proponents expect to change the world as much or more than the internet, and demand for its chips has proven to be shockingly voracious. Nvidia's revenue routinely triples every quarter, and its profit is rocketing at even more breathtaking rates. Its stock is up nearly 174% this year, and Nvidia alone was responsible for nearly a third of the S&P 500's entire gain for the year through May.\n\nOf course, a potential danger of having a handful of superstars responsible for most of the U.S. stock market's run to records is a more fragile market. If more stocks were participating, it could be a signal of a healthier market.\n\nStocks broadly got some lift Tuesday from easing yields in the bond market. Treasury yields fell after a report showed sales at U.S. retailers returned to growth last month but remained below economists' expectations.\n\nRelated Stories:\n\nMicrosoft and Google will help rural hospitals fight against cyberattacks\n\nMicrosoft report shows employees are using AI in the workplace at large", "source": {"uri": "10news.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "KGTV"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nvidia", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nvidia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S&P_500_Index", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "S&P 500 Index"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wall_Street", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Wall Street"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nasdaq", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nasdaq"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dow_Jones_Industrial_Average", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dow Jones Industrial Average"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santa_Clara,_California", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Santa Clara, California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Santa Clara, California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Tech", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Big Tech"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philip_Morris_International", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Philip Morris International"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ExxonMobil", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "ExxonMobil"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_value", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Market value"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Stock_Exchange", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "New York Stock Exchange"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_the_Treasury", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of the Treasury"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Internet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Google"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Stock"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks_and_Bonds", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks and Bonds", "wgt": 26}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Research_and_Analysis", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Research and Analysis", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Marketing_and_Advertising/Consulting", "label": "dmoz/Business/Marketing and Advertising/Consulting", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Education_and_Training", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Education and Training", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 84}], "image": "https://ewscripps.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/1bfbccf/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3000x1575+0+213/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fewscripps.brightspotcdn.com%2Fde%2F62%2Fab7b10b64051bfd3d1d1d625c9a7%2Fap24157697457284.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9658445", "eventUri": "eng-9658445", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2627450980392156, "wgt": 142, "relevance": 1}

Is It a Buy Around $130?", "body": "One of the big debates among Wall Street followers lately has been just how far Nvidia (NVDA 3.51%) stock can run. A new report from one analyst leads the charge on how high shares will go.\n\nSusquehanna senior semiconductor analyst Chris Rolland just raised his firm's price target from $145 to $160 per share. That would represent a gain of more than 20% from recent levels to a market cap of $3.94 trillion. The question for investors is how bold an outlook seems reasonable for Nvidia.\n\nIt's all about the software\n\nNvidia shares have soared by nearly 600% since January 2023, thanks to insatiable demand for its graphics processing units (GPUs). Customers can't get enough of those industry-leading processors, which they require to meet the massive computing power needs of artificial intelligence (AI) applications. Nvidia already has its next-generation chips in production, and henceforth plans to introduce new versions every year.\n\nNvidia also plans to integrate software to give customers more end-to-end solutions for data center servers. Rolland thinks that software will be a key factor that drives Nvidia's share price to his Street-high estimate.\n\nNvidia's CUDA (Compute Unified Device Architecture) toolkit allows users to develop, enhance, and deploy applications on multiple types of GPU-accelerated embedded systems. Rolland said that CUDA is \"the operating system for large language model processing and/or training as of right now.\"\n\nAggressive investing math\n\nIt makes sense to focus on software and other products beyond GPUs as potential drivers of Nvidia's future gains. After all, while demand outpaces supply for chips, production capacity remains a limitation on how much revenue Nvidia can generate from its hardware. Competition is also likely to chip away at market share.\n\nBut Rolland's valuation still appears a bit aggressive. He based that target on the stock being valued at a ratio of 51.5 times his 2025 forecast for adjusted earnings per share. I don't doubt Nvidia will keep growing its top and bottom lines. However, while it's a stock worth owning for the long term, it might not get that valuation as soon as next year.", "source": {"uri": "fool.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Motley Fool"}, "authors": [{"uri": "howard_smith@fool.com", "name": "Howard Smith", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nvidia", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nvidia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wall_Street", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Wall Street"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphics_processing_unit", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Graphics processing unit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Software"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CUDA", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "CUDA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semiconductor", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Semiconductor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_capitalization", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Market capitalization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computing", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Computing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_center", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Data center"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Server_(computing)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Server (computing)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embedded_system", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Embedded system"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valuation_(finance)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Valuation (finance)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operating_system", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Operating system"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_share", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Market share"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks_and_Bonds", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks and Bonds", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Research_and_Analysis", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Research and Analysis", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Companies", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Companies", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Hardware/Components", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Hardware/Components", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 76}], "image": "https://g.foolcdn.com/image/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fg.foolcdn.com%2Feditorial%2Fimages%2F780808%2Fnvidia-gh200-grace-hopper-powered-supercomputer.jpg&op=resize&w=400&h=400", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9658445", "eventUri": "eng-9658445", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2549019607843137, "wgt": 140, "relevance": 1}

S. Circuit Court of Appeals reinstanced a class action lawsuit filed by shareholders against Nvidia and its CEO, Jensen Huang.\n\nThe legal proceeding was filed by the Swedish investment management company E. Ohman J Fonder AB and asks for an undisclosed amount of money damages.\n\nNvidia and its top executives, consequently, are accused of issuing false statements in 2017 and 2018 regarding the significance of cryptocurrency-related sales in the company's revenue.\n\nThe case was launched back in 2018 with the main allegation of Nvidia violating the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The plaintiffs alleged that Nvidia did not provide accurate information about the percentage of its revenue that came from cryptomining, a process that involves the use of GPUs to solve mathematical problems in the mining of digital currencies such as Bitcoin.\n\nThis alleged omission concealed the fact that cryptomining had a negative and significant effect on Nvidia's business from investors and analysts.\n\nThe lower court had however rejected the case in 2021, but the 9th Circuit in a 2-1 decision decided in the latter half of 2021 that the lawsuit can go forward, because the plaintiffs plausibly alleged that Nvidia made \"false or misleading statements knowingly or recklessly. \"\n\nNvidia has posited that the 9th Circuit's decision can result in \"abusive and speculative litigation\", this is why the company has called on the Supreme Court to get involved. In the year 2022, Nvidia was charged by the U.S. authorities, and the company resolved to pay $5. 5 million for not adequately disclosing the effect of cryptomining on its gaming unit. This settlement however did not stop the shareholder lawsuit from continuing to the next level.\n\nIn addition, the justices have also consented to hear another such case concerning Meta Platforms Inc. where the shareholders of the social media company have alleged that the company misled the investors about the abuse of users' data.\n\nEarlier this month, US regulators opened an investigation into Nvidia alongside Microsoft and OpenAI on possible antitrust issues in the AI market.

The company's expansion into cloud services and new hardware has Nvidia competing with its own clients. And Nvidia clients like Amazon want chips so badly they're helping it compete, per The Information.\n\nNvidia knows its customers are desperate to get their hands on its GPUs, and the company is using that to its advantage.\n\nEven Amazon is bowing down, according to a new report from The Information.\n\nThough demand for Nvidia's GPUs -- the all-powerful chips fueling artificial intelligence -- is still high, the greatest existential threat to the company is if demand slows down. So, to keep itself at the top of the game, Nvidia has diversified its business into the world of cloud service software and rentals.\n\nLast year, Nvidia started its cloud service, DGX Cloud, a competitor to some of Nvidia's own customers, including Microsoft and Amazon Web Services. DGX Cloud rents Nvidia-powered servers from within AWS's data centers and then, promising greater computing capability, leases them back to Nvidia's customers, The Information reported.\n\nAt first, AWS was hesitant to allow Nvidia to set up a competing shop right under its nose, according to The Information. But once other rival companies agreed to the terms of DGX Cloud, AWS had no choice but to relent -- it just couldn't risk souring its relationship with the supplier of its crucial chips, per the outlet.\n\nAn Amazon spokesperson told The Information the suggestion that AWS was concerned about upsetting Nvidia was \"speculative and incorrect.\"\n\nWhen contacted by Business Insider, the spokesperson said Amazon worked closely with Nvidia to develop features in the DGX Cloud offering that offered customers \"the best of both companies.\"\n\n\"We have a deep collaboration with Nvidia that goes back more than 13 years, when together we launched the world's first GPU cloud instance on AWS, and today we offer the widest range of Nvidia GPU solutions for customers,\" Amazon's spokesperson told BI.\n\nThrough DGX Cloud, Nvidia has creatively maneuvered itself into a position where its own customers are helping it compete with them. But CEO Jensen Huang's aggressive strategy to maintain dominance doesn't stop there, per The Information. Nvidia is also requiring customers to build out more space to house the GPUs they buy -- and telling them how to do it.\n\n\"Nvidia will not ship GPUs unless the customer can certify that they have data center capacity in which to place those GPUs,\" Raul Martynek, who works with cloud providers as the CEO of DataBank, told The Information.\n\nThe titan chipmaker, in addition to demanding its clients provide proof of their expanded data center capacity, is also telling customers how to design the racks that hold the servers and GPUs within those data centers, the outlet reported.\n\nAnd because the racks are specifically designed to fit Nvidia chips, it could make it difficult for the customer to switch to chips from competing companies without incurring tremendous costs.\n\nFor now, Nvidia and its clients like Amazon have agreed to continue their somewhat symbiotic relationship, but that hasn't stopped competition from brewing on both sides. While Nvidia has expanded into cloud services, AWS is also developing its own AI chips, called Trainium and Inferentia, which aim to compete with Nvidia's.\n\nThough its current strategy is clever enough to have propelled Nvidia to become the world's most valuable company, the company's quest for industry dominance could come back to bite it. The Department of Justice is looking to launch an investigation into potential antitrust violations, Politico reported earlier this month.\n\nThe feds are preparing to investigate whether Nvidia came to become the leading supplier of high-end semiconductors through anticompetitive behavior, per Politico.\n\nA spokesperson for Nvidia declined to comment when reached by Business Insider.\n\nRead the original article on Business Insider", "source": {"uri": "businessinsider.nl", "dataType": "news", "title": "Business Insider Nederland"}, "authors": [{"uri": "grace_eliza_goodwin@businessinsider.nl", "name": "Grace Eliza Goodwin", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "katherine_tangalakis_lippert@businessinsider.nl", "name": "Katherine Tangalakis-Lippert", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_(company)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Amazon (company)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_Web_Services", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Amazon Web Services"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nvidia", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nvidia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_computing", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cloud computing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphics_processing_unit", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Graphics processing unit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_center", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Data center"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Server_(computing)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Server (computing)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Software"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jensen_Huang", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jensen Huang"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computing", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Computing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-competitive_practices", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Anti-competitive practices"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politico", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Politico"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_Insider", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Business Insider"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semiconductor", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Semiconductor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Competition_law", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Competition law"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Justice", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of Justice"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Business_Services/Customer_Management", "label": "dmoz/Business/Business Services/Customer Management", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Customer_Service", "label": "dmoz/Business/Customer Service", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Marketing_and_Advertising/Relationship_Marketing", "label": "dmoz/Business/Marketing and Advertising/Relationship Marketing", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Customer_Service/Software", "label": "dmoz/Business/Customer Service/Software", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Customer_Service/Consulting", "label": "dmoz/Business/Customer Service/Consulting", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 65}], "image": "https://cdn.businessinsider.nl/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/66720666a76074d191cd31e8-scaled.jpg?ver=1718766083", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9658445", "eventUri": "eng-9658445", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2, "wgt": 138, "relevance": 1}

Should You? | The Motley Fool", "body": "When a company's executives and board members sell their shares, it can raise concerns. But Nvidia's insider sales don't appear to be worrisome.\n\nWhen key insiders buy shares of their company, they're probably confident about its future. Sure, that confidence could be misplaced. However, most investors see insider buying as a positive sign.\n\nBut it can be a much different story when key insiders sell shares. In some cases, such moves could hint that they aren't optimistic about the stock's future -- at least over the near term.\n\nThat leads me to Nvidia (NVDA 1.75%). The stock has been on a roll, skyrocketing more than seven times over the last three years and soaring more than 160% so far in 2024. However, Insiders are selling their shares of Nvidia. Should you?\n\nSince the beginning of May, 10 Form 144 filings have been reported by Nvidia to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). There are two important things to know about Form 144. First, it's a notice of the proposed sale of securities. Second, it's only used when there's a planned sale of 5,000 or more shares or an aggregate amount of over $50,000.\n\nThe most prominent person selling Nvidia stock is the company's CEO, Jensen Huang. Nvidia notified the SEC that Huang planned to sell 120,000 shares on June 13, 2024. At the market close on that date, this transaction would have been worth around $15.5 million.\n\nHuang wasn't the only Nvidia executive selling shares. Executive vice president of operations Deborah Shoquist sold 41,140 shares worth more than $45 million on June 3, 2024.\n\nSeveral members of Nvidia's board of directors also got in on the action. Dawn Hudson sold a total of 25,000 shares on three separate occasions since May 29, 2024. Board members Tench Coxe, John Dabiri, Michael McCaffery, Brooke Seawell, and Mark Stevens also sold some of their Nvidia shares in recent weeks.\n\nThese insider sales could be alarming to some investors. To use an old saying: Are the rats fleeing a sinking ship? Nope. There's more to the story.\n\nThe shares Huang sold were part of his executive compensation package. Specifically, they were restricted stock units (RSU) and performance stock units (PSU). Company CEOs frequently sell such shares when they're allowed to do so.\n\nImportantly, Huang owned nearly 93.5 million shares of Nvidia as of March 25, 2024. That's almost 3.8% of the company's outstanding shares. His recent sales were only a drop in the bucket compared to his total holdings. Huang still has plenty of skin in the game.\n\nMost of the other sales (including the ones by Shoquist and several board members) were also of restricted stock units. Investors shouldn't be too concerned about these transactions.\n\nI don't think the recent insider sales of Nvidia are a reason for outsiders to sell the stock. However, there could be some reasons for you to consider selling.\n\nNvidia's jaw-dropping gains might have caused the stock to make up a worrisome percentage of your overall portfolio. Some investors might want to trim their positions as a result.\n\nMy colleague Sean Williams predicts that Nvidia stock is poised to plunge by at least 50%. If you agree with his rationale, selling soon makes sense.\n\nHowever, Nvidia's underlying business remains strong. The company continues to execute exceptionally well. The demand for its graphics processing units isn't waning. Those are great reasons to hang on to a stock.", "source": {"uri": "fool.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Motley Fool"}, "authors": [{"uri": "keith_speights@fool.com", "name": "Keith Speights", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nvidia", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nvidia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._Securities_and_Exchange_Commission", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Dabiri", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "John Dabiri"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jensen_Huang", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jensen Huang"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hudson_River", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hudson River"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_president", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Vice president"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Board_of_directors", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Board of directors"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Restricted_stock", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Restricted stock"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security_(finance)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Security (finance)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pennsylvania_State_University", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pennsylvania State University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shares_outstanding", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Shares outstanding"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphics_processing_unit", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Graphics processing unit"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks_and_Bonds", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks and Bonds", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Research_and_Analysis", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Research and Analysis", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Games", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Games", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work/Job_Sharing", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work/Job Sharing", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 77}], "image": "https://g.foolcdn.com/editorial/images/780563/nvidia-headquarters-with-nvidia-sign-in-front.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9658445", "eventUri": "eng-9658445", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2010-05-", "textStart": 797, "textEnd": 804}, {"amb": false, "date": "2013-06-", "textStart": 1285, "textEnd": 1292}], "sentiment": 0.2156862745098038, "wgt": 137, "relevance": 1}

This price makes the company at the center of the AI boom more valuable than Microsoft.\n\nThe end-of-day share price on Tuesday means the market now values the company at $3.34tn. They also overtook Apple earlier in the month.\n\nFounded in 1993, Nvidia is an American-based company that makes computer chips for all sorts of applications but latterly has been central in providing the chips needed for artificial intelligence (AI) software. As the rise in AI products has taken place over the last few years, so has the demand for chips.\n\nIt's the modern embodiment of the classic adage of 'during a gold rush, sell pickaxes'. While hundreds of start-ups have launched into the red-hot AI sector, Nvidia has confidently secured its place as the main supplier of the core components that power AI.\n\nWhile the use of AI will likely continue to accelerate due to the adoption of the technology by numerous industries, competition is starting to intensify.\n\nMicrosoft, Google-owned Alphabet, Meta, and Apple are all vying to dominate the space.\n\nNvidia was created by three Silicon Valley engineers who focused on the computing behind video games. They created a chip called a graphics card, otherwise known as a GPU (graphics processing unit) which helped 3D visuals come to life on the screen.\n\nThis niche direction led to huge success in the video game industry, but 2006 was the start of a turning point.\n\nThey released a programming language called CUDA which brought more possibilities to the graphics cards, enabling them to do more within general computing processes.\n\nThe chip was particularly great for machine learning and its entrance into cloud computing came at a time when data centers were popping up worldwide. It was the same year Amazon launched their cloud computing business too.\n\nNvidia still works within gaming today, but its other markets include professional visualization, data centers, and automotives. Its chips are in cryptocurrency mining, self-driving cars, and are used in the training of AI models.", "source": {"uri": "readwrite.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ReadWrite"}, "authors": [{"uri": "sophie_atkinson@readwrite.com", "name": "Sophie Atkinson", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nvidia", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nvidia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visualization_(graphics)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Visualization (graphics)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_center", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Data center"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computing", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Computing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Startup_company", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Startup company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphics_processing_unit", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Graphics processing unit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_circuit", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Integrated circuit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Software"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta_Platforms", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Meta Platforms"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphics_card", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Graphics card"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-driving_car", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Self-driving car"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alphabet_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Alphabet Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_(company)", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Amazon (company)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CUDA", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "CUDA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptocurrency", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cryptocurrency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_game_industry", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Video game industry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stereoscopy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Stereoscopy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programming_language", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Programming language"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Machine learning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_computing", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cloud computing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_game", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Video game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silicon_Valley", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Silicon Valley"}, "location": null}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Hardware/Components", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Hardware/Components", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence/Publications", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence/Publications", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence/Games", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence/Games", "wgt": 28}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence/Philosophy", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence/Philosophy", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 60}], "image": "https://readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/ktlR0TzIQNe8vIOKLYD2BQ.jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9658445", "eventUri": "eng-9658445", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-18", "textStart": 370, "textEnd": 377}], "sentiment": 0.3803921568627451, "wgt": 137, "relevance": 1}

The company can potentially impact several other tech companies and the stock market as a whole. Nvidia recently announced a 10-for-1 stock split to make it easier for investors to own the stock. Once trading at $1,200, the stock is now available for $131. However, besides the artificial intelligence leader, there are several other AI stocks to buy that could benefit from the AI boom and the stock split.\n\nThe broader sentiment towards the AI industry is bullish. These companies are already seeing their stocks rally with each quarterly result, and now is the time to load up on them if you want to enjoy more upside. Let's take a look at the three AI stocks worth buying after Nvidia's stock split.\n\nCloud service provider Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) is one of the fastest-moving stocks. Up 32% year-to-date, the stock is exchanging hands for $138. It is one of the top AI stocks to own amid the Nvidia stock split.\n\nOnce popular for database management, Oracle is now expanding its cloud business and has seen an impressive demand. Its cloud infrastructure revenue hit $2 billion, up 42% year-over-year in the recent quarter and the outstanding performance obligations soared 44% and stood at $98 billion. This shows the company's strength amid the rising competition.\n\nThe company is attracting customers and has had two exceptional quarters. It is signing new contracts rapidly and is currently rallying on the deal with OpenAI. The company will run AI workloads on Oracle cloud infrastructure and has another multi-cloud deal with Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) as well. These two deals could be a game-changer for the business.\n\nThe stock has already picked momentum and has had an excellent 2024 . I believe Oracle will end the year on a high note, and it has a buy rating from Wall Street with a price target of $145.\n\nBuying ORCL stock looks like a good deal right now.\n\nSuper Micro Computer (NASDAQ:SMCI) is the one stock that soars whenever Nvidia does. If you believe that the AI race will last longer, load up on SMCI stock. The stock is trading at $844 today, up 195% YTD. It is also down from the 52-week high of $1,229.\n\nThe company designs and makes high-performance servers for AI and machine learning devices. Running the latest chips requires the right hardware infrastructure, and Super Micro Computer leads the industry here.\n\nIt ensures that there is everything to achieve the right balance between the software and hardware components. It has seen explosive growth due to the high AI demand and works with Nvidia to build GPU server systems. The company is expanding its manufacturing capabilities at its global facilities, including California, Taiwan, and Malaysia.\n\nSuper Micro Computer reported an impressive quarter. Revenue jumped 200% to $3.9 billion, and EPS jumped 308% to $6.65. There is a lot more upside from the current level as companies and governments are investing heavily in AI. Management is aiming for revenue in the range of $5.1 billion to $5.5 billion for the quarter.\n\nThe company could also follow Nvidia's steps and announce a stock split. Nevertheless, SMCI is one of the best AI stocks to buy, whether it goes for a split or not.\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor (NYSE:TSM) is closely associated with Nvidia and benefits whenever Nvidia soars. Due to its partnership with the company, TSM has seen its value rise over the past year. It is up 55% YTD and is exchanging hands for $921. It manufactures chips for Nvidia and has become a huge asset to its business. As the demand for Nvidia chips soars, TSM will continue rallying.\n\nThe company has taken the necessary steps to ensure high client satisfaction and has improved the nanometer size of the chips, going from seven to two nanometers over the past few years. It is known for innovation, timeliness, and high quality. The company has seen its market cap swell and is on its way to an exceptional year.\n\nIt reported a 30% jump in the monthly revenue for May, and most of its revenue comes from chips designed using 3nm, 5nm, and 7nm nodes. Sales of these chips are expected to soar throughout 2024, and TSM will manage to beat expectations in the upcoming quarterly results.

So, to keep itself at the top of the game, Nvidia has diversified its business into the world of cloud service software and rentals.\n\nLast year, Nvidia started its cloud service, DGX Cloud, a competitor to some of Nvidia's own customers, including Microsoft and Amazon Web Services. DGX Cloud rents Nvidia-powered servers from within AWS's data centers and then, promising greater computing capability, leases them back to Nvidia's customers, The Information reported.\n\nAt first, AWS was hesitant to allow Nvidia to set up a competing shop right under its nose, according to The Information. But once other rival companies agreed to the terms of DGX Cloud, AWS had no choice but to relent -- it just couldn't risk souring its relationship with the supplier of its crucial chips, per the outlet.\n\nAn Amazon spokesperson told The Information the suggestion that AWS was concerned about upsetting Nvidia was \"speculative and incorrect.\"\n\nWhen contacted by Business Insider, the spokesperson said Amazon worked closely with Nvidia to develop features in the DGX Cloud offering that offered customers \"the best of both companies.\"\n\n\"We have a deep collaboration with Nvidia that goes back more than 13 years, when together we launched the world's first GPU cloud instance on AWS, and today we offer the widest range of Nvidia GPU solutions for customers,\" Amazon's spokesperson told BI.\n\nThrough DGX Cloud, Nvidia has creatively maneuvered itself into a position where its own customers are helping it compete with them. But CEO Jensen Huang's aggressive strategy to maintain dominance doesn't stop there, per The Information. Nvidia is also requiring customers to build out more space to house the GPUs they buy -- and telling them how to do it.\n\n\"Nvidia will not ship GPUs unless the customer can certify that they have data center capacity in which to place those GPUs,\" Raul Martynek, who works with cloud providers as the CEO of DataBank, told The Information.\n\nThe titan chipmaker, in addition to demanding its clients provide proof of their expanded data center capacity, is also telling customers how to design the racks that hold the servers and GPUs within those data centers, the outlet reported.\n\nAnd because the racks are specifically designed to fit Nvidia chips, it could make it difficult for the customer to switch to chips from competing companies without incurring tremendous costs.\n\nFor now, Nvidia and its clients like Amazon have agreed to continue their somewhat symbiotic relationship, but that hasn't stopped competition from brewing on both sides. While Nvidia has expanded into cloud services, AWS is also developing its own AI chips, called Trainium and Inferentia, which aim to compete with Nvidia's.\n\nThough its current strategy is clever enough to have propelled Nvidia to become the world's most valuable company, the company's quest for industry dominance could come back to bite it. The Department of Justice is looking to launch an investigation into potential antitrust violations, Politico reported earlier this month.\n\nThe feds are preparing to investigate whether Nvidia came to become the leading supplier of high-end semiconductors through anticompetitive behavior, per Politico.\n\nA spokesperson for Nvidia declined to comment when reached by Business Insider.", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_(company)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Amazon (company)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_Web_Services", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Amazon Web Services"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nvidia", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nvidia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_computing", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cloud computing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphics_processing_unit", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Graphics processing unit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_center", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Data center"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computing", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Computing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Server_(computing)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Server (computing)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Software"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jensen_Huang", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jensen Huang"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_Insider", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Business Insider"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-competitive_practices", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Anti-competitive practices"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politico", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Politico"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semiconductor", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Semiconductor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Competition_law", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Competition law"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Justice", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of Justice"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Business_Services/Customer_Management", "label": "dmoz/Business/Business Services/Customer Management", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Customer_Service", "label": "dmoz/Business/Customer Service", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Customer_Service/Education_and_Training", "label": "dmoz/Business/Customer Service/Education and Training", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Customer_Service/Software", "label": "dmoz/Business/Customer Service/Software", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Customer_Service/Consulting", "label": "dmoz/Business/Customer Service/Consulting", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 65}], "image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/d40rzMHVUsRYGSyUTLhqTw--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD05MDA7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/business_insider_articles_888/1e4331f6fc6ffdace6987eb2b28e38ea", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9658445", "eventUri": "eng-9658445", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.192156862745098, "wgt": 135, "relevance": 1}

The company's advanced graphics processing units (GPUs) have become the go-to hardware for powering AI applications, from self-driving cars to natural language processing.\n\nWhile many investors have recognized Nvidia's potential in the AI space, there is one underappreciated reason why the stock is a table-pounding buy: its role as a hedge against the uncertainty created by AI.\n\nAs AI continues to advance at an unprecedented pace, it has the potential to disrupt virtually every industry and transform the global economy. However, this disruptive potential also comes with significant risks.\n\nAI-driven automation could lead to widespread job displacement, exacerbating income inequality and social unrest. Additionally, the increasing reliance on AI systems in critical areas such as finance, healthcare, and transportation could make society more vulnerable to catastrophic failures or cyberattacks.\n\nOne specific example of AI's disruptive potential is in the finance industry. AI-powered algorithmic trading and robo-advisors are already transforming the way financial markets operate, with the potential to increase volatility and systemic risk.\n\nIn 2010, the \"flash crash\", sparked by a rogue algorithm, caused the Dow Jones to drop by nearly 1,000 points in a matter of minutes, demonstrating the enormous risk presented by AI-driven financial markets.\n\nAnother industry facing significant disruption from AI is legacy automobile manufacturers. As self-driving cars become a reality, traditional automakers are racing to keep up with tech giants like Google and Tesla. The shift toward autonomous vehicles could render millions of jobs obsolete, from truck drivers to car salesmen, creating significant economic and social challenges.\n\nThe insurance industry is also grappling with the risks posed by AI. As AI systems become more sophisticated, they may be able to accurately predict an individual's likelihood of filing a claim, leading to more granular risk assessments and personalized premiums.\n\nThis could create a more efficient insurance market, but it also raises concerns about privacy and fairness, particularly for vulnerable populations. Car insurance may also become a relict of the past, thanks to the advent of self-driving vehicles.\n\nAmid the uncertainty created by the rapid advancement of AI, Nvidia scans as a unique investment opportunity. As the world's leading provider of AI hardware, Nvidia is in the catbird seat to benefit from the continued growth and adoption of AI across various industries.\n\nHowever, investors often overlook the company's role as a hedge against the potential risks associated with this transformative technology, thanks to its mesmerizing growth potential.\n\nThe crux of the issue lies in the inversion of perspective. While it is true that Nvidia is an exceptional growth vehicle, propelled by the ongoing AI superbuild that spans the globe, the chipmaker's shares also serve as a crucial hedge against the systemic risks posed by this groundbreaking technology.\n\nThe reality is that many legacy companies will struggle to adapt to this new paradigm, leading to significant economic volatility in the coming years. As the chipmaker powering this revolution, Nvidia emerges as one of the most compelling hedges against this impending period, known as \"the transition\" in academic circles.\n\nInvesting in Nvidia not only offers the potential for substantial returns but also provides a measure of protection against the uncertainties that arise as AI reshapes industries and economies worldwide. Nvidia's dual role as a growth driver and a risk mitigator can aid investors in navigating the coming AI storm.\n\nThe disruptive potential of AI presents significant challenges and risks for the global economy, but it also creates unique investment opportunities. Nvidia, the world's leading provider of AI hardware, emerges as a compelling investment choice in this uncertain landscape.\n\nBy owning Nvidia shares, investors can not only benefit from the continued growth and adoption of AI but also hedge against the unprecedented systemwide risks posed by this transformative technology. Nvidia's position at the forefront of the AI revolution makes it an attractive option for investors seeking to capitalize on the potential of AI while mitigating the associated risks.\n\nFor investors looking to diversify their AI exposure, an alternative strategy is to invest in an exchange-traded fund (ETF) that holds Nvidia shares along with a basket of other AI-centric stocks. ETFs offer the added benefit of diversification, which can enhance a portfolio's margin of safety.\n\nAs the AI landscape continues to evolve, investors who adapt their strategies to include Nvidia or AI-focused ETFs may be better positioned to weather these forthcoming challenges and capitalize on the mind-boggling opportunities presented by the so-called 'fourth industrial revolution'.\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Nvidia wasn't one of them.

Justin Sullivan via Getty Images\n\nNvidia knows its customers are desperate to get their hands on its GPUs, and the company is using that to its advantage.\n\nEven Amazon is bowing down, according to a new report from The Information.\n\nThough demand for Nvidia's GPUs -- the all-powerful chips fueling artificial intelligence -- is still high, the greatest existential threat to the company is if demand slows down. So, to keep itself at the top of the game, Nvidia has diversified its business into the world of cloud service software and rentals.\n\nLast year, Nvidia started its cloud service, DGX Cloud, a competitor to some of Nvidia's own customers, including Microsoft and Amazon Web Services. DGX Cloud rents Nvidia-powered servers from within AWS's data centers and then, promising greater computing capability, leases them back to Nvidia's customers, The Information reported.\n\nAt first, AWS was hesitant to allow Nvidia to set up a competing shop right under its nose, according to The Information. But once other rival companies agreed to the terms of DGX Cloud, AWS had no choice but to relent -- it just couldn't risk souring its relationship with the supplier of its crucial chips, per the outlet.\n\nAn Amazon spokesperson told The Information the suggestion that AWS was concerned about upsetting Nvidia was \"speculative and incorrect.\"\n\nWhen contacted by Business Insider, the spokesperson said Amazon worked closely with Nvidia to develop features in the DGX Cloud offering that offered customers \"the best of both companies.\"\n\n\"We have a deep collaboration with Nvidia that goes back more than 13 years, when together we launched the world's first GPU cloud instance on AWS, and today we offer the widest range of Nvidia GPU solutions for customers,\" Amazon's spokesperson told BI.\n\nThrough DGX Cloud, Nvidia has creatively maneuvered itself into a position where its own customers are helping it compete with them. But CEO Jensen Huang's aggressive strategy to maintain dominance doesn't stop there, per The Information. Nvidia is also requiring customers to build out more space to house the GPUs they buy -- and telling them how to do it.\n\n\"Nvidia will not ship GPUs unless the customer can certify that they have data center capacity in which to place those GPUs,\" Raul Martynek, who works with cloud providers as the CEO of DataBank, told The Information.\n\nThe titan chipmaker, in addition to demanding its clients provide proof of their expanded data center capacity, is also telling customers how to design the racks that hold the servers and GPUs within those data centers, the outlet reported.\n\nAnd because the racks are specifically designed to fit Nvidia chips, it could make it difficult for the customer to switch to chips from competing companies without incurring tremendous costs.\n\nFor now, Nvidia and its clients like Amazon have agreed to continue their somewhat symbiotic relationship, but that hasn't stopped competition from brewing on both sides. While Nvidia has expanded into cloud services, AWS is also developing its own AI chips, called Trainium and Inferentia, which aim to compete with Nvidia's.\n\nThough its current strategy is clever enough to have propelled Nvidia to become the world's most valuable company, the company's quest for industry dominance could come back to bite it. The Department of Justice is looking to launch an investigation into potential antitrust violations, Politico reported earlier this month.\n\nThe feds are preparing to investigate whether Nvidia came to become the leading supplier of high-end semiconductors through anticompetitive behavior, per Politico.\n\nA spokesperson for Nvidia declined to comment when reached by Business Insider.", "source": {"uri": "businessinsider.in", "dataType": "news", "title": "Business Insider India"}, "authors": [{"uri": "katherine_tangalakis_lippert@businessinsider.in", "name": "Katherine Tangalakis-Lippert", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "grace_eliza_goodwin@businessinsider.in", "name": "Grace Eliza Goodwin", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_(company)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Amazon (company)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_Web_Services", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Amazon Web Services"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nvidia", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nvidia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_computing", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cloud computing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphics_processing_unit", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Graphics processing unit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_Insider", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Business Insider"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_center", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Data center"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Server_(computing)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Server (computing)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Software"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jensen_Huang", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jensen Huang"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Business intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computing", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Computing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-competitive_practices", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Anti-competitive practices"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politico", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Politico"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semiconductor", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Semiconductor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Competition_law", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Competition law"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Justice", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of Justice"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Business_Services/Customer_Management", "label": "dmoz/Business/Business Services/Customer Management", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Customer_Service", "label": "dmoz/Business/Customer Service", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Customer_Service/Education_and_Training", "label": "dmoz/Business/Customer Service/Education and Training", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Customer_Service/Software", "label": "dmoz/Business/Customer Service/Software", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Customer_Service/Consulting", "label": "dmoz/Business/Customer Service/Consulting", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 65}], "image": "https://staticbiassets.in/thumb/msid-111099900,width-700,resizemode-4,imgsize-138638/img66720666a76074d191cd31e8.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9658445", "eventUri": "eng-9658445", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.192156862745098, "wgt": 135, "relevance": 1}

It overtook Apple earlier this month.\n\nThe Californian company's meteoric rise has been fuelled by its dominance of what analysts call the \"new gold or oil in the tech sector\" - the chips needed for artificial intelligence (AI).\n\nSpeaking at event in Copenhagen, Chris Penrose, global head of business development for telco at Nvidia, said the record valuation was the culmination of more than 30 years of work in the AI field.\n\n\"It's really a big thank you to everyone we work with and all our partners that have really made this possible for us.\"\n\nHe also predicted further growth in the sector.\n\n\"The generative AI journey is really transforming businesses and telcos around the world,\" he said.\n\n\"We believe over the next year the race to $4 trillion market cap in tech will be front and center between Nvidia, Apple, and Microsoft,\" it said in a note earlier this week.\n\nOther commentators though have questioned whether there will be big future gains, given the increasing competition Nvidia faces.\n\nWhat is not in doubt though is how spectacularly it has grown.\n\nEight years ago, the stock was worth less than 1% of its current price.\n\nBack then, Nvidia's value came from its competition with rival AMD, in a race to make the best graphics cards.\n\nIn recent years though it has benefited from a boom in demand for chips that train and run generative AI models, the most well known of which being OpenAI's ChatGPT.\n\nThe firm also benefitted significantly from a rush to mine Bitcoin in 2020, which saw a sharp uptick in sales of its graphics cards.\n\nThe rise and rise of the tech giant has been mirrored by the increasingly high profile of its boss, Jensen Huang.\n\nSome have dubbed the 61-year-old electrical engineer the \"Taylor Swift

Should you?", "body": "This article was originally published on Fool.com. All figures quoted in US dollars unless otherwise stated.\n\nWhen key insiders buy shares of their company, they're probably confident about its future. Sure, that confidence could be misplaced. However, most investors see insider buying as a positive sign.\n\nBut it can be a much different story when key insiders sell shares. In some cases, such moves could hint that they aren't optimistic about the stock's future -- at least over the near term.\n\nThat leads me to Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA). The stock has been on a roll, skyrocketing more than seven times over the last three years and soaring more than 160% so far in 2024. However, Insiders are selling their shares of Nvidia. Should you?\n\nSince the beginning of May, 10 Form 144 filings have been reported by Nvidia to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). There are two important things to know about Form 144. First, it's a notice of the proposed sale of securities. Second, it's only used when there's a planned sale of 5,000 or more shares or an aggregate amount of over $50,000.\n\nThe most prominent person selling Nvidia stock is the company's CEO, Jensen Huang. Nvidia notified the SEC that Huang planned to sell 120,000 shares on June 13, 2024. At the market close on that date, this transaction would have been worth around $15.5 million.\n\nHuang wasn't the only Nvidia executive selling shares. Executive vice president of operations Deborah Shoquist sold 41,140 shares worth more than $45 million on June 3, 2024.\n\nSeveral members of Nvidia's board of directors also got in on the action. Dawn Hudson sold a total of 25,000 shares on three separate occasions since May 29, 2024. Board members Tench Coxe, John Dabiri, Michael McCaffery, Brooke Seawell, and Mark Stevens also sold some of their Nvidia shares in recent weeks.\n\nThese insider sales could be alarming to some investors. To use an old saying: Are the rats fleeing a sinking ship? Nope. There's more to the story.\n\nThe shares Huang sold were part of his executive compensation package. Specifically, they were restricted stock units (RSU) and performance stock units (PSU). Company CEOs frequently sell such shares when they're allowed to do so.\n\nImportantly, Huang owned nearly 93.5 million shares of Nvidia as of March 25, 2024. That's almost 3.8% of the company's outstanding shares. His recent sales were only a drop in the bucket compared to his total holdings. Huang still has plenty of skin in the game.\n\nMost of the other sales (including the ones by Shoquist and several board members) were also of restricted stock units. Investors shouldn't be too concerned about these transactions.\n\nI don't think the recent insider sales of Nvidia are a reason for outsiders to sell the stock. However, there could be some reasons for you to consider selling.\n\nNvidia's jaw-dropping gains might have caused the stock to make up a worrisome percentage of your overall portfolio. Some investors might want to trim their positions as a result.\n\nMy colleague Sean Williams predicts that Nvidia stock is poised to plunge by at least 50%. If you agree with his rationale, selling soon makes sense.\n\nHowever, Nvidia's underlying business remains strong. The company continues to execute exceptionally well. The demand for its graphics processing units isn't waning. Those are great reasons to hang on to a stock.", "source": {"uri": "fool.com.au", "dataType": "news", "title": "Motley Fool Australia"}, "authors": [{"uri": "keith_speights@fool.com.au", "name": "Keith Speights", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nvidia", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nvidia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._Securities_and_Exchange_Commission", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nasdaq", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nasdaq"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_dollar", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States dollar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Dabiri", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "John Dabiri"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jensen_Huang", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jensen Huang"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hudson_River", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hudson River"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_president", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Vice president"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Board_of_directors", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Board of directors"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Restricted_stock", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Restricted stock"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security_(finance)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Security (finance)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pennsylvania_State_University", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pennsylvania State University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shares_outstanding", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Shares outstanding"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphics_processing_unit", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Graphics processing unit"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks_and_Bonds", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks and Bonds", "wgt": 24}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Research_and_Analysis", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Research and Analysis", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Games", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Games", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work/Job_Sharing", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work/Job Sharing", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 77}], "image": "https://www.fool.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Woman-is-not-sure-16_9-1200x675.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9658445", "eventUri": "eng-9658445", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2010-05-", "textStart": 763, "textEnd": 770}, {"amb": false, "date": "2013-06-", "textStart": 1251, "textEnd": 1258}], "sentiment": 0.223529411764706, "wgt": 135, "relevance": 1}

Nvidia's rise has been driven by remarkable revenue growth fueled by AI, with its share price increasing over 160% in 2024, adding more than $2 trillion to its market value.", "source": {"uri": "timesnownews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "TimesNow"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nvidia", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Nvidia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_capitalization", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Market capitalization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_value", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Market value"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Marketing_and_Advertising", "label": "dmoz/Business/Marketing and Advertising", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Marketing_and_Advertising/Consulting", "label": "dmoz/Business/Marketing and Advertising/Consulting", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Information_Technology/Marketing_and_Advertising", "label": "dmoz/Business/Information Technology/Marketing and Advertising", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Marketing_and_Advertising/Associations", "label": "dmoz/Business/Marketing and Advertising/Associations", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Marketing_and_Advertising", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Marketing and Advertising", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 60}], "image": "https://static.tnn.in/thumb/msid-111099075,thumbsize-21680,width-1280,height-720,resizemode-75/111099075.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9658445", "eventUri": "eng-9658445", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-18", "textStart": 421, "textEnd": 428}], "sentiment": 0.7098039215686274, "wgt": 134, "relevance": 1}

Another analyst called Nvidia's chips \"the new gold or oil in the tech sector.\"\n\nNvidia's record market cap helped power the S&P 500's eighth consecutive record day and 31st of the year, and the Nasdaq and Dow Jones indexes also finished higher than the previous day, The Wall Street Journal noted. Nvidia's stock has been a \"table-pounding buy,\" an analyst at The Motley Fool said, arguing that as the global leading manufacturer of AI hardware, Nvidia can offer a hedge against the uncertainty that comes with the unprecedented rise of the technology, making it an attractive investment option. Wall Street remains \"bullish,\" and one analyst expects a $10 trillion valuation for Nvidia by the end of 2030, Business Insider noted.\n\nLike other tech giants including Apple, Microsoft, and Amazon, Nvidia owes part of its success to its global investments, particularly in Southeast Asian countries like Malaysia, Vietnam, and Singapore, Bloomberg reported. Southeast Asia is becoming increasingly attractive for tech investment because it's considered more immune to geopolitical fallout from US-China tensions, and easier to navigate politically than India: Tech giants are expected to invest $60 billion in the region for data centers alone over the next few years. The \"deep talent pool\" and support of cross-border investments also make it a viable alternative to China, Bloomberg wrote.\n\nInvestment companies like UBS and BlackRock have dismissed concerns that the AI market is going to see a dot-com like bubble, Citywire reported. \"We don't see an AI bubble, and the profitability of mega-cap tech companies stands in contrast to the unprofitable companies driving the dot-com bubble,\" a BlackRock official said in a note Tuesday. One investor told The Wall Street Journal that the differences between the AI and dot-com boom are in the speed of change, the market size, and \"the stage when the most valuable company was reached.\"", "source": {"uri": "finance.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo!

The suit, led by the Stockholm, Sweden-based investment management firm E. Ohman J:or Fonder AB, seeks unspecified monetary damages.\n\nSanta Clara, California-based Nvidia is a high-flying company that has become one of the biggest beneficiaries of the AI boom, and its market value has surged.\n\nIn 2018, Nvidia's chips became popular for cryptomining, a process that involves performing complex math equations in order to secure cryptocurrencies like bitcoin.\n\nMore: Nvidia (NVDA) stock forecast and price target prediction\n\nThe plaintiffs in a 2018 lawsuit accused Nvidia and top company officials of violating a U.S. law called the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 by making statements in 2017 and 2018 that falsely downplayed how much of Nvidia's revenue growth came from crypto-related purchases.\n\nThose omissions misled investors and analysts who were interested in understanding the impact of cryptomining on Nvidia's business, the plaintiffs said.\n\nU.S. District Judge Haywood Gilliam Jr. dismissed the lawsuit in 2021 but the San Francisco-based 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in a 2-1 ruling subsequently revived it. The 9th Circuit found that the plaintiffs had adequately alleged that Huang made \"false or misleading statements and did so knowingly or recklessly,\" allowing their case to proceed.\n\nNvidia urged the justices to take up its appeal, arguing that the 9th Circuit's ruling would open the door to \"abusive and speculative litigation.\"\n\nNvidia in 2022 agreed to pay $5.5 million to U.S. authorities to settle charges that it did not properly disclose the impact of cryptomining on its gaming business.\n\nThe justices agreed on June 10 to hear a similar bid by Meta's Facebook to dismiss a private securities fraud lawsuit accusing the social media platform of misleading investors in 2017 and 2018 about the misuse of its user data by the company and third parties. Facebook appealed after a lower court allowed a shareholder lawsuit led by Amalgamated Bank to proceed.\n\nThe Supreme Court will hear the Nvidia and Facebook cases in its next term, which begins in October.\n\nReporting by John Kruzel; Editing by Will Dunham", "source": {"uri": "finance.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo!

According to CoinGape, the lawsuit alleges that the company fraudulently misled investors regarding the extent of its revenue generated from the cryptocurrency industry.\n\nThe justices heard Nvidia's appeal following the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals instance of a class action lawsuit filed by shareholders against Nvidia and its CEO, Jensen Huang.\n\nE. Ohman J Fonder AB, a Swedish investment management company, initiated the legal action and seeks an undisclosed sum of damages.\n\nAs a result, Nvidia and its executives are accused of making fraudulent statements in 2017 and 2018 about the importance of cryptocurrency-related sales in the company's revenue.\n\nNvidia Accused of Violating Securities Act by Misleading Investors on Crypto Mining Revenue\n\nThe primary accusation against Nvidia was that it violated the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and the case was initiated in 2018. The plaintiffs contended that Nvidia failed to furnish precise data regarding the proportion of its revenue generated through crypto mining, which entails using GPUs to resolve mathematical challenges in mining digital currencies like Bitcoin.\n\nThis purported omission obscured that cryptomining had a substantial and adverse impact on Nvidia's business from investors and analysts.\n\nIn 2021, the lower court had rejected the case; however, the 9th Circuit, in a 2-1 decision in the latter half of 2021, determined that the litigation could proceed. This decision was based on the plaintiffs' plausible allegations that Nvidia had made \"false or misleading statements knowingly or recklessly. \"\n\nNvidia Appeals to Supreme Court to Dismiss Crypto Mining Fraud Case Amid Ongoing Regulatory Scrutiny\n\nNvidia has contended that the 9th Circuit's decision may lead to \"abusive and speculative litigation.\" Consequently, the company has requested that the Supreme Court intervene. In 2022, Nvidia was cited by the U.S. authorities and subsequently agreed to pay $5 million for failing to accurately disclose the impact of crypto mining on its gaming unit. Nevertheless, this resolution did not prevent the shareholder lawsuit from progressing to the next stage.\n\nFurthermore, the justices have agreed to hear an additional case involving Meta Platforms Inc., in which the social media company's shareholders claim that it has misled investors about using users' data.\n\nEarlier this month, U.S. regulators initiated an investigation into Nvidia, Microsoft, and OpenAI to assess potential antitrust concerns in the A.I. market.

Nvidia on Tuesday surpassed Microsoft to become the most valuable company in the world, reaching a market capitalization of $3.34 trillion to edge out Microsoft's $3.32 trillion.\n\nIn the first week of June, CEO Jensen Huang saw his firm hit a $3 trillion market cap for the first time, surpassing Apple. The Santa Clara, Calif.-based chipmaker, whose highly sought-after semiconductors help power AI-related computing tasks at massive data centers, has dominated the market. Over the past year, shares of Nvidia have surged more than 200%.\n\n\"The Godfather of AI, Jensen, and Nvidia are leading this AI revolution, and it's a race to $4 trillion market cap -- with Nvidia, Microsoft, and Apple battling for the No. 1 spot,\" Dan Ives, managing partner at Wedbush Securities, told me on Tuesday.\n\nHuang cofounded Nvidia in 1993 with Chris Malachowsky and Curtis Priem. About 34.5% of the S&P 500's market cap gains so far this year can be attributed to Nvidia alone, according to Apollo Global Management chief economist Torsten Sl\u00f8k, Fortune previously reported.\n\nOn May 22, Nvidia reported results for the quarter ended April 28, and it showed no signs of slowing down. On the earnings call, Nvidia EVP and CFO Colette Kress said revenue for the quarter was $26 billion, up 18% sequentially and up 262% year on year, and well above the company's outlook of $24 billion.\n\n\"The CFO leadership at Nvidia from Colette Kress has been instrumental in Nvidia's success with Wall Street, and is key to Jensen's vision,\" Ives told me. \"She is extremely well respected both internally at Nvidia and across the tech industry.\"\n\nKress joined Nvidia in 2013 as CFO after serving nearly 25 years in a range of finance roles at major technology companies. She previously was CFO of Cisco's Business Technology and Operations Finance organization, and she spent 13 years at Microsoft, including four years as CFO of the server and tools division.\n\nI had the opportunity to sit down with Kress in 2022, and we discussed how the rest of her career prepared her to move to Nvidia.\n\nHere's what she told me:\n\n\"My career background did serve me well. When I started at Nvidia, it was the smallest company that I'd ever worked for. It's gotten quite large, but the focus is on how do you think about the future and make sure we're ready for it to scale?\n\n\"Some of the techniques and processes have to be transformed over time as the company scales. How do we digitize manual processes? Our fast growth rate has put that front and center for us. Particularly, in my role leading finance, and the sister and brother organizations around me, I'm looking to them to say, 'Hey, we need to revise a process, how the functions work together, to create digital solutions.'\n\n\"When looking back at my career of 30-plus years, what's fascinating now is there are so many different ways to do things that never existed -- even at some of the largest companies that I've worked at in the past.\"\n\nShe now works at the largest company. And she's clearly a big reason why.\n\nSheryl Estrada\n\nsheryl.estrada@fortune.com\n\nJason Bengel was promoted to CFO at LendingTree, Inc. (Nasdaq: TREE), an online financial services marketplace, effective Aug. 9, following the departure of CFO Trent Ziegler, who is pursuing a new opportunity outside the company. Bengel, currently a senior vice president at LendingTree, joined the company in 2018 as VP of financial planning and analysis.\n\nAre virtual meetings still effective? Hybrid Work Has Changed Meetings Forever, a new report in Harvard Business Review, explores this topic The authors, Mike Tolliver and Jonathan Sass, from analytics firm Vyopta, analyzed 40 million virtual meetings from 11 organizations, spanning more than 450,000 unique employees.

The suit, led by the Stockholm-based investment management firm E Ohman Jor Fonder, seeks unspecified monetary damages.\n\nSanta Clara, California-based Nvidia is a high-flying company that has become one of the biggest beneficiaries of the AI boom, and its market value has surged.\n\nIn 2018, Nvidia's chips became popular for cryptomining, a process that involves performing complex math equations in order to secure cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin.\n\nThe plaintiffs in a 2018 lawsuit accused Nvidia and top company officials of violating a US law called the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 by making statements in 2017 and 2018 that falsely downplayed how much of Nvidia's revenue growth came from crypto-related purchases.\n\nThose omissions misled investors and analysts who were interested in understanding the impact of cryptomining on Nvidia's business, the plaintiffs said.\n\nUS District Judge Haywood Gilliam Jr dismissed the lawsuit in 2021 but the San Francisco-based 9th US Circuit Court of Appeals in a 2-1 ruling subsequently revived it.

That's the most in a half year period since the first six months of 2023 when about 848,000 shares were sold, according to data compiled by the Washington Service.\n\nThe dollar value of this year's share sales dwarfs that of previous periods given the stock's 164% gain in 2024. That run has been propelled by an arms race among companies to boost computing power, driving up demand for so-called AI accelerator chips, a market dominated by Nvidia.\n\nFor Mark Lehmann, chief executive officer at Citizens JMP Securities, the selling is worth bearing in mind but shouldn't necessarily set off alarms considering some compensation is paid in stock and there appear to be no signs of slowing demand for the company's products.\n\n\"Anytime you see this kind of wealth being created and the type of market cap being created, I always look for who is coming and going and I have not seen an exodus of the people that got us to this market cap,\" he said in an interview. \"That would be more concerning.\"\n\nThe chipmaker is now the third most valuable company in the world with a market capitalization of about $3.22 trillion, narrowly behind Microsoft Corp. and Apple Inc.\n\nMore than a third of the shares sold this year by insiders have come since Nvidia's fiscal first quarter earnings report on May 22 when a better-than-expected revenue forecast for the current quarter and the stock split announcement sent the shares soaring anew. Among the biggest sellers have been directors Mark Stevens and Tench Coxe. On Monday, Chief Executive Officer Jensen Huang reported the sale of about $31 million in shares under a pre-arranged trading plan. A representative for Nvidia declined to comment.\n\nWhile there are plenty of insider sellers, there has been a dearth of buyers. Excluding the exercising of options, there hasn't been an insider stock purchase at Nvidia since Chief Financial Officer Colette Kress bought $107,390 in shares in December 2020, according to Washington Service-compiled data.\n\nTech Chart of the Day\n\nThe artificial intelligence rally is showing signs of overheating. A further rally in megacap stocks including Nvidia and Broadcom Inc. on Monday helped push the Nasdaq 100 index to a fresh record high. Its 14-day relative strength index -- a gauge of price momentum -- is now at its most overbought level since 2018, meaning it may be poised for a pullback.\n\nTop Tech News\n\n--With assistance from Jan-Patrick Barnert and Subrat Patnaik.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek", "source": {"uri": "ca.finance.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo!

The suit, revived by a lower court, claims Nvidia and its CEO downplayed crypto-related revenue, affecting investment decisions.\n\nThe U.S. Supreme Court agreed on Monday to hear a bid by Nvidia to scuttle a securities fraud lawsuit accusing the artificial intelligence chipmaker of misleading investors about how much of its sales went to the volatile cryptocurrency industry.\n\nThe justices took up Nvidia's appeal made after a lower court revived a proposed class action brought by shareholders in California against the company and its CEO Jensen Huang. The suit, led by the Stockholm, Sweden-based investment management firm E. Ohman J:or Fonder AB, seeks unspecified monetary damages. Santa Clara, California-based Nvidia is a high-flying company that has become one of the biggest beneficiaries of the AI boom, and its market value has surged.\n\nIn 2018, Nvidia's chips became popular for cryptomining, a process that involves performing complex math equations in order to secure cryptocurrencies like bitcoin. The plaintiffs in a 2018 lawsuit accused Nvidia and top company officials of violating a U.S. law called the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 by making statements in 2017 and 2018 that falsely downplayed how much of Nvidia's revenue growth came from crypto-related purchases.\n\nThose omissions misled investors and analysts who were interested in understanding the impact of cryptomining on Nvidia's business, the plaintiffs said. U.S. District Judge Haywood Gilliam Jr. dismissed the lawsuit in 2021 but the San Francisco-based 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in a 2-1 ruling subsequently revived it. The 9th Circuit found that the plaintiffs had adequately alleged that Huang made \"false or misleading statements and did so knowingly or recklessly,\" allowing their case to proceed.\n\nNvidia urged the justices to take up its appeal, arguing that the 9th Circuit's ruling would open the door to \"abusive and speculative litigation.\" Nvidia in 2022 agreed to pay $5.5 million to U.S. authorities to settle charges that it did not properly disclose the impact of cryptomining on its gaming business.\n\n(This story has not been edited by Devdiscourse staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)", "source": {"uri": "devdiscourse.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Devdiscourse"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Securities_fraud", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Securities fraud"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptocurrency", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cryptocurrency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nvidia", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nvidia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Supreme Court of the United States"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawsuit", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lawsuit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Court_of_Appeals_for_the_Ninth_Circuit", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Class_action", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Class action"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Securities_Exchange_Act_of_1934", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Securities Exchange Act of 1934"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bachelor_of_Arts", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bachelor of Arts"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Damages", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Damages"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_value", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Market value"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitcoin", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bitcoin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plaintiff", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Plaintiff"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Investment_management", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Investment management"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Law of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shareholder", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Shareholder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santa_Clara,_California", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Santa Clara, California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Santa Clara, California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haywood_Gilliam", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Haywood Gilliam"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_district_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States district court"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal_Information", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal Information", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Security", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Security", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Law", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Law", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Security/FAQs,_Help,_and_Tutorials", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Security/FAQs, Help, and Tutorials", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 79}], "image": "https://www.devdiscourse.com/remote.axd?https://devdiscourse.blob.core.windows.net/aiimagegallery/31_05_2024_14_35_16_3178377.png?width=920&format=jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9658445", "eventUri": "eng-9658445", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.01960784313725494, "wgt": 130, "relevance": 1}

Nvidia attained a market capitalization of US$ 1 trillion last year, and it is unimaginably crazy that it has overtaken well-established tech giant's like Microsoft and Apple within such a short timeframe.\n\nThe tech market is in the heat of competition between different AI models such as OpenAI, ScaleAI, Google's Alphabet, Meta's and Elon Musk's xAI. All of these models are coming up with chatbots whose programs need to be run by chips manufactured by companies like Nvidia.\n\nNvidia controls 80% of the AI chips market globally. After reporting high revenues in its May report, the company's shares rose up by more than 170%. The almost miraculous ascent has roused skepticism from NASDAQ analysts - some of whom have warned that the entry of competition in the chips market is likely to pop the bubble that is Nvidia's stock.\n\nNvidia has partnered with an African entrepreneurship platform called Pariti to train more than 2,000 developers on deep learning across Africa.\n\nThe initiative is set to target tech students from Kenya, South Africa, Nigeria, Egypt, Morocco, Tunisia, and Algeria. It intends to train them on new skills in AI development to prepare them for unfolding opportunities in this tech landscape.\n\n\"Africa's greatest resource is our human capital.

The Nasdaq-100 Technology Sector is up 32% in the past 12 months, outperforming the S&P 500's growth of 24% in that period. The rise brings to mind the old proverb, \"The best time to plant a tree was 20 years ago, but the second best time is now.\" The same sentiment applies to the stock market, especially tech stocks.\n\nThe tech industry has a reputation for delivering significant gains over the long term, benefiting from its innovative nature and consistent demand for upgraded products and software. Meanwhile, recent advances in markets such as artificial intelligence (AI), self-driving cars, and virtual/augmented (VR/AR) reality indicate the tech market is nowhere near hitting its ceiling. As a result, there's no time like the present to invest in tech.\n\nHere are two hypergrowth tech stocks to buy in 2024 and beyond.\n\nShares in Nvidia (NVDA 1.75%) have hit record heights over the last year, rising 207% alongside soaring earnings. Stellar growth has seen the company become the first chipmaker to achieve a market cap above $3 trillion, making it the world's third most valuable company this year, only after Microsoft and Apple (AAPL -0.82%).\n\nNvidia's success comes down to its dominant position in AI graphics processing units (GPUs), the chips crucial to performing AI tasks and running AI platforms. While competitors such as Intel and Advanced Micro Devices prioritized central processing units (CPUs) in recent years, Nvidia's focus on GPUs gave it a head start in AI and perfectly positioned it to become the go-to chip supplier for AI developers worldwide.\n\nIn its most recent quarter, the first quarter of fiscal 2025, Nvidia's revenue increased by 262% year over year while operating income rose nearly 700%. The company enjoyed impressive growth in its data center segment, which posted revenue gains of 427%, illustrating a healthy boost to AI GPU sales.\n\nHowever, its diverse business model is the best reason to invest in this hypergrowth tech stock. In addition to AI chips, Nvidia has positions in consumer PCs, video games, self-driving cars, and more.\n\nIn Q1 2025, revenue in the company's automotive segment increased by 17% sequentially and 11% year over year. Nvidia CFO Colette Kress has expressed massive potential in automotive as advances in self-driving cars increase chip demand. On a recent earnings call, Kress said that she expects automotive to be the \"largest enterprise vertical\" within the data center segment in 2024.\n\nNvidia has delivered an impressive growth year but could have much more to offer investors as the tech market develops and the company continues to be a leading chipmaker. And with a price/earnings-to-growth ratio of less than 1, this hypergrowth tech stock is too good to pass up this year.\n\nShares of Apple are up 341% over the past five years, while annual revenue and operating income have soared 47% and 79%. The company has often been praised as one of the best growth stocks to invest in over the long term.\n\nHowever, Apple has been in a slump over the past 12 months. The company has a reputation for consistently outperforming the S&P 500. Yet while the renowned index has risen 24% since last June, Apple's stock price has increased by 16%. Investors have grown weary of Apple's products business after repeated sales declines.\n\nMeanwhile, the emergence of AI has highlighted the disparity in Apple's AI technology compared with some of its rivals. The iPhone giant isn't leading in the AI space today. However, recent developments and its Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC) on June 10 have made Wall Street bullish again.\n\nApple's stock jumped 10% after the conference, where the company debuted new AI services that could boost product sales in the coming months. At WWDC, the tech giant unveiled Apple Intelligence, a new AI platform that will bring generative updates across its product lineup. iPhone 15 Pro models, Apple Silicon Macs, and iPads equipped with M1 through M4 chips will give users access to Apple Intelligence, including features such as image and language generation, editing tools, an updated Siri, and much more.\n\nApple Intelligence could motivate millions of consumers to upgrade to the company's more recent devices, providing the boost that its product business needs to overcome recent headwinds.\n\nShares in Apple are trading at a premium, with its forward price-to-earnings ratio at 32. However, as the table shows, this figure is below the same metric for AI rivals Microsoft and Amazon, indicating that Apple's stock is a better value than both companies.\n\nApple also significantly outperforms both companies in free cash flow, which could mean it is better equipped to catch up with its competitors in AI and keep investing in its business.

This surge propelled their market cap to a historic $3 trillion, placing them alongside tech giants like Microsoft and Apple. But Nvidia's stellar performance didn't stop there.\n\nA few days later, it surpassed Apple to become the world's second-largest company. Then, on June 18th, Nvidia achieved another remarkable feat - dethroning all competitors to become the most valuable company in the world! This astonishing 180% surge since the beginning of 2024 underscores the immense potential investors still see in Nvidia's future.\n\nWhile Gold has long been considered a safe haven during inflation, a growing number of investors are turning to big tech stocks like Nvidia. A recent Bloomberg survey revealed a shift in sentiment, with 46% of respondents still favouring gold, but a significant 33% now viewing large technology companies as a more effective hedge against inflation.\n\nNvidia and other tech stocks are propelling major indexes like the S&P 500 and Nasdaq to record highs. However, a closer look reveals an interesting trend. Will Nvidia's reign at the top last? What are the other factors driving the markets to record highs? Will this stock's market growth continue? Let's take a closer look.\n\nNvidia published very strong and better-than-expected Q1 2024 performance, cementing their status as the undisputed kingpin of the AI era. Revenue skyrocketed 262% year-over-year, reaching an unprecedented $26 billion, which translates into a staggering 600% profit increase compared to the same period in 2023.\n\nFueling this explosive performance is the red-hot data centre segment. Driven by the insatiable demand for AI and high-performance computing, data centre sales reached a historic quarterly high of $22.6 billion, a significant 23% growth from the previous quarter and a jaw-dropping 427% surge compared to Q1 2023.\n\nIn June 2024, Nvidia announced a 10-to-1 stock split, following a similar move in July 2021 with a 4-to-1 split. This decision aims to make the company's stock more accessible to a broader range of investors.\n\nWhile the total value of the company remains the same after a split, it increases the number of shares available. This often translates to lower individual share prices, potentially attracting more investors that can now afford to invest in Nvidia and boosting overall trading activity (liquidity).\n\nWhile the S&P 500 and Nasdaq reached new highs on Tuesday, the Dow Jones barely budged. This follows a trend of the Dow underperforming other major U.S. indices this year. Since January 2024, the Dow has only gained around 3%, compared to the S&P 500's impressive 16% increase and the Nasdaq's surge of nearly 21%.\n\nOver the past 20 trading sessions, despite the overall market gains, a majority of individual S&P 500 companies have actually closed lower. This has only happened a handful of times in the past three decades, highlighting the concentration of recent growth in a select few heavyweight stocks.\n\nSo, what's driving the US stock performance of the S&P500 and the Nasdaq? Several factors are at play.\n\nInvestors are increasingly optimistic about the Federal Reserve implementing multiple interest rate cuts this year, despite hawkish communication from FOMC members, who decided to hold interest rates at its current level (5.25% to 5.50%) for the seventh time in a row, while signaling fewer rate cuts than previously estimated.\n\nStill, investors are growing more optimistic about the prospect of the Federal Reserve implementing multiple interest rate cuts this year with each piece of positive news released, despite the hawkish rhetoric from FOMC members.\n\nThis sentiment has been bolstered by recent comments from Fed Governor Adriana Kugler, who stated yesterday that she believes the current monetary policy stance is \"sufficiently restrictive.\"\n\nKugler's assessment suggests that the existing policy measures are sufficient to alleviate inflationary pressures without triggering a substantial downturn in the labour market. Her remarks provide a nuanced view amidst the predominantly hawkish communication from the Federal Reserve, highlighting a potential pathway for easing rates if economic conditions allow for it.\n\nAdditionally, excitement surrounding AI advancements and robust earnings reports from other tech players are fueling market enthusiasm. But these gains haven't been evenly distributed, with a small number of heavily weighted stocks leading the charge.\n\nEarly signs of massive investments in generative AI are fueling a surge in the stock prices of major tech companies. Since January 2024, shares of tech giants like Apple, Amazon, Alphabet, and Meta Platforms have skyrocketed, with gains exceeding 15%, 21%, and 44% respectively. The trend extends beyond household names, with chipmakers like Applied Materials and Qualcomm witnessing impressive growth of over 60% each.\n\nThe widespread rally in tech stocks reflects a surge in investor confidence in regards to the transformative potential of generative AI. This optimism isn't just driving stock prices higher; it's also prompting leading financial institutions to revise their market outlooks upwards.\n\nLast week, Goldman Sachs' equity strategy team upped their year-end target for the S&P 500 to 5,600, a significant increase from their previous estimate of 5,200. This week, Citigroup followed suit, raising their own year-end target to 5,600 from 5,100. These upward revisions highlight the belief that the momentum in the tech sector, fueled by AI advancements, is likely to continue propelling the broader market.\n\nThis week, investors should brace for potential volatility in Nvidia and other major tech stocks, particularly Apple. The Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLK), one of the largest tech-focused ETFs in the US, is undergoing its quarterly rebalancing on Friday. This process may involve buying or selling billions of dollars worth of these stocks, potentially exerting significant bullish or bearish pressure on their share prices.\n\nThe information provided does not constitute investment research.

Sustaining the current rally will require customers to keep spending billions of dollars a quarter on AI equipment, whose returns on investment are so far relatively small.\n\nWhat ultimately paved the way for Nvidia to climb to the top, though, was the company's big bet on graphics chips and the vision of co-founder and chief executive Jensen Huang that the industry would shift to what he calls \"accelerated computing,\" something his chips are inherently better at than the competition.", "source": {"uri": "financialpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Financial Post"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nvidia", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Nvidia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_dollar", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States dollar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S&P_500_Index", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "S&P 500 Index"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_capitalization", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Market capitalization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jensen_Huang", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jensen Huang"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computing", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Computing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphics_processing_unit", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Graphics processing unit"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks_and_Bonds", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks and Bonds", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Brokerages", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Brokerages", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Major_Companies", "label": "dmoz/Business/Major Companies", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Education_and_Training", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Education and Training", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 69}], "image": "https://smartcdn.gprod.postmedia.digital/financialpost/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/0620-bc-nvidia.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9658445", "eventUri": "eng-9658445", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2784313725490195, "wgt": 127, "relevance": 1}

The company's shares are up more than 170% this year and have risen about 1,100% since their October 2022 low.\n\nBlockbuster earnings and broadening investor enthusiasm over AI are supercharging Nvidia's rally. That fervor has been reflected in Nvidia's market value, which took only 96 days to go from $2 trillion to $3 trillion.\n\nMicrosoft, one of the two other companies to reach those rarefied levels, took 945 days to go from $2 trillion to $3 trillion while Apple took 1,044 days to make the leap, according to Bespoke Investment Group.\n\nPreviously, just 11 U.S. companies since 1925 have reached the top spot in market value on a closing basis, according to Howard Silverblatt, senior index analyst at S&P Dow Jones Indices.\n\nFortunes have diverged for past holders of the top position in recent decades. Microsoft reached No. 1 in the late 1990s but then its shares struggled for years during the early 2000s following the dotcom bubble, only to come roaring back in the latter half of the last decade.\n\nExxon Mobil became the world's most valuable company in the 2000s but its shares retreated following a downturn in oil prices.\n\nTo some, Cisco is the cautionary tale. The company's shares peaked at over $80 in March 2000 in the midst of the dotcom boom, during which investors often assigned dizzying valuations to internet-related companies.\n\nBespoke's analysts recently contrasted the trajectories of Nvidia and Cisco, whose products were seen as essential in supporting the internet's infrastructure.\n\n\"NVDA's run has been incredible, but it will need to keep growing from here and stave off competition if its stock is going to keep putting up stellar returns,\" Bespoke said in a recent note.\n\nFor now, Nvidia's earnings are supporting its stock price. Revenue more than tripled to $26 billion in the latest quarter, while net income jumped seven-fold to $14.9 billion.\n\nRevenue for the current fiscal year is expected to roughly double to $120 billion, and then rise another 33% in fiscal 2026, to $160 billion, according to LSEG data.\n\nNvidia's impressive financial performance and forecasts have led its stock valuation, by some measures, to moderate despite the surge in its share price. For example, Nvidia's forward price-to-earnings ratio last stood at 43, according to LSEG Datastream. That is higher than the 25 level it stood at to start the year but below levels it reached for much of last year. By contrast, the S&P 500 trades at 21 times earnings.\n\nWhile Nvidia has been the standout performer, it is not the only stock to benefit from enthusiasm about the profit potential for AI. Shares of other technology companies, including Super Micro Computer and Arm Holdings, have also risen sharply this year.\n\n(Reporting by Lewis Krauskopf in New York; Additional reporting by Saqib Iqbal Ahmed in New York and Noel Randewich in Oakland, California; Editing by Ira Iosebashvili and Matthew Lewis)", "source": {"uri": "theprint.in", "dataType": "news", "title": "ThePrint"}, "authors": [{"uri": "reuters@theprint.in", "name": "Reuters", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nvidia", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nvidia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_value", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Market value"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cisco", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cisco"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dot-com_bubble", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dot-com bubble"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_standard", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gold standard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Price_of_oil", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Price of oil"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S&P_Dow_Jones_Indices", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "S&P Dow Jones Indices"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ExxonMobil", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "ExxonMobil"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valuation_(finance)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Valuation (finance)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revenue", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Revenue"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arm_(company)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Arm (company)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S&P_500_Index", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "S&P 500 Index"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock_valuation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Stock valuation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Share_price", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Share price"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Net_income", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Net income"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiscal_year", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fiscal year"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Price\u2013earnings_ratio", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Price\u2013earnings ratio"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oakland,_California", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Oakland, California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Oakland, California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks_and_Bonds", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks and Bonds", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Research_and_Analysis", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Research and Analysis", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Day_Trading", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Day Trading", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Major_Companies/Company_Rankings", "label": "dmoz/Business/Major Companies/Company Rankings", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 100}], "image": null, "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9658445", "eventUri": "eng-9658445", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2000-03-", "textStart": 1342, "textEnd": 1352}], "sentiment": 0.2392156862745098, "wgt": 127, "relevance": 1}

Originally dismissed in 2021, the case was revived by the 9th Circuit Court. Nvidia contests the ruling, seeking to prevent speculative litigation.\n\nThe U.S. Supreme Court agreed on Monday to hear a bid by Nvidia to scuttle a securities fraud lawsuit accusing the artificial intelligence chipmaker of misleading investors about how much of its sales went to the volatile cryptocurrency industry. The justices took up Nvidia's appeal made after a lower court revived a proposed class action brought by shareholders in California against the company and its CEO Jensen Huang. The suit, led by the Stockholm, Sweden-based investment management firm E. Ohman J:or Fonder AB, seeks unspecified monetary damages.\n\nSanta Clara, California-based Nvidia is a high-flying company that has become one of the biggest beneficiaries of the AI boom, and its market value has surged. In 2018, Nvidia's chips became popular for cryptomining, a process that involves performing complex math equations in order to secure cryptocurrencies like bitcoin.\n\nThe plaintiffs in a 2018 lawsuit accused Nvidia and top company officials of violating a U.S. law called the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 by making statements in 2017 and 2018 that falsely downplayed how much of Nvidia's revenue growth came from crypto-related purchases. Those omissions misled investors and analysts who were interested in understanding the impact of cryptomining on Nvidia's business, the plaintiffs said.\n\nU.S. District Judge Haywood Gilliam Jr. dismissed the lawsuit in 2021 but the San Francisco-based 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in a 2-1 ruling subsequently revived it.

Nvidia urged the justices to take up its appeal, arguing that the 9th Circuit's ruling would open the door to \"abusive and speculative litigation.\"\n\nNvidia in 2022 agreed to pay $5.5 million to U.S. authorities to settle charges that it did not properly disclose the impact of cryptomining on its gaming business. The justices agreed on June 10 to hear a similar bid by Meta's Facebook to dismiss a private securities fraud lawsuit accusing the social media platform of misleading investors in 2017 and 2018 about the misuse of its user data by the company and third parties. Facebook appealed after a lower court allowed a shareholder lawsuit led by Amalgamated Bank to proceed.\n\nThe Supreme Court will hear the Nvidia and Facebook cases in its next term, which begins in October.\n\n(This story has not been edited by Devdiscourse staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)", "source": {"uri": "devdiscourse.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Devdiscourse"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Securities_fraud", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Securities fraud"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptocurrency", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cryptocurrency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nvidia", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nvidia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawsuit", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lawsuit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Court_of_Appeals_for_the_Ninth_Circuit", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Supreme Court of the United States"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Class_action", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Class action"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plaintiff", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Plaintiff"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Securities_Exchange_Act_of_1934", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Securities Exchange Act of 1934"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bachelor_of_Arts", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bachelor of Arts"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Damages", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Damages"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_value", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Market value"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitcoin", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bitcoin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Investment_management", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Investment management"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Law of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shareholder", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Shareholder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santa_Clara,_California", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Santa Clara, California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Santa Clara, California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haywood_Gilliam", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Haywood Gilliam"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_district_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States district court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Facebook"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Security", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Security", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Law", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Law", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Senses/Hearing", "label": "dmoz/Health/Senses/Hearing", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Security/FAQs,_Help,_and_Tutorials", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Security/FAQs, Help, and Tutorials", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 65}], "image": "https://www.devdiscourse.com/remote.axd?https://devdiscourse.blob.core.windows.net/aiimagegallery/31_05_2024_14_35_16_3178377.png?width=920&format=jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9658445", "eventUri": "eng-9658445", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-10", "textStart": 2348, "textEnd": 2355}], "sentiment": 0.02745098039215677, "wgt": 126, "relevance": 1}

This meteoric rise is driven by the boom in artificial intelligence.\n\nThe technology industry is undergoing rapid transformation, with companies constantly seeking to push the boundaries of innovation. These last years, artificial intelligence emerged as a dominant force driven by OpenAI with ChatGPT gaining attention and investments of tech giants.\n\nNvidia, once primarily recognized for its graphics cards for video games, such as the GeForce RTX 4080 and its evolution, the GeForce RTX 4080 SUPER, is now at the top of the stock market. With a steady rise in its shares, the company has reached a market capitalization of $3.34 trillion, surpassing Microsoft and Apple. This surge is largely attributed to the growing demand for AI chips, which are essential for data centers.\n\nFounded in 1991, Nvidia initially targeted the video game hardware market before diversifying into sectors like cryptocurrency mining and cloud gaming subscriptions. Since the start of the year, it has experienced a dramatic increase of its shares, with growth of more than 180% at present, it is twice as much as Bitcoin ! The company reported revenues of $22.6 billion - or around \u20ac21 billion - for its latest quarter, ae increase of 427% compared to the previous year, thanks to the sale of AI chips like the A100 and H100 models. These results show us to what extent these specific maps are used in varied domains ranging from OpenAI language models with ChatGPT, to Microsoft cloud services.\n\nIn response to this growth, the company recently announced a split of its shares 10 for 1. This process means that they are divided into 10 in order to make them cheaper and more accessible to small investors. It also increases Nvidia's chances of being added to the U.S. Dow Jones Index, a stock index that includes 30 of the largest public companies in the United States.

Meanwhile, RNDR has seen a 10.3% rise, currently trading at $7.75. Additionally, data from the on-chain analytic tool Santiment shows that RNDR has experienced a 33.33% increase in social volume changes during this period.\n\nIn the longer term, Nvidia's influence on the AI and crypto sectors is expected to be profound. A report by asset manager Bitwise highlights how the AI boom has significantly impacted data centers, creating a shortage of AI chips and access to electricity.\n\nBitcoin miners, equipped with powerful chips and advanced cooling systems, provide the necessary infrastructure for AI companies. As a leading manufacturer of AI chips and GPUs for crypto mining, Nvidia can gain considerably from the increasing demand.\n\nGreg Beard, CEO of Stronghold Digital Mining, noted that research analysts are sounding the alarm about the rising power demand driven by the expansion of AI data centers. He cites an April Goldman Sachs report stating that data center power demand, excluding crypto, is expected to grow by 160% in 2030 compared to 2023.\n\nHowever, the infrastructure is insufficient to meet the demand. Moreover, Beard pointed out that the US electric industry hasn't developed new baseload power infrastructure in almost twenty years.\n\nRead more: Top 9 Artificial Intelligence (AI) Cryptocurrencies in 2024\n\n\"AI developers are well-capitalized and in a hurry to build but face serious barriers to accessing power.

Ohman J:or Fonder AB and seeks unspecified monetary damages.\n\nPlaintiffs allege that Nvidia and its executives violated the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 by making statements in 2017 and 2018 that falsely downplayed the impact of crypto-related purchases on Nvidia's revenue growth. They argue that these omissions misled investors and analysts who keen on understanding the extent of influence that cryptomining had on Nvidia's overall business.\n\nUS District Judge Haywood Gilliam Jr. initially dismissed the lawsuit in 2021, but the San Francisco-based 9th US Circuit Court of Appeals subsequently revived it in a 2-1 ruling. The 9th Circuit found that the plaintiffs had adequately alleged that Huang made \"false or misleading statements and did so knowingly or recklessly,\" allowing their case to proceed.\n\nNvidia urged the Supreme Court to take up its appeal, arguing that the 9th Circuit's ruling would open the door to \"abusive and speculative litigation.\" The Supreme Court will hear the Nvidia case for its next term on October.\n\nIn 2018, Nvidia's chips gained popularity for cryptomining, a process that involves solving complex mathematical equations to secure crypto protocols that relied on proof of work consensus algorithms like Bitcoin. In 2021, Nvidia launched CMP 70HX, a graphics card built on an 8 nanometer process and designed specifically for the purpose of mining crypto.\n\nAt the time, Nvidia was facing criticism from GPU buyers, in particular gamers and video professionals who needed high-powered GPUs, for having its products sold more to crypto miners. In 2022, the company agreed to pay $5.5 million to US authorities to settle charges in relation to its improper disclosure on the impact of cryptomining to the gaming industry.\n\nBack to the present, the company's market value has surged, largely due to its position as a major beneficiary of the AI boom.

The chipmaker's stock has surged 168% in 2024, driven by booming demand for its AI accelerator chips. Executives and directors sold about 770,000 Nvidia shares, marking the highest volume in a six-month period since the first half of 2023. This massive insider selling is notable but not alarming, according to Mark Lehmann, CEO of Citizens JMP Securities, who emphasized that the compensation in stock and sustained demand for Nvidia's products are positive indicators.\n\nA significant portion of these sales occurred after Nvidia's fiscal first-quarter earnings report on May 22, which included a better-than-expected revenue forecast and a 10-for-1 stock split announcement. Directors Mark Stevens and Tench Coxe were among the biggest sellers, while CEO Jensen Huang sold about $31 million in shares under a pre-arranged trading plan. Despite the heavy selling, there has been a notable absence of insider buying, with the last purchase being in December 2020 by CFO Colette Kress.\n\nThe rally in AI and megacap stocks like Nvidia has propelled the Nasdaq 100 index to new heights, with its 14-day relative strength index indicating an overbought condition.

Become an Insider and start reading now. Have an account? Log in.\n\nLast year, Nvidia started its cloud service, DGX Cloud, a competitor to some of Nvidia's own customers, including Microsoft and Amazon Web Services. DGX Cloud rents Nvidia-powered servers from within AWS's data centers and then, promising greater computing capability, leases them back to Nvidia's customers, The Information reported.\n\nAt first, AWS was hesitant to allow Nvidia to set up a competing shop right under its nose, according to The Information. But once other rival companies agreed to the terms of DGX Cloud, AWS had no choice but to relent -- it just couldn't risk souring its relationship with the supplier of its crucial chips, per the outlet.\n\nAn Amazon spokesperson told The Information the suggestion that AWS was concerned about upsetting Nvidia was \"speculative and incorrect.\"\n\nWhen contacted by Business Insider, the spokesperson said Amazon worked closely with Nvidia to develop features in the DGX Cloud offering that offered customers \"the best of both companies.\"\n\n\"We have a deep collaboration with Nvidia that goes back more than 13 years, when together we launched the world's first GPU cloud instance on AWS, and today we offer the widest range of Nvidia GPU solutions for customers,\" Amazon's spokesperson told BI.\n\nThrough DGX Cloud, Nvidia has creatively maneuvered itself into a position where its own customers are helping it compete with them. But CEO Jensen Huang's aggressive strategy to maintain dominance doesn't stop there, per The Information. Nvidia is also requiring customers to build out more space to house the GPUs they buy -- and telling them how to do it.\n\n\"Nvidia will not ship GPUs unless the customer can certify that they have data center capacity in which to place those GPUs,\" Raul Martynek, who works with cloud providers as the CEO of DataBank, told The Information.\n\nThe titan chipmaker, in addition to demanding its clients provide proof of their expanded data center capacity, is also telling customers how to design the racks that hold the servers and GPUs within those data centers, the outlet reported.\n\nAnd because the racks are specifically designed to fit Nvidia chips, it could make it difficult for the customer to switch to chips from competing companies without incurring tremendous costs.\n\nFor now, Nvidia and its clients like Amazon have agreed to continue their somewhat symbiotic relationship, but that hasn't stopped competition from brewing on both sides. While Nvidia has expanded into cloud services, AWS is also developing its own AI chips, called Trainium and Inferentia, which aim to compete with Nvidia's.\n\nThough its current strategy is clever enough to have propelled Nvidia to become the world's most valuable company, the company's quest for industry dominance could come back to bite it. The Department of Justice is looking to launch an investigation into potential antitrust violations, Politico reported earlier this month.\n\nThe feds are preparing to investigate whether Nvidia came to become the leading supplier of high-end semiconductors through anticompetitive behavior, per Politico.\n\nA spokesperson for Nvidia declined to comment when reached by Business Insider.", "source": {"uri": "businessinsider.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Business Insider"}, "authors": [{"uri": "grace_eliza_goodwin@businessinsider.com", "name": "Grace Eliza Goodwin", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "katherine_tangalakis_lippert@businessinsider.com", "name": "Katherine Tangalakis-Lippert", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_Web_Services", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Amazon Web Services"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nvidia", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nvidia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_computing", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cloud computing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphics_processing_unit", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Graphics processing unit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_(company)", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Amazon (company)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_Insider", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Business Insider"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_center", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Data center"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computing", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Computing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Server_(computing)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Server (computing)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-competitive_practices", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Anti-competitive practices"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politico", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Politico"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semiconductor", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Semiconductor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Justice", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of Justice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Business_Services/Customer_Management", "label": "dmoz/Business/Business Services/Customer Management", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Customer_Service", "label": "dmoz/Business/Customer Service", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Customer_Service/Education_and_Training", "label": "dmoz/Business/Customer Service/Education and Training", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Customer_Service/Software", "label": "dmoz/Business/Customer Service/Software", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Customer_Service/Consulting", "label": "dmoz/Business/Customer Service/Consulting", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 56}], "image": "https://i.insider.com/6672077b2efa138e0330f245?width=1200&format=jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9658445", "eventUri": "eng-9658445", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1529411764705881, "wgt": 123, "relevance": 1}

Another player in the semiconductor industry, Moschip Technologies Ltd., is gaining attention for its high market capitalization and recent order from CDAC.Lazy investors' easy way to profit is to pile on to the 'likes' of companies that are successful in their area of business. Globally, the popular theme playing out these days is the chip, memory chip!\n\nNvidia's rise to the top of the market capitalisation pile has brought in its share of enthusiasts and skeptics. Its eye-popping market value topping $3.3 trillion -- towering above Microsoft, Apple and everything else from Walmart to Meta and Alphabet (Google) -- is making investors search for the next Nvidia.\n\nThat's a natural investor trait.\n\nThe growth of Nvidia is nothing short of a dream. It has prompted seasoned investors to draw parallel to Cisco Systems of the dotcom bubble that became the darling of investors in the internet age to see its valuations erode when earnings reality dawned.\n\nTo be sure, Nvidia, with its chips, is at the heart of the current technology revolution - Artificial Intelligence. Its chips are the most sought after by companies to turn mines of data into meaningful explanations to enhance businesses. That scramble for Nvidia's chips led to the tripling of its revenue in the last quarter to $26 billion compared to a year earlier.\n\nNo wonder the stock has also tripled in value in the past 12 months, and a trillion-dollar value -- equivalent of 7 (yes, 7!) HDFC Banks -- was added in just about four months. Many investors have capitalised on the boom in US tech stocks, thanks to the mutual fund plans that invest in overseas companies.\n\nBut those who did not, appear to have caught on to a locally listed stock that has been into semiconductors, and was backed by private equity firms early in its life. That is Moschip Technologies Ltd., which says it is into \"semiconductor and system design services\".\n\nOn Wednesday, Moschip was up 13 percent at Rs. 231.35, giving it a market capitalisation of Rs. 4,700 crore and more than 7 million shares changing hands on the BSE. That translates into more than 21 times its last year revenues.\n\nIt is also notable that the company in a recent regulatory filing said it had secured an order worth Rs 509.37 crore from the Centre for Development of Advanced Computing (CDAC). It involves the development of a high-performance computing SoC, or System on a Chip, using 5 nanometer technology that could open up opportunities.\n\nWhile the craze over Nvidia continues, thanks to its applications in the emerging AI businesses, there are also examples around how some of the technology companies are fading away as they lagged behind in research and development.\n\nIntel, that was the most popular among chip makers for decades, has been at the receiving end. It is down 12 percent for the year and 40 percent from its peak as it struggles to keep pace with the industry demands.\n\nIn no other field, developments happen as fast as it does in technology.\n\n\"As Intel approached its 50th anniversary in 2018, decay had set in,\" wrote Chris Miller in Chip War. \"Innovation happened elsewhere.\"\n\nThis is an industry where even the likes of Intel are struggling and the stars of yesteryears such as Texas Instruments are out of reckoning.\n\nIt is keeping abreast of the developments that provide valuation edge to technology companies and Nvidia is in the front because it is catering to the industries that are considered to be the future.\n\nIndian investors attempting to capitalise on an investment theme by riding on companies that are in similar businesses but that remotely echo that of Nvidia, may be in for a rude shock when reality dawns.", "source": {"uri": "economictimes.indiatimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

(Reuters)\n\nDays after the ten-for-one stock split, Nvidia surpassed Microsoft as the world's most valuable company. Presently, there are only three companies with over 3 trillion dollars of market cap listed on the Nasdaq stock exchange. Nvidia's market capitalisation hit $3.335 trillion after closing at $135.58, while Microsoft ended the June 18 session with a valuation of $3.315 trillion. Apple is close behind with a market cap of $ 3.285 trillion making the race for the top slot much more interesting.\n\nSince its stock market debut in 1999, Nvidia shares have increased by 591,078 percent. NVIDIA went public on January 22, 1999 at $12/share.\n\nThe US stock market is closed on Wednesday, June 19th, and will reopen on Thursday, June 20th on account of Juneteenth National Independence Day.\n\nNVIDIA has announced it will hold its 2024 Annual Meeting of Stockholders online on Wednesday, June 26, at 9 a.m. PT.\n\nNvidia's stock commenced trading on a ten-for-one split-adjusted basis on Monday, June 10, 2024. \"Thanks to the recent success and performance of Nvidia, the microchip and semiconductor-producing giant, tech stocks are receiving much more attention from investors. Those who missed out on Nvidia's rally are looking to grab onto the next hot tech stock and ride the long-term momentum. With analysts predicting a 10% annual revenue growth in tech-related industries like microchips and semiconductors, it's easy to see why demand is so high,\" says Joel Lim, financial analyst at Trading.biz.\n\nNvidia's climb has pushed the S&P 500 and Nasdaq to new highs. S&P 500 has reached its 30th all-time high this year, driven primarily by robust performances in the tech sector. \"There's not much downside in the markets at the moment as global stock markets continue their upward trajectory,\" says Nigel Green, CEO, deVere Group, one of the world's largest independent financial advisory and asset management organizations.\n\nUnless a Black Swan event occurs, the markets look poised for a rally ahead despite stretched valuations in some sectors. Will the rally depend on US Fed actions from here on? Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell has publicly stated that the existing interest rate range of 5.25% to 5.50% will not be changed.\n\nMany experts were surprised because the conventional assumption from a central bank is to decrease interest rates to stimulate growth. However, Powell is more cautious, arguing that inflation is excessive and must be reduced below 2%. The economy is exhibiting some signs of progress, as the inflation rate has just decreased. As a result, the Fed expects to see more consistent progress before going for rate cuts.\n\n\"The fact that the Federal Reserve left interest rates as they are suggests that they are not rushing things and are inclined to wait and see how the economy pans out,\" says Tobi Amure, a tech analyst at Trading.

I bring this up because holy shit, NVIDIA is now the most valuable company in the world.\n\nI noted this was just a matter of time after they passed Apple in market cap two weeks ago. Now, sure enough, down goes Microsoft.\n\nTo be clear, certainly that company and now even Apple are benefitting from the AI boom cycle, but nothing compared to what NVIDIA is seeing. Here's Tripp Mickle and Joe Rennison for The New York Times:\n\nNvidia's rise is among the fastest in market history. Just two years ago, the company's market valuation was over $400 million. Now, in the span of a year, it has gone from $1 trillion to more than $3 trillion.\n\nOn Tuesday, Nvidia's share price rose 3.6 percent, lifting its value above $3.3 trillion. Microsoft and Apple both fell, ending the day trailing the Silicon Valley chip maker.\n\nIt's just a stunning rise any way you slice the numbers. But is it sustainable?\n\nThe speed at which Nvidia's value has grown has been startling. Apple crossed $1 trillion in August 2018 and became the first $3 trillion company last June. Microsoft also took nearly five years to climb from $1 trillion to $3 trillion.\n\nBut Nvidia's investors are betting more on its potential than on its current profits. Microsoft and Apple generate more than $85 billion in annual profits, while Nvidia generates $42.6 billion.\n\nWhat matters there, of course, is not the number but the growth rate. Stock prices are indicative of future profit potential, not current, and NVIDIA sales tripled in the past year, while Microsoft and Apple have grown (or not grown, in the case of Apple) at rates more reasonable for public companies - let alone companies which are decades old and valued over $3T.\n\nStill, certainly a part - and likely a large part - of the run-up in NVIDIA's stock is simply exuberance, irrational or not, around AI and the notion that NVIDIA is the most straightforward bet to place in that space. It's less like the GameStop nonsense and perhaps more akin to what happened with Tesla a few years ago, when the company was valued far more than all other car companies combined. It still is, but the stock has come back to Earth a bit with the period of exuberance over and the realities of the world setting in.\n\nThe same thing will happen to NVIDIA at some point, but the question is when and how high can the stock go before then? If I knew that, I would place a bet (one way or the other), but the reality is that no one does. I asked ChatGPT to guess recently and - well, it sort of hallucinated. Can you blame it? Trying to parse this stock run, I'd hallucinate too. Kudos to CEO Jensen Huang for keeping it together.\n\nEspecially in the midst of a pretty obvious/cliched market top signal:\n\nNvidia's ascent has made Mr. Huang a celebrity in the tech world. After a computer conference in Taiwan early this month, he was surrounded by attendees who wanted his autograph, including a woman who asked him to sign her chest.\n\nThe company's rise is reminiscent of dot-com era titans like Cisco and Juniper Networks, which built the equipment that ran communications networks for the internet. Cisco's shares increased more than a thousandfold between its initial public offering in 1990 and 2000, when it briefly became the world's most valuable company.\n\nYou hear a lot of folks bring up this Cisco comparison, and so Asa Fitch of The Wall Street Journal went ahead and asked John Chambers, who was CEO of Cisco during their boom time, for his assessment:\n\nJohn Chambers, who was chief executive of Cisco during the dot-com boom, said there are some parallels, but the dynamics of the AI revolution are different from previous ones such as the internet and cloud computing. Chambers, now a venture investor, has made big bets on AI in cybersecurity and other arenas.\n\n\"The implications in terms of the size of the market opportunity is that of the internet and cloud computing combined,\" he said. \"The speed of change is different, the size of the market is different, the stage when the most valuable company was reached is different.\"\n\nAs noted, Chambers is somewhat biased given his current job investing in AI, but that doesn't mean he's wrong.\n\nChambers said Huang was working from a different playbook than Cisco but was facing some similar challenges. Nvidia has a dominant market share, much like Cisco did with its products as the internet grew, and is also fending off rising competition. Also like Nvidia, Cisco benefited from investments before the industry became profitable.\n\n\"We were absolutely in the right spot at the right time, and we knew it, and we went for it,\" Chambers said.\n\nOf course, it didn't end well for Cisco. Not awful, mind you, the company was and is still important and around, of course. But there was roughly two decades of stock stagnation following the Dot Com collapse. Today, Cisco is a $185B company. At its peak in March of 2000, it was valued at $555B.\n\nBack to Fitch on Huang:\n\nWith the rise of the stock, he has taken on an aura of stardom usually reserved for pop singers and athletes, not 61-year-old tech executives. At the company's annual conference in March, Huang gave his keynote speech from a stage at an 11,000-capacity arena; in Taiwan, he was pictured autographing the chest area of a woman's shirt.", "source": {"uri": "spyglass.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "Spyglass"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nvidia", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nvidia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_capitalization", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Market capitalization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cisco", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Cisco"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_York_Times", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The New York Times"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hallucination", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hallucination"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silicon_Valley", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Silicon Valley"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ChatGPT", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "ChatGPT"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tesla,_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tesla, Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jensen_Huang", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jensen Huang"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_T._Chambers", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "John T.

The Information reports that CEO Jensen Huang recently led discussions, expressing concerns about whether leading clients such as Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Microsoft have enough data center capacity to accommodate Nvidia's AI hardware.\n\nHuang questioned if cloud service firms are scaling their infrastructure swiftly enough to handle the increasing volume of Nvidia's GPUs. This could affect Nvidia's revenues, given that AWS and Microsoft have represented a considerable portion of the company's sales lately. Nvidia's internal discussions have led to an intensified effort to ensure that these cloud providers can meet the necessary requirements in terms of space and power to support their orders.\n\nAddressing these capacity constraints, Nvidia is pivoting towards software and cloud services, entering a field where it will directly compete with some of its principal customers. The company is intensifying its own AI research, as illustrated by its new series of open models crafted to produce synthetic data for training large language models (LLMs), its top-performing NV-Embed embedding model, or end-user focused products such as its new Project G-Assist, an AI-powered tool designed to offer real-time support to PC gamers.\n\nThis approach mirrors the challenges previously encountered by hardware-centric companies like Cisco. Huang aims to preempt a similar fate for Nvidia by diversifying its portfolio, ensuring the company is not overly reliant on hardware sales.\n\nNvidia's broadened strategy bears substantial consequences. By branching into software and cloud services, the company is not only seeking new revenue sources but also positioning itself as a comprehensive player in the AI industry.\n\nHowever, this shift might create tensions with existing customers who could perceive Nvidia's new direction as encroaching on their territory.

It has prompted seasoned investors to draw parallel to Cisco Systems of the dotcom bubble that became the darling of investors in the internet age to see its valuations erode when earnings reality dawned. Lazy investors' easy way to profit is to pile on to the 'likes' of companies that are successful in their area of business. Globally, the popular theme playing out these days is the chip, memory chip!\n\nNvidia's rise to the top of the market capitalisation pile has brought in its share of enthusiasts and skeptics. Its eye-popping market value topping $3.3 trillion -- towering above Microsoft, Apple and everything else from Walmart to Meta and Alphabet (Google) -- is making investors search for the next Nvidia.\n\nThat's a natural investor trait.\n\nThe growth of Nvidia is nothing short of a dream. It has prompted seasoned investors to draw parallel to Cisco Systems of the dotcom bubble that became the darling of investors in the internet age to see its valuations erode when earnings reality dawned.\n\nTo be sure, Nvidia, with its chips, is at the heart of the current technology revolution - Artificial Intelligence. Its chips are the most sought after by companies to turn mines of data into meaningful explanations to enhance businesses. That scramble for Nvidia's chips led to the tripling of its revenue in the last quarter to $26 billion compared to a year earlier.\n\nNo wonder the stock has also tripled in value in the past 12 months, and a trillion-dollar value -- equivalent of 7 (yes, 7!) HDFC Banks -- was added in just about four months. Many investors have capitalised on the boom in US tech stocks, thanks to the mutual fund plans that invest in overseas companies.\n\nBut those who did not, appear to have caught on to a locally listed stock that has been into semiconductors, and was backed by private equity firms early in its life. That is Moschip Technologies Ltd., which says it is into \"semiconductor and system design services\".\n\nOn Wednesday, Moschip was up 13 percent at Rs. 231.35, giving it a market capitalisation of Rs. 4,700 crore and more than 7 million shares changing hands on the BSE. That translates into more than 21 times its last year revenues.\n\nIt is also notable that the company in a recent regulatory filing said it had secured an order worth Rs 509.37 crore from the Centre for Development of Advanced Computing (CDAC). It involves the development of a high-performance computing SoC, or System on a Chip, using 5 nanometer technology that could open up opportunities.\n\nWhile the craze over Nvidia continues, thanks to its applications in the emerging AI businesses, there are also examples around how some of the technology companies are fading away as they lagged behind in research and development.\n\nIntel, that was the most popular among chip makers for decades, has been at the receiving end. It is down 12 percent for the year and 40 percent from its peak as it struggles to keep pace with the industry demands.\n\nIn no other field, developments happen as fast as it does in technology.\n\n\"As Intel approached its 50th anniversary in 2018, decay had set in,\" wrote Chris Miller in Chip War. \"Innovation happened elsewhere.\"\n\nThis is an industry where even the likes of Intel are struggling and the stars of yesteryears such as Texas Instruments are out of reckoning.\n\nIt is keeping abreast of the developments that provide valuation edge to technology companies and Nvidia is in the front because it is catering to the industries that are considered to be the future.\n\nIndian investors attempting to capitalise on an investment theme by riding on companies that are in similar businesses but that remotely echo that of Nvidia, may be in for a rude shock when reality dawns.", "source": {"uri": "telecom.economictimes.indiatimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

The suit, led by the Stockholm, Sweden-based investment management firm E. Ohman J:or Fonder AB, seeks unspecified monetary damages.\n\nSanta Clara, California-based Nvidia is a high-flying company that has become one of the biggest beneficiaries of the AI boom, and its market value has surged.\n\nIn 2018, Nvidia's chips became popular for cryptomining, a process that involves performing complex math equations in order to secure cryptocurrencies like bitcoin.\n\nThe plaintiffs in a 2018 lawsuit accused Nvidia and top company officials of violating a U.S. law called the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 by making statements in 2017 and 2018 that falsely downplayed how much of Nvidia's revenue growth came from crypto-related purchases.\n\nThose omissions misled investors and analysts who were interested in understanding the impact of cryptomining on Nvidia's business, the plaintiffs said.\n\nU.S. District Judge Haywood Gilliam Jr. dismissed the lawsuit in 2021 but the San Francisco-based 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in a 2-1 ruling subsequently revived it. The 9th Circuit found that the plaintiffs had adequately alleged that Huang made \"false or misleading statements and did so knowingly or recklessly,\" allowing their case to proceed.\n\nNvidia urged the justices to take up its appeal, arguing that the 9th Circuit's ruling would open the door to \"abusive and speculative litigation.\"\n\nNvidia in 2022 agreed to pay $5.5 million to U.S. authorities to settle charges that it did not properly disclose the impact of cryptomining on its gaming business.\n\nThe justices agreed on June 10 to hear a similar bid by Meta's (META.O)New Tab, opens new tab Facebook to dismiss a private securities fraud lawsuit accusing the social media platform of misleading investors in 2017 and 2018 about the misuse of its user data by the company and third parties.

These groundbreaking innovations are poised to unlock new frontiers for humanity, but they also come with significant risks that cannot be ignored - particularly by stock investors.\n\nWith this primer in mind, the following is a concise overview of the key players in AI, emerging trends, and one novel risk factor investors should bear in mind in the era of ultra-smart machines.\n\nOpenAI creates increasingly sophisticated models that can understand and generate human-like text, while Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) invests billions to accelerate AI development.\n\nFor example, Microsoft, in collaboration with OpenAI, is reportedly planning to build a $100 billion AI-data center designed to power a supercomputer called 'Stargate'. Feasibility issues not withstanding, this herculean effort underscores the industry's intent to transform the world.\n\nNvidia, for its part, plays a crucial role in providing the computational power necessary to train deep learning models with next-generation chips like Blackwell, positioning the company at the epicenter of the AI revolution.\n\nNvidia also has plans to use its proprietary platforms to drive the creation of digital humans, capable of performing a wide array of repetitive, laborious, and boring tasks.\n\nFor investors, this period presents an unprecedented opportunity. Generative AI is forecast to add trillions to the global economy in the coming years.\n\nHow should investors prepare for this trend? AI infrastructure stocks like Microsoft and Nvidia should continue to outperform the S&P 500 over the next five to 10 years due to the unstoppable AI superbuild.\n\nThe AI revolution is not merely knocking at our door. It has already entered our lives, whether we welcome it or not.\n\nAs investors, we must adapt to this technological phase shift by strategically investing in high-quality companies at the forefront of AI innovation.\n\nMicrosoft and Nvidia emerge as top choices due to their deeply entrenched positions in AI architecture.\n\nAeroVironment and Teradyne also deserve consideration as secondary AI plays, given their crucial roles in developing advanced physical AI systems.\n\nMoreover, Meta Platforms and Roblox stand out as key players in the realm of AI-powered virtual reality. These companies are shaping the future of immersive experiences, blurring the lines between the digital and physical worlds.\n\nWe must also recognize the substantial risk of not owning at least some of these AI stocks - or at least an exchange-traded fund (ETF) geared toward this theme.\n\nAI poses an existential threat to numerous legacy industries. Owning a handful of AI-centric stocks like AeroVironment, Microsoft, Meta Platforms, Nvidia, Roblox, and/or Teradyne can hedge a portfolio against this underappreciated risk factor.\n\nAs the AI revolution gains momentum, investors face a crucial choice: either embrace the change and adapt their strategies accordingly or risk being left behind in a world reshaped by technology. After all, the next five to 10 years will likely see traditional portfolio construction strategies underperform due to the transformative nature of AI.\n\nBuying and holding a basket of AI stocks is therefore becoming an urgent necessity. The companies discussed above form the very heart of the AI revolution in many ways, making their shares worth considering as automation, physical AI, and virtual reality become part of the fabric of everyday life.\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Nvidia wasn't one of them.

This increase reflects Nvidia's strong performance in the stock market, with a remarkable 164% growth year-to-date.\n\nThe rise in Nvidia's stock is due to solid earnings and positive market sentiment, making it a more influential part of the ETF's portfolio.\n\nOn the other hand, Apple, which has been a key component of the ETF, will see its share cut drastically to about 4.5%, down from 22%.\n\nThis reduction is part of a broader adjustment within the ETF to balance out past overrepresentation and better reflect the current tech market.\n\nThe financial impact of these changes is significant, involving the acquisition of around $11 billion in Nvidia shares and the sale of about $12 billion in Apple shares.\n\nThis massive reallocation is expected to generate billions of dollars in trading volume, marking one of the most notable trading events in recent ETF history.\n\nSince Nvidia's stock split last week, the company has seen an additional 7% rise in its stock price, showing continued investor confidence and market momentum.\n\nHowever, with the stock climbing 37% since its earnings announcement on May 23, there is growing anticipation of a market correction.\n\nSuch a strong upward trend often leads to pullbacks as investors take profits, indicating potential volatility ahead.\n\nNvidia's current technical indicators suggest the daily 20 simple moving average at $115 could be the first level of support, with the next significant support level likely around the $100 level, which is a psychological support zone.\n\nAfter the closing bell on Monday, June 17, the stock closed at $130.98, trading down by 0.67%.\n\nThis article is from an unpaid external contributor.

(NASDAQ:NVDA) in particular has drawn investments out of the other sectors and even the rest of the tech stocks.\n\nNvidia's Far-reaching Impact: \"Nvidia is sucking the oxygen out of the room,\" said Lumida Wealth co-founder Ram Ahluwalia in a post on X, formerly Twitter.\n\nSharing a chart of the S&P 500 sector indices, he said every sector is hurting except tech. The financial advisor also traced back the declines in other stocks to Nvidia's strength. \"Your [Lululemon Athletica Inc] stock is down because the owner decided to buy $NVDA. Your $SNOW stock is down because the owner decided to buy [NVIDIA].\"\n\nMuch against his earlier expectations that the phenomenon would be limited to techs, every sector seems to be impacted, Ahluwalia said. He went a step further and noted that stocks across the Atlantic were also flat-lining due to the Nvidia pull. \"I believe the 'AI story,' with [NVIDIA] as the leader, is causing the weak breadth stats,\" he said.\n\nAhluwalia's deduction comes amid analysts' concern over a lack of breadth in the current market rally. Granted, the Nasdaq Composite is at a fresh record and the S&P 500 Index is trading just off its record high. But much of the upside is fueled by the strength in Nvidia, Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) - all of which have AI exposure.\n\nThe iShares Russell 2000 ETF (NYSE:IWM), an exchange-traded fund that tracks an index comprising small-cap stocks, is down about 0.5% this year compared to the nearly 14% and 18% gains, respectively, for the broader S&P 500 Index and the Nasdaq Composite Index.\n\n\"I am surprised by how powerful this effect is,\" Ahluwalia said. \"If you told me every sector would be down red and Nvidia and AI friends are sucking the oxygen out of the room at this level, I wouldn't have believed it.\"\n\nMarket strategists have premised their optimism on the AI-frenzy spearheaded by Nvidia. On Sunday, Evercore ISI chief equity and quantitative strategist Julian Emanuel raised his S&P 500 year-end target to 6,000, which suggests a 26% gain for the index this year. He attributed his positive expectations to ebbing inflation and AI fervor that will likely propel stocks even higher.\n\nThe AI bubble may not burst any time soon, analysts say. Deepwater Asset Management's Gene Munster expects that the bubble will last at least three to five years.\n\nIn premarket trading on Monday, Nvidia rose 0.67% to $132.77, according to Benzinga Pro data.\n\nRead Next: As Apple, Nvidia Trade Near All-Time Highs, Jim Cramer Tells Investors To Cash In On AI Stocks: 'Let's Not Be Too Greedy'\n\nPhoto via Shutterstock", "source": {"uri": "uk.investing.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Investing.com UK"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nvidia", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nvidia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Stock"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S&P_500_Index", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "S&P 500 Index"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lululemon_Athletica", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lululemon Athletica"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wealth_management", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wealth management"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta_Platforms", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Meta Platforms"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alphabet_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Alphabet Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_(company)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Amazon (company)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nasdaq_Composite", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nasdaq Composite"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exchange-traded_fund", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Exchange-traded fund"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evercore", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Evercore"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantitative_analysis_(finance)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Quantitative analysis (finance)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russell_2000_Index", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Russell 2000 Index"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Cramer", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jim Cramer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IShares", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "IShares"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_capitalization", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Market capitalization"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks_and_Bonds", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks and Bonds", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Research_and_Analysis", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Research and Analysis", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Major_Companies", "label": "dmoz/Business/Major Companies", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Major_Companies/Publicly_Traded", "label": "dmoz/Business/Major Companies/Publicly Traded", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 84}], "image": "https://i-invdn-com.investing.com/news/moved_LYNXMPEHAH0WT_L.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9658445", "eventUri": "eng-9658445", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.05098039215686279, "wgt": 114, "relevance": 1}

When seeking top AI stocks to buy, I think it's best for investors to focus on top-tier companies with robust resources and expertise. These giants continue to innovate with substantial R&D spending, practical applications, and scalable production capabilities.\n\nGenerative AI has significantly reshaped industries and dominated stock markets, especially during last year's record gains. The recent first-quarter earnings season underscored AI's pervasive influence, with tech firms consistently exceeding analyst forecasts. AI-powered stocks propelled the market to a 10.2% surge in Q1, its strongest since 2019, marking the fifth consecutive quarter of surpassing expectations.\n\nWith that said, here are three leading AI stocks poised to drive significant advancements and shareholder upside over the long-term.\n\nNvidia (NVDA)\n\nNo list of top AI stocks is complete without discussing Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA). The company's CEO Jensen Huang has become a rockstar, for a number of reasons. His strategic leadership for the company and management style has created greater transparency and agility for the world's largest high-performance chip maker to continue to outperform in this current market. In order for AI to be successful as a broad technology, Nvidia's chips are going to be necessary to fuel this revolution.\n\nNVDA stock has continued to surge following its announced 10-for-1 stock split, an indication investors want more of what the company has to offer. Post-split, Nvidia shares opened around $120, a minor drop, though the company's stock price has since minted new highs above $130 per share. Many experts and market watchers believe $150 is a reasonable target by year end, due to the fact Nvidia is perhaps the best example of a prime beneficiary of the AI revolution.\n\nThe company has long led in machine learning benchmarks and continues to expand its dominance. The company's latest MLPerf tests, known as the \"Olympics of machine learning,\" introduced new benchmarks for fine-tuning large language models and graph neural networks. Despite competition from other mega-cap tech players, Nvidia's Hopper architecture (set up in a system featuring 11,616 H100 GPUs) set records in nine benchmarks, including the new ones. This is yet another catalyst investors have to point to as a reason to buy this top AI stock right now.\n\nMicrosoft (MSFT)\n\nCurrently trading at $448 per share and up 20% year-to-date, Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) truly holds a bright future. Its strategic investment in OpenAI and commitment to AI infrastructure solidify its market leadership. With strong cloud revenue and a stable dividend yield, Microsoft remains a top choice for long-term investors.\n\nStarting from September 16, 2024, Microsoft phased out Basic Authentication (username and password) for Outlook clients across personal accounts. This outdated method posed security risks by transmitting credentials without encryption, making users vulnerable to interception by network monitoring tools.\n\nAdditionally, cached credentials could be exploited if a device fell into the wrong hands. The company emphasized its shift to modern authentication ways like multi-factor authentication and token-based systems. This enhances its security offers more against cyber threats.\n\nAs the company continues to integrate AI technology into its business model, Microsoft stands as a key buying opportunity at this point in the AI hype cycle.\n\nPalantir Technologies (PLTR)\n\nSince the company launched its Artificial Intelligence Platform (AIP) last year, Palantir Technologies (NYSE:PLTR) has been progressing well in recent months. The company's bootcamps for organizations successfully converted leads by deploying large language models through AIP, driving a 21% revenue increase in Q1 to $634 million.\n\nIn Q1 2024, Palantir's total revenue rose 21% to $634 million, with government revenue up 16% to $335 million and commercial revenue soaring 27% to $299 million. The company's accelerated commercial revenue growth was driven by increased adoption of its AI platform. Palantir's strategy includes conducting \"bootcamps\" to educate customers on AI deployment, with sessions held for 915 organizations, enhancing customer acquisition.\n\nWith over two decades of experience, Palantir serves both government and commercial sectors. Now trading around $25 per share and up 40% year-to-date, Palantir appears poised for continued growth.\n\nOn the date of publication, Chris MacDonald did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

Since the beginning of 2024, the company's stock has jumped 167%. Over the past five years, it has surged by an impressive 3,450%.\n\nGiven these figures, it's easy to see why many NVIDIA employees who joined the company five or more years ago are likely millionaires today. Additionally, many midlevel managers at NVIDIA reportedly make over $1 million a year, thanks to stock options and the overall appreciation of the company's stock.\n\nHowever, being flush with cash now means that many established Nvidia executives are reportedly operating in \"semiretirement\" mode, which caught the attention of CEO Jensen Huang. They are financially comfortable enough that they don't seem motivated to work as hard as they used to.\n\nDon't Miss:\n\nIn response to questions about 'semiretired' employees, Huang advised all workers to act as the 'CEO' of their own time and be responsible for determining their work ethic. Still, even Huang received a 60% pay boost last fiscal year, and his compensation reached $34.2 million as Nvidia's market value is now $3.2 trillion.\n\nBut not all Nvidia employees think they're rich. As one Nvidia engineer earning $250,000 a year shared with Business Insider, employee salaries at the company are only impressive at first glance. He explained that although some Nvidia employees might be lucky enough to become millionaires, \"a million doesn't go too far.\"\n\nThis engineer, based on the West Coast and having joined Nvidia a few years ago, receives almost half of his base salary in the form of restricted stock units (RSUs) annually. He pointed out that from an outsider's perspective, it might seem like all Nvidia employees are rolling in money, especially with the company's stock skyrocketing.\n\nTrending: A startup that turns videos into games gets backing from Mark Cuban and opens a round for regular investors at $250.\n\nHowever, he clarified that not everyone receives a large number of RSUs as there's a limit on how many stock units employees can get. Even the top performers are capped at receiving 50% of their base salary in stock each year.\n\n\"You will end up cashing your stocks to meet your annual obligations in terms of personal taxes, property taxes, and any other expenses you will have,\" he said.\n\nAs former Tesla director of AI Andrej Karpathy recently pointed out, \"Most people don't HODL, and the government takes half.\" In other words, many Nvidia and Tesla employees could have been millionaires if they hadn't sold their company stock when they immediately could.

and particularly the persistent confidence in Nvidia.\n\nIn fact, the moving averages (MA), oscillators, and the overall readings remain virtually unchanged whether based on NVDA's performance in the last full trading session, the last week, and the month.\n\nThe only notable difference is that the average rating flips from a 'strong buy' to a mere 'buy' when based on the preceding 7 days of trading.\n\nAnalysts are likewise -

The associated price target is $170.00.\n\nIvan Feinseth has given his Buy rating due to a combination of factors that indicate Nvidia's strong position and potential for growth. Feinseth believes Nvidia is a fundamental component of the burgeoning AI investment theme, as the company's efforts in driving AI adoption are expected to substantially increase revenues and cash flow, thereby enhancing shareholder value. He highlights Nvidia's continuous advancements in GPU technology and product innovation as key drivers for the company's performance momentum, ensuring its leadership in the AI space. Additionally, Feinseth points out Nvidia's expanding influence in data centers, fueled by new product launches that will likely contribute to its sustained growth trajectory.\n\nMoreover, Feinseth cites Nvidia's robust growth in gaming revenue, propelled by rising consumer demand for high-quality, immersive gaming experiences and the shift to cloud gaming. Nvidia's strides in autonomous vehicle technology, with growing adoption among OEMs, also play a significant role in the Buy rating. Feinseth notes the enormous investment in global data infrastructure, which is expected to favor Nvidia as accelerated computing becomes more prevalent, especially with AI's integration into products, services, and business processes. The healthcare and life sciences sectors are underscored as major growth avenues for AI and, by extension, for Nvidia. Feinseth concludes that Nvidia's strong financials, including a solid balance sheet and robust cash flow, enable strategic investments, acquisitions, and shareholder value enhancement through dividends and share repurchases, reinforcing the rationale behind his Buy recommendation.\n\nFeinseth covers the Technology sector, focusing on stocks such as Microsoft, Nvidia, and Garmin. According to TipRanks, Feinseth has an average return of 12.2% and a 59.88% success rate on recommended stocks.\n\nIn another report released today, Wells Fargo also assigned a Buy rating to the stock with a $155.00 price target.\n\nTipRanks tracks over 100,000 company insiders, identifying the select few who excel in timing their transactions.

When seeking top AI stocks to buy, I think it's best for investors to focus on top-tier companies with robust resources and expertise. These giants continue to innovate with substantial R&D spending, practical applications, and scalable production capabilities.\n\nGenerative AI has significantly reshaped industries and dominated stock markets, especially during last year's record gains. The recent first-quarter earnings season underscored AI's pervasive influence, with tech firms consistently exceeding analyst forecasts. AI-powered stocks propelled the market to a 10.2% surge in Q1, its strongest since 2019, marking the fifth consecutive quarter of surpassing expectations.\n\nWith that said, here are three leading AI stocks poised to drive significant advancements and shareholder upside over the long-term.\n\nNo list of top AI stocks is complete without discussing Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA). The company's CEO Jensen Huang has become a rockstar, for a number of reasons. His strategic leadership for the company and management style has created greater transparency and agility for the world's largest high-performance chip maker to continue to outperform in this current market. In order for AI to be successful as a broad technology, Nvidia's chips are going to be necessary to fuel this revolution.\n\nNVDA stock has continued to surge following its announced 10-for-1 stock split, an indication investors want more of what the company has to offer. Post-split, Nvidia shares opened around $120, a minor drop, though the company's stock price has since minted new highs above $130 per share. Many experts and market watchers believe $150 is a reasonable target by year end, due to the fact Nvidia is perhaps the best example of a prime beneficiary of the AI revolution.\n\nThe company has long led in machine learning benchmarks and continues to expand its dominance. The company's latest MLPerf tests, known as the \"Olympics of machine learning,\" introduced new benchmarks for fine-tuning large language models and graph neural networks. Despite competition from other mega-cap tech players, Nvidia's Hopper architecture (set up in a system featuring 11,616 H100 GPUs) set records in nine benchmarks, including the new ones. This is yet another catalyst investors have to point to as a reason to buy this top AI stock right now.\n\nCurrently trading at $448 per share and up 20% year-to-date, Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) truly holds a bright future. Its strategic investment in OpenAI and commitment to AI infrastructure solidify its market leadership. With strong cloud revenue and a stable dividend yield, Microsoft remains a top choice for long-term investors.\n\nStarting from September 16, 2024, Microsoft phased out Basic Authentication (username and password) for Outlook clients across personal accounts. This outdated method posed security risks by transmitting credentials without encryption, making users vulnerable to interception by network monitoring tools.\n\nAdditionally, cached credentials could be exploited if a device fell into the wrong hands. The company emphasized its shift to modern authentication ways like multi-factor authentication and token-based systems. This enhances its security offers more against cyber threats.\n\nAs the company continues to integrate AI technology into its business model, Microsoft stands as a key buying opportunity at this point in the AI hype cycle.\n\nSince the company launched its Artificial Intelligence Platform (AIP) last year, Palantir Technologies (NYSE:PLTR) has been progressing well in recent months. The company's bootcamps for organizations successfully converted leads by deploying large language models through AIP, driving a 21% revenue increase in Q1 to $634 million.\n\nIn Q1 2024, Palantir's total revenue rose 21% to $634 million, with government revenue up 16% to $335 million and commercial revenue soaring 27% to $299 million.

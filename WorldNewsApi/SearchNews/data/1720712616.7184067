Although the party has expressed readiness for the July 13 election and has even drawn up its participation plan, it said Sunday that its chances are lean considering that past council elections conducted by the government formed by the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, had always gone the way of the ruling party. The state Publicity Secretary, Alhaji Muhammed Abdullahi, while addressing journalists, said the party is going into the election in the hope that things would be different this time. It would be recalled that the APC had only on Saturday, June 9, issued its aspiration forms for members of the party seeking to contest either as chairman or councillor in their respective local government areas. The party had put its chairmanship nomination and expression of interest forms for aspiring chairmen at N300,000 and N50,000 respectively; while those seeking to be councillors are to pay N50,000 for their nomination form and N10,000 for expression of interest form, respectively. The party had added however that chairmanship aspirants are to pay N10,000 party development levy and N20,000 LGA clearance levy; while aspiring councillors are to pay N5,000 party development levy and another N5,000 for LGA clearance. The total fees for an APC member seeking to be chairman is N380,000; while each aspiring councilor will pay a total of N70,000. The fees are a whole lot lower than those applicable in the ruling PDP in the state which is offering its chairmanship aspiration forms for a total of N10 million and councillorship forms for N120,000. The local government election is to be conducted in all the 21 LGAs of the state by the Adamawa State Independent Electoral Commission, ADSIEC.", "summary": "<img width=\"1200\" height=\"720\" src=\"https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/MixCollage-09-Jun-2024-04-47-PM-6008.jpg\" class=\"webfeedsFeaturedVisual wp-post-image\" alt=\"\" style=\"display: block; margin: auto; margin-bottom: 5px;max-width: 100%;\" link_thumbnail=\"\" decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/MixCollage-09-Jun-2024-04-47-PM-6008.jpg 1200w, https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/MixCollage-09-Jun-2024-04-47-PM-6008-300x180.jpg 300w, https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/MixCollage-09-Jun-2024-04-47-PM-6008-1024x614.jpg 1024w, https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/MixCollage-09-Jun-2024-04-47-PM-6008-1000x600.jpg 1000w, https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/MixCollage-09-Jun-2024-04-47-PM-6008-590x354.jpg 590w, https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/MixCollage-09-Jun-2024-04-47-PM-6008-400x240.jpg 400w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px\" /><p>The All Progressives Congress, APC, in Adamawa State", "url": "https://dailypost.ng/2024/06/09/apc-raises-concerns-over-adamawa-lga-election/", "image": "https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/MixCollage-09-Jun-2024-04-47-PM-6008.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-09 15:56:10", "author": "Jim Ochetenwu", "authors": ["Jim Ochetenwu"], "language": "en", "catgory": "politics", "source_country": "ng", "sentiment": -0.083}

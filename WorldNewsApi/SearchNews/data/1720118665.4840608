We lunched at the Indian Creek Yacht and Country Club (it was a family home after the Civil War, circa 1870) in Kilmarnock. Historic Christ Church (built 1732-35) in Lancaster County still has its original high-backed pews and three-tiered pulpit. We enjoyed the small-town charm on Main Street, Kilmarnock (a deed was recorded in 1778). Our final stop was Ditchley Cider Works and farm in Kilmarnock. We nicknamed the cows Oreos, but they are actually Belted Galloway cows, or Belties. ditchleyciderworks.com ___ Share your adventure Tell us about one favorite part \u2014 a restaurant, a hike, a monument, a hotel room \u2014 of one of your trips.

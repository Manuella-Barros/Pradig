Trump will address supporters and the curious on Thursday in a public park just a few short blocks from the boundary line of Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez's district.\n\n\"I think this is an opportunity Republicans should not let go,\" Valentino said on \"Fox & Friends\" Monday.\n\n\"Throughout the years, I've never heard of a Republican going to the Bronx, so seeing Trump make the effort with everything going on, what is the excuses for Republicans and conservatives?\" he said to Jones.\n\n\"It's crazy to me. I couldn't believe that people from the Bronx wanted to do a rally for Trump. Now I'm hearing that he is coming to the Bronx,\" Valentino said, calling out Democrats for \"dropping the ball.\"\n\n\"You see crime, you see a woman being dragged, with a belt. You see all types of stuff happening in the Bronx, and they're just gaslighting it, acting like it's not happening. So I just think it's the perfect opportunity for people to speak up,\" he said.\n\n\"A lot of bad things are happening. A lot of people can't afford groceries,\" he continued. \"And Trump is speaking to those people in those barbershops or people that just can't afford this lifestyle that they had probably four to five years ago. So this is just a, I think... once in a lifetime opportunity.\"\n\nValentino also noted that Republicans should be paying attention as the presumptive GOP nominee balks at political norms and expectations.\n\n\"The fact that Trump is going there to a spot that is deep blue, that should send a deep message to Republicans once again. Step up your game,\" he said.\n\nValentino was critical of President Joe Biden's recent commencement address to the Morehouse College graduating class in Atlanta, GA.\n\n\"I don't know what is going on with the Democrats this role that they are trying to play,\" Valentino told Jones.\n\n\"Unfortunately, liberals have this way of speaking down on black people,\" he said. \"That lets you know how they really think about you and how Democrats feel they have to do no work to get the black vote or the Hispanic vote. I think that's going to change this year.\"\n\nLifelong Democrat Rev. Ruben Diaz Sr. told \"Fox & Friends\" co-host Steve Doocy later in the show that there has been an \"awakening\" in his party.\n\n\"Our community is getting frustrated day by day with President Biden and the Democrats,\" he said Monday. \"They have been using us for too long, but this time it's too much... the open border... the groceries you can't even purchase. It's gas. Everything. Crime. Abuse against the police officers. Tying up the hands of judges.\"\n\n\"We [are] tired and more, day by day, more and more Hispanic and Black minority [voters]... We are switching. We are changing. We are awakening,\" Diaz continued.\n\n\"We are so mentally conditioned to vote for a Democrat that no matter who is running in the Democratic line, our people go for them, but now, now it's different,\" Diaz said. \"Now people are learning. People are awakening.\"\n\nWe have no tolerance for comments containing violence, racism, profanity, vulgarity, doxing, or discourteous behavior.

Trump will travel to Crotona Park in the Bronx on Thursday for a rally where he no doubt hopes to take a more favorable star turn.\n\nAs expected, many people in the Bronx are not happy about it.\n\nI wish it would go away, said Noel Rivera, a retired subway worker who was walking his dog in Crotona Park Wednesday. No one I know supports him.\n\nMr. Trump's event Thursday evening at the sprawling South Bronx park is his first campaign rally in New York state since 2016.\n\nHis choice of the Bronx may seem strange, since it is one of the most deeply Democratic counties in the country. In 2020, President Biden won the Bronx with 68 percent. In 2016, Mr. Trump lost the Bronx by more than 300,000 votes.\n\nBrian Hughes, a spokesman for the Trump campaign, said the rally was part of an effort by Mr. Trump to ensure that voters who are not traditionally Republican to speak to are seen and heard.\n\nMr. Trump, a lifelong New Yorker who now lives in Florida, spent much of his final weeks in Manhattan during his criminal trial on charges of falsifying business records to conceal a payment to a porn star, who reported having had a sexual relationship. meeting with him in 2006. The defense rested without Mr. Trump speaking; final arguments are scheduled for Tuesday.\n\nAt the rally, Mr. Trump is expected to talk about inflation and violent crime, a campaign spokeswoman said. The gathering is allowed to accommodate 3,500 people, according to police.\n\nWe're making inroads across the city, said Rep. Nicole Malliotakis, the only Republican member of New York City's House delegation. But you have to show up and talk to people about the issues they care about. Right now, those issues are the economy and public safety.\n\nThe Bronx is 57 percent Hispanic, 28 percent black and 8 percent white, according to census date. Recent polls show Mr. Trump gaining ground among some black and Latino voters. Last year, a Republican councilwoman was elected to represent the Bronx for the first time in more than 40 years. Lee Zeldin, the Republican candidate for governor in 2022, is six points behind Gov. Kathy Hochul. But Ms. Hochul beat Mr. Zeldin by 55 percentage points in the Bronx.\n\nRep. Ritchie Torres, a Democrat from the Bronx, said Mr. Trump owes the borough an apology because of its catastrophic handling of the pandemic, which has claimed thousands of lives in the borough.\n\nHe is so unpopular in the Bronx that he is radioactive, Mr. Torres said. Its approval ratings are lower than those of lead and arsenic.\n\nA protest elsewhere in the park is planned at Mr. Trump's rally by Bronx Congresswoman Amanda Septimo and Kirsten John Foy, president of the activism group Arc of Justice.\n\nMr. Foy said the rally, attended by prominent municipal unions, is designed to counter the narrative that Mr. Trump will do much better in places like the Bronx.\n\nHe is trying to distract and deflect attention from the fact that he is facing a criminal charge, Mr. Foy said. The best way to stop making headlines as a criminal and make headlines as a candidate is to organize a rally in the media capital of the world.\n\nOn Wednesday morning, most Crotona Park residents seemed unhappy about Mr. Trump's visit. Maggie Rodriguez, 57, an electrician who was walking her chihuahua in the park, grimaced in front of the site where Team Trump was preparing for the rally.\n\nWe will no longer have a democracy if Mr. Trump is re-elected, she said. God bless America.\n\nBut the feeling was not unanimous. Erica Perez, 37, a store clerk, said she appreciated that Mr. Trump referenced the Bible.\n\nI'm happy he's coming, she said. When Trump was president, America was better.\n\nArsenio Colon, 79, a retired maintenance worker, said he used to vote Democratic but now supports Mr. Trump and the Republican Party because he likes his tough stance on politics foreign with China.\n\nEvery time the Democratic Party is in power, the country has more problems, said Mr. Colon, who lives near the park. This country still needs a strong president.\n\nAs workers prepared a stage for Mr. Trump on Wednesday, a campaign representative asked a New York Times reporter to leave and threatened to call the police, saying the permit allowed the campaign to evict the uninvited guests of the public park.\n\nKaroline Leavitt, a Trump spokeswoman, said park security and law enforcement are notified to assist when an individual refuses to leave the permitted area.\n\nMr. Rivera, who has lived in the Bronx since 1958, said he would need no encouragement to leave the area once the rally began.\n\nHe'd be lucky if he had 35 people here to support him, he said.\n\nMichael Gold and Chelsia Rose Marcius contributed reporting.\n\nWhat Are The Main Benefits Of Comparing Car Insurance Quotes Online",

If you contribute $5 or more now, we can win it all: Donate now!\n\nPolling continues to become more inaccurate, and suspiciously so. For instance, in the recent Democratic Senate primary in Maryland, the polls all showed one candidate ahead the entire time, yet the other candidate won by double digits. The trend we keep seeing is that the polls are drastically under-counting Black voters and youth voters in general. And in general election polling, the polls are somehow showing a sharp rise in Republican support among Black voters and youth voters.\n\nThere is of course nothing to support such a trend. Given the Republican Party's escalating war on women and increasingly blatant racism, there's no real world reason to think such a shift is happening. And each time people actually go out and vote, we're reminded that this \"trend\" does not exist. It wasn't there in 2020. It wasn't there in 2022. It's not there in the one-off elections in 2023 or 2024. It's just an imaginary thing that only exists in the world of polling, and not the world of Earth.\n\nYet even as Trump has announced that he's holding a rally this week in the mostly nonwhite Bronx, we've seen the media suggest that this is a sign of Trump seizing upon his newfound popularity with Black voters. Again, this \"popularity\" does not exist. But since the media is routinely committed to pretending that the most ludicrous pro-Trump poll numbers are accurate (while ignoring all the polls that are good for Biden), the media is now extending this narrative by suggesting that Trump is competitive with Black voters.\n\nMeanwhile back in the real world, Alexandria Ocasio Cortez just pointed out the quite obvious real reason why Trump is holding a rally in the Bronx: he can't go much further. He's on criminal trial in Manhattan four days a week, and while a normal person could get on a plane those other three days and hold a rally in a faraway swing state, Trump is way too feeble for that.\n\nAnd so Trump is mostly limiting his rallies to locales that are close enough to Manhattan that he can make the short trip without completely falling to pieces. The other day Trump's babysitters let him hold a rally in New Jersey, and while that state is not in play, he was at least able to hold it in a part of New Jersey where he's popular.\n\nThis time around Trump is holding a rally even closer to his trial location, just one borough over. Of course Trump has almost no support in The Bronx. President Biden got 83% of the vote in the Bronx in 2020, and Trump only 15% of the vote. It's hard to find a place where Trump is less popular.\n\nBut by holding a rally in the Bronx, Trump has the benefit of not having to travel far, and his rally will allow the media (on both sides) to further hype the false narrative that Trump is suddenly popular with Black voters. As far as bullshitting goes, the Bronx rally is not a bad idea on the part of Trump's babysitters.\n\nThe tricky part is that because Trump is so widely despised in the Bronx, he won't find a supportive crowd there. His supporters will have to travel from other locales where he's more popular (such as Staten Island). And even then, there's the strong potential for large anti-Trump protests alongside his rally.\n\nRegardless of how this rally plays out, keep in mind that the Bronx hates Donald Trump. And most nonwhite voters in general hate Donald Trump. Just look at how poorly he did with these demographics in 2020. He's not somehow more popular with these demographics now. No matter what anyone in the media ends up saying about Trump's Bronx rally, he's as exceedingly unpopular there as ever.", "source": {"uri": "palmerreport.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Palmer Report"}, "authors": [{"uri": "bill_palmer@palmerreport.com", "name": "Bill Palmer", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Bronx", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "The Bronx"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "The Bronx"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "General election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Racism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maryland", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Maryland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Maryland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexandria_Ocasio-Cortez", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swing_state", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Swing state"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manhattan", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Manhattan"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Manhattan"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Jersey", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "New Jersey"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New Jersey"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boroughs_of_New_York_City", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Boroughs of New York City"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Staten_Island", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Staten Island"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Staten Island"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protests_against_Donald_Trump", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Protests against Donald Trump"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Online_Issues_Polls", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Online Issues Polls", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 94}], "image": "https://www.palmerreport.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/donald-trump-1.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9591065", "eventUri": "eng-9591065", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.05882352941176472, "wgt": 180, "relevance": 1}

Trump will travel to Crotona Park in the Bronx on Thursday for a rally where he no doubt hopes to take a more favorable star turn.\n\nAs expected, many people in the Bronx are not happy about it.\n\nI wish it would go away, said Noel Rivera, a retired subway worker who was walking his dog in Crotona Park Wednesday. No one I know supports him.\n\nMr. Trump's event Thursday evening at the sprawling South Bronx park is his first campaign rally in New York state since 2016.\n\nHis choice of the Bronx may seem strange, since it is one of the most deeply Democratic counties in the country. In 2020, President Biden won the Bronx with 68 percent. In 2016, Mr. Trump lost the Bronx by more than 300,000 votes.\n\nBrian Hughes, a spokesman for the Trump campaign, said the rally was part of an effort by Mr. Trump to ensure that voters who are not traditionally Republican to speak to are seen and heard.\n\nMr. Trump, a lifelong New Yorker who now lives in Florida, spent much of his final weeks in Manhattan during his criminal trial on charges of falsifying business records to conceal a payment to a porn star, who reported having had a sexual relationship. meeting with him in 2006. The defense rested without Mr. Trump speaking; final arguments are scheduled for Tuesday.\n\nAt the rally, Mr. Trump is expected to talk about inflation and violent crime, a campaign spokeswoman said. The gathering is allowed to accommodate 3,500 people, according to police.\n\nWe're making inroads across the city, said Rep. Nicole Malliotakis, the only Republican member of New York City's House delegation. But you have to show up and talk to people about the issues they care about. Right now, those issues are the economy and public safety.\n\nThe Bronx is 57 percent Hispanic, 28 percent black and 8 percent white, according to census date. Recent polls show Mr. Trump gaining ground among some black and Latino voters. Last year, a Republican councilwoman was elected to represent the Bronx for the first time in more than 40 years. Lee Zeldin, the Republican candidate for governor in 2022, is six points behind Gov. Kathy Hochul. But Ms. Hochul beat Mr. Zeldin by 55 percentage points in the Bronx.\n\nRep. Ritchie Torres, a Democrat from the Bronx, said Mr. Trump owes the borough an apology because of its catastrophic handling of the pandemic, which has claimed thousands of lives in the borough.\n\nHe is so unpopular in the Bronx that he is radioactive, Mr. Torres said. Its approval ratings are lower than those of lead and arsenic.\n\nA protest elsewhere in the park is planned at Mr. Trump's rally by Bronx Congresswoman Amanda Septimo and Kirsten John Foy, president of the activism group Arc of Justice.\n\nMr. Foy said the rally, attended by prominent municipal unions, is designed to counter the narrative that Mr. Trump will do much better in places like the Bronx.\n\nHe is trying to distract and deflect attention from the fact that he is facing a criminal charge, Mr. Foy said. The best way to stop making headlines as a criminal and make headlines as a candidate is to organize a rally in the media capital of the world.\n\nOn Wednesday morning, most Crotona Park residents seemed unhappy about Mr. Trump's visit. Maggie Rodriguez, 57, an electrician who was walking her chihuahua in the park, grimaced in front of the site where Team Trump was preparing for the rally.\n\nWe will no longer have a democracy if Mr. Trump is re-elected, she said. God bless America.\n\nBut the feeling was not unanimous. Erica Perez, 37, a store clerk, said she appreciated that Mr. Trump referenced the Bible.\n\nI'm happy he's coming, she said. When Trump was president, America was better.\n\nArsenio Colon, 79, a retired maintenance worker, said he used to vote Democratic but now supports Mr. Trump and the Republican Party because he likes his tough stance on politics foreign with China.\n\nEvery time the Democratic Party is in power, the country has more problems, said Mr. Colon, who lives near the park. This country still needs a strong president.\n\nAs workers prepared a stage for Mr. Trump on Wednesday, a campaign representative asked a New York Times reporter to leave and threatened to call the police, saying the permit allowed the campaign to evict the uninvited guests of the public park.\n\nKaroline Leavitt, a Trump spokeswoman, said park security and law enforcement are notified to assist when an individual refuses to leave the permitted area.\n\nMr. Rivera, who has lived in the Bronx since 1958, said he would need no encouragement to leave the area once the rally began.\n\nHe'd be lucky if he had 35 people here to support him, he said.\n\nMichael Gold and Chelsia Rose Marcius contributed reporting.\n\nWhat Are The Main Benefits Of Comparing Car Insurance Quotes Online",

{"id": 231214464, "title": "[SKED 8 a.m. June 8] Bipartisan Congressional Baseball Game Provides Respite From Hyper-Partisanship", "text": "As Sen. Eric Schmitt (R-Mo.) circled the bases after hitting an inside-the-park home run, Rep. Bill Huizenga (R-Mich.) heckled from the bleachers, \u201cIf the rest of the Senate could move that fast, that would be helpful!\u201d These Washington lawmakers have not quit their day jobs. They are practicing for an annual baseball game\u2014officiated by Major League Baseball (MLB) umpires\u2014that allows members of Congress to take a moment away from the deep divisions on Capitol Hill. Republicans and Democrats are preparing to play in the annual Congressional Baseball Game, which will take place on June 12. Proceeds from the seven-inning contest will go to charities such as the Boys & Girls Clubs of Greater Washington. The game will be played at Nationals Park, which is home to the MLB\u2019s Washington Nationals and less than two miles from the Capitol. GOP and Democrat fans each have their own section on the lower level along the first base and third base lines, respectively. Expect the lower bowl to be full, Ryan Thompson, president of the Congressional Sports for Charity Foundation, the game\u2019s organizer, told The Epoch Times on a breezy June 4 evening ahead of practice at the Washington Nationals Youth Baseball Academy in southeast Washington on an immaculately groomed field. Due to high demand, there will also be seating on the second level, said Mr. Thompson, noting that at least 12,000 tickets have been sold. The foundation is looking to raise $2 million in this year\u2019s game to better last year\u2019s effort, which brought in $1.8 million. \u201cI thought it was older than that,\u201d Mr. Williams told The Epoch Times, noting that he has been preaching baseball fundamentals to all of his team members. Mr. Williams, 74, was drafted by the Atlanta Braves in the 1971 MLB Draft, though he never made it to the majors. He coached the baseball team at his alma mater, Texas Christian University. Previously Texas Secretary of State and an owner of car dealerships, he entered the congressional arena in 2013 after feeling that nobody was fighting for him in Washington. The GOP team has been practicing since March 1, according to Mr. Williams. Rep. Greg Steube (R-Fla.) will be the GOP\u2019s starting pitcher. The 46-year-old three-term congressman played outfield at Southeast High School and was picked for the Florida All-State team. He passed on offers to play in college and got an agricultural degree at the University of Florida. During his interview with The Epoch Times, a foul ball flew overhead, almost striking a government-issued vehicle. \u201cGood thing that\u2019s paid for by the government,\u201d he quipped. The GOP team leads the series 45\u201342\u20131 and has won the past three games. The longest win streak is also held by the GOP who got 11 straight wins between 1964 and 1974. Another draw for the fans is that they get swag from the sponsors. In the past that has included CSPAN water bottles and hats as well as Quorum baseball cards of the participants with non-baseball statistics such as the number of bills sponsored. Concessions\u2014from DC staple Ben\u2019s Chili Bowl to nachos and hot dogs\u2014will also be available. The bipartisan event started in 1909 as a collegial competition but turned near-deadly serious in June 2017. During a GOP practice session one day before the game, a supporter of Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) shot House Majority Leader Steve Scalise (R-La.), who was then the House Majority Whip. He was struck in the hip, and the bullet tore into blood vessels, bones, and internal organs. Capitol Police were already on the scene due to the security afforded to Mr. Scalise as a senior member of congressional leadership. The shooter, James Hodgkinson, was taken down by Capitol Police. Before the 2017 game, the players on both teams huddled for a group prayer in a moment of unity in solidarity with their wounded colleague. Seven years later, Mr. Scalise remains thankful that he was able to overcome his injuries. \u201cIt\u2019s always great to just be able to come back out and play ball with my colleagues,\u201d he told The Epoch Times. \u201cThere was a time when I didn\u2019t know if I'd even be able to walk again,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd G-d\u2019s definitely performed a lot of miracles and given me a second chance.\u201d In a more recent successful battle for his life, Mr. Scalise\u2019s cancer is in remission. Given his physical condition, Mr. Scalise will be the first batter for the GOP to have a teammate running the bases for him. Despite the event being designed to allow for differences to be set aside for one night, it does not mean that everyone is on board. Ms. Sanchez gave the one-finger salute to the GOP dugout during the 2022 game, which the GOP won 10-0. The congressional game has aired on CSPAN and, more recently, on Fox Sports in 2022 and FS1 in 2023. For the last two games, Fox News senior congressional correspondent Chad Pergram served as an on-camera reporter and commentator, respectively. Fox News declined to make Mr. Pergram available for an interview. So, the annual event, for at least seven innings, makes it possible for a contentious political rivalry to be transformed into a friendly rivalry. \u201cWe make really good friends on the other side of the aisle,\u201d said Mr. Scalise, adding that \u201cit\u2019s good\u201d to get away from disagreements in the House while raising money for charity. Mr. Steube remarked that he has \u201cgotten to know guys on the Democrat side,\u201d such as Rep. Jimmy Panetta (D-Calif.), \u201cbecause there\u2019s a camaraderie in the game\u201d and, therefore, \u201cit is an opportunity to kind of put the politics aside and play a little baseball.\u201d Still, the competitive spirit remains strong. Mr. Williams said the game is \u201creally not\u201d bipartisan as the Democrats \u201cwant to beat us as bad as we want to beat them.\u201d The GOP and Democrat fans root for their own team, though the game \u201cis not angry like sometimes we are on the House floor.\u201d \u201cThere\u2019s always a lot more intensity when you\u2019re in an election year, especially presidential election year, because you want the right kind of momentum going into November,\u201d said Mr. Scalise. \u201cBut we especially want to win this year to set the table for what\u2019s coming in November.\u201d \u201cWe want to beat them in June, and we\u2019re going to beat them in November,\u201d said Mr. Williams.", "summary": "Proceeds from the seven-inning game go to charities such as the Boys &#38; Girls Clubs of Greater Washington.", "url": "https://www.theepochtimes.com/us/sked-8-a-m-june-8-bipartisan-congressional-baseball-game-provides-respite-from-hyper-partisanship-5661593", "image": "https://img.theepochtimes.com/assets/uploads/2024/06/07/id5664347-unnamed-61-300x180.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-08 12:00:04", "author": "Jackson Richman", "authors": ["Jackson Richman"], "language": "en", "source_country": "us", "sentiment": 0.137}

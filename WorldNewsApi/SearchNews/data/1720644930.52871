Jeff Landry (R) signed a bill on Wednesday requiring transgender individuals to use restrooms and public facilities that match their biological sex, which will take effect on August 1. HB608 is called \u201cThe Women\u2019s Safety and Protection Act,\u201d WBRZ reported, adding: HB608, authored by Rep. Roger Wilder, R-Denham Springs, will segregate all bathrooms, changing and locker rooms, as well as sleeping quarters by sex in public schools, domestic violence shelters and correctional facilities. This would prohibit transgender people from using facilities that align with their gender identity. \u2026 Landry said he was proud to sign the bill, which he said \u201cprotects women\u2019s safety and reinforces the very identity of what it means to be a woman.\u201d \u201cEnough is enough,\u201d Landry said. \u201cLouisiana will not allow biological men to take advantage of opportunities for women.\u201d During its final passage, Wilder said, \u201cWe must defend the dignity, safety, and welfare of all women. I\u2019m standing for the basic understanding that there are biological differences between females and males that create the need for separate privacy spaces for said females and males.\u201d \u201cI would like to simply say that I believe that this is more about love being extended to over half of our population in this state which is female,\u201d he added during his speech in April: \u201cTo each of the men in this body\u2026 Why have we as men allowed this to get to this point?\u201d Representative @RogerWilderIII gives a fiery close on the 'What is a Woman' bill codifying the two sexes into LA law, HB 608. The bill passed 79-16!

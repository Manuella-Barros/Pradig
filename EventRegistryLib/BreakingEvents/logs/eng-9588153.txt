However, analysts tracking space activities have noted its presence within the same orbital ring as USA 314, a substantial NRO satellite launched in April 2021, suggesting a potential convergence in the future.\n\nThe timing of this development is particularly significant, as it occurs amidst U.S. allegations regarding Russia's development of a space-based nuclear weapon, purportedly capable of dismantling entire satellite networks.\n\nAlthough U.S. officials suspect Russia of launching at least one satellite, COSMOS 2553, linked to its nuclear space weapon programme, there is no confirmation of a deployed nuclear weapon in space.\n\nSince the onset of the conflict in Ukraine in February 2022, Russia has adopted a veil of secrecy around its space activities, concurrently issuing threats directed towards U.S. satellites supporting Ukrainian military operations. This includes SpaceX's Starlink, a sprawling network of thousands of internet satellites positioned in low-Earth orbit.\n\nThe U.S. and Russia have engaged in contentious exchanges at the United Nations Security Council regarding the use and regulation of satellite weaponry, underscoring the escalating tensions and strategic implications of developments in space exploration and militarisation.", "source": {"uri": "eutoday.net", "dataType": "news", "title": "eutoday.net"}, "authors": [{"uri": "eutoday_correspondents@eutoday.net", "name": "EUToday Correspondents", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spacecraft", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Spacecraft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbit", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Orbit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satellite", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Satellite"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Russia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reconnaissance_satellite", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Reconnaissance satellite"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low_Earth_orbit", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Low Earth orbit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Space_Command", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Space Command"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soyuz_(rocket_family)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Soyuz (rocket family)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Reconnaissance_Office", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National Reconnaissance Office"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plesetsk_Cosmodrome", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Plesetsk Cosmodrome"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_Armed_Forces", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Russian Armed Forces"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moscow", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Moscow"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Moscow"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_weapon", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nuclear weapon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_government_of_the_United_States", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Federal government of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russo-Ukrainian_War", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Russo-Ukrainian War"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starlink", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Starlink"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Security_Council", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United Nations Security Council"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_exploration", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Space exploration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "SpaceX"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Internet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reuters", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Reuters"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukraine", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Space", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Space", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace_and_Defense/Space", "label": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace and Defense/Space", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Television/Satellite", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Television/Satellite", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Models/Rockets", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Models/Rockets", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 76}], "image": "https://eutoday.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/signal-2022-12-18-112058-300x58.jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9588153", "eventUri": "eng-9588153", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-16", "textStart": 122, "textEnd": 128}], "sentiment": -0.1137254901960785, "wgt": 209, "relevance": 1}

launched a satellite last week that it says may be capable of attacking other similar probes.\n\n\"Russia has launched a satellite into low Earth orbit that we believe is likely an anti-space weapon,\" Pentagon spokesman Brigadier General Pat Ryder said Tuesday evening.\n\nIt is in the \"same orbit\" as a U.S. government satellite, he said, adding that Washington would continue to monitor the situation and must be prepared to protect its interests.\n\nRussia has not publicly commented on the matter.\n\nMoscow and Washington - two global rivals - have clashed repeatedly over the issue of space weapons at the UN in recent weeks, with both sides accusing each other of seeking to militarize space.\n\nOn Tuesday, Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said the United States was seeking to transform space into an \"arena of military confrontation.\"\n\nA number of military experts have long warned that space will likely be the next frontier of warfare in a world increasingly dependent on technology.\n\nOn Tuesday, General Ryder said the Pentagon believed the Russian satellite was \"likely capable of attacking other satellites in low Earth orbit.\"\n\n\"Russia has deployed this new anti-space weapon in the same orbit as a US government satellite.\n\n\"Thus, the assessments further indicate characteristics resembling previously deployed anti-space payloads, from 2019 to 2022.\n\n\"We have a responsibility to be prepared to protect and defend the space domain, and to ensure continued and uninterrupted support to the Joint and Combined Force,\" added the Pentagon spokesperson.\n\nSeparately, a spokesperson for the US Space Command told the Reuters news agency that the satellite was \"likely an anti-space weapon, likely capable of attacking other satellites in low Earth orbit.\"\n\nThe spokesperson said the satellite - Cosmos 2576 - was launched on May 16 from Russia's Plesetsk cosmodrome, about 800 kilometers north of Moscow.\n\nIn its statement, Russian space agency Roskosmos said the May 17 launch was \"in the interests of the Ministry of Defense of the Russian Federation.\" It said its Soyuz-2.1b launcher had been used.\n\nThe different announced launch dates could be explained by the fact that the Moscow time zone is three hours ahead of GMT.\n\nNeither Moscow nor Washington provided further details.\n\nBut space analysts say Cosmos 2576 appears to be in the same orbit as the American satellite USA 314.\n\nSince launching a full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, Russia has warned that US satellites aiding the Ukrainian military could become legitimate targets.\n\nIn February, the White House admitted that Russia was developing a \"worrisome\" new space weapon, but insisted it had not yet deployed it.\n\nThis came after a senior Republican congressman issued a cryptic warning about a serious national security threat, sparking intense rumors around Washington DC.\n\nA report released last year by the Washington, DC-based Center for Strategic and International Studies suggests that Russia is developing a range of anti-satellite (ASAT) weapons, including a missile that was successfully tested against a defunct satellite of the Soviet era in November 2021. .\n\nWhat Are The Main Benefits Of Comparing Car Insurance Quotes Online", "source": {"uri": "exbulletin.com", "dataType": "news",

(Russian State Space Corporation ROSCOSMOS/Handout via Reuters)\n\nU.S. military and diplomatic officials claimed this week that Russia has likely launched a new \"counter-space weapon\" that could threaten satellite networks.\n\nAmbassador Robert Wood, the U.S. alternate representative for special political affairs in the United Nations, first alluded to the suspected Russian space weapon launch in remarks at the U.N. Security Council on Monday, ahead of a vote on a Russian-drafted resolution to ban weapons of any kind in space.\n\nMr. Wood noted Russia had vetoed an earlier proposal before the Security Council to ban the development of nuclear weapons intended for placement in Earth's orbit, and said this new Russian proposal was prepared in \"a hasty process that did not take into account legitimate, repeated, and shared concerns by a majority of this Council.\"\n\nMr. Wood referenced the suspected Russian space launch in his remarks urging other Security Council members to vote against the Russian proposal.\n\n\"Just last week, on May 16, Russia launched a satellite into low Earth orbit that the United States assesses is likely a counter-space weapon presumably capable of attacking other satellites in low Earth orbit. Russia deployed this new counter-space weapon into the same orbit as a U.S. government satellite,\" Mr. Wood said. \"Russia's May 16 launch follows prior Russian satellite launches likely of counter-space systems to low Earth orbit in 2019 and 2022.\"\n\nAlgeria, China, Ecuador, Guyana, Mozambique, and Sierra Leone voted with the Russian Federation in favor of their proposal. France, Japan, Malta, the Republic of Korea, Slovenia, the United Kingdom, and the United States voted against the proposal, and the council's 15th member, Switzerland, abstained from voting.\n\nPentagon press secretary Air Force Maj. Gen. Pat Ryder reaffirmed the U.S. concerns about the May 16 Russian space launch while addressing reporters during a press briefing on Tuesday.\n\n\"Russia launched a satellite into low Earth orbit that we - that we assess is likely a counter-space weapon presumably capable of attacking other satellites in low Earth orbit,\" Maj. Gen. Ryder said. \"Russia deployed this new counter-space weapon into the same orbit as a U.S. government satellite. And so assessments further indicate characteristics resembling previously deployed counter-space payloads from 2019 and 2022. And so, you know, obviously, that's something that we'll continue to monitor.\"\n\nMaj. Gen. Ryder said the United States has a responsibility to defend \"protect and defend\" the space domain. \"We'll continue to balance the need to protect our interests in space with our desire to preserve a stable and sustainable space environment.\"\n\nThe term \"counter-space weapon\" can encompass a variety of capabilities, from missiles and other kinetic systems designed to physically destroy satellites, and grappling devices used to grab and drag satellites out of their orbit, to laser dazzlers intended to blind space-based optical sensors used for surveillance.\n\nBeyond describing the orbit path of the newly launched Russian satellite, Maj. Gen. Ryder offered few additional details on how the U.S. government believes the Russian satellite could attack or disrupt other satellites in orbit.\n\nThe U.S. government has raised concerns in recent years about what Russia claims are \"inspector\" craft, which can deploy from their satellites and approach other objects in space. U.S. Space Command (SPACECOM) stated that the suspected Russian space launch on May 16 was carrying one of these inspector satellites.\n\nNTD News reached out to U.S. SPACECOM for further details about this claim but did not receive a response by publication time.\n\nRussia's Roscosmos space agency said in a social media post shortly after midnight local time on May 17 that one of its latest space launches entailed a launch vehicle carrying an unspecified \"spacecraft\" on board.\n\nRussian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov accused the U.S. government of spreading false claims about the May 16 Russian satellite launch.\n\n\"I don't think that we should respond to any fake news injected by Washington,\" Mr. Ryabkov told the Russian state-sponsored TASS news agency on Tuesday, following Maj. Gen. Ryder's remarks.\n\nMr. Ryabkov said Russia has consistently opposed placing attack weapons in low-Earth orbit. He told TASS that Russia has launched a variety of satellites, including those intended to strengthen Russian defense capabilities, and insisted that this fact is not newsworthy.\n\n\"That is why, the Americans can say whatever they like and our policy will not change from that,\" Mr. Ryabkov added.\n\nThe Russian official said that if the United States were truly interested in preserving security in the space domain, it would reconsider its opposition to Russia's recent proposal against the deployment of any weapons in space.", "source": {"uri": "ntd.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NTD"},

But on Tuesday, U.S. Space Command said Russia had launched an anti-satellite weapon.\n\nThe United States pointed a launch earlier this month of a Soyuz rocket from Russia's Plesetsk launch site. Russia's defence ministry said the May 17 launch had a spacecraft on board but gave no details what it was for.\n\nU.S. Space Command said the launch was a likely a counterspace weapon capable of attacking other satellites in low Earth orbit.\n\n\"I don't think we should respond to any fake news from Washington,\" Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov was quoted as saying by the Interfax news agency about the U.S. claims.\n\n\"The Americans can say whatever they want but our policy does not change from this,\" said Ryabkov, adding that Moscow had \"always consistently opposed the deployment of strike weapons in low-Earth orbit.\"\n\nPresident Vladimir Putin and his then defence minister, Sergei Shoigu, denied U.S. assertions in February that Russia was developing a space-based anti-satellite nuclear weapon designed to disrupt everything from military communications to phone-based ride services.\n\nU.S. Space Command said the May launch, which it dates as May 16, included COSMOS 2576, a type of Russian military \"inspector\" spacecraft that U.S. officials have long said exhibits reckless space behaviour.\n\nU.S. intelligence agencies had been expecting the launch of COSMOS 2576 and informed allies of their assessment of the satellite before its deployment in space, according to a U.S. official familiar with the intelligence. The launch also included civilian satellites deployed to different orbits.\n\nCOSMOS 2576, as of Tuesday, has not gone near a U.S. satellite, but space analysts observed it to be in the same orbital ring as USA 314, a bus-sized NRO satellite launched in April 2021.\n\nRyabkov said that Russia's space programme was developing as planned, including tasks aimed at strengthening defence capability but added that \"this is also not news\".\n\nHe said the United States was wrong to have dismissed Russian proposals on strengthening the security of space activities, including a proposal on developing a treaty on preventing an arms race in space.\n\n(Reporting by Reuters; Writing by Guy Faulconbridge; Editing by Andrew Osborn)", "source": {"uri": "aol.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

The launch also included civilian satellites deployed to different orbits.\n\nCOSMOS 2576, as of Tuesday, has not gone near a U.S. satellite, but space analysts observed it to be in the same orbital ring as USA 314, a bus-sized NRO satellite launched in April 2021.\n\nRyabkov said that Russia's space programme was developing as planned, including tasks aimed at strengthening defence capability but added that \"this is also not news\".\n\nHe said the United States was wrong to have dismissed Russian proposals on strengthening the security of space activities, including a proposal on developing a treaty on preventing an arms race in space.\n\n(Reporting by Reuters; Writing by Guy Faulconbridge; Editing by Andrew Osborn)", "source": {"uri": "usnews.com", "dataType": "news",

Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov asserted on Wednesday that there's been no violation of international law after the Pentagon again charged that Russia launched a satellite carrying a counterspace weapon. Another top Russian official decried this as \"fake news\".\n\nUS Department of Defense spokesman Maj. Gen. Pat Ryder on Tuesday in a briefing said that on May 16 Russia \"launched a satellite into low Earth orbit that we that we assess is likely a counter space weapon presumably capable of attacking other satellites in low Earth orbit.\" This was in apparent reference to the launch of a Soyuz rocket from the Plesetsk launch site, which Russia has previously affirmed was carrying a spacecraft of some type.\n\n\"Russia deployed this new counter space weapon into the same orbit as a U.S. government satellite,\" Ryder continued. \"And so assessments further indicate characteristics resembling previously deployed counter space payloads from 2019 and 2022.\"\n\nPeskov's response Wednesday was as follows: \"I cannot comment on this in any way. Here, we act absolutely in accordance with international law, we do not violate anything.\"\n\nImportantly, he said that Russia has repeated reached out in hopes of advancing talks with the US to prohibit certain types of weapons in space, but this was rejected. \"We have repeatedly advocated for a ban on the launch of any weapons into space. Unfortunately, these initiatives of ours were rejected, including by the United States,\" Peskov said.\n\nSeparately, Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov has flatly rejected the Pentagon's charge. \"I don't think we should respond to any fake news from Washington,\" he said as quoted by Interfax.\n\n\"The Americans can say whatever they want but our policy does not change from this,\" said Ryabkov. He stressed that Moscow had \"always consistently opposed the deployment of strike weapons in low-Earth orbit.\"\n\nCurrently allegations are also flying in major Western media outlets alleging that Russia has for years been pursuing a robust space weapons program. For example, days ago The Wall Street Journal detailed a secretive launch that happened some two years ago, based on US officials revealing the info:\n\nRussia launched a satellite into space in February 2022 that is designed to test components for a potential antisatellite weapon that would carry a nuclear device, U.S. officials said.\n\nThe satellite that was launched doesn't carry a nuclear weapon. But U.S. officials say it is linked to a continuing Russian nuclear antisatellite program that has been a growing worry for the Biden administration, Congress and experts outside the government in recent months. The weapon, if deployed, would give Moscow the ability to destroy hundreds of satellites in low Earth orbit with a nuclear blast.\n\nThe satellite in question, known as Cosmos-2553, was launched on Feb. 5, 2022, and is still traveling around the Earth in an unusual orbit. It has been secretly operating as a research and development platform for nonnuclear components of the new weapon system, which Russia has yet to deploy, other officials said.\n\nPutin's rebuttal of recent US allegations was issued back in February:\n\nRevelation of that launch is said to have in part driven the recent frenzy of Congressional statements raising the alarm over Russian malign activities in space. However, others cited in the same WSJ report have said that Russia's program has yet to advance very far.\n\nMeanwhile President Putin himself has tried to bat down the allegations as well, saying recently, \"Our position is clear and transparent: We have always been categorically against, and are now against, the placement of nuclear weapons in space.\"", "source": {"uri": "zerohedge.com",

Gen. Patrick Ryder told reporters Tuesday that it had assessed that Moscow had launched a satellite into low Earth orbit last week that was \"likely a counterspace weapon presumably capable of attacking other satellites in low Earth orbit.\"\n\n\"Russia deployed this new counterspace weapon into the same orbit as a U.S. government satellite,\" Ryder said, noting that it could pose a possible threat to the satellite and would continue to be monitored. \"We'll continue to balance the need to protect our interests in space with our desire to preserve a stable and sustainable space environment.\"\n\nThe Kremlin dismissed the claims Wednesday, suggesting that its recent space launch had not broken international law. \"We are not violating anything,\" Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters Wednesday. \"We have repeatedly advocated bans on the launch of any weapons into space; unfortunately, these initiatives have been rejected, including by the United States of America.\"\n\nThe tension was sparked by a Russian launch carried out May 17. Russia's Ministry of Defense and state space agency Roscosmos posted statements last week confirming that Russia's air and space forces had carried out a launch of what it described as a Soyuz-2.1b launch vehicle from Russia's Plesetsk cosmodrome in the far north of the country.\n\nExperts said the competing claims were inconclusive. Some said they would not describe the Russian launch as a weapon.\n\nJonathan McDowell, an astronomer at the Harvard & Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics, said the satellite \"appears to be one of a series of Russian inspector satellites that 'shadow' U.S. spy sats at a generous distance of 50 km or more.\"\n\n\"I do not believe that it is a weapon,\" McDowell added. \"I do not think it is a real threat to U.S. satellites.\"\n\nRussia launched a similar system several years ago in an apparent test, said Todd Harrison, a senior fellow with the American Enterprise Institute. \"That system deployed a sub-satellite and then appeared to fire a projectile,\" said Harrison. \"It also appears that it can do close inspection and surveillance of satellites.\"\n\nBoth sides were ambiguous in their descriptions of last week's launch and its impact, said Bleddyn Bowen, an associate professor of international relations at the University of Leicester who has written books on space warfare and astropolitics.\n\n\"All we know is that [the satellite] it's been put into a certain orbital flight path,\" which presumably clashes with the United States' interests, Bowen said. This could present a risk of \"collision,\" but \"I wouldn't rush to call it an antisatellite weapon yet,\" he added.\n\nHowever, the dispute shows the growing debate about warfare in space. Bowen said that with powers such as China, India, Russia and the United States active in space, \"the risk of space warfare happening is very real.\"\n\nRussia and the United States have proposed rival resolutions to the U.N. Security Council in recent weeks, though neither passed. Russia vetoed a U.S.-led resolution last month that Washington said was designed to prevent a nuclear arms race in space.\n\nThe Security Council on Monday did not pass a Russia-backed proposal, co-sponsored by China, that aimed to prevent \"for all time\" the use of any weapons in space. Ahead of the vote, U.S. deputy ambassador Robert Wood accused Russia of \"gaslighting\" on the issue and stated Russia had launched likely \"counterspace weapons\" into low orbit in 2019, 2022 and last week.\n\nRussia's Foreign Ministry called the results of the vote on the draft U.N. resolution \"disappointing\" on Tuesday and accused the United States of militarizing space.\n\n\"The United States and its allies, despite all the steps we have taken to consider their proposals ... opposed our constructive, comprehensive initiative,\" spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said. \"They have once again demonstrated their true priorities in the space area, aimed not at keeping space free of weapons of any kind, but at placing weapons in outer space and turning it into an arena for military confrontation.\"\n\nA U.S. Space Command spokesperson said in a statement Wednesday that the Russian satellite was \"likely a counterspace weapon presumably capable of attacking other satellites in low Earth orbit.\" The statement added that \"even as Moscow backs space arms control negotiations, Russia continues to research, develop, test, and deploy a suite of counterspace systems that threaten the safety and stability of the domain.\"\n\nClay Moltz, a professor at the Naval Postgraduate School and author of books on space security and conflict, said space warfare \"has already been occurring\" for many years, largely in the form of jamming satellite signals. \"But there have been no kinetic attacks or nuclear explosions except in national weapons testing programs,\" he added.\n\n\"As space becomes more and more crowded ... countries are nervous about possible attacks on their assets,\" Moltz said. \"Such a [space] war is certainly possible, but it would be damaging to all of humanity.\"", "source": {"uri": "adn.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Anchorage Daily News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low_Earth_orbit", "type":

The spokesperson for the US Space Command stated that they have observed \"nominal activity and assess it is likely a counterspace weapon presumably capable of attacking other satellites in low Earth orbit.\"\n\nThe spokesperson for the US Space Command further noted that, \"Russia deployed this new counterspace weapon into the same orbit as a US government satellite.\" The COSMOS 2576 is similar to previously launched counterspace payloads from 2019 as well as 2022. These past instances involved Russia positioning satellites in close proximity to sensitive US spy satellites, raising concerns among American officials. Prior to the launch of COSMOS 2576, US intelligence agencies had anticipated its deployment and informed their allies accordingly.\n\nThe launch of COSMOS 2576 also included the deployment of civilian satellites to different orbits, a move not seen before in a Russian launch.

According to the US Space Command (USSPACECOM), the satellite, designated Cosmos 2576, was launched on May 16 and is currently trailing a US spy satellite in low-Earth orbit.\n\n\"Russia deployed this new counterspace weapon into the same orbit as a US government satellite,\" a USSPACECOM spokesperson stated.\"We have observed nominal activity and assess it is likely a counterspace weapon presumably capable of attacking other satellites in low Earth orbit.\"\n\nThe launch, which took place at Russia's Plesetsk launch site approximately 800 kilometers north of Moscow, included at least nine satellites.

Bart Hendrickx, a long-time analyst of Russia's space program, remarked, \"This mix of military and civilian payloads was totally unexpected.

These earlier satellites exhibited behavior such as ejecting objects into space and closely following US National Reconnaissance Office (NRO) satellites. Although Cosmos 2576 has not yet approached a US satellite, it is currently in the same orbital ring as USA 314, an NRO satellite launched in April 2021, and appears to be closing the gap, a South China Morning Post report said.\n\nThe deployment of Cosmos 2576 has heightened tensions between the US and Russia, especially amid ongoing conflicts such as Russia's invasion of Ukraine. The US has accused Russia of developing a space-based nuclear weapon capable of destroying satellite networks, although officials note that no nuclear weapon has been deployed in space.\n\nSince the start of the Ukraine conflict in February 2022, Russia has increased the secrecy of its space activities and has threatened to attack US satellites that aid Ukrainian defense efforts, such as SpaceX's Starlink network.\n\nThe issue of satellite weapons has been a contentious point at the United Nations Security Council, where the US and Russia have been in dispute over space militarization. The US continues to monitor Cosmos 2576 and its potential threat to American space assets.\n\nAt TOI World Desk, our dedicated team of seasoned journalists and passionate writers tirelessly sifts through the vast tapestry of global events to bring you the latest news and diverse perspectives round the clock.

Space Command announced.\n\n\"We have observed nominal activity and assess it is likely a counterspace weapon presumably capable of attacking other satellites in low-Earth orbit,\" a USSPACECOM spokesperson said in a statement.\n\n\"Russia deployed this new counterspace weapon into the same orbit as a U.S. government satellite,\" the statement warned.\n\nAs of Tuesday, COSMOS 2576 had not gone near a US satellite, but space analysts said it was in the same orbital ring as USA 314, which was launched in April 2021.\n\nThe Kremlin, however, dismissed the claim as \"fake news\" on Wednesday.\n\n\"The Americans can say whatever they want but our policy does not change from this,\" Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov scoffed\n\nMoscow had \"always consistently opposed the deployment of strike weapons in low-Earth orbit,\" Ryabkov insisted.\n\nThe Russian defense ministry confirmed there was a space launch last week, but did not provide any details about its purpose.\n\nIn February, President Vladimir Putin and then-defense minister Sergei Shoigu denied US claims that Russia was working on a space-based anti-satellite nuclear weapon.\n\nThe deployment of nuclear weapons in space would be aimed at disrupting enemy communications, as well as key scientific and military resources, current and former officials suggested at the time.\n\nThe suggestion also came just as House Intelligence Committee Chairman Mike Turner(R-Ohio) made a cryptic comment about a \"serious national security threat.\"\n\nIn recent weeks, the US and Russia clashed over the topic of space weapons at the United Nations - with both powers accusing the other of trying to militarize space, the BBC noted.\n\n\"We have a responsibility to be ready to protect and defend, the domain, the space domain, and ensure continuous and uninterrupted support to the Joint and Combined Force,\" Pentagon spokesman Brig Gen Pat Ryder said Tuesday evening.", "source": {"uri": "nypost.com",

other members of the Security Council in voting down a Russian non-proliferation resolution at the United Nations.\n\n\"They have once again demonstrated that their true priorities in the area of outer space are aimed not at keeping space free from weapons of any kind, but at placing weapons in space and turning it into an arena for military confrontation,\" Russian foreign ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said in a statement.\n\nThe world powers have traded accusations over weaponizing space in recent months.\n\nThey have proposed rival non-proliferation resolutions at the UN as part of the spat.\n\nRussia vetoed the US initiative last month, while Moscow's proposal failed after receiving only seven votes in support, with seven against, and one abstention, on Monday.\n\nUS envoy Robert Wood said Russia's proposal, which called on all countries to \"take urgent measures to prevent for all time the placement of weapons in outer space\", was a distraction and accused Moscow of \"diplomatic gaslighting\".\n\nHe said that Russia's \"likely\" counter-space weapon was \"presumably capable of attacking other satellites in low Earth orbit\".\n\n\"Russia deployed this new counter-space weapon into the same orbit as a US government satellite,\" he said in remarks ahead of Monday's vote.\n\n\"Russia's May 16 launch follows prior Russian satellite launches likely of counter-space systems to low Earth orbit in 2019 and 2022.\"\n\nIn February, the White House said Russia was developing an anti-satellite weapon, the existence of which was confirmed after lawmakers warned of an unspecified but serious threat to national security.\n\nSpace has been a rare area where the two countries have maintained a degree of cooperation despite a swathe of Western sanctions and dire relations after Russia's invasion of Ukraine.\n\nBoth countries ferry each other's crew members to and from the International Space Station (ISS), where their astronauts are jointly stationed.\n\nThe space weapon spat between Moscow and Washington resurrects the specter of space being militarized despite the 1967 Outer Space Treaty which forbids countries from deploying \"any objects carrying nuclear weapons or any other kinds of weapons of mass destruction\" into orbit or outer space.", "source": {"uri": "spacewar.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "SpaceWar"}, "authors":

The Russian satellite \"is likely a counter-space weapon presumably capable of attacking other satellites in low Earth orbit,\" Major General Patrick Ryder said during the Pentagon press briefing.\n\n\"Russia deployed this new counter-space weapon into the same orbit as a US government satellite,\" he added. \"And so assessments further indicate characteristics resembling previously deployed counter-space payloads from 2019 and 2022.\"\n\nRyder didn't elaborate or mention what this new satellite might be carrying. But last week, Russian space agency Roscosmos announced it had launched a mysterious spacecraft on behalf of the country's Ministry of Defense.\n\nUS intelligence is concerned about the Russian government detonating nuclear weapons in space to disable satellites. Earlier this month, a US defense official told lawmakers that such a nuclear blast would release an electromagnetic pulse and disrupt orbiting satellites with a surge of radiation.\n\n\"Several analysts do believe that a detonation in space of the right magnitude and in the right location could render low-Earth orbit, for example, unusable for some period of time,\" said Assistant Secretary of Defense for Space Policy John Plumb.\n\nIn 2021, Russia also used a missile test to take down one of its own satellites, which caused debris to fill parts of low-Earth orbit temporarily.\n\nSuch attacks pose a particular danger to SpaceX's satellite internet system, Starlink, which now has about 6,000 satellites in low-Earth orbit. The Kremlin has repeatedly threatened to attack Starlink, citing its role in supplying internet access to Ukraine and over claims that the US is using the satellite technology to militarize space.\n\nHowever, the Russian government is denying it launched an anti-satellite weapon last week. \"I don't think that we should respond to any fake news injected by Washington,\" a Russian deputy foreign minister told reporters.\n\n\"We have always spoken consistently against placing attack weapons in near-Earth orbit.

rare area where the two countries have maintained a degree of cooperation despite a swathe of Western sanctions and dire relations after Russia's invasion of Ukraine.\n\nBoth countries ferry each

And we'll continue to balance the need to protect our interests in space with our desire to preserve a stable and sustainable space environment.\"\n\nThis news comes on the heels of American security officials sounding the alarm earlier this year that Russia planned to send a nuclear space weapon -- an anti-satellite probe, essentially -- or even a dummy version of it into orbit. Security leaks to news media indicated that it would be capable of emitting a powerful energy wave that would disable other satellites, even ones sent into space by Russia.\n\nSuch a weapon would be in violation of the 1967 Outer Space Treaty, which \"forbids countries from deploying 'nuclear weapons or any other kinds of weapons of mass destruction' in outer space.\"\n\nCould this mysterious probe launched into space last week be the nuclear weapon that American security officials have been warning about? It's tough to say, but the Russians flatly denied the Pentagon's assertions that last week's launch was a space weapon.\n\n\"I don't think that we should respond to any information leak from Washington,\" said Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov to journalists in Moscow, as quoted by ABC News. \"The Russian space program is developing as planned, launches of spacecraft for various purposes, including devices that solve the problem of strengthening our defense capability, this is also not news.\"\n\nThat's somewhat hard to believe; back in 2021, Russia blew up a satellite with a missile in a military exercise, forcing the crew of the International Space Station to cower and prompting an outraged international response.", "source": {"uri": "futurism.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Futurism"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbit", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Orbit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satellite", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Satellite"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Pentagon", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "The Pentagon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Russia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_weapon", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Space weapon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "BBC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Militarisation_of_space", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Militarisation of space"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low_Earth_orbit", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Low Earth orbit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_security", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National security"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_government_of_the_United_States", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Federal government of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-satellite_weapon", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Anti-satellite weapon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_environment", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Space environment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ABC_News", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "ABC News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_weapon", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nuclear weapon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roscosmos", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Roscosmos"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_exercise", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Military exercise"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outer_Space_Treaty", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Outer Space Treaty"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Space_Station", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "International Space Station"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sergei_Ryabkov", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sergei Ryabkov"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ministry_of_Foreign_Affairs_(Russia)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Russia)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spacecraft", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Spacecraft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outer_space", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Outer space"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weapon_of_mass_destruction", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Weapon of mass destruction"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington,_D.C.", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moscow", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Moscow"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Moscow"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Space", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Space", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace_and_Defense/Space", "label": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace and Defense/Space", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Television/Satellite", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Television/Satellite", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Models/Rockets", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Models/Rockets", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 64}], "image": "https://wp-assets.futurism.com/2024/05/pentagon-russia-orbital-weapon.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9588153", "eventUri": "eng-9588153", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1450980392156862, "wgt": 185, "relevance": 1}

But on Tuesday, U.S. Space Command said Russia had launched an\n\nanti-satellite weapon\n\n.\n\nThe United States pointed a launch earlier this month of a Soyuz rocket from Russia's Plesetsk launch site. Russia's\n\ndefence ministry\n\nsaid the May 17 launch had a spacecraft on board but gave no details what it was for.\n\nU.S. Space Command said the launch was a likely a counterspace weapon capable of attacking other satellites in low Earth orbit.\n\n\"I don't think we should respond to any fake news from Washington,\" Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov was quoted as saying by the Interfax news agency about the U.S. claims.\n\n\"The Americans can say whatever they want but our policy does not change from this,\" said Ryabkov, adding that Moscow had \"always consistently opposed the deployment of strike weapons in low-Earth orbit.\"\n\nPresident Vladimir Putin and his then defence minister, Sergei Shoigu, denied U.S. assertions in February that Russia was developing a space-based anti-satellite nuclear weapon designed to disrupt everything from military communications to phone-based ride services.\n\nU.S. Space Command said the May launch, which it dates as May 16, included COSMOS 2576, a type of Russian military \"inspector\" spacecraft that U.S. officials have long said exhibits reckless space behaviour.\n\nU.S. intelligence agencies had been expecting the launch of COSMOS 2576 and informed allies of their assessment of the satellite before its deployment in space, according to a U.S. official familiar with the intelligence. The launch also included civilian satellites deployed to different orbits.\n\nCOSMOS 2576, as of Tuesday, has not gone near a U.S. satellite, but space analysts observed it to be in the same orbital ring as USA 314, a bus-sized NRO satellite launched in April 2021.\n\nRyabkov said that Russia's space programme was developing as planned, including tasks aimed at strengthening defence capability but added that \"this is also not news\".\n\nHe said the United States was wrong to have dismissed Russian proposals on strengthening the security of space activities, including a proposal on developing a treaty on preventing an arms race in space.\n\n(Reporting by Reuters;

Washington and Moscow have increasingly clashed in recent weeks over the issue, accusing each other of trying to militarize space.\n\nThe Kremlin has not commented on the latest U.S. claims.\n\nLast month, Russia vetoed a resolution at the United Nations Security Council (UNSC) aimed at preventing a nuclear arms race in outer space.\n\nThe draft vote was proposed by Japan and the U.S. and called on all states to uphold the 1967 Outer Space Treaty, which obligates nations \"not to place in orbit around the Earth any objects carrying nuclear weapons or any other kinds of weapons of mass destruction.\"\n\nThirteen of the UNSC's members voted in favor, while Russia voted against. China abstained.\n\nEarlier this month, it was reported that Russia tested a space-based anti-satellite weapon with potential nuclear capabilities in 2022.\n\nU.S. officials said that Russia had launched a satellite into space in February 2022 to test components for a potential anti-satellite weapon that would carry a nuclear device. However, the satellite that was launched does not carry a nuclear weapon, the Wall Street Journal (WSJ) reported.\n\nThe U.S. House Intelligence Committee warned in February of a \"serious\" but unspecified security threat from Russia. Reports then followed that the threat relates to Russia's desire to \"put a nuclear weapon into space.\"\n\nU.S. President Joe Biden later said that Moscow was indeed developing an anti-satellite space weapon, but it did not endanger people on Earth. He added that there had not yet been a decision to launch the weapon into space.\n\nThe Russian satellite, named the Cosmos-2553, was launched in February 2022 and has been orbiting Earth since then, operating as a platform to test \"nonnuclear components of the new weapon system,\" officials told the WSJ.\n\nRussian officials have claimed that the Cosmos-2553 is \"intended for scientific research,\" which the U.S. officials say is unlikely. The Kremlin has previously denied that it has any intention to put nuclear weapons in space.\n\nIf Cosmos-2553 or a similar satellite were equipped with nuclear weapons, it could destroy hundreds of

But on Tuesday, U.S. Space Command said Russia had launched an anti-satellite weapon.\n\nThe United States pointed a launch earlier this month of a Soyuz rocket from Russia's Plesetsk launch site. Russia's defence ministry said the May 17 launch had a spacecraft on board but gave no details what it was for.\n\nU.S. Space Command said the launch was a likely a counterspace weapon capable of attacking other satellites in low Earth orbit.\n\n\"I don't think we should respond to any fake news from Washington,\" Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov was quoted as saying by the Interfax news agency about the U.S. claims.\n\n\"The Americans can say whatever they want but our policy does not change from this,\" said Ryabkov, adding that Moscow had \"always consistently opposed the deployment of strike weapons in low-Earth orbit.\"\n\nPresident Vladimir Putin and his then defence minister, Sergei Shoigu, denied U.S. assertions in February that Russia was developing a space-based anti-satellite nuclear weapon designed to disrupt everything from military communications to phone-based ride services.\n\nU.S. Space Command said the May launch, which it dates as May 16, included COSMOS 2576, a type of Russian military \"inspector\" spacecraft that U.S. officials have long said exhibits reckless space behaviour.\n\nU.S. intelligence agencies had been expecting the launch of COSMOS 2576 and informed allies of their assessment of the satellite before its deployment in space, according to a U.S. official familiar with the intelligence. The launch also included civilian satellites deployed to different orbits.\n\nCOSMOS 2576, as of Tuesday, has not gone near a U.S. satellite, but space analysts observed it to be in the same orbital ring as USA 314, a bus-sized NRO satellite launched in April 2021.\n\nRyabkov said that Russia's space programme was developing as planned, including tasks aimed at strengthening defence capability but added that \"this is also not news\".\n\nHe said the United States was wrong to have dismissed Russian proposals on strengthening the security of space activities, including a proposal on developing a treaty on preventing an arms race in space.\n\n(Reporting by Reuters; Writing by Guy Faulconbridge; Editing by Andrew Osborn)\n\nSign Up for Springs AM Update Your morning rundown of the latest news from Colorado Springs and around the country\n\nSign Up View all of our newsletters.

However, the Cosmos 2576, which the US Space Command (USSPACECOM) says is a counterspace weapon, was inserted into the same orbit as the US NRO satellite, USA 314.\n\nUSSPACECOM said, \"We have observed nominal activity and assess it is likely a counterspace weapon presumably capable of attacking other satellites in low Earth orbit.\"\n\nIt added \"Russia deployed this new counterspace weapon into the same orbit as a US government satellite.\"\n\nThis comes a day after the United Nations Security Council (UNSC), led by the US, Britain, and France, vetoed a proposal led by Russia to ban ASAT weapons in space.\n\nLast month, the UNSC rejected (vetoed by Russia) a similar proposal led by the US and Japan to ban weapons of mass destruction (WMD) -- nuclear weapons -- that could render satellites in space non-operational.\n\nIn February this year, US intelligence warned about Russia's plans to deploy an ASAT weapon in space that could potentially be a nuclear explosive device. The US claims that the electromagnetic radiation from a nuclear explosive blast could blind and potentially render all satellites in space, both civilian and military, non-operational.\n\nIf such a weapon is actually deployed, it will be in violation of the Outer Space Treaty signed by more than 130 countries, including Russia.\n\nAccording to the Pentagon, the new Russian satellite is exhibiting similar behaviour to counter-space payloads deployed by Russia from 2019 to 2022.\n\nThe Cosmos 2576 is trailing behind the USA 314, a bus-sized spy satellite, with a much higher orbital velocity.\n\nRussia denied these claims by the US as fake news.\n\nIts Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov said, \"I don't think we should respond to any fake news from Washington.\" He added that, \"the Americans can say whatever they want but our policy does not change from this.\"\n\nRussia has repeatedly warned about shooting down US satellites, including SpaceX Starlink satellites, that are supporting Ukraine in its defensive efforts.", "source": {"uri": "swarajyamag.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Swarajyamag"}, "authors": [{"uri": "ujjwal_shrotryia@swarajyamag.com", "name": "Ujjwal

Gen. Patrick Ryder told reporters Tuesday that it had assessed that Moscow had launched a satellite into low Earth orbit last week that was \"likely a counter space weapon presumably capable of attacking other satellites in low Earth orbit.\"\n\n\"Russia deployed this new counter-space weapon into the same orbit as a U.S. government satellite,\" Ryder said, noting that it could pose a possible threat to the satellite and would continue to be monitored. \"We'll continue to balance the need to protect our interests in space with our desire to preserve a stable and sustainable space environment.\"\n\nThe Kremlin dismissed the claims Wednesday, suggesting that its recent space launch had not broken international law. \"We are not violating anything,\" Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters Wednesday. \"We have repeatedly advocated bans on the launch of any weapons into space; unfortunately, these initiatives have been rejected, including by the United States of America.\"\n\nThe tension was sparked by a Russian launch carried out on May 17. Russia's Ministry of Defense and state space agency Roscosmos posted statements last week confirming that Russia's air and space forces had carried out a launch of what it described as a Soyuz-2.1b launch vehicle from Russia's Plesetsk cosmodrome in the far north of the country.\n\nExperts said the competing claims were inconclusive. Some said they would not describe the Russian launch as a weapon.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJonathan McDowell, an astronomer at the Harvard & Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics, said the satellite \"appears to be one of a series of Russian inspector satellites that 'shadow' U.S. spy sats at a generous distance of 50 km or more.\"\n\n\"I do not believe that it is a weapon,\" McDowell added. \"I do not think it is a real threat to U.S. satellites.\"\n\nRussia launched a similar system several years ago in an apparent test, said Todd Harrison, a senior fellow with the American Enterprise Institute. \"That system deployed a sub-satellite and then appeared to fire a projectile,\" said Harrison. \"It also appears that it can do close inspection and surveillance of satellites.\"\n\nBoth sides were ambiguous in their descriptions of last week's launch and its impact, said Bleddyn Bowen, an associate professor of international relations at the University of Leicester who has written books on space warfare and astropolitics.\n\n\"All we know is that [the satellite] it's been put into a certain orbital flight path,\" which presumably clashes with the United States' interests, Bowen said. This could present a risk of \"collision,\" but \"I wouldn't rush to call it an antisatellite weapon yet,\" he added.\n\nHowever, the dispute shows the growing debate about warfare in space. Bowen said that with powers such as China, India, Russia and the United States active in space, \"the risk of space warfare happening is very real.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRussia and the United States have proposed rival resolutions to the U.N. Security Council in recent weeks, though neither passed. Russia vetoed a U.S.-led resolution last month that Washington said was designed to prevent a nuclear arms race in space.\n\nThe Security Council on Monday did not pass a Russia-backed proposal, co-sponsored by China, that aimed to prevent \"for all time\" the use of any weapons in space. Ahead of the vote, U.S. deputy ambassador Robert Wood accused Russia of \"gaslighting\" on the issue and stated Russia had launched likely \"counter space weapons\" into low orbit in 2019, 2022 and last week.\n\nRussia's Foreign Ministry called the results of the vote on the draft U.N. resolution \"disappointing\" on Tuesday and accused the United States of militarizing space.\n\n\"The United States and its allies, despite all the steps we have taken to consider their proposals ... opposed our constructive, comprehensive initiative,\" spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said. \"They have once again demonstrated their true priorities in the space area, aimed not at keeping space free of weapons of any kind, but at placing weapons in outer space and turning it into an arena for military confrontation.\"\n\nA U.S. Space Command spokesperson said in a statement Wednesday that the Russian satellite was \"likely a counter space weapon presumably capable of attacking other satellites in low Earth orbit.\" The statement added that \"even as Moscow backs space arms control negotiations, Russia continues to research, develop, test, and deploy a suite of counter space systems that threaten the safety and stability of the domain.\"\n\nClay Moltz, a professor at the Naval Postgraduate School and author of books on space security and conflict, said space warfare \"has already been occurring\" for many years, largely in the form of jamming satellite signals. \"But there have been no kinetic attacks or nuclear explosions except in national weapons testing programs,\" he added.\n\n\"As space becomes more and more crowded ... countries are nervous about possible attacks on their assets,\" Moltz said. \"Such a [space] war is certainly possible, but it would be damaging to all of humanity.\"\n\nNatalia Abbakumova contributed to this report.\n\nCopy the Story Link\n\nInvalid username/password.\n\nPlease check your email to confirm and complete your registration.\n\nCreate a commenting profile by providing an email address, password and display name.

It was launched using a Soyuz-2.1b rocket on 16 May, \"in the interests of the defence ministry\", according to its Roskosmos state space agency\n\nDr Bleddyn Bowen, a space policy expert at the University of Leicester, told one reason for a Russian satellite getting \"too close for comfort\" could be to take pictures of the US satellite, adding: \"This is very old-hat technology.\"\n\nHe said the rival powers' feud at the UN fitted into a wider \"pattern of messaging from the US on China and Russia in space, calling out bolder behaviour\". He added: \"It is part of the same sabre-rattling which has got much more prevalent in the last six to seven years.\"\n\nMs Suess said Russia had been a \"declining space power\" since the Cold War, which may mean the country is more willing to take more risks.\"The Russians have slightly less to lose,\" she added.\n\nBrig Gen Ryder said the US assessments \"further indicate characteristics resembling previously deployed counter space payloads, from 2019 and 2022\".\n\n\"We have a responsibility to be ready to protect and defend, the domain, the space domain, and ensure continuous and uninterrupted support to the Joint and Combined Force,\" the spokesman added.\n\nThe accusations by the US administration follow reports in February that Russia was allegedly developing a space-based weapon armed with a nuclear weapon to target satellites - something Moscow has always denied.\n\nThe US and Russia have repeatedly clashed at the UN in recent weeks, with both sides accusing the other of militarising space. Russia's foreign ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said on Tuesday that the US was seeking to turn space into an \"arena for military confrontation\".\n\nIn April, Russia vetoed a US and Japanese-led resolution directing members to uphold Article 4 of the Outer Space Treaty, which forbids countries from placing nuclear weapons in orbit or on celestial bodies.", "source": {"uri":

But the last time was in 2022, said Wood, who is the alternate U.S. representative for special political affairs at the United Nations.\n\nThe launch comes at a time when the United States and its allies are increasingly concerned about Russia's efforts to develop a space nuclear weapon capable of destroying commercial and government satellites.\n\nOn May 16, Russia launched a satellite into low Earth orbit that the United States says is likely an antispace weapon that could attack other satellites in low Earth orbit, Wood said before voting on a resolution of the UN Security Council drafted by Russia on external issues. space security. Russia has deployed this new antispace weapon in the same orbit as a US government satellite.\n\nWood added that the May 16 launch follows earlier launches of Russian satellites, likely anti-space systems in low Earth orbit in 2019 and 2022.\n\nPentagon spokesman Maj. Gen. Pat Ryder said Tuesday that U.S. assessments of the Russian satellite further indicate features resembling previously deployed antispace payloads, from 2019 to 2022.\n\nThe ambassador called the launch troubling and said it undermines Russia's claims that it seeks security in space. The command monitored the incident as it unfolded, according to a defense official.\n\nRussia issued at least two NOTAMs to aviators that became active on May 16, indicating a possible space launch. One was intended for the launch itself and the other for the re-entry of a Russian space launcher off the coast of Baja California, Mexico.\n\nThe good news is that NOTAMs are the responsible and normal way for countries to support the security of aviation and maritime activities, the defense official said.\n\nThe United States and its allies are working to deter Russia from developing a space nuclear weapon, CNN previously reported. If deployed, such a weapon could destroy satellites by creating a massive energy wave when it detonates, potentially crippling a vast portion of the commercial and government satellites that the world below depends on for cell phone talk, payment his bills and surf the Internet.\n\nIn April, the United States and Japan jointly introduced a UN Security Council resolution calling on UN member states not to develop space-based nuclear weapons, but Russia vetoed it. which the United States took as a sign that it was indeed pursuing a space nuclear project. weapon based.\n\nAs we noted previously, the United States believes that Russia is developing a new satellite carrying a nuclear device, National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan said in a statement on April 24. We have heard President Putin publicly state that Russia does not intend to deploy nuclear weapons. weapons in space. If that were the case, Russia would not have vetoed this resolution.\n\nThe Russian weapon is still under development and is not yet in orbit, Biden administration officials have publicly emphasized. But if used, officials say, it would cross a dangerous Rubicon in the history of nuclear weapons.\n\nRussia introduced its own rival resolution earlier this month, calling for a permanent ban on the placement of weapons in our space. But the United States vetoed it Monday because it does not accomplish the simple task we set out to do several months ago: reaffirming the core obligations of the Outer Space Treaty and avoiding a race to nuclear weapons in space, Wood said.\n\nThe US ambassador particularly took issue with resolutions calling for a binding mechanism to ban any space weapons, saying such a ban cannot be verified and that the resolution was an attempt by Russia to distract the world's attention from its development of a new satellite carrying a nuclear weapon. device.\n\nWhat Are The Main Benefits Of

We have repeatedly advocated a ban on the deployment of any weapons into space. Unfortunately, our initiatives were rejected, including by the United States,\" Peskov told reporters.\n\nU.S. intelligence agencies had been expecting the launch of COSMOS 2576 and informed allies of their assessment of the satellite before its deployment in space, according to a U.S. official familiar with the intelligence. The launch also included civilian satellites deployed to different orbits.\n\nCOSMOS 2576, as of Tuesday, has not gone near a U.S. satellite, but space analysts observed it to be in the same orbital ring as USA 314, a bus-sized NRO satellite launched in April 2021.\n\nRyabkov said Russia's space programme was developing as planned, including tasks aimed at strengthening defence capability but added that \"this is also not news\".\n\nHe said the United States was wrong to have dismissed Russian proposals on strengthening the security of space activities, including a proposal on developing a treaty on preventing an arms race in space.\n\n(Reporting by Reuters; Writing by Guy FaulconbridgeEditing by Andrew Osborn and Gareth Jones)\n\nSign Up for Springs AM Update\n\nYour morning rundown of the latest news from Colorado Springs and around the country\n\nSign Up View all of our newsletters.\n\nSuccess!

But the last time it did so was in 2022, said Wood, who serves as the US alternative representative for Special Political Affairs at the UN.\n\nThe launch comes at a time the US and its allies are increasingly concerned about Russia's efforts to develop a nuclear space weapon capable of destroying commercial and government satellites.\n\n\"On May 16, Russia launched a satellite into low Earth orbit that the United States assesses is likely a counterspace weapon presumably capable of attacking other satellites in low Earth orbit,\" Wood said in remarks before a vote on a UN Security Council resolution drafted by Russia on outer space security. \"Russia deployed this new counterspace weapon into the same orbit as a US government satellite.\"\n\nWood added that the May 16 launch \"follows prior Russian satellite launches likely of counterspace systems to low Earth orbit in 2019 and 2022.\"\n\nPentagon spokesperson Maj. Gen. Pat Ryder said on Tuesday that US assessments of the Russian satellite \"further indicate characteristics resembling previously deployed counterspace payloads, from 2019 and 2022.\"\n\nThe ambassador called the launch \"troubling,\" and said it undermines Russia's claims that it is seeking outer space security. A US official separately told CNN that the US had been expecting the launch for at least several weeks, and North American Aerospace Defense Command and US Northern Command tracked it as it happened, according to a defense official.\n\nRussia issued at least 2 NOTAMs -- Notices to Airmen -- that became active on May 16 indicating a possible space launch. One was for the launch itself and the other was for the re-entry of a Russian space launch booster off the coast of Baja California, Mexico.\n\n\"The good news is that the NOTAM is the responsible, normal way for nations to support safe air and maritime activities,\" the defense official said.\n\nThe US and its allies have been working to deter Russia from developing a nuclear space weapon, CNN previously reported. If deployed, such a weapon could destroy satellites by creating a massive energy wave when detonated, potentially crippling a vast swath of the commercial and government satellites that the world below depends on to talk on cell phones, pay bills, and surf the internet.\n\nIn April, the US and Japan jointly introduced a UN Security Council resolution that called for UN member states not to develop space-based nuclear weapons, but Russia vetoed against it -- something the US saw as a sign that it is indeed pursuing a nuclear space-based weapon.\n\n\"As we have noted previously, the United States assesses that Russia is developing a new satellite carrying a nuclear device,\" National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan said in a statement on April 24. \"We have heard President Putin say publicly that Russia has no intention of deploying nuclear weapons in space. If that were the case, Russia would not have vetoed this resolution.\"\n\nThe Russian weapon is still under development and is not yet in orbit, Biden administration officials have emphasized publicly. But if used, officials say, it would cross a dangerous Rubicon in the history of nuclear weapons.\n\nRussia introduced its own rival resolution earlier this month, calling for the prohibition \"for all time\" on the placement of weapons in our space. But the US vetoed it on Monday because it \"does not achieve the simple task that we set out to achieve several months ago: reaffirm the basic obligations of the Outer Space Treaty and avoid a nuclear arms race in space,\" Wood said.\n\nThe US ambassador took particular issue with the resolution's call for a binding mechanism to ban any space-based weapons, saying such a ban \"cannot be verified\" and that the resolution was an attempt by Russia \"to distract global attention from its development of a new satellite carrying a nuclear device.\"", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType":

Pat Ryder said the U.S. has assessed that Moscow deployed the satellite on May 16. \"Russia launched a satellite into low Earth orbit that we assess is likely a counterspace weapon, presumably capable of attacking other satellites in low Earth orbit,\" Ryder said.\n\nIt was launched into the same orbit as a U.S. government satellite, Ryder said, without elaborating on whether the American satellite was in any immediate danger.\n\nThe U.S. will be monitoring the situation, he added, but is ready to protect the \"space domain.\"\n\nRussia's state space agency, Roscosmos, said in a statement in the early morning hours of May 17 local time that a Soyuz launch vehicle with \"spacecraft on board\" took off from its Plesetsk cosmodrome in northern Russia \"in the interests of the Ministry of Defense of the Russian Federation.\" It was unclear whether the launch was related to the \"counterspace weapon\" that the U.S. assessed Russia put into space.\n\nThe latest space feud comes three months after Washington raised fears that Russia was developing a space-based nuclear weapon potentially designed to target U.S. satellites. Moscow strongly denied it, with President Vladimir Putin saying he was categorically against the deployment of nuclear weapons in space.\n\nThe new U.S. assessment was once again dismissed by Russia on Wednesday.\n\n\"I don't think we should respond to any information hoax from Washington,\" Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov was quoted as saying by state news agency Tass, adding that Russia has consistently opposed the deployment of weapons in low Earth orbit.\n\nKremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told a daily news briefing that Russia has been acting in accordance with international law and has repeatedly called for a ban on any weapons in space, but those initiatives have been turned down, including by the U.S.\n\nWashington and Moscow have clashed over the space weapons issue at the United Nations in recent weeks.\n\nA Russian-drafted Security Council resolution that called on all countries to prevent \"for all time\" the placement, threat or use of any weapons in outer space failed on Monday. Foreign ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova called the outcome of the vote \"disappointing,\" saying that the U.S. and its partners had once again demonstrated their \"true priorities\" in the space field, including transforming it into an \"arena of military confrontation.\"\n\nBut Russia vetoed a U.S.-drafted resolution last month that called on countries to prevent an arms race in outer space.\n\nThe latest exchange of rhetoric comes amid growing tensions between Russia and the U.S. over Washington's continued support for the Kyiv fight in the two-year war. Putin has engaged in nuclear brinkmanship on many occasions throughout the war, threatening to unleash Russia's powerful nuclear arsenal if its existence is threatened.\n\nOn Tuesday, his defense ministry said it had begun the first phase of the drills on the preparation and use of non-strategic nuclear weapons in its Southern military district, which borders Ukraine.\n\nThe exercises were ordered by Putin earlier this month. The defense ministry reiterated Tuesday that the drills were in response to \"provocative statements and threats of certain Western officials regarding the Russian Federation,\" in a likely reference to a growing discussion around the possibility of sending NATO troops to Ukraine.", "source": {"uri": "nbcnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NBC News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

That suggests the Russian satellite has ASAT capabilities.\n\nRussia denies it. But U.S. intelligence knew as long ago as February that Russia was going to deploy a new ASAT weapon in the near future. House Intelligence Committee Chairman Mike Truner warned in February that the committee had \"made available to all Members of Congress information concerning a serious national security threat.\"\n\nThat threat was the assumption that Russia had placed a nuclear weapon in space.\n\nThat assumption is based on the simple fact that satellites moving at 22,500 MPH are very hard to hit. If you use a nuke to destroy a satellite, a near miss is as good as a hit.\n\n\"I don't think we should respond to any fake news from Washington,\" Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov was quoted as saying by the Interfax news agency.\n\n\"The Americans can say whatever they want, but our policy does not change from this,\" said Ryabkov, adding that Moscow had \"always consistently opposed the deployment of strike weapons in low-Earth orbit.\"\n\nThe choice of language was curious. The weapon would not be a \"strike\" weapon to hit the Earth but rather a space weapon to target satellites.\n\nU.S. Space Command said the May launch, which it dates as May 16, included COSMOS 2576, a type of Russian military \"inspector\" spacecraft that U.S. officials have long said exhibits reckless space behavior.\n\nU.S. intelligence agencies had been expecting the launch of COSMOS 2576 and informed allies of their assessment of the satellite before its deployment in space, according to a U.S. official familiar with the intelligence. The launch also included civilian satellites deployed to different orbits.\n\nCOSMOS 2576, as of Tuesday, has not gone near a U.S. satellite, but space analysts observed it to be in the same orbital ring as USA 314, a bus-sized National Reconnaissance Office satellite launched in April 2021.\n\nRussia tried to use the UN as cover when they introduced a resolution in the Security Council, piously calling on all countries to prevent \"for all time\" the \"placement, threat or use of any weapons in outer space,\" according to Reuters.\n\nThe resolution failed, as Moscow knew it would, except Russia is now on the record as opposing the placement of weapons in outer space. They vetoed a similar resolution introduced by the U.S. in April.\n\n\"We are here today because Russia seeks to distract global attention from its development of a new satellite carrying a nuclear device,\" deputy U.S. Ambassador Robert Wood told the Security Council before the vote.\n\nRussia's U.N. Ambassador Vassily Nebenzia claimed he didn't understand what Wood was saying when he accused Russia of launching a nuke into space.\n\nReuters:\n\nNebenzia said the Russian draft resolution covered both weapons of mass destruction and all forms of other weapons and was aimed at stopping an arms race in outer space.\n\nBut, when pressed by Nebenzia, Wood took issue with language in the draft seeking \"a lengthy binding mechanism that cannot be verified,\" saying, \"I've seen this movie before.\"\n\nThe Russian draft had language echoing a 2008 proposal by Moscow and Beijing for a treaty banning \"any weapons in outer space\" and threats \"or use of force against outer space objects,\" but the diplomatic effort did not find international support.\n\nThe U.S. almost certainly has its own ASAT capability. Whether it's already in space is unknown.

Gen. Pat Ryder confirmed Tuesday.\n\n\"What I'm tracking here is on May 16, as you highlighted, Russia launched a satellite into low Earth orbit that we that we assess is likely a counter space weapon presumably capable of attacking other satellites in low Earth orbit,\" Ryder said when questioned by ABC News about the information, which was made public earlier Tuesday by Robert Wood, deputy U.S. ambassador to the United Nations.\n\n\"Russia deployed this new counter space weapon into the same orbit as a U.S. government satellite,\" Ryder continued. \"And so assessments further indicate characteristics resembling previously deployed counter space payloads from 2019 and 2022.\"\n\nAustin says 'expectation' is Ukraine won't use US weapons outside its territory, despite Russian advance\n\n\"Obviously, that's something that we'll continue to monitor,\" Ryder added. \"Certainly, we would say that we have a responsibility to be ready to protect and defend the space domain and ensure continuous and uninterrupted support to the joint and combined force. And we'll continue to balance the need to protect our interests in space with our desire to preserve a stable and sustainable space environment.\"\n\nWhen asked if the Russian counter space weapon posed a threat to the U.S. satellite, Ryder responded: \"Well, it's a counter space weapon in the same orbit as a U.S. government satellite.\"\n\nWhile there are requirements for making advance air and sea notifications for space launches, Ryder wouldn't discuss whether the U.S. knew in advance that the launch contained a particular type of counter-space weapon.\n\nRussian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov called the Pentagon's statements an \"information leak\" on Wednesday.\n\n\"I don't think that we should respond to any information leak from Washington.

It is recalled that in recent weeks, Russia and the US have repeatedly clashed at the UN over space weapons, accusing each other of seeking to militarize space.\n\nEarlier yesterday, Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said that the US is trying to turn space into an \"arena of military confrontation\".\n\nDefense experts have long warned that space is likely to become the next front of conflict in an increasingly technology-dependent world. Brigadier General Ryder said the Pentagon believes the Russian satellite is \"probably capable of attacking other satellites in low Earth orbit.\"\n\n\"Russia has developed this new anti-space weapon in the same orbit as a US government satellite (...) We have a responsibility to be ready to protect and defend the domain, the space domain,\" the Pentagon spokesman added.\n\nThe same was supported by his statements to Reuters and a representative of the US space administration, noting that the Russian satellite Kosmos 2576 was launched on May 16 from the Plesetsk cosmodrome, about 800 km north of Moscow.\n\nA statement from the Russian space agency Roscosmos said that the launch on May 17, and the difference in the dates given by Moscow and Washington probably explains the time difference, was carried out in the \"interests of the Ministry of Defense of the Russian Federation\".\n\nWhile no other details have been released by either side, analysts say Kosmos 2576 appears to be in the same orbit as the US satellite USA 314. Since the start of its intervention in Ukraine in February 2022, Russia has warned that US satellites assisting Kyiv's armed forces could be legitimate targets.\n\nLast February, the White House announced that Russia was developing a \"disturbing\" new space weapon, which it has not yet developed. A report last year by Washington's Center for Strategic and International Studies said Russia was developing a range of anti-satellite weapons (ASAT), including a missile that was successfully tested in November 2021 to destroy a Soviet-era satellite, according to the BBC.", "source": {"uri": "b92.net", "dataType": "news", "title": "B92"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Pentagon spokesman Patrick Ryder announced.\n\nRyder added that the launch took place on May 16, and the Russian satellite is now in the same orbit as a US government satellite.\n\nWhen asked whether the Russian satellite threatened the US satellite, Ryder said: \"Well, it's a space defence weapon in the same orbit as a US government satellite.\"\n\nAmerican UN representative Robert Wood had previously expressed views similar to Ryder's.\n\nThe Pentagon stated that it is not the first time Russia has launched such space weapons, referring to 2019 and 2022.\n\nOn Monday, a UN resolution tabled by Russia against an arms race in space failed in the UN Security Council.\n\nThe draft resolution received seven votes in favour, while seven countries, including the US, voted against it.\n\nUS representative Robert Wood accused Moscow of using manipulative tactics after Russia vetoed a US resolution against nuclear weapons in space last month.\n\nIn February, reports in the US warned about Russia's nuclear ambitions in space, stating that the nuclear potential of weapons directed against satellites could pose a threat to national and international security.\n\nThe US government responded to the reports, accusing Russia of developing military capabilities for use against satellites, with President Joe Biden assuring that there is no nuclear danger facing Americans or people anywhere in the world.\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin responded to the reports and said that Russia is against the deployment of nuclear weapons in space.", "source": {"uri":

Pentagon spokesman Brigadier General Pat Ryder disclosed this information on Tuesday, stating that the satellite, launched into low Earth orbit, is believed to be a counter-space weapon.\n\nHe mentioned that the satellite's orbit is aligned with that of a US government satellite, and emphasised that Washington is closely monitoring the situation to protect its interests.\n\nRussia has not issued any public comments on the matter. The tension between Moscow and Washington over space militarisation has been escalating, with both nations accusing each other of attempting to turn space into a battleground.\n\nEarlier on Tuesday, Maria Zakharova, a spokeswoman for Russia's foreign ministry, accused the US of trying to transform space into an \"arena for military confrontation.\"\n\nMilitary experts have long predicted that space could become the next frontier of warfare, especially in a world increasingly reliant on technology.\n\nGeneral Ryder reiterated the Pentagon's belief that the Russian satellite could attack other satellites in low Earth orbit. He highlighted the importance of readiness to protect and defend the space domain to ensure uninterrupted support for joint and combined forces.\n\nA spokesperson for the US Space Command echoed these concerns, identifying the satellite as Cosmos 2576, which was launched on May 16 from Russia's Plesetsk Cosmodrome. The Russian space agency Roskosmos confirmed the launch, stating it was conducted on May 17 using the Soyuz-2.1b vehicle and was intended for the Russian defence ministry. The discrepancy in launch dates can be attributed to the time difference between Moscow and GMT.\n\nSpace analysts have noted that Cosmos 2576 shares its orbit with the US satellite USA 314. Since the onset of the full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, Russia has hinted that US satellites supporting the Ukrainian military could be considered legitimate targets.\n\nIn February, the White House acknowledged that Russia was developing a concerning new space weapon, although it had not yet been deployed. This announcement followed a cryptic warning from a senior Republican congressman about a significant national security threat, which fueled intense speculation in Washington, DC.\n\nA report by the Center for Strategic and International Studies, based in Washington, DC, released last year, indicated that Russia is working on various anti-satellite (ASAT) weapons. This includes a missile successfully tested against an old Soviet-era satellite in November 2021.\n\nThe current situation underscores the ongoing rivalry between the US and Russia in space, with both nations vying for dominance and security in an increasingly contested domain. As space becomes more integral to national security and military operations, the potential for conflict over satellite capabilities and intentions appears to be rising.", "source": {"uri":

'And so assessments further indicate characteristics resembling previously deployed counter space payloads from 2019 and 2022.'\n\nIt came after Wood made the statement to the UN on Monday, coming as the United States and Russia have drafted rival resolutions in an attempt to outlaw weapons in space.\n\nThe US made multiple claims this week that Russia has launched what could be a counter space weapon into the same orbit as an American satellite. Major General Pat Ryder confirmed the news at a press conference Tuesday\n\nThe drafts focused on different types of weapons, with the U.S. and Japan specifying weapons of mass destruction. The Russian draft discussed all types of weapons.\n\nMembers of the United Nations Security Council condemned the actions even as they failed to pass a measure against it.\n\n'The culmination of Russia\u00b4s campaign of diplomatic gaslighting and dissembling is the text before us today,' U.S. deputy ambassador Robert Wood told the council.\n\nRussia\u00b4s U.N. ambassador, Vassily Nebenzia, denied that his nation was trying to mislead the world. Backed by China and others, he called the vote 'a unique moment of truth for our Western colleagues.'\n\n'If they fail to support this, then they will clearly show that their main priority remains keeping freedom of the way for themselves to expedite the militarization of outer space,' Nebenzia said.\n\nEvery nation says it wants weapons barred from space, and council members repeated that Monday.\n\nBut when it came time to vote, the council evenly split 7-7 between backers of the U.S. and of Russia, with Switzerland abstaining. The measure failed under U.N. rules because it didn't receive nine votes.\n\nRyder said that the US remains vigilant at what appears to be Russia's attempt to weaponize space.\n\nUS Ambassador Robert Wood made the initial allegation to the UN on Monday\n\nRussia already has several space-based military assets. These include co-orbital anti-satellite (ASAT) weapons, direct-ascent ASAT missiles, and Starlink communication satellites it is contracting for its war on Ukraine\n\n'Obviously, that's something that we'll continue to monitor,' he said. 'Certainly, we would say that we have a responsibility to be ready to protect and defend the space domain and ensure continuous and uninterrupted support to the joint and combined force.'\n\n'And we'll continue to balance the need to protect our interests in space with our desire to preserve a stable and sustainable space environment.'\n\nRyder would not say if the US knew in advance that Russia was making the launch.\n\nIn early May, a Pentagon official warned lawmakers that Russia's development of a nuclear space satellite could knock out all other global satellites for up to a year.\n\nSatellites aren't built to withstand the radiation from a nuclear explosion and some could be destroyed by the blast and have 'devastating' consequences for the US and other countries' capabilities in space.\n\nThis marks the first time the Biden administration has openly discussed the 'indiscriminate weapon' at an open Congressional hearing, after a bombshell revelation by lawmakers in February.\n\nMeanwhile, China has launched the first mission to collect samples from the dark side of the moon, even as the US government has warned that China could claim ownership of the moon if it reached the lunar surface first.\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin (pictured) has denied claims that reports that the country is building a nuclear anti-satellite that could destroy all other satellites in space for up to a year.\n\n'The concept that we are concerned about is Russia developing and -- if we are unable to convince them otherwise -- to ultimately fly a nuclear weapon in space which will be an indiscriminate weapon,' John Plumb, the assistant secretary of defense for space policy, said at a House Armed Services subcommittee hearing.\n\nREAD MORE: Republicans question if the US has the capability to respond to Russia attacking its satellites\n\nRussia blew up one of its own satellites in 2021 using a missile. Cosmos 1408, a defunct spy satellite launched in 1982, was the destroyed target, which resulted in a field of 1,500 pieces of debris endangering the crew of the ISS\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe added that the weapon wouldn't distinguish between civilian, commercial or military satellites which provide cell phone reception, internet access and data about foreign threats.\n\nSpaceX's Starlink has 5,400 satellites in orbit that have been vital to Ukraine remaining online and having communication capabilities during the ongoing Russian invasion.\n\nIn February, lawmakers first warned that Russia was developing a nuclear anti-satellite, also called a nuclear EMP, that posed a 'serious national security threat' to the US.\n\n'Our general knowledge of Russian pursuit of this kind of capability goes back many, many months, if not a few years,' National Security Council spokesman John Kirby told CNN at the time.\n\n'But only in recent weeks now has the intelligence community been able to assess with a higher sense of confidence exactly how Russia continues to pursue it.'\n\nThe weapon has not yet been placed in space and Plumb said there isn't an 'imminent' threat to public safety, and the anti-satellite wouldn't be able to attack humans or cause physical destruction on Earth.\n\nHowever, if the nuclear EMP is deployed, it 'could pose a threat to all satellites operated by countries and companies around the globe, as well as to the vital communications, scientific, meteorological, agricultural, commercial, and national security services we all depend upon,' Plumb said.\n\nShortly after lawmakers said Russia was building the anti-satellite nuclear weapon, Russian President Vladimir Putin vehemently denied the reports during a meeting with his defense minister in Moscow and claimed he was against deploying nuclear weapons in space.\n\nChina launched its Chang'e 6 rocket on Friday (pictured) that will travel to the dark side of the moon to collect rock samples from the lunar surface\n\nConcerns over Russia's potential impact on space satellites come as China launched the Chang E' 6 mission to the dark side of the moon on Friday, making it the first country to deploy a mission to the region.\n\nLast month, NASA warned that China could be using its civilian space program as a cover for military operations and their plans to create a landing base on the lunar surface could pose a threat to national security.\n\nHe noted that much of his concern stems from the Chinese space programs' close-knit ties to the People's Liberation Army - a military branch of the Communist Party.\n\n'My concern would be if China got there first and suddenly said: 'Okay, this is our territory, you stay out,''' Nelson said.\n\nHe said his concern stems from the Chinese space programs' close-knit ties to the People's Liberation Army - a military branch of the Communist Party.\n\n'My concern would be if China got there first and suddenly said: 'Okay, this is our territory, you stay out,''' Nelson said.\n\nHe argued that if anyone doubts his warning, they should look at Beijing's claims that it owns the majority of territory in the Spratly Islands in the South China Sea which China, Taiwan, Vietnam, Malaysia and the Philippines jointly own.\n\n'China has made extraordinary strides, especially in the last 10 years, but they are very, very secretive,' Nelson said at the hearing.\n\n'We believe that a lot of their, so-called civilian space programs is a military program,' he continued. 'And I think, in effect, we are in a race.'", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Mail Online"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Patrick Ryder told reporters on Tuesday that it had assessed Moscow had launched a satellite into low Earth orbit last week that was \"likely a counterspace weapon presumably capable of attacking other satellites in low Earth orbit.\"\n\n\"Russia deployed this new counterspace weapon into the same orbit as a U.S. government satellite,\" Ryder said, noting that it could pose a possible threat to a U.S. government satellite and would continue to be monitored. \"We'll continue to balance the need to protect our interests in space with our desire to preserve a stable and sustainable space environment.\"\n\nThe Kremlin dismissed the claims on Wednesday, suggesting that its recent space launch had not broken international law. \"We are not violating anything,\" Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters on Wednesday. \"We have repeatedly advocated bans on the launch of any weapons into space; unfortunately, these initiatives have been rejected, including by the United States of America.\"\n\nThe tension has been sparked by a Russian launch carried out on May 17. Russia's Ministry of Defense and state space agency Roscosmos posted statements last week confirming that Russia's Air and Space Forces had carried out a launch on May 17 of what it described as a Soyuz 2.1b launch vehicle from Russia's Plesetsk cosmodrome in the far north of the country.\n\nExperts said the competing claims were inconclusive. \"Both sides are quite ambiguous in what they're saying,\" said Bleddyn Bowen, associate professor of international relations at the University of Leicester who has authored books on space warfare and astropolitics, adding that there was a lack of concrete detail from both sides on the Russian launch.\n\n\"All we know is that [the satellite] it's been put into a certain orbital flight path,\" which presumably clashes with the United States' interests, Bowen said. This could present a risk of \"collision,\" but \"I wouldn't rush to call it an antisatellite weapon yet,\" he added.\n\nHowever, the dispute shows the growing debate about warfare in space. Bowen said that with powers such as China, India, Russia and the United States active in space, \"the risk of space warfare happening is very real.\"\n\nRussia and the United States have proposed rival resolutions to the United Nations Security Council in recent weeks, though neither passed. Russia vetoed a U.S.-led resolution last month that Washington said was designed to prevent a nuclear arms race in space.\n\nThe Security Council failed to pass a Russia-backed proposal, co-sponsored by China, that aimed to prevent \"for all time\" the use of any weapons in space on Monday. Ahead of the vote, U.S. deputy ambassador Robert Wood accused Russia of \"gaslighting\" on the issue and stated Russia had launched likely \"counterspace weapons\" into low orbit in 2019, 2022 and last week.\n\nRussia's Foreign Ministry called the results of the vote on the draft U.N. resolution \"disappointing\" on Tuesday and accused the United States of militarizing space.\n\n\"The United States and its allies, despite all the steps we have taken to consider their proposals ... opposed our constructive, comprehensive initiative,\" said spokeswoman Maria Zakharova. \"They have once again demonstrated their true priorities in the space area, aimed not at keeping space free of weapons of any kind, but at placing weapons in outer space and turning it into an arena for military confrontation.\"\n\nClay Moltz, a professor at the Naval Postgraduate School and author of books on space security and conflict, said space warfare \"has already been occurring\" for many years, largely in the form of jamming satellite signals. \"But there have been no kinetic attacks or nuclear explosions except in national weapons testing programs,\" he added.\n\n\"As space becomes more and more crowded ... countries are nervous about possible attacks on their assets,\" Moltz said. \"Such a [space] war is certainly possible, but it would be damaging to all of humanity.\"", "source":

Major General Pat Ryder (pictured right) revealed news at a press conference Tuesday, after U.S. Ambassador Robert Wood made the initial allegation to the UN on Monday.\n\n'What I'm tracking here is on May 16, as you highlighted, Russia launched a satellite into low Earth orbit that we that we assess is likely a counter space weapon presumably capable of attacking other satellites in low Earth orbit,' Ryder (pictured) told ABC News. 'Russia deployed this new counter space weapon into the same orbit as a U.S. government satellite,' he added. 'And so assessments further indicate characteristics resembling previously deployed counter space payloads from 2019 and 2022.' It came after Wood made the statement to the UN on Monday, coming as the United States and Russia have drafted rival resolutions in an attempt to outlaw weapons in space.\n\nThe drafts focused on different types of weapons, with the U.S. and Japan specifying weapons of mass destruction. The Russian draft discussed all types of weapons. Members of the United Nations Security Council condemned the actions even as they failed to pass a measure against it. 'The culmination of Russia's campaign of diplomatic gaslighting and dissembling is the text before us today,' U.S. deputy ambassador Robert Wood (pictured) told the council.\n\nRussia's U.N. ambassador, Vassily Nebenzia (pictured), denied that his nation was trying to mislead the world. Backed by China and others, he called the vote 'a unique moment of truth for our Western colleagues.' 'If they fail to support this, then they will clearly show that their main priority remains keeping freedom of the way for themselves to expedite the militarization of outer space,' Nebenzia said. Every nation says it wants weapons barred from space, and council members repeated that Monday.\n\nBut when it came time to vote, the council evenly split 7-7 between backers of the U.S. and of Russia, with Switzerland abstaining. The measure failed under U.N. rules because it didn't receive nine votes. Ryder said that the U.S. remains vigilant at what appears to be Russia's attempt to weaponize space. 'Obviously, that's something that we'll continue to monitor,' he said. 'Certainly, we would say that we have a responsibility to be ready to protect and defend the space domain and ensure continuous and uninterrupted support to the joint and combined force. And we'll continue to balance the need to protect our interests in space with our desire to preserve a stable and sustainable space environment,' he added.\n\nRyder would not say if the U.S. knew in advance that Russia was making the launch. In early May, a Pentagon official warned lawmakers that Russia's development of a nuclear space satellite could knock out all other global satellites for up to a year. Satellites aren't built to withstand the radiation from a nuclear explosion and some could be destroyed by the blast and have 'devastating' consequences for the U.S. and other countries' capabilities in space. This marks the first time the Biden administration has openly discussed the 'indiscriminate weapon' at an open Congressional hearing, after a bombshell revelation by lawmakers in February.\n\nMeanwhile, China has launched the first mission to collect samples from the dark side of the moon, even as the U.S. government has warned that China could claim ownership of the moon if it reached the lunar surface first. 'The concept that we are concerned about is Russia developing and -- if we are unable to convince them otherwise -- to ultimately fly a nuclear weapon in space which will be an indiscriminate weapon,' John Plumb, the assistant secretary of defense for space policy, said at a House Armed Services subcommittee hearing. He added that the weapon wouldn't distinguish between civilian, commercial or military satellites which provide cell phone reception, internet access and data about foreign threats.\n\nSpaceX's Starlink has 5,400 satellites in orbit that have been vital to Ukraine remaining online and having communication capabilities during the ongoing Russian invasion. In February, lawmakers first warned that Russia was developing a nuclear anti-satellite, also called a nuclear EMP, that posed a 'serious national security threat' to the U.S. 'Our general knowledge of Russian pursuit of this kind of capability goes back many, many months, if not a few years,' National Security Council spokesman John Kirby told CNN at the time. 'But only in recent weeks now has the intelligence community been able to assess with a higher sense of confidence exactly how Russia continues to pursue it.'\n\nThe weapon has not yet been placed in space and Plumb said there isn't an 'imminent' threat to public safety, and the anti-satellite wouldn't be able to attack humans or cause physical destruction on Earth. However, if the nuclear EMP is deployed, it 'could pose a threat to all satellites operated by countries and companies around the globe, as well as to the vital communications, scientific, meteorological, agricultural, commercial, and national security services we all depend upon,' Plumb said.\n\nShortly after lawmakers said Russia was building the anti-satellite nuclear weapon, Russian President Vladimir Putin vehemently denied the reports during a meeting with his defense minister in Moscow and claimed he was against deploying nuclear weapons in space. Concerns over Russia's potential impact on space satellites come as China launched the Chang E' 6 mission to the dark side of the moon on Friday, making it the first country to deploy a mission to the region. Last month, NASA warned that China could be using its civilian space program as a cover for military operations and their plans to create a landing base on the lunar surface could pose a threat to national security.\n\nWant more stories like this from the Daily Mail?

The U.S. Space Command pointed to a recent launch as evidence. Russia's defence ministry and President Putin deny developing such weapons but assert their space program is for strengthening defence.\n\nRussia's top arms control diplomat on Wednesday dismissed as fake news an assertion by the United States that Russia had launched a weapon into low-Earth orbit that was capable of inspecting and attacking other satellites. The Kremlin has flatly denied assertions by U.S. officials that Moscow is developing a\n\nspace-based anti-satellite nuclear weapon . But on Tuesday, U.S. Space Command said Russia had launched an\n\nanti-satellite weapon .\n\nThe United States pointed a launch earlier this month of a Soyuz rocket from Russia's Plesetsk launch site. Russia's defence ministry\n\nsaid the May 17 launch had a spacecraft on board but gave no details what it was for. U.S. Space Command said the launch was a likely a counterspace weapon capable of attacking other satellites in low Earth orbit.\n\n\"I don't think we should respond to any fake news from Washington,\" Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov was quoted as saying by the Interfax news agency about the U.S. claims. \"The Americans can say whatever they want but our policy does not change from this,\" said Ryabkov, adding that Moscow had \"always consistently opposed the deployment of strike weapons in low-Earth orbit.\"\n\nPresident Vladimir Putin and his then defence minister, Sergei Shoigu, denied U.S. assertions in February that Russia was developing a space-based anti-satellite nuclear weapon designed to disrupt everything from military communications to phone-based ride services. U.S. Space Command said the May launch, which it dates as May 16, included COSMOS 2576, a type of Russian military \"inspector\" spacecraft that U.S. officials have long said exhibits reckless space behaviour.\n\nU.S. intelligence agencies had been expecting the launch of COSMOS 2576 and informed allies of their assessment of the satellite before its deployment in space, according to a U.S. official familiar with the intelligence. The launch also included civilian satellites deployed to different orbits. COSMOS 2576, as of Tuesday, has not gone near a U.S. satellite, but space analysts observed it to be in the same orbital ring as USA 314, a bus-sized NRO satellite launched in April 2021.\n\nRyabkov said that Russia's space programme was developing as planned, including tasks aimed at strengthening defence capability but added that \"this is also not news\". He said the United States was wrong to have dismissed Russian proposals on strengthening the security of space activities, including a proposal on developing a treaty on preventing an arms race in space.\n\n(This story has not been edited by Devdiscourse staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)", "source": {"uri": "devdiscourse.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Devdiscourse"},

rare area where the two countries have maintained a degree of cooperation despite a swathe of Western sanctions and dire relations after Russia's invasion of Ukraine.\n\nBoth countries ferry each other's crew members to and from the International Space Station (ISS), where their astronauts are jointly stationed.\n\nThe space weapon spat between Moscow and Washington resurrects the spectre of space being militarized despite the 1967 Outer Space Treaty which forbids countries from deploying \"any objects carrying nuclear weapons or any other kinds of weapons of mass destruction\" into orbit

Liberals were aghast that anyone would try to find an alternative to the \"mutually assured destruction\" (MAD) strategy, which Reagan called a \"suicide pact.\"\n\nNone other than then-Sen. Joe Biden was wrong on the issue, just as he's been wrong on virtually every other major issue since: \"'Star Wars' represents a fundamental assault on the concepts, alliances and arms-control agreements that have buttressed American security for several decades, and the president's continued adherence to it constitutes one of the most reckless and irresponsible acts in the history of modern statecraft,\" he counseled in 1986.\n\nWell Joe, some of the technology developed as a result of that initiative helped develop the Iron Dome, which Israel uses to shoot down Iranian missiles and Houthi projectiles.\n\nReagan was right to be looking to the future because in coming years the battle may very well be fought in space. The Russians think so, evidently, because according to U.S. officials they just launched a space weapon that may have the capability to track and destroy our satellites.\n\nDeputy Ambassador Robert Wood delivered the news at the United Nations Monday:\n\n\"On May 16, Russia launched a satellite into low Earth orbit that the United States assesses is likely a counterspace weapon presumably capable of attacking other satellites in low Earth orbit,\" Wood said in remarks before a vote on a UN Security Council resolution drafted by Russia on outer space security. \"Russia deployed this new counterspace weapon into the same orbit as a US government satellite.\"\n\nWood added that the May 16 launch \"follows prior Russian satellite launches likely of counterspace systems to low Earth orbit in 2019 and 2022.\"\n\nPentagon spokesperson Maj. Gen. Pat Ryder said on Tuesday that US assessments of the Russian satellite \"further indicate characteristics resembling previously deployed counterspace payloads, from 2019 and 2022.\"\n\nAmerican officials are concerned that Russia is trying to develop a nuclear space weapon, which could have devastating effects if deployed.\n\nThe US and its allies have been working to deter Russia from developing a nuclear space weapon, CNN previously reported. If deployed, such a weapon could destroy satellites by creating a massive energy wave when detonated, potentially crippling a vast swath of the commercial and government satellites that the world below depends on to talk on cell phones, pay bills, and surf the internet.\n\nThis launch is obviously a concerning -- and provocative -- development. The United States must keep doing what we've been doing since the Cold War: stay one step ahead of the former Soviet Union.\n\nMore Russia:\n\nThree Resignations and a High Profile Arrest Show the

urgent measures to prevent for all time the placement of weapons in outer space\", was a distraction and accused Moscow of \"diplomatic gaslighting\".\n\nHe said that Russia's \"likely\" counter-space weapon was \"presumably capable of attacking other satellites in low Earth orbit\".\n\n\"Russia deployed this new counter-space weapon into the same orbit as a US government satellite,\" he said in remarks ahead of Monday's vote.\n\n\"Russia's May 16 launch follows prior Russian satellite launches likely of counter-space systems to low Earth orbit in 2019 and 2022.\"\n\nIn February, the White House said Russia was developing an anti-satellite weapon, the existence of which was confirmed after lawmakers warned of an unspecified but serious threat to national security.\n\nSpace has been a rare area where the two countries have maintained a degree of cooperation despite a swathe of Western sanctions and dire relations after Russia's invasion of Ukraine.\n\nBoth countries ferry each other's crew members to and from the International Space Station (ISS), where their astronauts are jointly stationed.\n\nThe space weapon spat between Moscow and Washington resurrects the spectre of space being militarized despite the 1967 Outer Space Treaty which forbids countries from deploying \"any objects carrying nuclear weapons or any other kinds of weapons of mass destruction\" into orbit or outer space.", "source": {"uri": "digitaljournal.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Digital Journal"}, "authors": [{"uri": "agence_france_presse@digitaljournal.com", "name": "Agence

It said its launch vehicle Soyuz-2.1b was used.\n\nThe different reported launch dates might be explained by the fact that the Moscow time zone is three hours ahead of GMT.\n\nNeither Moscow nor Washington provided any further details.\n\nBut space analysts say that Cosmos 2576 appears to be on the same orbit as America's USA 314 satellite.\n\nSince launching a full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, Russia has warned that US satellites aiding the Ukrainian military could become legitimate targets.\n\nIn February, the White House admitted Russia was developing a \"troubling\" new

around the Washington DC.\n\nA report released by the Washington DC-based Center for Strategic and International Studies last year suggested that Russia is developing a range of anti-satellite (ASAT)

Subsequent reporting said that the potential weapon would be used to knock out satellites critical to U.S. national security.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE DAILYWIRE+ APP\n\nRussia vetoed a UN Security Council resolution last month proposed by the United States and Japan reaffirming the obligation of countries that signed the Outer Space Treaty not to place nuclear weapons in orbit around the Earth. The resolution would ban member states from developing nuclear weapons specifically designed to be placed in orbit.\n\n\"As we have noted previously, the United States assesses that Russia is developing a new satellite carrying a nuclear device,\" National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan said in a statement in April. \"We have heard President Putin say publicly that Russia has no intention of deploying nuclear weapons in space.

Russia's steadfast denial and dismissal of these claims as \"fake news\" highlights the divergent perspectives on space security and the militarization of space. While the U.S. remains vigilant about potential threats posed by Russian space activities, Russia continues to advocate for a ban on deploying weapons in space and criticizes the U.S. for rejecting collaborative proposals aimed at ensuring space security. This ongoing dispute underscores the urgent need for international dialogue and the establishment of clear, binding treaties to govern space activities and prevent an arms race in this critical domain. As technological advancements make space increasingly contested, maintaining peace and stability in outer space remains a paramount concern for the global community.\n\nRussia Rejects U.S. Claims of Space Weapon Deployment as \"Fake News\"\n\nRussia's top arms control diplomat dismissed as \"fake news\" the United States' assertion that Russia had launched a weapon into low-Earth orbit capable of inspecting and attacking other satellites. The Kremlin has categorically denied these claims by U.S. officials, asserting that Moscow is not developing a space-based anti-satellite nuclear weapon.\n\nOn Tuesday, U.S. Space Command highlighted a recent launch of a Soyuz rocket from Russia's Plesetsk launch site, suggesting it likely involved \"a counterspace weapon presumably capable of attacking other satellites in low Earth orbit.\" In response, Russia's defense ministry confirmed the May 17 launch included a spacecraft but provided no further details about its purpose.\n\n\"I don't think we should respond to any fake news from Washington,\" Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov stated via the Interfax news agency. Ryabkov emphasized that American claims would not alter Russia's policy, which has \"always consistently opposed the deployment of strike weapons in low-Earth orbit.\"\n\nIn February, President Vladimir Putin and then-Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu also refuted U.S. allegations that Russia was developing a space-based anti-satellite nuclear weapon intended to disrupt military communications and civilian services.\n\nU.S. Space Command specified that the May launch, dated as May 16, included COSMOS 2576, a Russian military \"inspector\" spacecraft. U.S. officials have long criticized such satellites for exhibiting reckless behavior in space.\n\nKremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov declined to comment directly on the U.S. accusations but insisted that Russia was acting in full accordance with international law. \"We are not violating anything. We have repeatedly advocated a ban on the deployment of any weapons into space. Unfortunately, our initiatives were rejected, including by the United States,\" Peskov told reporters.\n\nA U.S. official familiar with the intelligence noted that U.S. intelligence agencies had anticipated the launch of COSMOS 2576 and had informed allies about their assessment prior to the satellite's deployment. The launch also included civilian satellites placed into different orbits.\n\nAs of Tuesday, COSMOS 2576 had not approached any U.S. satellites. However, space analysts observed it to be in the same orbital ring as USA 314, a bus-sized National Reconnaissance Office satellite launched in April 2021.\n\nRyabkov reiterated that Russia's space program was progressing as planned, with objectives aimed at strengthening the country's defense capabilities. He added, \"this is also not news,\" and criticized the United States for dismissing Russian proposals on enhancing the security of space activities. Ryabkov highlighted a Russian initiative to develop a treaty aimed at preventing an arms race in space, which the U.S. had rejected.\n\nThe U.S. allegations come amid heightened tensions between the two nations, with both sides expressing concerns over military activities in space. The debate over the weaponization of space has intensified in recent years, as technological advancements have made space an increasingly contested domain.\n\nRussia's stance remains firm in opposing the deployment of weapons in space, aligning with its long-standing policy to prevent the militarization of outer space. This position is echoed by many international actors who advocate for maintaining space as a domain for peaceful activities.\n\nThe international community continues to monitor developments closely, with many urging for dialogue and cooperation to prevent an arms race in space. The establishment of clear regulations and treaties is seen as crucial to maintaining stability and security in this new frontier.\n\nWhile the U.S. maintains its concerns about potential threats from Russian space activities, it also faces scrutiny over its own space initiatives. Both countries' actions and policies will likely remain under international observation as the discourse on space security evolves.\n\nIn summary, Russia firmly rejects U.S. claims about the launch of a counterspace weapon, labeling them as baseless and part of a broader pattern of misinformation. The ongoing debate underscores the need for robust international frameworks to govern space activities and prevent conflict in this increasingly critical domain.\n\nIn conclusion, the recent allegations by the United States regarding Russia's launch of a potential counterspace weapon have further strained the already tense relations between the two nations. Russia's steadfast denial and dismissal of these claims as \"fake news\" highlights the divergent perspectives on space security and the militarization of space. While the U.S. remains vigilant about potential threats posed by Russian space activities, Russia continues to advocate for a ban on deploying weapons in space and criticizes the U.S. for rejecting collaborative proposals aimed at ensuring space security.

Gen. Pat Ryder held a news briefing Tuesday and claimed that the space weapon can attack other satellites. His comments mirrored earlier claims made by the U.S. ambassador to the UN on Monday that Russia had launched an anti-satellite weapon.\n\n\"Russia launched a satellite into low Earth orbit that we assess is likely a counter space weapon, presumably capable of attacking other satellites in low Earth orbit,\" Ryder said. He added that the weapon was launched into the \"same orbit\" as a U.S. government satellite.\n\nThe U.S. is monitoring the situation and stands ready to protect the \"space domain,\" Ryder said. The satellite weapon was allegedly launched on May 16 on a Soyuz rocket from Russia's Plesetsk launch site.\n\nMoscow, however, denied the U.S.' claims, deriding them as disinformation.\n\n\"I don't think we should respond to any fake news from Washington,\" Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov was quoted as saying by the Interfax news agency.\n\n\"The Americans can say whatever they want but our policy does not change from this,\" said Ryabkov, adding that Moscow had \"always consistently opposed the deployment of strike weapons in low-Earth orbit.\"\n\nThe Kremlin confirmed it launched a rocket on May 17 that had a spacecraft on board but gave no details about what it was for.\n\nThe U.S. and Russia have been clashing over the issue of space weapons at the UN in recent weeks, with a U.S.-backed resolution and Russia-backed resolution to ban space weapons failing to be passed by the Security Council (UNSC). Both countries are accusing the other of trying to militarize space, even as they both present resolutions calling for bans.\n\nThe first resolution was introduced by the U.S. and Japan and put to a vote at the UNSC on April 24. The resolution sought to reaffirm the Outer Space Treaty of 1967, which bans states from placing nuclear weapons and weapons of mass destruction in space and mandates that outer space be held in common for all of humanity. In other words, no state can annex or claim sovereignty over space.\n\nRussia pushed back against the resolution and deemed it unnecessary, given that the Outer Space Treaty is still in effect. The Russian representative accused the U.S. and Japan of \"cherry-picking\" weapons of mass destruction and nuclear weapons instead of banning all kinds of weaponry in order to \"camouflage their lack of interest\" in outer space peace.\n\nRussia, a permanent member of the UNSC with veto powers, voted against the draft resolution, killing it. All other members were in favour except for China, which abstained.\n\nShortly after, Russia introduced its own draft resolution calling for a ban on all space weapons, including weapons of mass destruction, which the U.S. representative called \"disingenuous.\"\n\nIt was during this meeting that the U.S. ambassador first asserted that Russia had launched a space weapon on May 16.\n\nNumerous member states pointed out that the text of Russia's resolution was based on the text of the previous U.S.-Japan resolution, which Russia vetoed.\n\nWhen put to a vote on Monday, the resolution failed to pass. Seven states, including the U.S., voted against it.\n\nEcuador's ambassador noted the outcome was \"largely predictable\" but decried the UNSC as becoming \"just one more arena that exposes today's geopolitical tensions.\"\n\nIn a comment to the Associated Press, Paul Meyer, Canada's former ambassador for disarmament and a fellow at the Vancouver-based Outer Space Institute, lamented the \"squabbling\" taking place over the issue of space weapons.\n\n\"We have this negative, squabbling attitude among leading space powers that seem more interested in scoring points off their adversaries rather than engaging in constructive dialogue,\" he said.", "source": {"uri": "globalnews.ca", "dataType": "news", "title": "Global News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Unfortunately, they launched it into the same orbit as a US government satellite. This came as the US and Russia have been taking turns voting down rival resolutions to de-weaponize space at the United Nations. It also comes as Biden announced another draw-down of the Northeast Gasoline Supply Reserve. These two things taken together could become a serious problem.\n\n\"Russia launched a satellite into low Earth orbit that we assess is likely a counter-space weapon presumably capable of attacking other satellites in low Earth orbit...We have a responsibility to be ready to protect and defend the domain, the space domain, and ensure continuous and uninterrupted support to the Joint and Combined Force.\" Air Force Major General Pat Ryder, Pentagon Spokesman (Breitbart)\n\nSpace Weapon?\n\nRussia denies that it launched a space weapon, but this is exactly what caused the extreme concern (read that near hysterical reaction) of lawmakers back in February. The concern is that the launch could contain nuclear weapons designed to destroy satellites of any nation, including ours.\n\nPlus...does the weapon employ nuclear armament? It's a serious concern, one that Russia downplays and accuses the US of listening to \"fake news.\"\n\nRussia's defence ministry said the May 17 launch had a spacecraft on board but gave no details what it was for.\n\n\"I don't think we should respond to any fake news from Washington,\" Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov was quoted as saying by the Interfax news agency...\n\nCOSMOS 2576, as of Tuesday, has not gone near a U.S. satellite, but space analysts observed it to be in the same orbital ring as USA 314, a bus-sized NRO satellite launched in April 2021.\n\nRyabkov said Russia's space programme was developing as planned, including tasks aimed at strengthening defence capability but added that \"this is also not news\".\n\nHe said the United States was wrong to have dismissed Russian proposals on strengthening the security of space activities, including a proposal on developing a treaty on preventing an arms race in space. Reuters\n\nMeanwhile...\n\nIs Biden deliberately releasing oil from our reserve to cause a depletion that leaves the US vulnerable to our adversaries?\n\nIf war should break out, our petroleum supply would be severely depleted, and yes, we NEED petroleum in spite of what the leftists advocate.\n\nBiden has been trying to win votes for the last 3 years by releasing oil from the US reserves to bring down prices that he pushed up- and according to Forbes, those millions of barrels of oil have not been replaced. Now he plans to release 1 million more barrels. It could prove disastrous in the current world environment.\n\nWhile you're at it, be sure to check out our friends at Whatfinger News, the Internet's conservative front-page founded by

Gen. Pat Ryder said Russia \"likely\" has launched a \"counter space weapon\" capable of threatening U.S. government satellites.\n\nResponding to a question from ABC News, Ryder said that Russia launched the satellite on May 16, adding it was deployed \"into the same orbit as a U.S. government satellite.\"\n\n\"Assessments further indicate characteristics resembling previous deployed counter space payloads from 2019 and 2022,\" Ryder said. \"Obviously, that's something that we'll continue to monitor. Certainly, we would say that we have a responsibility to be ready to protect and defend the space domain and ensure continuous and uninterrupted support to the joint and combined forces.\"\n\nCounter space satellites have the potential to use lasers to \"blind\" satellite sensors with overwhelming light, preventing them from taking images.

low Earth orbit that we assess is likely a counter-space weapon presumably capable of attacking other satellites in low Earth orbit,\" Pentagon spokesman Air Force Major General Pat Ryder told a press briefing late Tuesday.\n\nThe Russian \"counter-space weapon\" launched on May 16 was deployed \"into the same orbit as a US government satellite,\" he said.\n\nRyder added that Washington would continue to monitor the situation and was ready to protect its interests.\n\n\"We have a responsibility to be ready to protect and defend the domain, the space domain, and ensure continuous and

non-proliferation motion at the United Nations.\n\n\"They have once again demonstrated that their true priorities in the area of outer space are aimed not at keeping space free from weapons of any kind, but at placing weapons in space and turning it into an arena for military confrontation,\" Russian foreign ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said in a statement.\n\nThe world powers have traded multiple accusations of seeking to weaponize space in recent months.\n\nThey have proposed rival non-proliferation motions at the United Nations as part of the spat.\n\nRussia vetoed the US initiative last month, while Moscow's proposal was blocked by the United States, Britain and France in a vote on Monday.\n\nUS envoy Robert Wood said Russia's proposal, which called on all countries to \"take urgent measures to prevent for all time the placement of weapons in outer space\", was a distraction and accused Moscow of \"diplomatic gaslighting\".\n\nHe said that Russia's \"likely\" counter-space weapon was \"presumably capable of attacking other satellites in low Earth orbit\".\n\n\"Russia deployed this new counter-space weapon into the same orbit as a US government satellite,\"

Tension between superpowers escalates", "body": "Russia earlier launched a counter space weapon which the US said threatens its satellites in the Low Earth Orbit. This weapon has both offensive and defensive capabilities. In further signs of deteriorating relations between the US and the Russian Federation, the Pentagon has given out the details of a Russian counter space weapon that was launched earlier into the Low Earth Orbit (LEO). This weapon is said to be capable enough of attacking US Space assets. The US said that this launch took place on May 16, 2024.\n\nThe US Space Command said that the Russian Satellite Cosmos 2576 was launched on May 16, 2024, from the Plesetsk Cosmodrome, which is located 497 miles north of Moscow.\n\nRoscosmos, the state-owned Russian space agency issued a statement in which it said that the satellite was launched in the interest of the Defense Ministry and this launch was carried out using the Soyuz-2.1b launch vehicle. The launch date was given as May 17, 2024. This is due to the time difference between the two countries.\n\nThe re-entry of the Russian launch vehicle was recorded off the coast of Baja California in Mexico.\n\nSpeaking at a meeting organized by the UN Security Council, US Ambassador Robert Wood called this launch as \"troubling\" and highlighted its positioning in an orbit with several US Government satellites. In recent times, the US has been concerned about the growing weaponization of space by Russia which could lead to massive losses of several commercial and government satellites launched by US-based entities.\n\nWhile the US accusations were ascertained, Russia too accused the US of indulging in space battles. The spokesperson for the Russian Foreign Minister had earlier accused the US of turning space into \"an arena for military confrontation\".\n\nThe Pentagon too has confirmed that the Russians had launched a counter space weapon on May 16 leading to potential threats. This is the second launch of such a weapon by Russia in recent times. The earlier launch was in 2022.\n\nEarlier, Russia had vetoed a resolution by the US and Japan to ban the development of nuclear space assets.\n\nThis comes as the relations between the two countries have continued to deteriorate over the last two decades on a variety of issues including Russia's invasion of Ukraine and Georgia, alleged attempts at influencing US elections, competing influence in the West Asian region, Africa and the Indo-Pacific region.\n\n1. Which are the countries that have Anti-Satellite weapons?\n\nOnly 4 countries have developed anti-satellite weapons. These countries are Russia, the US, China and India.\n\n2. Are there any treaties governing the space sector?\n\nFive effective treaties govern the conduct of space between the nations. The most influential is the Outer Space Treaty of 1967.", "source": {"uri": "economictimes.indiatimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Economic Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Gen. Pat Ryder said that Russia launched last week a satellite carrying a counterspace weapon that is presumably capable of attacking other satellites in low Earth orbit. Ryder claimed that Russia deployed the satellite without communicating this fact to the United States. \"I do not think we should respond to any misinformation from Washington. The Russian space program is developing as planned, launches of spacecraft for various purposes, including devices that solve the problem of strengthening our defense capability, are also not news. Another thing is that we always consistently oppose the deployment of strike weapons in low-Earth orbit,\" Ryabkov told reporters. If the United States wanted to ensure the safety of space activities, it should have reconsidered its approach to Russia's space proposals, the senior diplomat added.Last week, the Wall Street Journal reported that US officials said Russia launched a research spacecraft into space in February 2022 intended to test components for a potential nuclear anti-satellite weapon.In February, the US government claimed that Russia was developing a space-based anti-satellite weapon that poses a serious threat to US national security.Russian President Vladimir Putin has said Russia has always been categorically opposed to deploying nuclear weapons in space. Russia's activities in space are no different from those of other countries, including the US, Putin added.Speaking about introduction of the Bulava ICBM into service, Ryabkov said that Russia does not violate the limits set by the New START Treaty.The R30 3M30 Bulava (RSM-56 for use in international treaties, SS-NX-30 according to NATO classification) is a Russian three-stage solid-fuel intercontinental ballistic missile, designed to arm the advanced Borei-class nuclear-powered strategic missile submarines. It was officially reported that the missile is capable of carrying several hypersonic nuclear warheads with individual guidance. The Bulava is expected to form the basis of Russia's strategic nuclear forces grouping until 2040-2045, according to Russian military statements.", "source": {"uri": "sputnikglobe.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sputnik International"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satellite", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Satellite"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Russia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low_Earth_orbit", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Low Earth orbit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roscosmos", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Roscosmos"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Defense", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of Defense"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spacecraft", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Spacecraft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-satellite_weapon", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Anti-satellite weapon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wall_Street_Journal", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Wall Street Journal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_government_of_the_United_States", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Federal government of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vladimir_Putin", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Vladimir Putin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solid-propellant_rocket", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Solid-propellant rocket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSM-56_Bulava", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "RSM-56 Bulava"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypersonic_speed", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hypersonic speed"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_START", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "New START"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intercontinental_ballistic_missile", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Intercontinental ballistic missile"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_Armed_Forces", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Russian Armed Forces"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_power", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nuclear power"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treaty", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Treaty"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Submarine", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Submarine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_weapon", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nuclear weapon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NATO", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NATO"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace_and_Defense/Space", "label": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace and Defense/Space", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Television/Satellite", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Television/Satellite", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Military_Science", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Military Science", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Models/Rockets", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Models/Rockets", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 63}], "image": "https://cdn1.img.sputnikglobe.com/images/sharing/article/eng/1118582903.jpg?10235119751716371547", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9588153", "eventUri": "eng-9588153", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.07450980392156858, "wgt": 145, "relevance": 1}

Plumb at a House Armed Services Committee hearing.\n\nIn February, Rep. Mike Turner (R-Ohio), the chair of the House Intelligence Committee, issued a statement warning of a \"serious national security threat.\" White House National Security Council spokesman John Kirby then confirmed media reports that the danger involved an anti-satellite weapon the Russians have been developing, which would violate an international treaty that bans the deployment of nuclear weapons in space.\n\nVarious Pentagon officials subsequently warned of the widespread destruction a nuke could wreak in space, without outright saying that the Russians were developing such a weapon. Space Development Agency director Derek M. Tournear, for example, noted that detonating a nuclear weapon in space would destroy commercial, civil, and military satellites and constitute an \"attack on the world.\"\n\nPlumb offered even more detail, saying in his written testimony that such a weapon \"could pose a threat to all satellites operated by countries and companies around the globe, as well as to the vital communications, scientific, meteorological, agricultural, commercial, and national security services.\"\n\nIn low-Earth orbit (LEO) in particular, Plumb cautioned most satellites aren't hardened against a nuclear detonation, making them especially vulnerable to damage. The outcome could vary based on factors like the detonation type and location, but satellites in the blast zone would likely be destroyed. He also suggested a sufficiently powerful nuclear detonation in the right location could render LEO unusable for up to a year.\n\n\"It is not imminent in the way that we should have to worry about it right now, but we are concerned about it,\" said Plumb. \"The department and the entire administration, and I know this Congress is taking this deadly seriously.\"\n\nThe U.S. has a significant number of satellites in LEO, both civil and military, like the Space Development Agency's Proliferated Warfighting Space Architecture and SpaceX's Starlink constellation.\n\n\"And those could be what a Russian weapon system might be trying to counter, is that proliferated, architecture that we're seeing used so well in Ukraine and as part of our overall architecture moving forward for the United States,\" Charles Galbreath, senior fellow at the Mitchell Institute for Aerospace Studies, told Air & Space Forces Magazine in February.\n\nIn addition to military and commercial satellite damage, Galbreath cautioned of potential indirect effects from the detonation, referencing the Cold War-era \"Starfish Prime\" test. In 1962, the U.S. detonated a nuclear weapon in low-Earth orbit, disabling eight out of 24 satellites and causing a power blackout in Hawaii.\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin has denied any intention to deploy nuclear weapons in space. However, Russia recently vetoed a U.N. Security Council resolution, co-proposed by the U.S. and Japan, urging Member States not to develop such weapons. Russia's U.N. Ambassador cited the resolution's inadequacy in banning all space weapons as the reason for the veto.\n\nMoscow is now considering proposing a resolution calling on all nations to urgently prevent the placement of any weapons in outer space \"for all time,\" according to the Associated Press.\n\nEarlier this week, Secretary of Defense Lloyd J. Austin III said if a nuclear device were detonated today in outer space, it would have \"devastating consequences,\" and that it's \"irresponsible for anybody to even consider deploying or employing a nuclear device in space.\" Austin was addressing a lawmaker's question regarding Russia's veto and China's abstention of the U.N. proposal by the U.S. and Japan, at a separate House Armed Services Committee hearing. Plumb also criticized Moscow and Beijing's stance at the U.N., calling it \"hypocritical and unbelievable,\" given the nations' continued development and fielding of counterspace weapons.", "source": {"uri": "airandspaceforces.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Air & Space Forces Magazine"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low_Earth_orbit", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Low Earth orbit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satellite", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Satellite"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_weapon", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nuclear weapon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Russia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_security", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "National security"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_F._Plumb", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "John F.

Switzerland abstained.\n\nFor a resolution to be adopted, it needs to secure at least nine votes in favour, and no negative vote (or veto) by any of the Council's five Permanent Members (China, France, Russia, UK and US).\n\nIntroducing the text, Russian Ambassador and Permanent Representative Vasily Nebenzya said that the 24 April vote demonstrated the West's single motivation, \"to attempt to portray the Russian Federation in an unfavourable light\" and \"assign to us a certain plan of action which we do not have\".\n\nIn the current text, Moscow provided those countries another opportunity, \"not in word, but in deed\" to \"demonstrate the peaceful nature of their intentions\", he said.\n\nHe said the draft was \"comprehensive\" in nature and that it reflects the \"interests and aspirations of an overwhelming majority\" of UN members.\n\n\"Today's vote is a unique moment of truth for our Western colleagues,\" he emphasized, stating that a failure to support the text will demonstrate that such countries wish to retain their ability to militarize outer space.\n\nSpeaking before the vote, US Ambassador and Deputy Permanent Representative Robert Wood, however, stressed that Moscow was seeking to distract global attention from its development of a new satellite carrying a nuclear device.\n\nThe hastily drafted text did not reaffirm the basic provisions of the Treaty

This follows Russia's veto of a text co-led by the US and Japan in April.\n\nThe Russian-led draft resolution failed, as it did not secure sufficient votes in favour among the 15 council members.\n\nSeven nations supported it (Algeria, Ecuador, China, Guyana, Mozambique, Russia, and Sierra Leone), while seven voted against (France, Japan, Malta, Republic of Korea, Slovenia, the United Kingdom and the United States). Switzerland abstained.\n\nFor a resolution to be adopted, it needs to secure at least nine votes in favour, and no negative vote (or veto) by any of the Council's five Permanent Members (China, France, Russia, UK and US).\n\nIntroducing the text, Russian Ambassador and Permanent Representative Vasily Nebenzya said that the 24 April vote demonstrated the West's single motivation, \"to attempt to portray the Russian Federation in an unfavourable light\" and \"assign to us a certain plan of action which we do not have\".\n\nIn the current text, Moscow provided those countries another opportunity, \"not in word, but in deed\" to \"demonstrate the peaceful nature of their intentions\", he said.\n\nHe said the draft was \"comprehensive\" in nature and that it reflects the \"interests and aspirations of an overwhelming majority\" of UN members.\n\n\"Today's vote is a unique moment of truth for our Western colleagues,\" he emphasized, stating that a failure to support the text will demonstrate that such countries wish to retain their ability to militarize outer space.\n\nSpeaking before the vote, US Ambassador and Deputy Permanent Representative Robert Wood, however, stressed that Moscow was seeking to distract global attention from its development of a new satellite carrying a nuclear device.\n\nThe hastily drafted text did not reaffirm the basic provisions of the Treaty on the Prohibition of the Use of Force in Outer Space and from Space against the Earth and, for that reason, the US will not support this \"disingenuous\" resolution, he said.\n\nHe also reported that, on 16 May, Russia launched a satellite into low-Earth orbit, which the \"United States assesses is likely a counterspace weapon presumably capable of attacking other satellites in low Earth orbit.\"\n\nHe added that Russia deployed the satellite into the same orbit as one belonging to the US.", "source": {"uri": "news.un.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "UN News"}, "authors": [],

{"id": 243258466, "title": "Stephen Fry cleared by wrongdoing by MCC after former president said 237-year-old club is full...", "text": "Stephen Fry was cleared of misconduct by Marylebone Cricket Club yesterday after accusing the institution of 'stinking of privilege and classism'. His comments were made on a panel discussing racism in cricket at the Welsh literature festival and have reportedly caused 'outrage' within the club where he is still a member and was president from 2022 to 2023. The furore, revealed in the Mail earlier this month, was sparked when the actor told the Hay Literature Festival: 'It (MCC) has a public face that is deeply disturbing, sort of beetroot-coloured gentleman in yellow-and-orange blazers sitting in this space in front of the Long Room and looking as if they'd come out of an Edwardian cartoon.' The remarks saw the former MCC president, 66, accused by members of hypocrisy and breaking the body's code of conduct. But yesterday, the club dismissed the complaints, adding that Fry's comments were 'not an attack on Members of the MCC'. Mark Milliken-Smith KC, chair of the club's disciplinary panel, said in his judgement: 'There are no issues of misconduct raised when your comments are fairly and properly considered in their wider and complete context.' The author reportedly also said that the annual Eton versus Harrow public school match, which is traditionally hosted by the 237-year-old club at Lord's Cricket Ground in north-west London, was a prime example of this privilege. It comes after Fry was accused by the MCC member, Chris Waterman, of making racist and misogynistic jokes during a club dinner last year. Mr Waterman alleged the QI host referred to an amateur cricket team called the Allahakbarries and joked the term 'Allahu akbar' was usually followed by a 'loud bang'. But MCC bosses launched a disciplinary hearing into Mr Waterman rather than Fry, claiming he had brought the club into disrepute by putting the author's comments into the public domain. In 2022, the MCC Chairman of the \u00a3800 a year club received a six-month suspension after a large number of members complained when he was over-heard making a misplaced gaffe about colostomy bags. At the MCC's annual meeting, Bruce Carnegie Brown's microphone was switched back on before members had returned to their seats after a break. Unknowingly, he whispered to the treasurer: 'I expect they are taking an age to empty their colostomy bags,' but it was overheard by a woman listening online and the Lloyds chairman was asked to make a large donation to Colostomy UK. But members were upset with the low-level punishment and called for his suspension which was permitted by the Disciplinary Committee. Earlier this month Fry threatened to quit the all-male Garrick Club unless members voted to admit women. The motion passed, meaning women \u2013 possibly including classicist Dame Mary Beard and broadcaster Cathy Newman \u2013 can join the 193-year-old institution. A representative for Fry said: 'MCC Comms are handling the response to this matter, and Stephen Fry does not have any further comments.' Fry's representatives have been approached for comment.", "summary": "The remarks saw the former MCC president, 66, accused by members of hypocrisy and breaking the body's code of conduct.", "url": "https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-13581997/Stephen-Fry-cleared-wrongdoing-MCC-former-president-said-237-year-old-club-beetroot-coloured-men-stink-privilege.html?ns_mchannel=rss&ns_campaign=1490&ito=1490", "image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2024/06/29/00/86718697-0-image-m-30_1719618405805.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-29 02:17:24", "author": "Editor,Sam Lawley", "authors": ["Editor", "Sam Lawley"], "language": "en", "catgory": "politics", "source_country": "GB", "sentiment": 0.084}

The presidential candidate\u2019s comments to the cheering crowd largely centered on the ongoing migrant crisis, which he linked to a rise in crime and a decrease in jobs. \u201cWe had the safest border in the history of our country. Now we have the unsafest border in the history of the world,\u201d Trump told the crowd at the Liacouras Center. The GOP frontrunner focused on the murder case of Rachel Morin as proof that migrants are wreaking havoc on the US \u2014 police believe the Maryland mother of five was raped and slaughtered by a Salvadorian migrant on the run after killing another girl in his native country. According to Trump, even non-violent migrants pose a danger to the nation\u2019s security. He claimed they are stealing jobs, an issue that disproportionately affects black Americans. President Joe Biden has exacerbated the issue by allowing inflation to run rampant under Bidenomics, Trump continued, promising to replace the latter plan with \u201cMAGA-omics.\u201d \u201cI believe it\u2019s the worst inflation the country\u2019s ever had,\u201d he said. \u201cTo stop Biden-flation, I will end crooked Joe\u2019s wasteful spending and rapidly terminate the green new scam.\u201d Trump\u2019s visit to the Liacouras Center \u2014 the 10,200-seat North Philly arena home to Temple University basketball and various other events \u2014 comes as polls show him opening up a narrow lead over President Biden in Pennsylvania. A Marist College poll released last week found voters in Biden\u2019s birth state prefer the former prez to the incumbent by 2 percentage points (47% to 45%). Earlier Saturday, Trump visited the Faith and Freedom Coalition Conference in Washington DC to brag about his involvement in overturning Roe v. Wade.", "summary": "\"We had the safest border in the history of our country.

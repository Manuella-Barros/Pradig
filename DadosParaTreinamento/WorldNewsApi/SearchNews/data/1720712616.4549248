According to the directive, the police department has been asked to submit the report by June 11 on how the violence flared up in the district, bordering Assam, and if adequate action has been taken. The directive was issued by the secretary to the chief minister and addressed to the Manipur Director General of Police (DGP), security advisor, and state chief secretary. The order also asked the state home department to follow up the matter. This directive followed a January 15 order from the CMO, instructing the DGP to implement all requisite security protocols to avert any untoward incidents and address threats from approximately 200 armed suspected militants who had relocated from Churachandpur to Phaitol Village, encompassing the Old and New Kaiphundai areas in Tamenglong district, adjacent to Jiribam. According to the police control room, the situation in Jiribam was reported \u201ctense\u201d but under control.

The control room stated that authorities are actively monitoring social media platforms to identify the posts that could incite communal tensions and has urged the public to abstain from disseminating unverified information. In response to Saturday\u2019s violence, over 70 state police commandos units were airlifted from Imphal to Jiribam to support the local security forces in controlling the situation.", "summary": "", "url": "https://indianexpress.com/article/india/manipur-cmo-jiribam-violence-9382003/", "image": "https://images.indianexpress.com/2024/06/manipur.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-09 15:50:42", "author": null, "language": "en", "catgory": "politics", "source_country": "in", "sentiment": -0.244}

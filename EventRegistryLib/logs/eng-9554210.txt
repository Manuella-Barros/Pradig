ROBERTSON - Associated Press\n\nRALEIGH, N.C. (AP) -- What is expected to be a very small group of North Carolina voters will decide which Republicans will serve as the party's nominees for a congressional district seat and for the statewide positions of lieutenant governor and auditor.\n\nOne of Tuesday's GOP primary runoffs is for the 13th Congressional District, though one of the candidates who will appear on the ballot is no longer actively running. Kelly Daughtry, who finished first in the March 5 primary, announced last week that she was suspending her campaign and supporting Brad Knott, a former federal prosecutor from Raleigh who obtained the endorsement of former President and presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump.\n\nRunoffs were called for by the second-place finisher in each of the March primaries after the leading vote-getter failed to receive more than 30% of the vote. There are also two other local elections next week.\n\nOverall, 1.8 million people -- about 24% of all eligible registered voters -- cast ballots during the March 5 primary. Turnout for the runoff is expected to be much smaller. About 26,000 people had cast ballots through Wednesday, the State Board of Elections said.\n\nThese runoffs are \"pretty low-octane affairs,\" with less public campaigning and more efforts by candidates and volunteers to get the most committed allies out to vote, said David McLennan, a political science professor at Meredith College in Raleigh. \"They really depend on the campaign's ability to reach out to their supporters.\"\n\nIn addition to registered Republicans, the GOP runoff voting is open to unaffiliated voters who either voted Republican in the March primaries or didn't vote. There are no Democratic races.\n\nIn the congressional race, Daughtry said a pathway to victory for her was \"no longer feasible\" after Knott received Trump's endorsement.\n\nBut the Johnston County attorney is still listed on the ballot, leaving open the possibility that she could win. It's unlikely that she would accept the nomination, however, according to McLennan, who said such a move could sink her future in GOP politics. If she wins and doesn't accept the nomination, it will be up to local Republicans to appoint the nominee.\n\nKnott has warned supporters that despite his endorsement from Trump, he has not yet won, and reminded them to vote.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\nFourteen Republicans were on the ballot in March for the newly reconfigured Republican-leaning 13th District, which covers all or parts of eight counties. The horseshoe-shaped boundaries arc around most of Raleigh and stretch from Lee County -- then east and north -- to the Virginia border.\n\nThe runoff winner will take on Democratic nominee Frank Pierce. The current 13th District congressman, Democrat Wiley Nickel, declined to seek reelection, citing the North Carolina legislature's redistricting last fall that skewed the district to the right politically.\n\nThe runoff for lieutenant governor features Hal Weatherman, a former chief of staff to then-Lt. Gov. Dan Forest, and Forsyth County District Attorney Jim O'Neill. Weatherman finished first in the 11-candidate GOP primary.\n\nThe primary winner will take on Democratic nominee and state Sen. Rachel Hunt, who is also the daughter of former four-term Gov. Jim Hunt.\n\nThere aren't any obvious major policy fissures between Weatherman and O'Neill. Weatherman has been endorsed by current Lt. Gov. Mark Robinson, who won the March GOP primary for governor and has been on the campaign trail for over a year. O'Neill has name recognition after running for attorney general in 2020, when he narrowly lost to Democrat Josh Stein, who is now his party's candidate for governor.\n\nThe lieutenant governor has limited duties, such as presiding over state Senate debate and holding membership on state education and community college boards.\n\nThe auditor's runoff features first-place primary finisher Jack Clark and Dave Boliek. The winner will take on Democratic State Auditor Jessica Holmes, who was appointed by Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper following Beth Wood's resignation last year.\n\nClark is a certified public accountant who has worked in auditing in the private sector before becoming a General Assembly staff employee on budget matters, according to his campaign's website. Boliek is an attorney and former chairman of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill trustee board.\n\nThe lieutenant governor and state auditor are part of the Council of State, composed of the 10 executive branch officials who are elected statewide.\n\nThe last time Council of State races went to primary runoffs was 2012, when two GOP contenders for lieutenant governor received a total of 150,000 votes. In the first primary that led to the runoff, the candidates received a total of 769,000 votes.\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

Turnout for the runoff is expected to be much smaller. About 26,000 people had cast ballots through Wednesday, the State Board of Elections said.\n\nThese runoffs are \"pretty low-octane affairs,\" with less public campaigning and more efforts by candidates and volunteers to get the most committed allies out to vote, said David McLennan, a political science professor at Meredith College in Raleigh. \"They really depend on the campaign's ability to reach out to their supporters.\"\n\nIn addition to registered Republicans, the GOP runoff voting is open to unaffiliated voters who either voted Republican in the March primaries or didn't vote. There are no Democratic races.\n\nIn the congressional race, Daughtry said a pathway to victory for her was \"no longer feasible\" after Knott received Trump's endorsement.\n\nBut the Johnston County attorney is still listed on the ballot, leaving open the possibility that she could win. It's unlikely that she would accept the nomination, however, according to McLennan, who said such a move could sink her future in GOP politics. If she wins and doesn't accept the nomination, it will be up to local Republicans to appoint the nominee.\n\nKnott has warned supporters that despite his endorsement from Trump, he has not yet won, and reminded them to vote.\n\nFourteen Republicans were on the ballot in March for the newly reconfigured Republican-leaning 13th District, which covers all or parts of eight counties. The horseshoe-shaped boundaries arc around most of Raleigh and stretch from Lee County -- then east and north -- to the Virginia border.\n\nThe runoff winner will take on Democratic nominee Frank Pierce. The current 13th District congressman, Democrat Wiley Nickel, declined to seek reelection, citing the North Carolina legislature's redistricting last fall that skewed the district to the right politically.\n\nThe runoff for lieutenant governor features Hal Weatherman, a former chief of staff to then-Lt. Gov. Dan Forest, and Forsyth County District Attorney Jim O'Neill. Weatherman finished first in the 11-candidate GOP primary.\n\nThe primary winner will take on Democratic nominee and state Sen. Rachel Hunt, who is also the daughter of former four-term Gov. Jim Hunt.\n\nThere aren't any obvious major policy fissures between Weatherman and O'Neill. Weatherman has been endorsed by current Lt. Gov. Mark Robinson, who won the March GOP primary for governor and has been on the campaign trail for over a year. O'Neill has name recognition after running for attorney general in 2020, when he narrowly lost to Democrat Josh Stein, who is now his party's candidate for governor.\n\nThe lieutenant governor has limited duties, such as presiding over state Senate debate and holding membership on state education and community college boards.\n\nThe auditor's runoff features first-place primary finisher Jack Clark and Dave Boliek. The winner will take on Democratic State Auditor Jessica Holmes, who was appointed by Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper following Beth Wood's resignation last year.\n\nClark is a certified public accountant who has worked in auditing in the private sector before becoming a General Assembly staff employee on budget matters, according to his campaign's website. Boliek is an attorney and former chairman of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill trustee board.\n\nThe lieutenant governor and state auditor are part of the Council of State, composed of the 10 executive branch officials who are elected statewide.\n\nThe last time Council of State races went to primary runoffs was 2012, when two GOP contenders for lieutenant governor received a total of 150,000 votes. In the first primary that led to the runoff, the candidates received a total of 769,000 votes.\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

But after former President Donald Trump endorsed former federal prosecutor Brad Knott to be the Republican nominee there, Knott's opponent Kelly Daughtry dropped out.\n\nThat could mean few voters show up for the remaining contests on the ballot -- the first statewide runoff since 2012.\n\n\"I think we're going to see somewhere below half of the turnout from the first primary,\" said political scientist Chris Cooper of Western Carolina University. \"So, these are really, really small numbers in terms of statewide voters. We may be at 4 or 5-6% of these eligible voters.\"\n\nOne of the remaining competitive races will determine the Republican nominee for state auditor, a position that often gets little attention. The auditor is the watchdog for state government, reviewing state agencies to find inappropriate spending and other management problems.\n\nJack Clark, a certified public accountant who works for N.C. Rep. Kyle Hall, R-Stokes, came in first in the March primary. But his vote total wasn't enough to avoid a runoff with Dave Boliek, an attorney who serves on the UNC-Chapel Hill board of trustees.\n\nThe key difference between the two candidates is their resumes. Clark says his CPA background makes him the best qualified for the job.\n\n\"I worked as an auditor for years, so I feel I have the background for this kind of niche role,\" Clark said. \"We've elected two consecutive CPAs for the role with an audit background, so I just felt that was important.\"\n\nThe winner of the runoff will face Democrat Jessica Holmes, an attorney and former Wake County commissioner who was appointed to the role in December following the resignation of Beth Wood.\n\nBoliek's background is also in the legal field.\n\n\"What I bring to the table is maturity,\" Boliek said. \"I have led larger organizations, I've run businesses, I've got a master's in business administration as well as a law degree. So not only have I worked as a prosecutor, from traffic court all the way to handling murder cases and everywhere in between, but I have started a business from scratch, managed that business, sold a business.\"\n\nBoliek touts his work on the UNC-Chapel Hill board, where he helped start an audit committee that addressed a structural deficit in the university's budget. He wants to take a similar approach to problems at the Division of Motor Vehicles.\n\n\"It's a disgrace right now,\" Boliek said. \"I have pledged this on day one: DMV is going to be audited for efficiency and economy. We're going to look for some best practices, and we're going to make recommendations to the governor and the legislature on how to make DMV better.\"\n\nBoliek also wants to see the auditor's office create a \"strike force or a rapid response team\" to quickly look into issues like the financial problems at Durham public schools that resulted in staff losing their raises.\n\nBut Boliek's opponent wants to approach the job differently. Clark says it's not appropriate to pledge specific audits before taking office.\n\n\"I just think it would set the auditor's office up as more of a combatant, and it would kind of incentivize me to find things, even if there aren't things to find,\" Clark said.\n\nClark has also criticized Boliek for having been a registered Democrat and voting in that party's primary as recently as 2020.\n\n\"That brings up questions of his motives, of his sincerity,\" Clark said. \"He's been pitching some of his conservative achievements in recent years and months, but voters are still definitely a little skeptical.\"\n\nBoliek describes himself as a lifelong conservative, and records show he's donated to GOP candidates for the past decade (he donated to Democrat Walter Dalton's campaign for governor in 2012). House Speaker Tim Moore and Senate leader Phil Berger have endorsed Boliek, along with several of his primary opponents who didn't make the runoff.\n\n\"I think the Republican Party represents the way I have lived my life and the way I continue to live my life every day,\" Boliek said. \"Donald Trump has done more to open up the Republican Party to people across all spectrums of life, probably more so than anybody since Ronald Reagan, and I count myself in that population.\"\n\nWhile Boliek is trying to reverse a second-place finish in March, his campaign has had a major financial advantage. Ahead of the March primary, his campaign reported raising more than $500,000 (including $100,000 he loaned his campaign), while Clark raised just $18,000. But records show Bob Luddy, a Raleigh businessman and major Republican donor, is supporting Clark in the runoff.\n\n\"I think people really liked the CPA and the audit background,\" Clark said. \"There were so many people on the ballot on the Republican side, that if you're only trying to do a couple minutes of research per person for the auditor's race, you see, 'oh, there's just one guy with the CPA and the audit background.'\"\n\nIn addition to the auditor race, the GOP primary ballot also features a runoff for lieutenant governor.

Roy Cooper.\n\nRepublicans haven't occupied the office since 2009, when longtime Auditor Beth Wood began her 15-year tenure as North Carolina's top government watchdog. (Wood resigned in December after pleading guilty to misusing her state-assigned car for private use. She had previously pleaded guilty to a hit-and-run charge that stemmed from a crash in downtown Raleigh.)\n\nClark is a certified public accountant and research assistant for a budget chair in the N.C. House. Boliek is an attorney and small business owner who has served on the UNC-Chapel Hill Board of Trustees since 2019, including as the board's chair.\n\nThe auditor, one of 10 statewide elected officeholders who serves on the Council of State, is responsible for keeping track of how taxpayer money is being spent and identifying waste or fraud through audits and investigations. The auditor's office conducts oversight of spending across all levels of government, from executive branch agencies and departments, to local governments at the county and municipal levels.\n\nAhead of the May 14 runoff, The News & Observer spoke with Clark and Boliek about their platforms and how they would approach the job of auditor, what distinguishes them from each other, and what their pitch has been to GOP voters.\n\nJack Clark\n\nClark, the first-place finisher in the March primary, hasn't held any prior elected office. He told The N&O he decided to run for auditor because \"auditors don't usually run for office,\" and he believed voters would support a candidate with auditing and accounting experience.\n\nBefore joining Rep. Kyle Hall's staff in January 2023, Clark worked as an external auditor at Grant Thornton, and an internal auditor at Parexel. As a research assistant for Hall, a Stokes County Republican, Clark said he's seen the legislative budget process up close, and has the experience to audit how taxpayer money is allocated and spent.\n\nAs auditor, Clark said he would help set up \"controls and procedures to prevent fraud\" from happening in the first place. He also said the job of an auditor is similar to the job of a judge, in terms of being \"impartial\" and \"free of bias.\"\n\n\"Tone at the top is the most important aspect of any company or organization's culture,\" Clark said in an interview. \"If the people at the top are telling you to get things done, we don't care how, or telling you to specifically meet one way or another, that's going to impact everyone underneath. So, as the (head) of the audit department, I'm going to set the tone that we're going to find the facts, we're going to find the truth, we're not there to push our own personal agenda.\"\n\nClark said that he hasn't pledged to audit anything in particular while campaigning, because that could make him seem like more of a \"combatant than a partner.\"\n\nIf he were to be elected, Clark said he will keep an open mind in determining where to begin oversight, prioritizing areas or parts of government that have the largest amounts of money and the fewest or least-comprehensive audits.\n\n\"I want to be a trusted resource, I want to be trusted by everyone in the state, and if I'm campaigning on pledging certain things, it might hurt that trust,\" he said.\n\nOver the last two months, Clark said he's been focused on trying to engage with grassroots supporters by visiting as many county Republican parties as possible.\n\nIt's difficult to campaign for statewide elected office while working a day job at the General Assembly, but Clark said he works a schedule with reduced hours that allows him to travel to events and do other campaign work during evenings and weekends.\n\nIn addition to Hall, Clark said he's been endorsed by GOP Reps. Jeffrey Elmore, Wayne Sasser, Ray Pickett, Jeff McNeely, Jake Johnson, and the Iredell County Republican Men's Club.\n\nDave Boliek\n\nBoliek finished in second place during the March primary, trailing Clark by just 1.14%.\n\nSince then, however, the former UNC Board of Trustees chairman has been endorsed by two of the other four Republicans who ran in the primary: Charles Dingee and Jim Kee. He also has the support of Jeff Tarte, a former state senator and mayor of Cornelius, who also ran in the primary and came in fourth. (Tarte can't endorse candidates under the rules of the Lake Norman Chamber of Commerce, where he serves as board chair, Boliek said.)\n\nOn his campaign website, Boliek also touts endorsements from several key GOP lawmakers, including Senate leader Phil Berger and House Speaker Tim Moore.\n\nIn an interview, Boliek said that between running businesses that included a government contract firm that serviced U.S. Defense Department contracts across the country, serving as a prosecutor in Cumberland County, and chairing the Board of Trustees at UNC, he has wide-ranging experience \"of being somebody who can get things done.\"\n\n\"If voters are looking for somebody to show up at the state auditor's office with a Ziploc bag full of No. 2 pencils, and a calculator in his or her hand, don't vote for me,\" Boliek said. \"I want to go to the office to set a tone, identify the areas where taxpayers can save the most money, and gain the most efficiency.\"\n\nBoliek didn't hesitate to point out areas of government that he believes are long overdue for a thorough audit, identifying the Division of Motor Vehicles as \"target No. 1,\" saying that the agency has \"failed\" to serve North Carolinians \"efficiently\" and with \"an eye toward customer service.\"\n\nThe DMV's performance has been an ongoing area of concern for the General Assembly as well. In March, lawmakers on a joint transportation oversight committee spent nearly three hours grilling DMV Commissioner Wayne Goodwin and his staff about the agency's efforts to address staff shortages, reduce long lines and improve the appointment process.\n\nBoliek said the agency's problems aren't because of its \"hard working\" staff, but because of a lack of leadership from the current secretary and the governor's office.\n\nHe identified election integrity as another area where he believed the auditor's office is \"uniquely situated to effectively give the voting public confidence in the way elections are run in our state.\"\n\nBoliek outlined a few different actions that could be taken to do that, including the scrubbing of voter rolls to \"make sure that they're accurate,\" and a number of different types of audits, covering machines and technology, systems and compliance, and voter tabulation.\n\nHaving led and continued to serve on the UNC Board of Trustees, Boliek said the auditor also needs to look at the proliferation of administrators in public schools, universities and state government.\n\nBoliek said it's important for auditors to not go into an audit \"presupposing a result,\" but said that \"in the same token, someone who has been a leader cannot go into an office without bringing their own personal experiences, and their own personal knowledge.\"\n\n\"I hear complaint after complaint after complaint about teacher pay, and about classroom size, but when I was in high school, there might have been one or two assistant principals,\" Boliek said. \"I know, today, you go to one of these high schools, there's a dozen assistant principals.\"\n\nBoliek said his campaign schedule has been packed with events across the state. On a recent weekend, he said, his day started with a breakfast at the Cleveland County Republican Men's Club, continued with speeches in Waynesville, Gastonia, and Marshville, and concluded with a dinner in Lumberton.\n\nBoliek said that although the auditor's office has been \"an overlooked office that has not garnered much attention\" in the past, he's been encouraged to meet people on the campaign trail who are interested in the race, and what the office does.\n\n\"I think that's good, I think that's good for the people of North Carolina.\"", "source": {"uri": "charlotteobserver.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Charlotte Observer"}, "authors": [{"uri": "avi_bajpai@charlotteobserver.com", "name": "Avi Bajpai", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auditor", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Auditor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two-round_system", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Two-round system"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audit", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Audit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clark_County,_Nevada", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Clark County, Nevada"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Clark County, Nevada"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Clark_(baseball)", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Jack Clark (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_North_Carolina_at_Chapel_Hill", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fraud", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Fraud"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota_State_Auditor", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota State Auditor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jessica_Holmes", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jessica Holmes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beth_Wood", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Beth Wood"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accounting", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Accounting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roy_Cooper", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Roy Cooper"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incumbent", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Incumbent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_News_&_Observer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The News & Observer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Certified_Public_Accountant", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Certified Public Accountant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_government", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Local government"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._state", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "U.S. state"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/County_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "County (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawyer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lawyer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_agency", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Government agency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raleigh,_North_Carolina", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Raleigh, North Carolina"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Raleigh, North Carolina"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ray_Pickett", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ray Pickett"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wayne_Sasser", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Wayne Sasser"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyle_Hall", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kyle Hall"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeffrey_Elmore", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jeffrey Elmore"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeff_McNeely", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jeff McNeely"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jake_Johnson", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jake Johnson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Carolina_General_Assembly", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "North Carolina General Assembly"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulysses_S._Grant", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ulysses S.

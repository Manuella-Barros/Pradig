There was zero chance of paying for college if not for a basketball scholarship to Northern Colorado.\n\n\"The assumption was if I didn't get a scholarship, I was not going to college,\" recalled McDavis, now an attorney for a Los Angeles-based firm.\n\nScholarships are not going away in college athletics, but how many there are and which sports they will apply to in coming years are among the many questions stemming from a mammoth antitrust settlement and athlete revenue-sharing plan proposed by the NCAA and its five largest conferences last week. Nearly $2.8 billion in damages over 10 years must come from somewhere.\n\nScholarship limits for individual teams are expected to be lifted. That could mean even more scholarships available from certain schools for money-makers like football or basketball. It could mean that programs like baseball and softball -- which have to slice and dice scholarships each season -- could be fully funded. But even the wealthiest schools may have to make tough choices when it comes to investing in which sports.\n\nThe days of the straightforward national letter of intent, first implemented in 1964, are likely a thing of the past.\n\n\"I do think the athletic scholarship is going to change. I think the relationship between college and the athlete is going to change,\" said Gregory Kaliss, an author and researcher at York College in Pennsylvania who has written about college athletics.\n\nParsing scholarships\n\nThe NCAA says its Division I and II member schools provide more than $3.6 billion in athletic scholarships annually to more than 180,000 athletes. Yet not all scholarships are created equal.\n\nFor example, Bowl Subdivision football programs in Division I can dole out 85 full scholarship; those in the Championship Subdivision can hand out 63, but those are considered \"equivalency scholarships,\" which means they can be divided or parsed to provide partial scholarships to more athletes. Division II programs tend to carve up their 36 scholarships for multiple players.\n\nThat's a familiar step for coaches in charge of much smaller rosters: As of now, schools can distribute 11.7 scholarships across a baseball roster of 32 players; a men's soccer team can offer 9.9 full scholarships, a softball team 12.\n\nWhat happens when the settlement terms begin, perhaps by fall 2025? A school could raise those roster sizes but will they commit to more scholarship money? Will they look for athletes who may not need the help because they have lucrative name, image or likeness deals?\n\n\"We have limited time to prepare for these changes,\" Illinois athletic director Josh Whitman said in a public letter. \"All athletic programs, including those in the Big Ten, face very real financial constraints. On our campus, we must determine what we can afford, who will receive these new scholarship or revenue sharing benefits and in what amounts.\"\n\nFlorida softball coach Tim Walton, whose team advanced to the Women's College World Series this past weekend, said he's been on campuses where programs were dropped for financial reasons and, while he believes revenue sharing is the right thing to do, it could lead to the elimination of Olympic sports.\n\n\"That's the reality. We're just not going down a sustainable model for every athlete, every coach, every university, every program,\" he said.\n\nHow big is too big?\n\nTwo power conference administrators told Yahoo Sports they plan to add more than 100 additional scholarships at $9 million to $10 million each year. Clemson, which with 21 sports is smaller than the likes of Stanford (38), is planning for additional scholarship spending of $5 million to $7 million annually once the settlement terms are enacted.\n\nThat sets the stage for a much different recruiting landscape. Prospects and their families will likely need advocates and advisers ensuring that colleges live up to agreements amid all the uncertainty, said McDavis, who got his law degree from UCLA after graduating from Northern Colorado. He worries the new spending will attract problems.\n\n\"These leeches come out as street professionals,\" McDavis said. \"Suddenly, they know the best and they're going to take a nice fee off the top of it. There's going to be grifters.\"\n\nKarissa Niehoff, the CEO of the National Federation of State High School Associations, noted that 96% of teens who play high school sports don't play in college. The organization has helped state federations be a resource for overwhelmed parents and expects the same thing to happen once the settlement details are firmed up.\n\n\"We're doing our best to stay educated around what the reality is,\" she said. \"Around this deal, we're not there yet.\"\n\nMcDavis said he understands all too well the work college athletes put in and are deserving of compensation. He was also nostalgic about what will be lost -- the notion of an amateur's joy at achieving next-level success -- in the shift to a more professional contract.\n\n\"There's something about it that we all recognize as beautiful,\" McDavis said. \"I think that is the thing that we're destroying.\"\n\nAP Sports Week in Pictures: Stanley Cup and NBA playoffs, baseball, soccer and more!", "source":

Nearly $2.8 billion in damages over 10 years must come from somewhere.\n\nScholarship limits for individual teams are expected to be lifted.

I think the relationship between college and the athlete is going to change,\" said Gregory Kaliss, an author and researcher at York College in Pennsylvania who has written about college athletics.\n\nParsing scholarships\n\nThe NCAA says its Division I and II member schools provide more than $3.6 billion in athletic scholarships annually to more than 180,000 athletes. Yet not all scholarships are created equal.\n\nFor example, Bowl Subdivision football programs in Division I can dole out 85 full scholarship; those in the Championship Subdivision can hand out 63, but those are considered \"equivalency scholarships,\" which means they can be divided or parsed to provide partial scholarships to more athletes. Division II programs tend to carve up their 36 scholarships for multiple players.\n\nThat's a familiar step for coaches in charge of much smaller rosters: As of now, schools can distribute 11.7 scholarships across a baseball roster of 32 players; a men's soccer team can offer 9.9 full scholarships, a softball team 12.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | Omny Studio\n\nWhat happens when the settlement terms begin, perhaps by fall 2025? A school could raise those roster sizes but will they commit to more scholarship money? Will they look for athletes who may not need the help because they have lucrative name, image or likeness deals?\n\n\"We have limited time to prepare for these changes,\" Illinois athletic director Josh Whitman said in a public letter. \"All athletic programs, including those in the Big Ten, face very real financial constraints. On our campus, we must determine what we can afford, who will receive these new scholarship or revenue sharing benefits and in what amounts.\"\n\nFlorida softball coach Tim Walton, whose team advanced to the Women's College World Series this past weekend, said he's been on campuses where programs were dropped for financial reasons and, while he believes revenue sharing is the right thing to do, it could lead to the elimination of Olympic sports.\n\n\"That's the reality. We're just not going down a sustainable model for every athlete, every coach, every university, every program,\" he said.\n\nHow big is too big?\n\nTwo power conference administrators told Yahoo Sports they plan to add more than 100 additional scholarships at $9 million to $10 million each year. Clemson, which with 21 sports is smaller than the likes of Stanford (38), is planning for additional scholarship spending of $5 million to $7 million annually once the settlement terms are enacted.\n\nThat sets the stage for a much different recruiting landscape. Prospects and their families will likely need advocates and advisers ensuring that colleges live up to agreements amid all the uncertainty, said McDavis, who got his law degree from UCLA after graduating from Northern Colorado. He worries the new spending will attract problems.\n\n\"These leeches come out as street professionals,\" McDavis said. \"Suddenly, they know the best and they're going to take a nice fee off the top of it. There's going to be grifters.\"\n\nKarissa Niehoff, the CEO of the National Federation of State High School Associations, noted that 96% of teens who play high school sports don't play in college. The organization has helped state federations be a resource for overwhelmed parents and expects the same thing to happen once the settlement details are firmed up.\n\n\"We're doing our best to stay educated around what the reality is,\" she said. \"Around this deal, we're not there yet.\"\n\nMcDavis said he understands all too well the work college athletes put in and are deserving of compensation. He was also nostalgic about what will be lost -- the notion of an amateur's joy at achieving next-level success -- in the shift to a more professional contract.\n\n\"There's something about it that we all recognize as beautiful,\" McDavis said. \"I think that is the thing that we're destroying.\"\n\nTags Dcc Wire Lee-national Be the first to know\n\nGet local news delivered to your inbox!\n\nSign

Yet not all scholarships are not all created equal.\n\nFor example, Bowl Subdivision football programs in Division I can dole out 85 full scholarship; those in the Championship Subdivision can hand out 63, but those are considered \"equivalency scholarships,\" which means they can be divided or parsed to provide partial scholarships to more athletes. Division II programs tend to carve up their 36 scholarships for multiple players.\n\nThat's a familiar step for coaches in charge of much smaller rosters: As of now, schools can distribute 11.7 scholarships across a baseball roster of 32 players; a men's soccer team can offer 9.9 full scholarships, a softball team 12.\n\nWhat happens when the settlement terms begin, perhaps by fall 2025? A school could raise those roster sizes but will they commit to more scholarship money? Will they look for athletes who may not need the help because they have lucrative name, image or likeness deals?\n\n\"We have limited time to prepare for these changes,\" Illinois athletic director Josh Whitman said in a public letter. \"All athletic programs, including those in the Big Ten, face very real financial constraints. On our campus, we must determine what we can afford, who will receive these new scholarship or revenue sharing benefits and in what amounts.\"\n\nFlorida softball coach Tim Walton, whose team advanced to the Women's College World Series this past weekend, said he's been on campuses where programs were dropped for financial reasons and, while he believes revenue sharing is the right thing to do, it could lead to the elimination of Olympic sports.\n\n\"That's the reality. We're just not going down a sustainable model for every athlete, every coach, every university, every program,\" he said.\n\nHOW BIG IS TOO BIG?\n\nTwo power conference administrators told Yahoo Sports they plan to add more than 100 additional scholarships at $9 million to $10 million each year. Clemson, which with 21 sports is smaller than the likes of Stanford (38), is planning for additional scholarship spending of $5 million to $7 million annually once the settlement terms are enacted.\n\nThat sets the stage for a much different recruiting landscape. Prospects and their families will likely need advocates and advisers ensuring that colleges live up to agreements amid all the uncertainty, said McDavis, who got his law degree from UCLA after graduating from Northern Colorado. He worries the new spending will attract problems.\n\n\"These leeches come out as street professionals,\" McDavis said. \"Suddenly, they know the best and they're going to take a nice fee off the top of it. There's going to be grifters.\"\n\nKarissa Niehoff, the CEO of the National Federation of State High School Associations, noted that 96% of teens who play high school sports don't play in college. The organization has helped state federations be a resource for overwhelmed parents and expects the same thing to happen once the settlement details are firmed up.\n\n\"We're doing our best to stay educated around what the reality is,\" she said. \"Around this deal, we're not there yet.\"\n\nMcDavis said he understands all too well the work college athletes put in and are deserving of compensation. He was also nostalgic about what will be lost -- the notion of an amateur's joy at achieving next-level success -- in the shift to a more professional contract.\n\n\"There's something about it that we all recognize as beautiful,\" McDavis said. \"I think that is the thing that we're destroying.\"\n\nAP Sports Writer Mark Long contributed to this report.\n\n-- -\n\nAP college sports:

I think the relationship between college and the athlete is going to change,\" said Gregory Kaliss, an author and researcher at York College in Pennsylvania who has written about college athletics.\n\nParsing scholarships\n\nThe NCAA says its Division I and II member schools provide more than $3.6 billion in athletic scholarships annually to more than 180,000 athletes. Yet not all scholarships are created equal.\n\nFor example, Bowl Subdivision football programs in Division I can dole out 85 full scholarship; those in the Championship Subdivision can hand out 63, but those are considered \"equivalency scholarships,\" which means they can be divided or parsed to provide partial scholarships to more athletes. Division II programs tend to carve up their 36 scholarships for multiple players.\n\nThat's a familiar step for coaches in charge of much smaller rosters: As of now, schools can distribute 11.7 scholarships across a baseball roster of 32 players; a men's soccer team can offer 9.9 full scholarships, a softball team 12.\n\nWhat happens when the settlement terms begin, perhaps by fall 2025? A school could raise those roster sizes but will they commit to more scholarship money? Will they look for athletes who may not need the help because they have lucrative name, image or likeness deals?\n\n\"We have limited time to prepare for these changes,\" Illinois athletic director Josh Whitman said in a public letter. \"All athletic programs, including those in the Big Ten, face very real financial constraints. On our campus, we must determine what we can afford, who will receive these new scholarship or revenue sharing benefits and in what amounts.\"\n\nFlorida softball coach Tim Walton, whose team advanced to the Women's College World Series this past weekend, said he's been on campuses where programs were dropped for financial reasons and, while he believes revenue sharing is the right thing to do, it could lead to the elimination of Olympic sports.\n\n\"That's the reality. We're just not going down a sustainable model for every athlete, every coach, every university, every program,\" he said.\n\nHow big is too big?\n\nTwo power conference administrators told Yahoo Sports they plan to add more than 100 additional scholarships at $9 million to $10 million each year. Clemson, which with 21 sports is smaller than the likes of Stanford (38), is planning for additional scholarship spending of $5 million to $7 million annually once the settlement terms are enacted.\n\nThat sets the stage for a much different recruiting landscape. Prospects and their families will likely need advocates and advisers ensuring that colleges live up to agreements amid all the uncertainty, said McDavis, who got his law degree from UCLA after graduating from Northern Colorado. He worries the new spending will attract problems.\n\n\"These leeches come out as street professionals,\" McDavis said. \"Suddenly, they know the best and they're going to take a nice fee off the top of it. There's going to be grifters.\"\n\nKarissa Niehoff, the CEO of the National Federation of State High School Associations, noted that 96% of teens who play high school sports don't play in college. The organization has helped state federations be a resource for overwhelmed parents and expects the same thing to happen once the settlement details are firmed up.\n\n\"We're doing our best to stay educated around what the reality is,\" she said. \"Around this deal, we're not there yet.\"\n\nMcDavis said he understands all too well the work college athletes put in and are deserving of compensation.

I think the relationship between college and the athlete is going to change,\" said Gregory Kaliss, an author and researcher at York College in Pennsylvania who has written about college athletics.\n\nParsing scholarships\n\nThe NCAA says its Division I and II member schools provide more than $3.6 billion in athletic scholarships annually to more than 180,000 athletes. Yet not all scholarships are created equal.\n\nFor example, Bowl Subdivision football programs in Division I can dole out 85 full scholarship; those in the Championship Subdivision can hand out 63, but those are considered \"equivalency scholarships,\" which means they can be divided or parsed to provide partial scholarships to more athletes. Division II programs tend to carve up their 36 scholarships for multiple players.\n\nThat's a familiar step for coaches in charge of much smaller rosters: As of now, schools can distribute 11.7 scholarships across a baseball roster of 32 players; a men's soccer team can offer 9.9 full scholarships, a softball team 12.\n\nWhat happens when the settlement terms begin, perhaps by fall 2025?

Nearly $2.8 billion in damages over 10 years must come from somewhere.\n\nScholarship limits for individual teams are expected to be lifted. That could mean even more scholarships available from certain schools for money-makers like football or basketball. It could mean that programs like baseball and softball -- which have to slice and dice scholarships each season -- could be fully funded.

Yet not all scholarships are not all created equal.\n\nFor example, Bowl Subdivision football programs in Division I can dole out 85 full scholarship; those in the Championship Subdivision can hand out 63, but those are considered \"equivalency scholarships,\" which means they can be divided or parsed to provide partial scholarships to more athletes. Division II programs tend to carve up their 36 scholarships for multiple players.\n\nThat's a familiar step for coaches in charge of much smaller rosters: As of now, schools can distribute 11.7 scholarships across a baseball roster of 32 players; a men's soccer team can offer 9.9 full scholarships, a softball team 12.\n\nWhat happens when the settlement terms begin, perhaps by fall 2025? A school could raise those roster sizes but will they commit to more scholarship money? Will they look for athletes who may not need the help because they have lucrative name, image or likeness deals?\n\n\"We have limited time to prepare for these changes,\" Illinois athletic director Josh Whitman said in a public letter. \"All athletic programs, including those in the Big Ten, face very real financial constraints. On our campus, we must determine what we can afford, who will receive these new scholarship or revenue sharing benefits and in what amounts.\"\n\nFlorida softball coach Tim Walton, whose team advanced to the Women's College World Series this past weekend, said he's been on campuses where programs were dropped for financial reasons and, while he believes revenue sharing is the right thing to do, it could lead to the elimination of Olympic sports.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\n\"That's the reality. We're just not going down a sustainable model for every athlete, every coach, every university, every program,\" he said.\n\nHOW BIG IS TOO BIG?\n\nTwo power conference administrators told Yahoo Sports they plan to add more than 100 additional scholarships at $9 million to $10 million each year. Clemson, which with 21 sports is smaller than the likes of Stanford (38), is planning for additional scholarship spending of $5 million to $7 million annually once the settlement terms are enacted.\n\nThat sets the stage for a much different recruiting landscape. Prospects and their families will likely need advocates and advisers ensuring that colleges live up to agreements amid all the uncertainty, said McDavis, who got his law degree from UCLA after graduating from Northern Colorado. He worries the new spending will attract problems.\n\n\"These leeches come out as street professionals,\" McDavis said. \"Suddenly, they know the best and they're going to take a nice fee off the top of it. There's going to be grifters.\"\n\nKarissa Niehoff, the CEO of the National Federation of State High School Associations, noted that 96% of teens who play high school sports don't play in college. The organization has helped state federations be a resource for overwhelmed parents and expects the same thing to happen once the settlement details are firmed up.\n\n\"We're doing our best to stay educated around what the reality is,\" she said. \"Around this deal, we're not there yet.\"\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nMcDavis said he understands all too well the work college athletes put in and are deserving of compensation. He was also nostalgic about what will be lost -- the notion of an amateur's joy at achieving next-level success -- in the shift to a more professional contract.\n\n\"There's something about it that we

Nearly $2.8 billion in damages over 10 years must come from somewhere.\n\nPeople are also reading...\n\nScholarship limits for individual teams are expected to be lifted. That could mean even more scholarships available from certain schools for money-makers like football or basketball. It could mean that programs like baseball and softball -- which have to slice and dice scholarships each season -- could be fully funded. But even the wealthiest schools may have to make tough choices when it comes to investing in which sports.\n\nThe days of the straightforward national letter of intent, first implemented in 1964, are likely a thing of the past.\n\n\"I do think the athletic scholarship is going to change. I think the relationship between college and the athlete is going to change,\" said Gregory Kaliss, an author and researcher at York College in Pennsylvania who has written about college athletics.\n\nPARSING SCHOLARSHIPS\n\nThe NCAA says its Division I and II member schools provide more than $3.6 billion in athletic scholarships annually to more than 180,000 athletes. Yet not all scholarships are not all created equal.\n\nFor example, Bowl Subdivision football programs in Division I can dole out 85 full scholarship; those in the Championship Subdivision can hand out 63, but those are considered \"equivalency scholarships,\" which means they can be divided or parsed to provide partial scholarships to more athletes. Division II programs tend to carve up their 36 scholarships for multiple players.\n\nThat's a familiar step for coaches in charge of much smaller rosters: As of now, schools can distribute 11.7 scholarships across a baseball roster of 32 players; a men's soccer team can offer 9.9 full scholarships, a softball team 12.\n\nWhat happens when the settlement terms begin, perhaps by fall 2025? A school could raise those roster sizes but will they commit to more scholarship money? Will they look for athletes who may not need the help because they have lucrative name, image or likeness deals?\n\n\"We have limited time to prepare for these changes,\" Illinois athletic director Josh Whitman said in a public letter. \"All athletic programs, including those in the Big Ten, face very real financial constraints. On our campus, we must determine what we can afford, who will receive these new scholarship or revenue sharing benefits and in what amounts.\"\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\nFlorida softball coach Tim Walton, whose team advanced to the Women's College World Series this past weekend, said he's been on campuses where programs were dropped for financial reasons and, while he believes revenue sharing is the right thing to do, it could lead to the elimination of Olympic sports.\n\n\"That's the reality. We're just not going down a sustainable model for every athlete, every coach, every university, every program,\" he said.\n\nHOW BIG IS TOO BIG?\n\nTwo power conference administrators told Yahoo Sports they plan to add more than 100 additional scholarships at $9 million to $10 million each year. Clemson, which with 21 sports is smaller than the likes of Stanford (38), is planning for additional scholarship spending of $5 million to $7 million annually once the settlement terms are enacted.\n\nThat sets the stage for a much different recruiting landscape. Prospects and their families will likely need advocates and advisers ensuring that colleges live up to agreements amid all the uncertainty, said McDavis, who got his law degree from UCLA after graduating from Northern Colorado. He worries the new spending will attract problems.\n\n\"These leeches come out as street professionals,\" McDavis said. \"Suddenly, they know the best and they're going to take a nice fee off the top of it. There's going to be grifters.\"\n\nKarissa Niehoff, the CEO of the National Federation of State High School Associations, noted that 96% of teens who play high school sports don't play in college. The organization has helped state federations be a resource for overwhelmed parents and expects the same thing to happen once the settlement details are firmed up.\n\n\"We're doing our best to stay educated around what the reality is,\" she said. \"Around this deal, we're not there yet.\"\n\nMcDavis said he understands all too well the work college athletes put in and are deserving of compensation. He was also nostalgic about what will be lost -- the notion of an amateur's joy at achieving next-level success -- in the shift to a more professional contract.\n\n\"There's something about it that we all recognize as beautiful,\" McDavis said. \"I think that is the thing that we're destroying.\"\n\nAP Sports Writer Mark Long contributed to this report.\n\n-- -\n\nAP college sports: https://apnews.com/hub/college-sports\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

(Chris Machian/Omaha World-Herald via AP)\n\nCody McDavis' life changed forever with a few strokes of a pen.\n\nMcDavis grew up in a single-parent home where his mother worked three jobs to afford life's essentials. There was zero chance of paying for college if not for a basketball scholarship to Northern Colorado.\n\n\"The assumption was if I didn't get a scholarship, I was not going to college,\" recalled McDavis, now an attorney for a Los Angeles-based firm.\n\nScholarships are not going away in college athletics, but how many there are and which sports they will apply to in coming years are among the many questions stemming from a mammoth antitrust settlement and athlete revenue-sharing plan proposed by the NCAA and its five largest conferences last week. Nearly $2.8 billion in damages over 10 years must come from somewhere.\n\nScholarship limits for individual teams are expected to be lifted. That could mean even more scholarships available from certain schools for money-makers like football or basketball. It could mean that programs like baseball and softball -- which have to slice and dice scholarships each season -- could be fully funded. But even the wealthiest schools may have to make tough choices when it comes to investing in which sports.\n\nThe days of the straightforward national letter of intent, first implemented in 1964, are likely a thing of the past.\n\n\"I do think the athletic scholarship is going to change. I think the relationship between college and the athlete is going to change,\" said Gregory Kaliss, an author and researcher at York College in Pennsylvania who has written about college athletics.\n\nPARSING SCHOLARSHIPS\n\nThe NCAA says its Division I and II member schools provide more than $3.6 billion in athletic scholarships annually to more than 180,000 athletes. Yet not all scholarships are not all created equal.\n\nFor example, Bowl Subdivision football programs in Division I can dole out 85 full scholarship; those in the Championship Subdivision can hand out 63, but those are considered \"equivalency scholarships,\" which means they can be divided or parsed to provide partial scholarships to more athletes. Division II programs tend to carve up their 36 scholarships for multiple players.\n\nThat's a familiar step for coaches in charge of much smaller rosters: As of now, schools can distribute 11.7 scholarships across a baseball roster of 32 players; a men's soccer team can offer 9.9 full scholarships, a softball team 12.\n\nWhat happens when the settlement terms begin, perhaps by fall 2025? A school could raise those roster sizes but will they commit to more scholarship money? Will they look for athletes who may not need the help because they have lucrative name, image or likeness deals?\n\n\"We have limited time to prepare for these changes,\" Illinois athletic director Josh Whitman said in a public letter. \"All athletic programs, including those in the Big Ten, face very real financial constraints. On our campus, we must determine what we can afford, who will receive these new scholarship or revenue sharing benefits and in what amounts.\"\n\nFlorida softball coach Tim Walton, whose team advanced to the Women's College World Series this past weekend, said he's been on campuses where programs were dropped for financial reasons and, while he believes revenue sharing is the right thing to do, it could lead to the elimination of Olympic sports.\n\n\"That's the reality. We're just not going down a sustainable model for every athlete, every coach, every university, every program,\" he said.\n\nHOW BIG IS TOO BIG?\n\nTwo power conference administrators told Yahoo Sports they plan to add more than 100 additional scholarships at $9 million to $10 million each year. Clemson, which with 21 sports is smaller than the likes of Stanford (38), is planning for additional scholarship spending of $5 million to $7 million annually once the settlement terms are enacted.\n\nThat sets the stage for a much different recruiting landscape. Prospects and their families will likely need advocates and advisers ensuring that colleges live up to agreements amid all the uncertainty, said McDavis, who got his law degree from UCLA after graduating from Northern Colorado. He worries the new spending will attract problems.\n\n\"These leeches come out as street professionals,\" McDavis said. \"Suddenly, they know the best and they're going to take a nice fee off the top of it. There's going to be grifters.\"\n\nKarissa Niehoff, the CEO of the National Federation of State High School Associations, noted that 96% of teens who play high school sports don't play in college. The organization has helped state federations be a resource for overwhelmed parents and expects the same thing to happen once the settlement details are firmed up.\n\n\"We're doing our best to stay educated around what the reality is,\" she said. \"Around this deal, we're not there yet.\"\n\nMcDavis said he understands all too well the work college athletes put in and are deserving of compensation. He was also nostalgic about what will be lost -- the notion of an amateur's joy at achieving next-level success -- in the shift to a more professional contract.\n\n\"There's something about it that we all recognize as beautiful,\" McDavis said. \"I think that is the thing that we're destroying.\"\n\nAP Sports Writer Mark Long contributed to this report.\n\n-- -\n\nAP college sports:

There was zero chance of paying for college if not for a basketball scholarship to Northern Colorado.\n\n\"The assumption was if I didn't get a scholarship, I was not going to college,\" recalled McDavis, now an attorney for a Los Angeles-based firm.\n\nScholarships are not going away in college athletics, but how many there are and which sports they will apply to in coming years are among the many questions stemming from a mammoth antitrust settlement and athlete revenue-sharing plan proposed by the NCAA and its five largest conferences last week. Nearly $2.8 billion in damages over 10 years must come from somewhere.\n\nScholarship limits for individual teams are expected to be lifted. That could mean even more scholarships available from certain schools for money-makers like football or basketball. It could mean that programs like baseball and softball - which have to slice and dice scholarships each season - could be fully funded. But even the wealthiest schools may have to make tough choices when it comes to investing in which sports.\n\nThe days of the straightforward national letter of intent, first implemented in 1964, are likely a thing of the past.\n\nFILE - Arkansas players run past the Southeastern Conference logo during practice for the 2006 SEC men's basketball tournament March 8, 2006, in Nashville, Tenn.

(AP Photo/Mark Humphrey, File)\n\n\"I do think the athletic scholarship is going to change. I think the relationship between college and the athlete is going to change,\" said Gregory Kaliss, an author and researcher at York College in Pennsylvania who has written about college athletics.\n\nThe NCAA says its Division I and II member schools provide more than $3.6 billion in athletic scholarships annually to more than 180,000 athletes. Yet not all scholarships are not all created equal.\n\nFor example, Bowl Subdivision football programs in Division I can dole out 85 full scholarship; those in the Championship Subdivision can hand out 63, but those are considered \"equivalency scholarships,\" which means they can be divided or parsed to provide partial scholarships to more athletes. Division II programs tend to carve up their 36 scholarships for multiple players.\n\nThat's a familiar step for coaches in charge of much smaller rosters: As of now, schools can distribute 11.7 scholarships across a baseball roster of 32 players; a men\u00b4s soccer team can offer 9.9 full scholarships, a softball team 12.\n\nWhat happens when the settlement terms begin, perhaps by fall 2025? A school could raise those roster sizes but will they commit to more scholarship money? Will they look for athletes who may not need the help because they have lucrative name, image or likeness deals?\n\n\"We have limited time to prepare for these changes,\" Illinois athletic director Josh Whitman said in a public letter. \"All athletic programs, including those in the Big Ten, face very real financial constraints. On our campus, we must determine what we can afford, who will receive these new scholarship or revenue sharing benefits and in what amounts.\"\n\nFlorida softball coach Tim Walton, whose team advanced to the Women's College World Series this past weekend, said he's been on campuses where programs were dropped for financial reasons and, while he believes revenue sharing is the right thing to do, it could lead to the elimination of Olympic sports.\n\n\"That\u00b4s the reality. We\u00b4re just not going down a sustainable model for every athlete, every coach, every university, every program,\" he said.\n\nTwo power conference administrators told Yahoo Sports they plan to add more than 100 additional scholarships at $9 million to $10 million each year. Clemson, which with 21 sports is smaller than the likes of Stanford (38), is planning for additional scholarship spending of $5 million to $7 million annually once the settlement terms are enacted.\n\nThat sets the stage for a much different recruiting landscape. Prospects and their families will likely need advocates and advisers ensuring that colleges live up to agreements amid all the uncertainty, said McDavis, who got his law degree from UCLA after graduating from Northern Colorado. He worries the new spending will attract problems.\n\n\"These leeches come out as street professionals,\" McDavis said. \"Suddenly, they know the best and they're going to take a nice fee off the top of it. There's going to be grifters.\"\n\nKarissa Niehoff, the CEO of the National Federation of State High School Associations, noted that 96% of teens who play high school sports don\u00b4t play in college. The organization has helped state federations be a resource for overwhelmed parents and expects the same thing to happen once the settlement details are firmed up.\n\n\"We're doing our best to stay educated around what the reality is,\" she said. \"Around this deal, we're not there yet.\"\n\nMcDavis said he understands all too well the work college athletes put in and are deserving of compensation. He was also nostalgic about what will be lost - the notion of an amateur's joy at achieving next-level success - in the shift to a more professional contract.\n\n\"There's something about it that we all recognize as beautiful,\" McDavis said. \"I think that is the thing that we're destroying.\"\n\nAP Sports Writer Mark Long contributed to this report.\n\n--\n\nAP college sports: https://apnews.com/hub/college-sports\n\nFILE - An Atlantic Coast Conference sign is displayed by Florida State players after the team's win over Louisville in the ACC championship NCAA college football game Dec. 2, 2023, in Charlotte, N.C.

The French Ministry of Foreign and European Affairs also offers a large number of grants and scholarships, and there are numerous bodies worldwide supporting the study of international students wishing to embark on a master's programme. Below is a comprehensive overview of the scholarships, grants and loans available.\n\nEDHEC Business School's comprehensive scholarship scheme aimed at MIM & MSC candidates\n\nSo my name is Michelle Sisto I am the associate Dean for graduate studies at EDHEC Business School. So within that perimeter, it englobes the PhD programme, our\n\nprogramme Grande Ecole, Master in Management and all of our specialised MSc programmes.\n\n[Music]\n\n\"What types of scholarships and financial aid does EDHEC offer to international students?\"\n\nRegarding scholarships available for international students, and even for our French students, EDHEC has a strong belief in making education possible for students coming from diverse horizons, backgrounds, and have both the economic levels and what they studied previously, regional differences, and so we've put in place a multitude of opportunities for scholarships to encourage that diversity in our classrooms. We have some scholarships that are academic merit-based, aiming for excellence in the profile of students. We have some scholarships that are more oriented for particular regional areas, and we have some scholarships that are also oriented towards diversity. For example, women in finance and women in data science, where we see that we still don't have a sufficient number of women in those areas in the profession, and also in the programmes. And then we also have scholarships\n\nthat can be requested, when students are actually in the programme, should there be an instance where somebody's situation changes dramatically while they're already a student here. We have a special commission that looks at changes in the situation for exceptional scholarships.\n\n[Music]\n\n\"What is a merit-based scholarship and what are the selection criteria?\"\n\nSo our merit-based scholarships are really based on the profile of our candidates. What we're looking at, when students apply to our programme Grande Ecole and to our MSc programmes, we're looking at their full profile. So their academic background, how they perform in their previous academic studies... We're looking at things like their score on GMAT or the TAGE MAGE or the CAT exam, some kind of aptitude test. We're also looking at the type of school that they went to previously, but that's not the major issue.\n\nIt's really where they were. Did they perform really well? And as EDHEC academic excellence is a key driving force for education, we want to offer scholarships to encourage those types of profiles to come to EDHEC. Because we know they have choices amongst diverse, very strong schools, and our aim is to bring the very brightest and the best to EDHEC.\n\n[Music]\n\n\"How does EDHEC approach need-based scholarships for international students?\n\nFor need-based scholarships, we have one system for our French students, and then for international students, we're looking at the profiles of our students. What we will look at\n\nis, what is their overall situation, what is their profile and how can we make an offer to them that would render their participation and education in EDHEC more feasible for them.\n\nAs I mentioned earlier EDHEC really believes in bringing diverse and excellent profiles to our school, and so our approach in terms of scholarships is evermore going in the direction of diversity and inclusion. So we're currently offering, as I mentioned, a scholarship for women in data science and in finance. We also have scholarships that are called the \"make and impact\" scholarship, and \"make an impact\" is our tagline at EDHEC. Our strategic plan is really EDHEC for future generations, and so we're looking for this \"make an impact\" scholarship, for students who have shown in the past that they're willing to engage in their local communities and environmental projects. With coming to EDHEC, the education that they're going to receive here, is going to propel them forward to the next step where they'll make an impact, a further impact, and so what we do for that scholarship is, we ask students to apply with an essay and tell us something about what they've done in the past and where they wish to go. And so for those students, we have a special scholarship. We're also looking to increase now, in line with our strategic plan, for greater diversity and inclusion on socioeconomic as well as cultural, regional, gender differences, and expand our portfolio of scholarships. So we're working on offering more scholarships for high potential women, specific scholarships for certain regions. In terms of regional scholarships we already have some for example: with the French embassy in India we have a special scholarship that pays up to 15 percent of students tuition fees, likewise in Russia with a scholarship that's a hundred percent for a student applying for an MSc with an excellent profile. We work with Campus France. We also have Eiffel scholarships. In Colombia for example, we work with local players like ColFuturo and there's lots of information on the website so anyone who's wishing to apply to EDHEC should definitely look at the \"financing your studies\" part and reach out to our admissions team to get more information as to what financing is available from their particular region. As we move forward, we will continue to expand this offer both in terms of the number of scholarships and in terms of the amount.\n\nCurrently EDHEC issues about 5 million euros in scholarships every year across our graduate studies. About a quarter of all of our students do receive some type of financial aid, and part of our plan moving forward is to expand that to an even higher percentage of students. And for some of our students, to go all the way up to 75% of tuition fees that would be covered for those who are the most in need, notably students coming from particular backgrounds or potentially zones of conflict, or refugees and, or recent immigrants from areas that have been touched negatively by world events.\n\n[Music]\n\n\"Why is diversity important to EDHEC? How does it relate to your mission to make an impact?\"\n\nWell thank you for that question, I think that you know we're in the age that we're living in right now, we've seen that diversity and inclusion is a global issue. We have some researchers within our school, who study the positive impact of diversity and inclusion on the performance of companies. But we believe that diversity and inclusion is essential, to bring a diversity of perspectives to solving some of the major societal stakes that we're facing right now, the challenges that we're facing. So what do we mean by that? Now when we talk about women in finance and women in data science, with the algorithms that are currently directing quite a bit of our lives right now. If the data that goes into those algorithms or the people who are writing those algorithms are not representative of the society at large, then we may end\n\nup with situations where they're detrimental to certain aspects of certain groups in society.\n\nAlgorithms that scan CVs, algorithms that give us suggestions for what we should be reading or watching or eating even. So I think that diversity is necessary to have a more equitable society. Things like climate change, bringing together people who come from diverse backgrounds around the world, seeing how its impacts differ around the world and how we can globally work together to find solutions. Of course the strongest element recently is the global pandemic, and we can see that something like this can only be solved by global collaboration.\n\nSo bringing together people from all over the world and these diverse perspectives, what we hope to do is to encourage our students to grow into leaders with a global perspective, in order to collaboratively solve some of the big problems that we're facing now.\n\n[Music]\n\n\"Are your scholarships fee waivers only or do you also offer financial support for travel, housing, and other study expenses?\"\n\nCurrently EDHEC's scholarships focus on the tuition fees, although some of the people that we partner with do offer stipends for living, for example the Eiffel scholarship. To be eligible for the Eiffel scholarship, students need to apply and be admitted before early December but that is a scholarship that is within the French ministry and that covers about 1200 euros a month stipend for students in order to cover living expenses, rent...and there are some scholarships that also look at fees for the flights to and from France. So it varies but the bulk of our scholarships are really just focused on the tuition fees.\n\n[Music]\n\n\"Any scholarship application tips you'd like to offer?\"\n\nMy first tip would be to make a request. Don't hesitate to make a request. As they often say: if you don't ask, you certainly don't receive. So not to be shy in reaching out and aiming for one of our scholarships. I think another tip would be, for the scholarships that require essays, to take the time to build an essay that really responds to the question that's asked for the particular scholarship, and make it quite personal. What we want to do, when we're evaluating these essays, is get to know the person behind that essay. What's their real desire to make an impact for example, if it's in line with the sustainable development goals, and convince us\n\nthat you're somebody who would bring your expertise, your enthusiasm, your drive, and your values to our community, here at EDHEC. And lastly, I would say, be absolutely authentic in what you say and what you write.\n\nSo I'd just like to add, that you know, beyond the direct scholarships that we've talked about here, at EDHEC there's an institution-wide number of initiatives in order to offer our education and render education more affordable to a wide group of candidates. For example, in our undergraduate programmes, there are students working on a programme that's called \"Cord\u00e9e de la r\u00e9ussite\", where they're going into local high schools, that tend to have and be in areas, that are considered considered disadvantaged or that don't have as high proportion\n\nthat go into higher education, to encourage those students to believe that they can access and succeed in higher education. And then we offer up to 75 percent of fees for students who come through that path. In addition, over the last year, I think one area that we're very happy with and grateful for, is during the pandemic we made a call out to all of our alumni and to some of our corporate partners to request additional funding for direct additional scholarships to students. Unfortunately, we had a number of students over time whose family situations changed. Either their family business had a problem or that sadly there was some severe illness or even death in the family. So we wanted to make sure that those difficult events didn't also have an impact on our students' ability to continue with their education. And our alumni really stood up to the call and we raised close to a half a million euros for direct additional aid to our students. So I think there's a very strong sense of community at EDHEC,\n\nand we hope that the students for whom we can make this extra offer available, will continue to be part of that community as they move on to their careers afterwards, and be part of a virtuous cycle of ongoing financing of studies for everyone.", "source": {"uri": "edhec.edu", "dataType": "news", "title": "EDHEC BUSINESS SCHOOL"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EDHEC_Business_School", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "EDHEC Business School"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_student", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "International student"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scholarship", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Scholarship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Master_of_Science", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Master of Science"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_language", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "French language"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grande_\u00e9cole", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Grande \u00e9cole"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_science", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Data science"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finance", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Finance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exam", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Exam"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ministry_for_Europe_and_Foreign_Affairs_(France)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ministry for Europe and Foreign Affairs (France)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Master_of_Management", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Master of Management"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graduate_Management_Admission_Test", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Graduate Management Admission Test"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Munich_Security_Conference", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Munich Security Conference"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctor_of_Philosophy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Doctor of Philosophy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuition_payments", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tuition payments"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Generation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Algorithm"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gustave_Eiffel", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gustave Eiffel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socioeconomics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Socioeconomics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gender"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refugee", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Refugee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Russia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "France"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colombia", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Colombia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Colombia"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Gay,_Lesbian,_and_Bisexual/Student", "label": "dmoz/Society/Gay, Lesbian, and Bisexual/Student", "wgt": 24}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/College_Financing", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/College Financing", "wgt": 29}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Nursing/Students", "label": "dmoz/Health/Nursing/Students", "wgt": 25}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Scouting/Scholarships", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Scouting/Scholarships", "wgt": 51}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/College_and_University/Recruiting", "label": "dmoz/Sports/College and University/Recruiting", "wgt": 22}], "image": null, "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9605650", "eventUri": "eng-9605650", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3960784313725489, "wgt": 198, "relevance": 1}

Nearly $2.8 billion in damages over 10 years must come from somewhere.\n\nScholarship limits for individual teams are expected to be lifted. That could mean even more scholarships available from certain schools for money-makers like football or basketball. It could mean that programs like baseball and softball -- which have to slice and dice scholarships each season -- could be fully funded. But even the wealthiest schools may have to make tough choices when it comes to investing in which sports.\n\nThe days of the straightforward national letter of intent, first implemented in 1964, are likely a thing of the past.\n\n\"I do think the athletic scholarship is going to change. I think the relationship between college and the athlete is going to change,\" said Gregory Kaliss, an author and researcher at York College in Pennsylvania who has written about college athletics.\n\nThe NCAA says its Division I and II member schools provide more than $3.6 billion in athletic scholarships annually to more than 180,000 athletes. Yet not all scholarships are created equal.\n\nFor example, Bowl Subdivision football programs in Division I can dole out 85 full scholarships; those in the Championship Subdivision can hand out 63, but those are considered \"equivalency scholarships,\" which means they can be divided or parsed to provide partial scholarships to more athletes. Division II programs tend to carve up their 36 scholarships for multiple players.\n\nThat's a familiar step for coaches in charge of much smaller rosters: As of now, schools can distribute 11.7 scholarships across a baseball roster of 32 players; a men's soccer team can offer 9.9 full scholarships, a softball team 12.\n\nWhat happens when the settlement terms begin, perhaps by fall 2025? A school could raise those roster sizes but will they commit to more scholarship money? Will they look for athletes who may not need the help because they have lucrative name, image or likeness deals?\n\n\"We have limited time to prepare for these changes,\" Illinois athletic director Josh Whitman said in a public letter. \"All athletic programs, including those in the Big Ten, face very real financial constraints. On our campus, we must determine what we can afford, who will receive these new scholarship or revenue sharing benefits, and in what amounts.\"\n\nFlorida softball coach Tim Walton, whose team advanced to the Women's College World Series this past weekend, said he's been on campuses where programs were dropped for financial reasons and, while he believes revenue sharing is the right thing to do, it could lead to the elimination of Olympic sports.\n\n\"That's the reality. We're just not going down a sustainable model for every athlete, every coach, every university, every program,\" he said.\n\nTwo power conference administrators told Yahoo Sports they plan to add more than 100 additional scholarships at $9 million to $10 million each year. Clemson, which with 21 sports is smaller than the likes of Stanford (38), is planning for additional scholarship spending of $5 million to $7 million annually once the settlement terms are enacted.\n\nThat sets the stage for a much different recruiting landscape. Prospects and their families will likely need advocates and advisers ensuring that colleges live up to agreements amid all the uncertainty, said McDavis, who got his law degree from UCLA after graduating from Northern Colorado. He worries the new spending will attract problems.\n\n\"These leeches come out as street professionals,\" McDavis said. \"Suddenly, they know the best and they're going to take a nice fee off the top of it. There's going to be grifters.\"\n\nKarissa Niehoff, the CEO of the National Federation of State High School Associations, noted that 96 percent of teens who play high school sports don't play in college. The organization has helped state federations be a resource for overwhelmed parents, and expects the same thing to happen once the settlement details are firmed up.\n\n\"We're doing our best to stay educated around what the reality is,\" she said. \"Around this deal, we're not there yet.\"\n\nMcDavis said he understands all too well the work college athletes put in and are deserving of compensation. He was also nostalgic about what will be lost -- the notion of an amateur's joy at achieving next-level success -- in the shift to a more professional contract.\n\n\"There's something about it that we

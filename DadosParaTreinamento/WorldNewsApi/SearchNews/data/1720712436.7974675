{"id": 232017962, "title": "&#8216;Bad Boys 4&#8217; Gives Box Office a Much-Needed $56 Million Opening Weekend", "text": "The box office is finally starting to pick up thanks to Sony/Columbia\u2019s \u201cBad Boys: Ride or Die,\u201d which faced fears from some exhibition sources that it would succumb to the recent slump in the theatrical market but has instead broken it with a $56 million opening weekend from 3,885 locations in North America with a $104.6 million global start. While a bit below the $62 million 3-day opening weekend earned by \u201cBad Boys For Life\u201d in January 2020, it beats pre-release projections, which had topped out at $50 million and had been revised down to the low $40 million range in the leadup to release. Some movie theater owners who spoke to TheWrap were concerned that the $100 million franchise action film could do even worse based on lagging presales. Instead, \u201cBad Boys 4\u201d has enjoyed robust walk-up traffic, with movie theater sources telling TheWrap that an estimated 70% of tickets sold for the film have been day-of purchases. The film\u2019s core Black audience comprised 44% of its opening day audience, with 50% being under the age of 35. That success in drawing out a substantial younger cohort has been key to \u201cBad Boys\u201d getting a strong start, as Warner Bros.\u2019 \u201cFuriosa\u201d has failed to leave a mark largely due to lower turnout from Gen Z audiences. Just as encouraging is the word-of-mouth, as \u201cBad Boys 4\u201d has received an A- on CinemaScore to go with a 5/5 on PostTrak and a 97% audience Rotten Tomatoes score. That should give the film strong legs through Father\u2019s Day and into the rest of June. But one successful film isn\u2019t going to be enough to pull the box office completely out of the hole its fallen into thanks to the worst May it has seen since the turn of the century. \u201cBad Boys: Ride or Die\u201d and fellow Sony release \u201cThe Garfield Movie\u201d are the only films estimated to earn at least $10 million this weekend, and the overall estimated total of $103.7 million is down 38% from a year ago. One of the films that didn\u2019t reach eight digits this weekend is \u201cThe Watchers,\u201d the directorial debut of M. Night Shyamalan\u2019s daughter, Ishana Night Shyamalan. Produced and self-financed by the \u201cSixth Sense\u201d director and acquired by Warner Bros. for $30 million, \u201cThe Watchers\u201d opened in the No. 4 spot to an estimated $7 million from 3,351 locations, getting poor marks with a C- on CinemaScore and Rotten Tomatoes scores of 29% critics and 56% audience. More help is on the way next weekend with Disney/Pixar\u2019s \u201cInside Out 2,\u201d which will have a shot at earning the highest opening of 2024 so far with projections predicting a $90 million launch. In the meantime, Sony will enjoy a one-two weekend finish as DNEG\u2019s \u201cThe Garfield Movie\u201d takes the No. 2 spot with $10 million in its third weekend, giving the family film an $68.6 million domestic total. Paramount\u2019s \u201cIF\u201d is in third this weekend with $8 million, giving John Krasinski\u2019s family film a solid $93.5 million domestic total after four weekends. Opening to $33.7 million domestic against a reported $110 million budget before marketing, \u201cIF\u201d has legged out quite well despite some competition from \u201cGarfield\u201d; and while \u201cInside Out 2\u201d will likely lead to stiffer drops for both of those films next weekend, \u201cIF\u201d will earn a 3x multiple as it crosses $100 million domestic in the coming week.

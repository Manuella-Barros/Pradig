(AP) -- Arkansas lawmakers adjourned this year's session without approving a budget for the Game and Fish Commission on Thursday, putting the state's hunting and fishing programs in limbo if the Legislature doesn't return for a special session by July.\n\nThe House voted 62-21 in favor of the agency's appropriation, which gives it the authority to spend more than $175 million in state and federal funds, falling short of the 75 votes needed to pass the legislation. The Senate approved the bill earlier this month.\n\nThe vote creates uncertainty about whether the 636-employee agency that oversees the state's hunting, fishing and conversation programs will be able to operate when the fiscal year begins July 1. The commission, which issues hunting and fishing licenses, is primarily funded by a 1/8-cent sales tax approved by Arkansas voters in 1996.\n\n\"There's 636 employees that work hard that we've got to think about,\" Republican Rep. Lane Jean, who co-chairs the Joint Budget Committee, told the House before the vote. \"Sometimes you've got to put your personal grief, your personal vendettas, your personal pride aside and do what's right for the whole.\"\n\nThursday's vote marks the first time in more than 20 years lawmakers have adjourned without approving an agency's budget. Standoffs over budget aren't uncommon, including past fights over the state's Medicaid expansion, but they're usually resolved.\n\nLegislative leaders said they were confident the Game and Fish Commission would not shut down in July and expected its budget to get approved before then. The Legislature can only return if Arkansas Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders calls a special session. Spokeswoman Alexa Henning didn't say whether the governor would call one but said \"all options are on the table.\"\n\nThe standoff over the agency's budget stems primarily from objections to it proposing to raise the maximum salary of its executive director, Austin Booth, to $190,000 a year. Booth is currently paid $152,638 a year.\n\nCommission Chair Stan Jones told lawmakers in a letter that Booth had never requested a raise and that increase was proposed to be \"proactive\" and remain competitive in case of a future director search. Jones promised lawmakers in a letter that Booth's salary would not be increased to more than $170,000.\n\nBut that didn't allay opponents who complained the bill wasn't taken up earlier in the session.\n\n\"We're now put in this situation of emotional blackmail,\" Republican Rep. Robin Lundstrum said.\n\nThe House vote frustrated Senate leaders, who moments later passed an amended version of the legislation capping Booth's salary at his current amount. It was a mostly symbolic move since the House had already adjourned.\n\n\"There will be a lot of concern from the people of Arkansas, which is why we stayed here to do anything we could to end up getting this budget passed,\" Senate President Bart Hester told reporters.\n\nThe House also Thursday elected Republican Rep. Brian Evans to succeed House Speaker Matthew Shepherd next year. Shepherd has served as speaker since 2018.

Evans voted Speaker-designate - Talk Business & Politics", "body": "The Arkansas General Assembly adjourned sine die Thursday (May 9) - without approving an appropriation for the Arkansas Game & Fish Commission - while selecting the next Speaker of the House of Representatives.\n\nLawmakers have wrestled for weeks with SB 21, the Arkansas Game & Fish Commission's spending bill, mainly over a request to raise the salary of the executive director.\n\nAgency officials had originally proposed an increase in pay for the executive director from $152,638 to $190,000. That request was pared back to $170,000 on Thursday, but it was still not enough to win the 75 votes needed in the House for passage. The bill failed 62-21 with 17 representatives either not voting or voting present.\n\nWhile some lawmakers criticized the tardiness of the changes and conveyed feeling pressured to approve a spending bill they didn't like, other legislators noted they had held up the budget process for approving the bill in order to find a compromise. They contended their efforts to resolve the matter dragged the bill into the 11th hour.\n\nThe Game & Fish Commission will have authority to spend money until the fiscal year ends on June 30, 2024. With the legislature officially adjourned and the appropriation bill not approved to begin July 1, passage of a measure in a special session will be the only route to resolve the dispute and allow the agency to spend its monies legally. Gov. Sarah Sanders would have to call the special session before July 1 to keep the agency operational.\n\nThe House of Representatives selected Rep. Brian Evans, R-Cabot, to be the next Speaker of the House. He will succeed Rep. Matthew Shepherd, R-El Dorado, who has served an unprecedented three full terms as Speaker.\n\nEvans defeated Rep. Johnny Rye, R-Trumann, for the position with 91 of the 100 House votes. Rep. Jack Ladyman, R-Jonesboro, withdrew from the race earlier this week. Evans must be officially elected and sworn in as Speaker in January when the 95th General Assembly convenes.\n\nTalk Business & Politics will update this story later today.", "source": {"uri": "talkbusiness.net", "dataType": "news", "title": "Talk Business & Politics"}, "authors": [{"uri": "roby_brock@talkbusiness.net", "name": "Roby Brock", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arkansas", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Arkansas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Arkansas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adjournment_sine_die", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Adjournment sine die"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Appropriation_(law)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Appropriation (law)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arkansas_General_Assembly", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Arkansas General Assembly"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bachelor_of_Science", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bachelor of Science"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speaker_of_the_United_States_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Speaker of the United States House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_session", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Special session"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiscal_year", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fiscal year"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Ladyman", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jack Ladyman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matthew_Shepherd", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Matthew Shepherd"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sarah_Huckabee_Sanders", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sarah Huckabee Sanders"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Jersey_General_Assembly", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "New Jersey General Assembly"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Appropriation_bill", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Appropriation bill"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speaker_(politics)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Speaker (politics)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legislature", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Legislature"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns_and_Elections", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns and Elections", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Housing", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Housing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 86}], "image": "https://talkbusiness.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Shepherd-House.jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9555159", "eventUri": "eng-9555159", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-09", "textStart": 59, "textEnd": 64}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-01", "textStart": 1251, "textEnd": 1257, "freq": 2}], "sentiment": -0.1294117647058823, "wgt": 178, "relevance": 1}

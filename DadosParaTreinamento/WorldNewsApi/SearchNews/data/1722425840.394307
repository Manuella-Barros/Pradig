I like to apply one drop on each cheek and my forehead, massage it into the skin, and then go to bed. (It is blue and could potentially stain your white pillowcase if you're a side or stomach sleeper, so just a heads up!) The next morning my skin is literally glowing and so soft that I can't stop touching it. Some people complain about the smell, which is a bit herbal (blame the blue tansy), but it's mild enough that it doesn't bother me and I can't smell it once I've applied it.\" Promising review: \"I have battled acne and oily skin for 15+ years. I was always so worried about having any lotion or oil on my skin due to the skin issues, but then my skin would get so dry in the winter. I got a sample size from Sephora and it has been so 'skin-changing' for me! It doesn't bother my skin or make more acne. In the winter, I would wake up with dry red skin on my forehead and cheeks. I don't anymore because of this product. I also believe it has helped with the appearance of scars and marks from the years of acne. It is expensive, but I am a firm believer in this product.\" \u2014adobr345 Get it from Amazon or Sephora for $55+ (available in two sizes).", "summary": "<h1>Because some products are worth the splurge.</h1><p><img src=\"https://img.buzzfeed.com/buzzfeed-static/static/2024-06/14/15/tmp/5cc37c21679f/tmp-name-3-464-1718379522-0_dblbig.jpg\" /></p><hr /><p><a href=\"https://www.buzzfeed.com/maryruehl/beauty-products-spend-more-on\">View Entire Post &rsaquo;</a></p>", "url": "https://www.buzzfeed.com/maryruehl/beauty-products-spend-more-on", "image": "https://img.buzzfeed.com/buzzfeed-static/static/2024-06/14/15/tmp/5cc37c21679f/tmp-name-3-464-1718379522-0_dblbig.jpg?resize=1200:*", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-29 00:31:02", "author": "https://www.buzzfeed.com/about,Jenae Sitzes,Mary Ruehl", "authors": ["https://www.buzzfeed.com/about", "Jenae Sitzes", "Mary Ruehl"], "language": "en", "source_country": "US", "sentiment": -0.229}

The plan was previously considered acquiring planes from the bankrupt Brazilian carrier Gol or other sources. The decision comes after failed discussions and Gol's accusations towards LATAM for attempting to poach its planes and pilots amid Gol's filing for bankruptcy protection in the U.S. in January.\n\nReuters reported that following the unsuccessful negotiations, LATAM sought to acquire B737s that Gol could potentially release as part of its restructuring efforts.\n\nGol's Lease Renegotiation and LATAM's Strategic Pivot\n\nAccording to US News, Gol is currently navigating through bankruptcy, aiming to renegotiate terms for 90 aircraft leases by the end of May. LATAM, meanwhile, did not disclose the number of planes it hoped to secure from Gol's fleet. The deal's collapse was attributed to Gol's \"lack of meaningful engagement,\" as stated in a letter LATAM filed in the bankruptcy case.\n\nDespite Gol's declined to comment on the matter, LATAM voiced its frustrations over the scarcity of available B737 aircraft and Gol's non-cooperation, forcing LATAM to seek alternative narrowbody aircraft to meet the growing consumer demand.\n\nBroader Industry Impacts and Boeing 737 MAX Production\n\nThe airline industry has faced numerous challenges recently, including safety concerns that have slowed Boeing's production of its best-selling aircraft, the 737 MAX. These challenges were compounded when the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) halted Boeing's expansion of its 737 MAX production following a cabin blowout incident on an Alaska Airlines flight.\n\nWith Boeing given a 90-day period to address these systemic quality-control issues, and already halfway through, the industry watches closely. LATAM's pivot away from the B737 amid these tumultuous times illustrates the complex dynamics and rapid strategic adjustments airlines must make to navigate the contemporary aviation landscape.", "source": {"uri": "econotimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "EconoTimes"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gol_Linhas_A\u00e9reas_Inteligentes", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gol Linhas A\u00e9reas Inteligentes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bankruptcy", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bankruptcy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_737", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boeing 737"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LATAM_Airlines_Group", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "LATAM Airlines Group"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narrow-body_aircraft", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Narrow-body aircraft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Boeing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin_America", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Latin America"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aircraft_lease", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Aircraft lease"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_737_MAX", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Boeing 737 MAX"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alaska_Airlines", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Alaska Airlines"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Aviation_Administration", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Federal Aviation Administration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aviation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Aviation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airline", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Airline"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reuters", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Reuters"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Aerospace", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Aerospace", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Travel/Transportation", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Travel/Transportation", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Aviation/Multimedia", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Aviation/Multimedia", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 89}], "image": "https://f1.econotimes.com/2024/04/9ajv6z77jz_th_1024x0.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9511853", "eventUri": "eng-9511853", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.2627450980392156, "wgt": 195, "relevance": 1}

LATAM then offered to acquire any B737s that Gol no longer wished to operate after its bankruptcy restructuring.\n\nGol is trying to renegotiate terms on 90 aircraft leases by the end of May, and LATAM did not say how many planes it hoped to acquire during Gol's bankruptcy.\n\nLATAM blamed Gol's \"lack of meaningful engagement\" for the deal's failure, in a letter filed on Wednesday in Gol's bankruptcy case.\n\nGol declined to comment on LATAM's letter.\n\nLATAM said that the \"scarcity of available B737 aircraft, as well as the debtors' refusal to cooperate\" had forced LATAM to pursue alternative narrowbody aircraft to bolster its fleet and meet rising consumer demand.\n\n\"LATAM has been unable over the last several months - despite its extensive efforts - to obtain B737 aircraft from other sources unrelated to the debtors,\" LATAM's attorneys wrote. \"Accordingly, LATAM is unlikely to continue pursuing any transactions involving the B737.\"\n\nAirlines have needed to adjust their business plans as safety concerns have forced Boeing to slow production of its best-selling 737 Max.\n\nThe U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) stopped Boeing from expanding its 737 MAX production after a mid-flight cabin blowout on an Alaska Airlines flight. The FAA gave Boeing 90 days to address systemic quality-control issues revealed by the incident, and Boeing is about halfway through that period.\n\n(Reporting by Dietrich Knauth; Editing by Sonali Paul)", "source": {"uri": "money.usnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "U.S. News & World Report"}, "authors": [{"uri": "reuters@money.usnews.com", "name": "Reuters", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gol_Linhas_A\u00e9reas_Inteligentes", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gol Linhas A\u00e9reas Inteligentes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bankruptcy", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bankruptcy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LATAM_Airlines_Group", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "LATAM Airlines Group"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boeing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_737", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Boeing 737"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narrow-body_aircraft", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Narrow-body aircraft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reuters", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Reuters"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brazil", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Brazil"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Brazil"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aircraft_lease", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Aircraft lease"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alaska_Airlines", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Alaska Airlines"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_737_MAX", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Boeing 737 MAX"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Aviation_Administration", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Federal Aviation Administration"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Aerospace", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Aerospace", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace_and_Defense/Aeronautical", "label": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace and Defense/Aeronautical", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Military/Aviation", "label": "dmoz/Society/Military/Aviation", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Aviation/Multimedia", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Aviation/Multimedia", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Classifieds/Aviation", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Classifieds/Aviation", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 82}], "image": "https://www.usnews.com/dims4/USNEWS/bbca8d0/2147483647/thumbnail/970x647/quality/85/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.usnews.com%2Fcmsmedia%2F05%2F0931e0d84f7a4d5a3ca13be0825666%2Ftag%3Areuters.com%2C2024%3Anewsml_LYNXNPEK3N0YE%3A12024-04-24T224358Z_1_LYNXNPEK3N0YE_RTROPTP_3_GOL-BANKRUPTCY.JPG", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9511853", "eventUri": "eng-9511853", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.2784313725490196, "wgt": 191, "relevance": 1}

Kusale went on to compete in some national-level tournaments before receiving the call-up to the Indian shooting team.\n\nIn 2015, Swapnil Kusale was recruited by the Indian Railways and was posted in Pune Division as a ticket examiner. The job was necessary for the 28-year-old shooter hailing from a modest family.\n\nThere was a time when his father had to take a loan to bear the expenses of the bullets. \"The cost of each bullet was around 120 rupees at that time, so I had to be very careful while shooting because I couldn't afford that much,\" Kusale said, as per Olympics.com.\n\nSwapnil Kusale tasted his first success at the 2023 Asian Games where he finished atop the podium along with Aishwary Pratap Singh Tomar and Akhil Sheoran. The trio also set a new world record in the men's rifle 3 positions team event, registering a score of 1769.\n\nSwapnil Kusale earned a Paris Olympics quota for India in 2022 after finishing fourth in the 50m rifle 3 positions at the World Championship in Cairo.

In the standing position, he managed scores of 98 and 97, ensuring his place in the final, which will take place on Thursday.\n\nWhile Kusale thrived, fellow Indian shooter Aishwary Pratap Singh Tomar finished in 11th place with 589 points. Despite being in contention for the top eight, Tomar's performance was hampered by a lower score of 95 in the first series of the standing position. China's Liu Yukun emerged as a leading contender, topping the qualification with an Olympic record of 594 points. However, Du Linshu, who holds the World qualification record, surprisingly did not make the cut.\n\nWho is Swapnil Kusale?\n\nBorn on August 6, 1995, in Pune, Swapnil Kusale comes from an agricultural background. Swapnil's journey into shooting began in 2009 when his father enrolled him in Maharashtra's Krida Prabhodini, a primary sports program. After a year of intense training, Kusale chose to shoot as his sport. His dedication and talent were soon recognized, and in 2013, he received sponsorship from Lakshya Sports. Kusale's achievements in the shooting world are notable. He clinched gold in the 50m rifle prone 3 event at the 2015 Asian Shooting Championships in Kuwait. Additionally, he won the 59th National Shooting Championship in Tughlakabad, surpassing well-known shooters like Gagan Narang and Chain Singh. He repeated this success at the 61st National Championship in Thiruvananthapuram, securing another gold in the 50m rifle 3-position event.\n\nSwapnil finished 4th at the 2022 World Championship in Cairo, earning an Olympic quota place for India. The Pune-born shooter won gold in the team event at the 2022 Asian Games and secured gold in the mixed team event at the 2023 World Cup in Baku, along with two silver medals in individual and team events. Kusale also claimed a bronze medal in the team event at the 2022 World Championship and gold in the team event at the 2021 World Cup in New Delhi. His success is supported by assistance under the Procurement of Ammunition, domestic training with a personal coach, and financial backing of Rs. 17,58,557 through the Target Olympic Podium Scheme (TOPS). As he heads into the final at the Paris Olympics, Kusale's journey from a promising young shooter in Pune to a leading Olympic contender highlights his exceptional skill, dedication, and the comprehensive support he has received throughout his career.", "source": {"uri": "indiatoday.in", "dataType": "news", "title": "India Today"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

The 22-year-old opened India's account with a 10m air pistol bronze on Sunday and would go on to win the same medal in the mixed team version of the event with Sarabjot Singh on Tuesday.\n\nThere was more good news coming in from the Indian shooting contingent on Wednesday with Swapnil Kusale giving the nation hope of an unprecedented third medal in the sport by qualifying for the men's 50m rifle 3 positions finals.\n\nKusale became the fourth Indian to feature in the final round of a shooting event after Bhaker, Sarabjot, Ramita Jindal and Arjun Babuta on Wednesday with a score of 590 in the qualifying round.

He would repeat the performance in the 61st Nationals in Thiruvananthapuram, this time winning gold in 50m rifle 3 position.\n\nHow the government has funded him?\n\nKusale has been receiving the Sports Ministry's support in his journey to the Paris Olympics. Not only is he a Target Olympic Podium Scheme (TOPS) athlete, he also receives assistance in procurement of ammunition, he also has been assigned a personal coach as far as his domestic training is concerned.\n\nThe shooter also receives a financial assistance of Rs 17.58 lakh as part of TOPS, and a sum of Rs 1,42,69,647 under the Annual Calendar for Training and Competition (ACTC) scheme.\n\nWhat are Swapnil Kusale's achievements?\n\n-- World Championship, Cairo (2022) - finished 4th winning Olympics 2024 quota place for India.\n\n-- Asian Games 2022 - Gold in Team event.

It was a redemption of sorts for him after a debacle at last year's Asian Games final, where he led from the start and was in line for a medal before one poor shot dropped him to fourth.\n\nAishwary Pratap Singh Tomar, the other Indian in the fray, had one bad series in the standing round, which brought him down from the top eight to eventually finish in 11th place.\n\nJULY 31 LIVE UPDATES | INDIA'S OLYMPIC MEDAL TALLY | INDIA AT PARIS OLYMPICS | LATEST OLYMPIC NEWS | KEY DATES AT PARIS 2024\n\nKusale became the first Indian to qualify for the final of this event in 12 years, following Joydeep Karmakar at the London Olympics, when he finished fourth.\n\nToday, Kusale was the only one among the top 8 who didn't record a single perfect series of 100. However, he maintained excellent consistency - his last series of 97 was his lowest. He shot three 99s and two 98s before that, which ensured he was always in the hunt for qualiflication.\n\nHow did he qualify for the Olympics?\n\nKusale had won a quota for India in this category, and eventually did well enough in the trials to make it to the squad as well.\n\nAt the trials though, he had finished behind Tomar, and eventually almost didn't make it, as he had a very poor final round of trials, but his performances in the first three rounds were good enough for him to make it to the squad.\n\nWhat happened in his last big final?\n\nAt the Asian Games, Kusale qualified in first place; both he and Tomar shot 591, with Kusale taking top spot with more inner tens. In the final, he set the pace in the kneeling and prone rounds. He was leading until the first elimination shot in the standing series, where he shot a 7.6.\n\nHe managed to shoot 10.5 and 10.1 in the following shots, but he couldn't recover from the blow created by that one bad shot, which made him fall from first to fourth, where he eventually finished.\n\nTomorrow, in his first Olympic final, he will know he cannot afford that one bad shot to derail his path towards a medal.

It is therefore no surprise that Kusale relates to Dhoni's life story.\n\nHe has watched the biopic of the World Cup winner multiple times and hopes to match the lofty achievements of the champion cricketer.\n\nA top-three finish in the 50m rifle three positions final here on Thursday would certainly put Kusale in the list of high achieves in Indian sport.\n\n\"I don't follow anyone specific in the shooting world. Outside of that, I admire Dhoni for the person that he is. My sport requires me to be as calm and patient as he is on the field. I also relate to his story as I am a ticket collector like he was,\" Kusale told PTI shortly after finishing seventh in a tightly contest qualification here.\n\nKusale has been working for Central Railways since 2015.\n\nHis two rivals from Czech Republic also shot 590 but the Indian had the most inner 10s -- 38 -- compared to Jiri Privratsky and Petr Nymbursky, who sealed the eighth and last qualification spot.\n\nHe also doesn't have to look too far beyond home for inspiration. His father and brother are teachers in a district school while mother is the sarpanch of Kambalwadi village.\n\nThe fancied Aishwary Pratap Tomar ended 11th with a total of 589 in a session topped by China's Liu Yukun.\n\nKusale did not know about his classification in the final until his coach told him that. He shot 197 in prone, 195 in standing and as much in kneeling.\n\n\"Every shot is a new shot. I was just trying to be patient. The whole match I had the same mindset. Just shoot with patience. At the back of the mind, you are thinking about your scores but it is better if you don't,\" said Kusale.\n\nThe job is half done in his debut Games and Kusale is fully aware of that. Manu Bhaker's unprecedented two medals here has also provided an extra dose of motivation.\n\n\"It has been a great experience so far. I love shooting and I am glad that I have been able to do it for so long. Seeing Manu do well gives us a lot of confidence. If she can do it, we can do it too,\" said Kusale.\n\nNational coach Manoj Kumar Ohlyan was tracking Kusale's progress from a distance and he is bullish about his chances in the final.\n\n\"He is in a good frame of mind. We are hoping for the best. We just want him to perform the way he did today. He was patient. He is good technically and physically,\" added Ohlyan.

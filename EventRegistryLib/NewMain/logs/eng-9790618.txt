It starts off with Joel (Pedro Pascal) in conversation with a new character played by Catherine O'Hara (seemingly his therapist), reckoning with his past actions. \"Did you hurt her?\" she asks. \"I saved her,\" he replies.\n\nOn top of O'Hara's unknown role, we see other characters for the first time including Kaitlyn Dever's Abby, Jeffrey Wright reprising his video game voice role as Isaac, and Dina, played by Isabela Merced. Meanwhile with returning cast, Joel's brother Tommy (Gabriel Luna) as well as Ellie (Bella Ramsey) appear briefly in some intense action scenes.\n\nAs revealed last year, showrunners Craig Mazin and Neil Druckmann decided to split the events from The Last of Us Part II video game into two seasons, since the story was far more complex than the original. The second season will be just seven episodes to create a natural break, while the third season will be \"significantly larger,\" they said.\n\nThe original series mostly followed the events of the game, with some smart deviations and changes. Expect more of the same for season two, though the teaser already shows one significant divergence. In the game, Joel only confesses the events that occurred at the hospital to his brother, but here, he's telling Catherine O'Hara's character.", "source": {"uri": "engadget.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "engadget"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catherine_O'Hara", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Catherine O'Hara"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Last_of_Us", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Last of Us"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pedro_Pascal", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pedro Pascal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HBO", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "HBO"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bella_Ramsey", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bella Ramsey"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaitlyn_Dever", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kaitlyn Dever"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gabriel_Luna", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gabriel Luna"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeffrey_Wright", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jeffrey Wright"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Mandalorian_(season_3)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Mandalorian (season 3)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Mandalorian_(season_2)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Mandalorian (season 2)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neil_Druckmann", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Neil Druckmann"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Craig_Mazin", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Craig Mazin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Showrunner", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Showrunner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Last_of_Us_Part_II", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Last of Us Part II"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Television/Programs", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Television/Programs", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Online/Roleplaying", "label": "dmoz/Games/Online/Roleplaying", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Action-Adventure", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Action-Adventure", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Adventure", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Adventure", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Animation/Cartoons", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Animation/Cartoons", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 78}], "image": "https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2024-08/74b75010-52df-11ef-bffb-c8b40f32e6b2", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9790618", "eventUri": "eng-9790618", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1686274509803922, "wgt": 176, "relevance": 1}

New faces include Kaitlyn Dever as Abby and Catherine O'Hara's still to be named character (although previous rumours suggested her character will be called Gail).\n\nYou can check out the teaser below, towards the end of HBO's latest sizzle reel. It starts at around the 01:15 mark. After the trailer, I will be breaking down a few bits I noticed, so please be aware of spoilers for The Last of Us Part 2 (the video game) below.\n\nThe first clip we see is panning down on a party scene, lit up by fairy lights. The back of a girl's head can be seen, as she watches out over the dance floor.\n\nThis is Bella Ramsey's Ellie, and the scene shown here is basically a carbon copy from that same moment in the game.\n\nWhile the above footage is playing, we hear a woman's voice asking \"Did you hurt her?\", to which Pedro Pascal's Joel replies: \"No.\" The trailer then pans to Ellie's scared arm, and her tattoo.\n\nIn the game, it is revealed that between the events of The Last of Us and The Last of Us Part 2, Ellie covers her bite mark (which she received in the shopping mall with her friend Riley during the series' DLC, Left Behind) first with a chemical burn and later, by getting her ex-girlfriend Cat to tattoo over the area.\n\nThe moment shared in HBO's teasers appears to be Ellie getting the tattoo, suggesting that we may meet Cat during the show's second season (or, this is just a brief flashback scene and Cat's hands may be all we get to see).\n\nAfter seeing Ellie's arm, we get to see the lady who was speaking to Joel, and it's Catherine O'Hara's character. I previously wondered if O'Hara would play either a member of the WLF or a Seraphite, but she appears to be a Jackson resident given her seemingly close relationship with Joel.\n\nO'Hara previously said she had filmed scenes with both Joel and Ellie, so I now wonder if she will try and act as a mediator between the two during the Jackson scenes (those who have played the game will know there is friction between Joel and Ellie after the events of Part 1).\n\nMy other theory is she is some kind of resident therapist that Jackson's community confides in. Her role in the series was previously said to be an all-new character, so that would fit. The first season did also address Joel's trauma and mental health, so this could be the next evolution of his journey.\n\nRight now, I am not exactly sure what is happening in this next scene. Ellie can be seen screaming as someone slightly off screen tries to hold her down on a bed of sorts.\n\nFirst, I wondered if this was a traumatic dream Ellie was having, and she is picturing herself inside the Firefly hospital unable to stop Joel from his killing spree.\n\nI then wondered if this was someone else pouring the chemicals on her bite scar, and Ellie screaming in pain. This would suggest that Ellie and Joel had confided in several other members of the Jackson community, though, so I am not sure how likely this is. Thoughts welcome!\n\nWe are back outside for the next brief clip, which shows a snowy landscape with a large walled structure - Jackson - being stormed by a large horde of running assailants. While we can't see their faces, it is fair to assume that this is a horde of infected runners.\n\nThe next clip show's Gabriel Luna's Tommy using his gun to shoot out into the snow, I assume at these very runners, defending Jackson. In the game, Jackson's residents regularly patrol the surrounding areas to defend the settlement from infected.\n\nThe next few clips are again brief, but we get our first official look at season two's Seraphites, Isabela Merced as Dina and Jeffrey Wright, reprising his role as Isaac.\n\nPrevious images had leaked of Merced on set with Ramsey, as they filmed in Canada. An image of Wright also appeared online, and appeared to suggest we will be learning more about Isaac's backstory when season two airs.\n\nAt last, we now get our first very quick glimpse of Dever's Abby. This image is again almost a carbon copy of the same moment in the game. We see Abby wearing a dark beanie hat fleeing from a swarm of infected.\n\nShe is on the cusp of being overcome by the swarm, with a wired fence being pressed down over her as she tries to crawl through the snow to safety.\n\nThe final few images from the teaser show a horseback ride in the snow (something we again see in the game).\n\nWe also see Ellie and Dina in a subway running from a clicker. I am going to suggest this represents The Last of Us Part 2's 'Tunnels' section, where the two make their way through train cars while fighting off enemies.\n\nThe final shot from the teaser shows Joel, a tear rolling down his cheek, telling O'Hara he saved Ellie.

More info\n\nHBO has dropped a sizzling new teaser trailer hinting at the highly anticipated second season of The Last of Us, showcasing a dramatic divergence from its video game origins.\n\nThe series, inspired by the successful PlayStation games, follows the perilous journey of survivors Joel (played by Pedro Pascal) and Ellie (Bella Ramsey) through a world devastated by a fungal zombie apocalypse.\n\nIn the gripping conclusion of its nine-episode inaugural season, viewers watched as Joel grappled with an excruciating decision, ultimately choosing to save Ellie, whose unique immunity made her humanity's potential saviour, from certain death.\n\nWith anticipation building, season two is poised to draw content from the game franchise's second installment, released in 2020.\n\nPedro Pascal and Bella Ramsey return to their respective roles, joined by newcomers including Kaitlyn Dever as Abby, Jeffrey Wright as Isaac Dixon, Isabela Merced as Ellie's love interest Dina, and Catherine O'Hara in a yet-to-be-disclosed role.\n\nCatherine, known for her stellar work on Schitt's Creek, features prominently in the brief glimpse provided for the upcoming season, playing a character who, in dialogue with Joel, probes deeply with the question: \"Did you hurt her?\"\n\nA visibly emotional Joel responds with a sombre admission: \"I saved her.\"\n\nThis powerful exchange nods to the original narrative where Joel's controversial choice becomes a central element of tension in the second video game.\n\nHowever, the trailer has already shown significant deviations from the original game's storyline. In the game, Joel is actually confessing to his brother Tommy, who is played by Gabriel Luna in the series.\n\nThe trailer has already hinted at some major changes from the game's narrative, keeping fans guessing about the direction of the HBO adaptation's second instalment.\n\nBrief clips have also suggested a number of violent scenes and frightening encounters with the infected.\n\nWhile an exact release date is yet to be confirmed, the second season is scheduled for 2025 and is expected to comprise seven episodes. A third season is also in the works but has not been officially greenlit.\n\nIn addition to the sneak peek at The Last of Us, HBO viewers were also given a glimpse of the next Game of Thrones prequel, A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms.\n\nFirst looks at the upcoming seasons of The White Lotus, And Just Like That... season three and Industry were also shared.\n\nThe Last of Us is available to stream on Sky Go and NOW.", "source": {"uri": "manchestereveningnews.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Manchester Evening News"}, "authors": [{"uri": "lucas_hill_paul@manchestereveningnews.co.uk", "name": "Lucas Hill-Paul", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bella_Ramsey", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Bella Ramsey"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pedro_Pascal", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Pedro Pascal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trailer_(promotion)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Trailer (promotion)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Mandalorian_(season_2)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Mandalorian (season 2)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fungal_infection", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fungal infection"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catherine_O'Hara", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Catherine O'Hara"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PlayStation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "PlayStation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zombie_apocalypse", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Zombie apocalypse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HBO", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "HBO"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_game", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Video game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isabela_Merced", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Isabela Merced"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schitt's_Creek", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Schitt's Creek"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaitlyn_Dever", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kaitlyn Dever"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeffrey_Wright", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jeffrey Wright"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Last_of_Us", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Last of Us"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reality_television", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Reality television"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Mandalorian_(season_3)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Mandalorian (season 3)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/And_Just_Like_That...", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "And Just Like That..."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Now_(Sky)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Now (Sky)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_White_Lotus", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The White Lotus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Knight_of_the_Seven_Kingdoms_(Game_of_Thrones)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms (Game of Thrones)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steam_(service)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Steam (service)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gabriel_Luna", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gabriel Luna"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prequel", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Prequel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_of_Thrones", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Game of Thrones"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streaming_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Streaming media"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Adventure", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Adventure", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Historical", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Historical", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Addictions/Games", "label": "dmoz/Health/Addictions/Games", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Entertaining/Baby_Showers", "label": "dmoz/Home/Entertaining/Baby Showers", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 53}], "image": "https://i2-prod.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/news/tv/article29678908.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_pedro-pascal-as-joel.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9790618", "eventUri": "eng-9790618", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1764705882352942, "wgt": 167, "relevance": 1}

However, more details about her role remain undisclosed.\n\nThe debut season of The Last of Us was an enormous success for HBO. It reportedly delivered viewer numbers not seen since the conclusion of Game of Thrones and even earned 19 Emmy nominations, of which it won eight. The American post-apocalyptic drama TV series, created by Craig Mazin and Neil Druckmann, is based on the video game franchise by the company Naughty Dog. Now, following the conclusion of season 1 of The Last of Us in 2023, Max has released a new teaser for the Last of Us Season 2. While season one was based on 2013's The Last of Us, the second season will cover events from 2020's The Last of Us - Part II.\n\nAmong the highlights, we get our first look at Catherine O'Hara's character but more details about her remain undisclosed. However, her portrayal hints at a blend of menace and kindness that is going to be compelling. O'Hara's character also might be an original addition rather than one from the video games.\n\n\"Did you hurt her?\" O'Hara's character asks Joel, played by Pedro Pascal, likely referring to Ellie (portrayed by Bella Ramsey). \"What did you do,\" she adds.\n\nThe clip then transitions into a montage showing Joel's actions and the intense events of the second season. In a major reveal, Oscar-nominated actor Jeffrey Wright reprises his role from The Last of Us - Part II as Isaac, described as \"the quietly powerful leader of a large militia group who sought liberty but instead has become mired in an endless war against a surprisingly resourceful enemy,\" reports Entertainment Weekly.\n\nAnswering O'Hara's question, Joel, with a tear running down his cheek, says, \"I saved her.\"\n\nWatch it here:\n\nWith Pedro Pascal's emotional performance, Catherine O'Hara's intriguing character and Jeffrey Wright's return, fans' excitement for the second season runs high. However, markers are still to announce the premiere date for the series.\n\nTVline adds that Abby, a key character in The Last of Us Part II video game, will be portrayed by Kaitlyn Dever, known for her role in Dopesick. According to the official description, Abby is \"a skilled soldier whose black-and-white view of the world is challenged as she seeks vengeance for those she loved.\"\n\nJoining Kaitlyn Dever and Catherine O'Hara in the new season are several fresh faces including Young Mazino, Isabela Merced, Danny Ramirez, Ariela Barer, Tati Gabrielle and Spencer Lord.", "source": {"uri": "news18.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "News18"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catherine_O'Hara", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Catherine O'Hara"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Last_of_Us", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "The Last of Us"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_game", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Video game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Mandalorian_(season_2)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Mandalorian (season 2)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emmy_Awards", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Emmy Awards"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drama_(film_and_television)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Drama (film and television)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neil_Druckmann", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Neil Druckmann"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Craig_Mazin", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Craig Mazin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naughty_Dog", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Naughty Dog"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apocalyptic_and_post-apocalyptic_fiction", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Apocalyptic and post-apocalyptic fiction"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_of_Thrones", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Game of Thrones"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HBO", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "HBO"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bella_Ramsey", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bella Ramsey"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeffrey_Wright", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jeffrey Wright"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pedro_Pascal", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pedro Pascal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_Awards", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Academy Awards"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isabela_Merced", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Isabela Merced"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dopesick_(miniseries)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dopesick (miniseries)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Danny_Ramirez", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Danny Ramirez"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tati_Gabrielle", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tati Gabrielle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaitlyn_Dever", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kaitlyn Dever"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TVLine", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "TVLine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entertainment_Weekly", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Entertainment Weekly"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Last_of_Us_Part_II", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Last of Us Part II"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Television/Programs", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Television/Programs", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Virtual_Reality/Multi-User_Systems", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Virtual Reality/Multi-User Systems", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Online/Roleplaying", "label": "dmoz/Games/Online/Roleplaying", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Adventure", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Adventure", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Animation/Cartoons", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Animation/Cartoons", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 99}], "image": null, "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9790618", "eventUri": "eng-9790618", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1607843137254903, "wgt": 157, "relevance": 1}

She could be some sort of therapist since she asks Joel if he hurt Ellie. \"No. I saved her,\" Pedro Pascal answers.\n\nThis conversation is taken straight from The Last of Us Part 2. The game opens with the same conversation between Joel and his brother Tommy, who discuss what went down in Fireflies' hospital. In the game, Joel says the same words when telling the story to Tommy. The latter then comforts his brother by saying he would do the same if he were him, and he'll take it to the grave if he has to.\n\nIt seems like Catherine O'Hara will take Tommy's role in HBO's show, at least in this part. O'Hara's character is currently unnamed, and as there's no one in the game similar to this character, the Home Alone actress will likely be playing an entirely new, original character.\n\nThe conversation between her and Joel isn't the entire focus of the short first teaser. We also get glimpses of Gabriel Luna's Tommy, Isabela's Merced Dina, Jeffrey Wright's Isaac, and obviously, Bella Ramsey's Ellie. Each character holds a gun in their short glimpses, with Tommy wielding a sniper rifle.\n\nFans of the game should be excited to see Tommy with a sniper rifle due to a fan-favorite scene from The Last of Us Part 2, which involves this deadly duo. We don't want to get into spoilers territory for those who haven't played the games, so we won't share any details, but this scene happens late in the game and could take place this season.\n\nThe second season of HBO's show will only have seven episodes, according to Deadline's interview with Craig Mazin and Neil Druckmann, the show creators. The duo has teased a third season, and looking at how much from the second game there is to cover, it seems like it is all but confirmed.\n\nHBO will release The Last of Us season two in 2025, but no exact date has been confirmed. The first season launched in January 2023, and we'd expect a similar timeframe for the upcoming one.", "source": {"uri": "dotesports.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Dot Esports"}, "authors": [{"uri": "mateusz_miter@dotesports.com", "name": "Mateusz Miter", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catherine_O'Hara", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Catherine O'Hara"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Character_arc", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Character arc"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Last_of_Us", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Last of Us"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pedro_Pascal", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pedro Pascal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trailer_(promotion)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Trailer (promotion)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Last_of_Us_Part_II", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Last of Us Part II"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_Alone_(franchise)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Home Alone (franchise)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sniper", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sniper"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HBO", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "HBO"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Mandalorian_(season_3)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Mandalorian (season 3)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isabela_Merced", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Isabela Merced"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Mandalorian_(season_2)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Mandalorian (season 2)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/What_If...?_(TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "What If...?

HBO has shared a first look at the second season, which stars Pedro Pascal and Bella Ramsey as unlikely friends in a zombie apocalypse.\n\nMORE: Succession writer and director announced for HBO's Harry Potter adaptation: what we know so far\n\nBased on the best selling video games, season one concluded - and spoiler alert for those who have yet to watch it - with Pedro's character Joel saving young Ellie from being killed at the hands of the Fireflies, a group of people who believed that Ellie was the key to the cure, and wanted to remove her brain.\n\nUpon saving her, he lies about what happened to her, saying that there was an ambush and he managed to get her away. However, he actually massacred the group to save Ellie - knowing that she would sacrifice herself if she believed that she was humanity's only hope of a cure.\n\nIn the trailer, Joel's actions have clearly had an impact on his relationship with Ellie, as Schitt's Creek star Catherine O'Hara can be seen quizzing him on Ellie, asking: \"Did you hurt her?\" When he says he didn't, she asks: \"Then what? What did you do?\" To which he replies: \"I saved her.\"\n\nThe footage also shows a host of new characters, as well as a clip of Ellie screaming. Taking to the YouTube comment section to discuss, one person wrote: \"That quick shot of Ellie screaming/crying gave me chills. I'm wondering if it's a ptsd flashback she had.\"\n\nAnother person added: \"I don't know if I will be emotionally ready for that one scene we all know, but I am so ready for the coming season and the season after.\" A third person wrote: \"S2's already looking chaotic, sad it's only 7 episodes. Can't wait!\"\n\nSeason two will of course see Pedro and Bella return as Joel and Ellie, while Gabriel Luna and Rutine Wesley also return as Tommy and Maria respectively. Following that, the show has plenty of new faces, including Unbelievable star Kaitlyn Dever as Abby, Isabela Merced as Dina, Young Mazino as Jesse, Ariela Barer as Mel, Tati Gabrielle as Nora, Spencer Lord as Owen, and Danny Ramirez as Manny.\n\nThe show was a huge hit for HBO, and was the most-watched debut season of a series ever. Season two will kick off in 2025 - so watch this space!", "source": {"uri": "hellomagazine.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "HELLO!"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HBO", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "HBO"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Mandalorian_(season_2)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Mandalorian (season 2)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Succession_(TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Succession (TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bella_Ramsey", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bella Ramsey"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Last_of_Us", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Last of Us"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pedro_Pascal", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pedro Pascal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zombie_apocalypse", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Zombie apocalypse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_game", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Video game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Potter", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Harry Potter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schitt's_Creek", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Schitt's Creek"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catherine_O'Hara", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Catherine O'Hara"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trailer_(promotion)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Trailer (promotion)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isabela_Merced", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Isabela Merced"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unbelievable_(miniseries)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Unbelievable (miniseries)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Danny_Ramirez", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Danny Ramirez"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tati_Gabrielle", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tati Gabrielle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ariela_Barer", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ariela Barer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaitlyn_Dever", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kaitlyn Dever"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gabriel_Luna", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gabriel Luna"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flashback_(narrative)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Flashback (narrative)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YouTube", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "YouTube"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 65}], "image": "https://images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/landscape/bb3ee38513e7-screengrabs-main00001423still024.jpg?tx=c_fill,w_1200", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9790618", "eventUri": "eng-9790618", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2078431372549019, "wgt": 154, "relevance": 1}

We're betting on the former.\n\n\"Did you hurt her?\" O'Hara's character asks of Ellie, to which Joel replies: \"No... \"I saved her.\"\n\nFor fans of the first season, and the video game on which it is based, this answer will make perfect sense. For the uninitiated, series one ends with Ellie and Joel in a resistance group hospital, with Ellie under general anaesthesia, ready to be operated on so that a cure for all humanity can be reverse-engineered from the mutation that makes her the only known human who can resist the Cordyceps infection.\n\nJoel learns too late that the operation could kill Ellie, and, unable to bear the thought of losing her, he kills the surgeons. We wonder whether that might come back to haunt him.\n\nThe trailer also gives a first look at Dina crying over something, Abby being cornered by Infected in the snow, Isaac (Jeffrey Wright) pulling a gun on someone, and the Seraphite cult racing through woods with torches in hand.\n\nIn the game, Isaac is the leader of the Washington Liberation Front, or, as Ellie calls them, The Wolves.\n\nElsewhere, Ellie is seen screaming in fear, Joel's brother Tommy firing a sniper's rifle, and a Clicker screeching at the door of a train carriage. Oh, it's good have them back.\n\nShare your thoughts!

Really curious how season 2 of the show is gonna go.\"\n\nThe Last of Us season two is set to pick up after the events of the intense season one finale - which saw Joel violently refuse to give Ellie to the Fireflies for their medical research.", "source": {"uri": "gaytimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "GAY TIMES"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jordan_robledo@gaytimes.com", "name": "Jordan Robledo", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HBO", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "HBO"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bella_Ramsey", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bella Ramsey"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neil_Druckmann", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Neil Druckmann"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pedro_Pascal", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pedro Pascal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Storytelling", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Storytelling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_producer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Executive producer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotten_Tomatoes", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rotten Tomatoes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_game", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Video game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Mandalorian_(season_2)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Mandalorian (season 2)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catherine_O'Hara", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Catherine O'Hara"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Last_of_Us", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Last of Us"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Close-up", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Close-up"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trailer_(promotion)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Trailer (promotion)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tattoo", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tattoo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jackson,_Wyoming", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jackson, Wyoming"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Jackson, Wyoming"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isabela_Merced", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Isabela Merced"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gabriel_Luna", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gabriel Luna"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_Awards", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Academy Awards"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Television/Programs", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Television/Programs", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Interactive", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Interactive", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Animation/Cartoons", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Animation/Cartoons", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 93}], "image": "https://www.gaytimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/The-Last-Of-Us-Pedro-Pascal-Bella-Ramsey-1.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9790618", "eventUri": "eng-9790618", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-04", "textStart": 790, "textEnd": 798}], "sentiment": -0.003921568627450966, "wgt": 153, "relevance": 1}

HBO's live-action adaptation of Naughty Dog's video game was one of 2023's biggest TV shows, and up there with network greats like The Sopranos, True Detective, and Game of Thrones, was another certified banger.\n\nWhile we originally hoped The Last of Us Season 2 would be with us this year, HBO later confirmed our worst fears that the next run of episodes has been pushed to 2025. Hype has only continued to build with new castings and potential plans for four seasons, but now, we've finally got a look at Season 2.\n\nHBO has given us a quick peek at Season 2, with it packing a lot into its 22 seconds. We see Joel (Pedro Pascal) dealing with the aftermath of his lies that saved Ellie (Bella Ramsey) but potentially doomed the human race when he massacred the Fireflies.\n\nThe trailer features Joel speaking to Catherine O'Hara's mystery character, with the Beetlejuice star potentially being some kind of therapist. There's also newcomer Isabela Merced as Ellie's girlfriend, Dina, as well as Jeffrey Wright reprising his role as WLF leader, Isaac.\n\nEasily the biggest reveal of the trailer is the appearance of Booksmart's Kaitlyn Dever. In this blink-and-you'll-miss-it moment, we see Dever's Abby crawling through the snow, looking like a dead ringer for her video game counterpart. The casting of Abby was one of Season 2's big coups, especially as she's the main antagonist in the second game.\n\nGiven what we've seen in the trailer, it doesn't look like we'll get too far into the events of 2020's The Last of Us Part II, suggesting Abby might only appear in a minor capacity. Still, there's plenty of action, with Ellie involved in a tense subway scene from the games and Tommy (Gabriel Luna) defending Jackson with guns.\n\nWhile it's frustrating that we'll have to wait until next year for the abridged The Last of Us Season 2, the trailer has only hyped us further. As Season 1 was a faithful adaption of the first game but put its own spin on the source material, we're excited to see what showrunner Craig Mazin can do with the meatier Part II.", "source": {"uri": "ggrecon.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ggrecon.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HBO", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "HBO"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Last_of_Us", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "The Last of Us"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/True_Detective", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "True Detective"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naughty_Dog", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Naughty Dog"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Sopranos", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Sopranos"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Live_action", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Live action"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_of_Thrones", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Game of Thrones"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trailer_(promotion)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Trailer (promotion)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_game", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Video game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isabela_Merced", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Isabela Merced"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bella_Ramsey", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bella Ramsey"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeffrey_Wright", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jeffrey Wright"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catherine_O'Hara", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Catherine O'Hara"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pedro_Pascal", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pedro Pascal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beetlejuice_(TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Beetlejuice (TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaitlyn_Dever", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kaitlyn Dever"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Craig_Mazin", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Craig Mazin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gabriel_Luna", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gabriel Luna"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antagonist", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Antagonist"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Showrunner", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Showrunner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jackson,_Wyoming", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jackson, Wyoming"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Jackson, Wyoming"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Last_of_Us_Part_II", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Last of Us Part II"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Action", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Action", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Action-Adventure", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Action-Adventure", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Adventure", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Adventure", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Addictions/Games", "label": "dmoz/Health/Addictions/Games", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Entertaining/Baby_Showers", "label": "dmoz/Home/Entertaining/Baby Showers", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 88}], "image": "https://www.ggrecon.com/media/l55bzfso/the-last-of-us-season-2-trailer-shows-off-abby.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9790618", "eventUri": "eng-9790618", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.05882352941176472, "wgt": 152, "relevance": 1}

season three of The White Lotus and season two of The Last of Us.\n\nBoth shows are coming to Max next year, and are expected to be available to watch in the UK on Sky Atlantic.\n\nThe Last of Us - an adaptation of the zombie apocalypse video game - was a hit for the network when it was released in January last year, garnering critical acclaim and 24 nominations at the Emmy Awards.\n\nThe footage glimpsed in the preview shows the return of protagonists Pedro Pascal and Bella Ramsey as Joel and Ellie, respectively.\n\nAlso glimpsed in the 20-second snippet were Isabela Merced as Dina, Ellie's love interest, and Jeffrey Wright as Isaac, whom he previously lent his voice to in The Last of Us Part II video game.\n\nKathryn Dever is also seen for a split second in the role of Abby, and Catherine O'Hara in an unknown role that is yet to be confirmed.\n\nIn the trailer, O'Hara's character is seen asking Joel: \"Did you hurt her?\" seemingly referring to Ellie.\n\nJoel is then seen in tears, replying: \"I saved her.\" Fans of the game, however, will recall that Joel is supposed to address that line to his brother Tommy (portrayed by Gabriel Luna).\n\nPlayers of the game have remarked on how similar the visuals of season two look to scenes from the video game.\n\nThey have also urged viewers to prepare for an emotionally devastating second outing.\n\n\"Let me just say you're not f***ing ready for what's to come, arguably one of the hardest pills to swallow and I love every bit of it,\" said one person.\n\nFans of The White Lotus also got a peek at the hugely anticipated third season of Mike White's award-winning series, which is set in Thailand.\n\n\"What happens in Thailand stays in Thailand,\" one character is overheard saying in the snippet, which includes scenes set in luxurious hotels and a Muay Thai boxing ring.\n\nParker Posey, Jason Isaacs, Patrick Schwarznegger, Sarah Catherine Hook, and Sam Nivola all featured in the brief clip,

Players who have followed th eon screen performance of Pedro Pascal and Bella Ramsey as Joel and Ellie will soon get a second season of action. The follow up to the first instalment in The Last of US TV show just appeared in a new showreel for HBO's upcoming 2024-2025 season. Dropping alongside the likes of Game of Thrones, The Penguin, Dune: Prophecy, and more the tale only gets a few seconds of footage, but its telling.\n\nTaking place after the end of season one, this video game adaptation seems to return to the commune Joel and Ellie left us at. A brief flash of the snowy surroundings and mountainous territory suggest we will be back there. We also see a brief glimpse of Catherine O'Hara's character, although we don't know who that will be. Expect to find more undead, and morally grey choices alongside the established characters.\n\nThe Last of Us Season 2 is likely to follow the story behind the video game franchise from developer Naughty Dog. The second in this series is likely to provide much of the inspiration for this upcoming TV adaptation and confirms that it will land in 2025.

The second season does not cover the the entire game, is set to be shorter with 7 episodes, ending at a 'natural breaking point.' Fans are intrigued by how controversial narrative choices from the game will be presented in the show.\n\nAfter numerous image teases , HBO has released the first teaser trailer for The Last of Us Season 2. Set for release at some point in 2025, this second season will adapt a portion of the hit PlayStation game developed by Naughty Dog of the same name.\n\nThe first season of The Last of Us was a critical hit, winning 8 Primetime Emmys and one BAFTA among dozens of other nominations. Pedro Pascal's Joel Miller and Bella Ramsey's Ellie are set to return alongside Jeffrey Wright reprising his role from the game and Catherine O'Hara's unnamed character.\n\nRelated\n\nLike a Dragon: Yakuza is Amazon's next bet on game adaptations\n\nAmazon has announced it's next video game adaptation following Fallout's smash success.\n\nThe Last of Us Season 2 first look\n\nI saved her\n\nThe less than 30-second teaser was released by Max with the simple caption of \"I saved her.\" The trailer itself expands on this by showing O'Hera's character speaking to Pascal's Joel about what he did to Ellie, presumably at the end of the last season. He denies hurting her and claims to have saved her with a tear running down his face. Given the moral ambiguity of the ending of the first season, his reaction feels appropriate here.\n\nClips show numerous moments from the upcoming season out of context, including Ellie's tattoo, Tommy defending Jackson, Seraphites moving through the woods, Dina, Abbey, and more. Being a teaser, there's not much that can be gleaned about how far the story will go or in what ways it will or will not deviate from the source material. Some major moments appear to be direct comparisons to some early events in the game, but the quick editing makes it hard to know for sure if it will play out in the same way.\n\nWe already know that season 2 will not cover the entirety of The Last of Us Part 2, as stated by showrunners Craig Mazen and Neil Druckmann. Season 2 will be shorter than the first at only 7 episodes and end at a \"natural breaking point.\" Those who have played the game have already speculated where and how the season could naturally be divided.\n\nThe Last of Us Part 2 was the target of much controversy before and during release for a specific narrative choice made very early on. Without spoiling anything, those who have played the game are quite curious if and how the show will choose to present that event and how the narrative unfolds as a result of it.\n\nThe Last of Us season 2 is currently in development and set to release in 2025 exclusively on HBO Max.\n\nRelated\n\nWhat's new on Max in August (and what's leaving?)\n\nTo make sure you get max enjoyment out of your Max subscription, check out all the content coming and going this month.", "source": {"uri": "pocket-lint.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Pocket-lint"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jesse_lennox@pocket-lint.com", "name": "Jesse Lennox", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Last_of_Us", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "The Last of Us"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Mandalorian_(season_2)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "The Mandalorian (season 2)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trailer_(promotion)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Trailer (promotion)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primetime_Emmy_Awards", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Primetime Emmy Awards"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/What_If...?_(TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "What If...?

Ellie's intense moment of losing her fingers to Abby may not appear until later seasons. The show may alter the finger loss scene to avoid ongoing production challenges for Bella Ramsey.\n\nWith more episodes of The Last of Us on the way, the live-action adaptation will need to include a violent moment from the end of the second game, but it could complicate the show's future for a specific reason. The Last of Us season 2's cast combines familiar faces and newcomers to tell the next chapter of the story, which originated in 2020's The Last of Us Part II game. The conclusion of Part II features an upsetting sequence of events that are essential to one character's story, but will be tricky to adapt for practical reasons.\n\nThe Last of Us season 1's ending teased a continuation, but fans of the game series will have known there was still another installment to adapt. Part II is much longer than the first game, so it would be a struggle to fit the entire story into a single season of television. For that reason, it's highly likely that The Last of Us season 2 will only address some of the narrative from the second game and end on a compelling cliffhanger. If so, then one of Ellie's most intense moments may not appear until deeper into the show's run.\n\nRelated Complete The Last Of Us Season 1 Timeline (In Chronological Order)\n\nHBO's The Last of Us timeline for season 1 covers the beginning of the Cordyceps outbreak in 2003 up to 2024 after Ellie and Joel meet.\n\nThe Last Of Us TV Show Needs To Include Abby Taking Ellie's Fingers Abby bites off 2 of Ellie's fingers at the end of The Last of Us Part II\n\nThe ending of The Last of Us Part II forces Ellie into a violent conflict with Abby, during which she bites off Ellie's pinky and ring fingers of her left hand. While it's a grim moment, the full impact of the injury only becomes apparent during the game's epilogue. With Joel dying at the hands of Abby in the game's opening act, playing the guitar is the last connection Ellie has to her late father figure.\n\nAbby will be played by Kaitlyn Dever in The Last of Us season 2.\n\nSo, when she picks up the instrument in the game's closing moments, the fact Ellie is unable to play it due to lacking two fingers brings about the crushing realization that her blind quest for vengeance has cost her the skill taught to her by Joel - the very man she was trying to avenge by attacking Abby. There is an incredibly dark beauty to the moment, with the upsetting scene allowing the game to draw to the same uneasy ending as the initial entry into the game series. It'll be a huge loss if the show doesn't include this sequence.\n\nAbby & Ellie's Fight Might Not Happen Until The Last Of Us Season 3 (Or Later) The length of The Last of Us Part II may result in the conflict not making it into season 2 Close\n\nThe Last of Us Part II shows the perspectives of both Ellie and Abby, with the player controlling each character. To provide sufficient context and to allow the player the chance to realize that both women aren't that different, each of their stories takes hours to complete. Therefore, The Last of Us season 2 would be doing a disservice to the source material by trying to fit everything in. The most logical course of action would be to split it into two seasons instead.\n\nWith Abby taking Ellie's fingers right before the second game ends, it would make sense if the moment didn't happen in the coming season.\n\nWith Abby taking Ellie's fingers right before the second game ends, it would make sense if the moment didn't happen in the coming season and was instead reserved for near the end of The Last of Us season 3. Alternatively, two seasons may still not be enough to cover every event in the game, especially if the show continues to make as many additions to the games as it did during season 1. If so, then The Last of Us season 4 is a real possibility, and it could be the run to include Ellie's fight with Abby.\n\nThe Last of Us creator and co-showrunner Neil Druckmann has confirmed Naughty Dog is working on a third game, which could eventually serve as the basis for future seasons of the live-action adaptation.\n\nWhy HBO's The Last Of Us May Avoid This Moment Bella Ramsey's Ellie missing fingers could be a tricky thing to sustain\n\nAs important and artful as Ellie's upsetting guitar moment is, the fact she has to lose her fingers for it to happen may result in it being left out. Bella Ramsey's hand would need to have the ongoing appearance of missing fingers for the rest of the show's run, which could be a difficult challenge that would limit her portrayal of the character as well as present unnecessary production challenges. The Ellie avatar in the games can easily have this change made to her appearance, whereas Bella Ramsey cannot.\n\n2:20 Related New Last Of Us Set Photos All But Confirm How Much They're Covering In Season 2\n\nNew leaked photos from the set of HBO's The Last of Us all but confirm how much of the game will be covered in season 2 (and how faithful it'll be).\n\n3\n\nHowever, there could be an alternative. While Ramsey's Ellie may not lose her fingers to Abby's teeth, the moment with the guitar could be adapted to be altered so it still worked. When she returns to her and Dana's new family home, as she does in the games, Ramsey's Ellie could find that the guitar that once belonged to Joel has been damaged or destroyed when Dana left with her young son. It may not be quite as effective as the original versions of events, but it would create fewer problems with The Last of Us' TV future.\n\nThe Last Of Us 4.0 DramaHorrorAdventure Where to Watch streamrentbuy\n\nNot available\n\nNot available\n\nNot available\n\n*Availability in US\n\nBased on the critically acclaimed video game The Last of Us developed by Naughty Dog, the story of the TV series takes place twenty years after a parasitic fungal infection wreaks havoc across the world that turns humans into zombie-like creatures. Joel (Pedro Pascal) agrees to smuggle a 14-year-old girl named Ellie (Bella Ramsey) out of a quarantine zone, only to discover she may be the key to discovering a cure. The Last of Us TV series is a collaborative effort between one of the original creators, Neil Druckmann, and the creator of the award-winning HBO series Chernobyl.\n\nCast Pedro Pascal , Bella Ramsey

Pedro Pascal's Joel and Bella Ramsay's Ellie are present and accounted for as, too, is Gabriel Luna's Tommy.\n\nAmong the newcomers is Kaitlyn Dever's Abby (seen crouching under netting in a snowy landscape), Isabela Merced's Dina, and Jeffrey Wright, who is reprising his role as Washington Liberation Front leader Isaac.\n\nMost intriguing, though, is the interaction between Joel and a new, seemingly original character played by Catherina O'Hara.\n\nIn it, she asks Joel, \"What did you do?\" His emotional reply: \"I saved her.\" Yeah, we're gonna need the tissues for this one.\n\nThose familiar with the source material of Naughty Dog's critically acclaimed video game sequel will also be able to map out what exactly the second season will cover. No spoilers here, but the lit-up hall in Jackson, inclement wintry weather, and the inclusion of the Seraphite group indicates that - at the very least - the first half of The Last of Us Part 2 will be covered, including a hint at some crucial flashbacks as certain relationships fracture and others begin.\n\nAhead of the new season, Bella Ramsey praised the \"excellent\" new cast, which includes Young Mazino as Jesse, as well as their awkward first meeting with Kaitlyn Dever - presumably worlds apart from their upcoming interactions together as Ellie and Abby.\n\n\"I'm incredibly happy with who has been cast,\" Ramsey told GamesRadar+. \"It's exciting for me. I'm happy to have a whole new bunch of people come and join the family. It's gonna be a lot of fun.\"\n\nRamsey continued: \"I met Kaitlyn [at a gala] very briefly when we were waiting for our cars.

Though only a handful of shots from The Last of Us season 2 are revealed, among them is the first look at new cast member Kaitlyn Dever as Abby Anderson. Though a slew of set photos and videos have popped up online revealing The Last of Us season 2 characters, this marks the first time The Last of Us fans will have seen Abby Anderson in live-action.\n\nThough only one screen for a split-second, the first footage of Kaitlyn Dever as Abby in The Last of Us season 2 is something fans of The Last of Us Part II video game will immediately recognize. Dever's version of the character can be seen being pursued by infected, a horde of them pushing onto a fence and toppling it on top of her as she scrambles through the snow. This leads to a major moment in the video game itself which we won't reveal, but it shows how much of the 2020 video game will make it onto the screen in the second season of HBO's hit series.\n\nWhen news of Kaitlyn Dever's casting as Abby in The Last of Us season 2 hit, it came with some surprise considering the major physical differences in Abby and Ellie in The Last of Us Part II video game. By contrast, the Booksmart and No One Will Save You star was previously a fan-favorite to play Ellie when the potential of a The Last of Us adaptation was first flirted with by Hollywood. One person that was very excited to see Dever take the role is voice actor and performer Laura Bailey, who voiced and provided the motion capture for Abby in The Last of Us Part II.\n\n\"Huge congrats, Kaitlyn!,\" Bailey posted on X back in January. \"So excited to see Abby's evolution in your performance! Let me know if you want a workout buddy. \ud83d\udcaa\"\n\nBased on previous talk from The Last of Us creators about the TV series it seems very likely that Kaitlyn Dever will portray Abby not only in The Last of Us season 2 but in future seasons. It was previously confirmed that the second game is expected to be adapted into multiple seasons.\n\n\"Our focus is the two games,\" Neil Druckmann previously told Deadline. \"As Craig mentioned, there's quite a bit of material there that we're taking our time with, and we're looking at each piece individually to make sure it's got its own arc, its own journey that the characters go on, but there is a grander plan that ties all the seasons together.\"\n\nSeason 2 of HBO's The Last of Us has been confirmed to be just seven episodes, two shorter than season one's nine episode total.

A two-minute sizzle real released just before the House of the Dragon Season 2 finale Sunday night gave fins a glimpse at the popular titles set to premiere in 2024 and 2025, including the first teaser trailer for The Last of Us Season 2.\n\nAfter Season 1 ended with Joel (Pedro Pascal) saving Ellie (Bella Ramsey) from the Fireflies, Season 2 is expected to return in 2025 and focus on the events of The Last of Us Part II. Further details of the season remain unclear, but the brief teaser, released just a few months after HBO in May dropped first-look images of Joel and Ellie, hinted at an emotional seven-episode run as Joel spoke with Catherine O'Hara's unnamed character, who asked, \"Did you hurt her? Then what? What did you do?\" After glimpses at newcomer Isabela Merced as Dina, Jeffrey Wright as Isaac, and Gabriel Luna as Tommy, the trailer then cuts back to an emotional Joel, who says, \"I saved her.\"\n\nIn addition to Pedro, Ramsey and Luna, Season 2 will star Merced (Turtles All the Way Down), Wright (American Fiction) and O'Hara in a currently undisclosed role. Newcomer Kaitlyn Dever (No One Will Save You) is set to star as Abby, a revenge-seeking soldier, with the cast also featuring Young Mazino (Beef) as Jesse, Danny Ramirez (Top Gun: Maverick) as Washington Liberation Front member Manny, Ariela Barer (Runaways) as doctor Mel, Tati Gabrielle (You) as military medic Nora, and Spencer Lord (The Good Doctor) as WLF member Owen. O'Hara's character largely remains a mystery, though the trailer seems to hint that she may be a therapist of sorts.\n\nThe Last of Us is based on Naughty Dog's award-winning video game of the same name. Set 20 years after modern civilization has been destroyed by a mass fungal infection caused by a mutation in the genus Cordyceps, turning humans into cannibalistic creatures, the series centers around Joel and Ellie. A hardened survivor, Joel is hired to smuggle Ellie, a 14-year-old girl, out of an oppressive quarantine zone, but what begins as a small job soon becomes a brutal, heartbreaking journey.\n\nA co-production with Sony Pictures Television, The Last of Us is written and executive produced by Craig Mazin and Naughty Dog's Neil Druckmann. Carolyn Strauss, Jacqueline Lesko, Cecil O'Connor, Asad Qizilbash, Carter Swan, and Evan Wells also executive produce.

The introduction of the Seraphite threat earlier in the series can provide a balance to Ellie and Abby's stories. While the Seraphite cult story in TLOU 2 was backloaded, the TV series can remedy this by incorporating it sooner.\n\nHBO's first-look teaser for The Last of Us season 2 suggests the sophomore outing of the network's hit drama will fix a glaring villain problem from Naughty Dog's second game, The Last of Us Part II. Picking up in the wake of The Last of Us season 1, episode 9's ending, the second season will focus on the fallout from Joel's (Pedro Pascal) complicated decision at the Salt Lake City hospital. Realizing that the Fireflies intended to kill Ellie (Bella Ramsey) in order to find a cure to the Cordyceps infection, Joel slaughters everyone and escapes the hospital.\n\nIn the immediate aftermath, Joel lies to Ellie about what happened. The two keep Ellie's immunity under wraps, with only Joel's brother, Tommy (Gabriel Luna), knowing the truth. Eventually, Joel owns up to what really happened, causing friction between him and Ellie, who rightly feels that Joel took away her agency with his decision to choose her over a cure. In the beginning of TLOU 2, Joel is killed by Abby (Kaitlyn Dever), the daughter of a slaughtered doctor, setting Ellie's own revenge quest into motion. But Abby is far from the only \"villain\" in The Last of Us 2.\n\nHBO's The Last Of Us Needs To Introduce The Seraphite Threat Sooner\n\nThe Last Of Us Part 2's Seraphites Get A Bit Lost In The Core Ellie vs. Abby Plot\n\nClose\n\nAlthough it doesn't look like Catherine O'Hara will play the Seraphite Prophet after all, the Seraphites are still a substantial and compelling aspect of The Last of Us Part 2, and, by extension, the HBO show's second season. In the video game sequel, Ellie tracks Abby down to Seattle. A jaded Firefly who's broken by her father's death, Abby ends up joining a different group -- the Washington Liberation Front militia (WLF). As Ellie discovers upon arriving in Seattle, the WLF, FEDRA, and a mysterious group called the Seraphites once used the former city as a battleground.\n\nYears later, the Prophet is still worshiped by the zealous Seraphites.\n\nThe Seraphites become a massive threat as the game continues, especially in the last few acts, but the cult's story feels kind of backloaded. As Ellie (and, later, Abby) traverses Seattle, she sees hints of the Seraphites and their enigmatic leader. Sure enough, players piece together that the Seraphite Prophet emerged as a leader after FEDRA established Seattle as a Quarantine Zone (QZ). A surprisingly skilled fighter, the Prophet inspired others to live an egalitarian life without technology or pleasure, enabling her followers to build a self-sufficient commune. Years later, the Prophet is still worshiped by TLOU 2's Seraphites.\n\nRelated\n\nEllie's Tattoo In The Last Of Us Season 2 Explained\n\nIn The Last of Us Part II, Ellie boasts a fresh tattoo on her arm and, based on early footage, The Last of Us season 2 features her fern tattoo too.\n\nWhy The Seraphites Are Important In The Last Of Us Part 2\n\nThe Seraphite Prophet & Her Followers Serve As Antagonists To Both Ellie & Abby\n\nClose\n\nWith its inventive narrative structure, The Last of Us 2's timeline follows both Ellie, who wants revenge, and Abby, a soldier who gets her revenge but is pulled into a conflict between her militia and the Seraphite cult. The game features a chunk of Ellie's story first, using the Seattle setting to tease the WLF and Seraphite conflict, but the cult's presence grows once the player takes control of Abby. At one point, Abby's ex-boyfriend, Owen, is captured by the Seraphites while he's investigating the group's activity, prompting Abby to infiltrate the cult herself.\n\n...it would make sense for the series to remain faithful to the source material and include the ex-Seraphite siblings.\n\nAfter being captured herself, Abby is rescued by ex-Seraphite siblings Yara and Lev, who were branded traitors because of Lev's identity. Although she tries to forge ahead with her initial mission, Abby's story becomes irrevocably intertwined with Yara and Lev's throughout the rest of The Last of Us Part 2. While The Last of Us' cast of characters for season 2 has yet to be announced in full, it would make sense for the series to remain faithful to the source material and include the ex-Seraphite siblings. That said, the cult is crucial to the series' narrative.\n\nRelated\n\nThe Last Of Us Season 2 Trailer Suggests A Major Change To The Game's Timeline\n\nThe Last of Us season 2 trailer opens with Ellie at the Jackson dance, suggesting one of the game's final flashbacks will be bumped up to the start.\n\nTLOU2's Seraphite Story Could Have Been Better\n\nThe Seraphite Cult's Story Is Backloaded In The Last Of Us 2\n\nClose\n\nAlthough the Seraphite cult members make for compelling antagonists, the group's story could have been handled a bit better. There's no denying that TLOU 2 broke from tradition with its non-linear narrative and point-of-view swaps. While some players hated the idea of controlling the character responsible for Joel's death, the tactic is an incredibly effective one. Unfortunately, the need to front-load the game with Ellie's sections meant that Abby's story -- and, by extension, the Seraphites' -- was introduced a bit late. Thankfully, The Last of Us season 2's story seems to be remedying this issue.\n\nRelated\n\nLast Of Us Season 2's Ellie Update Debunks A Popular Theory With 1 Small Detail\n\nRecent photos captured of Ellie on the set of HBO's The Last of Us season 2 completely debunk a major theory about the direction the show is headed.\n\nThe Last Of Us 2's Religious Cult Can Help Break Up The Core Narrative\n\nAnother Threat Can Balance Out Ellie & Abby's Competing Stories\n\nClose\n\nWhile an earlier introduction would benefit the Seraphites -- and characters like Yara and Lev -- the third-party group could also help break up The Last of Us season 2's core narrative. Ellie's quest for revenge, and how her story echoes Abby's, is incredibly compelling, but it doesn't have enough weight to be stretched out into the four or more seasons HBO has planned for the show. Whether The Last of Us season 3 is solely Abby's point-of-view or not, the Seraphites are a crucial part of the narrative that, thankfully, are coming sooner than expected.\n\nThe Last of Us season 1 is streaming on Max.\n\nThe Last Of Us\n\n4.0\n\nDrama\n\nHorror\n\nAdventure\n\nWhere to Watch\n\nSeasonAllSeason 1\n\nstreamrentbuy\n\nNot available\n\nNot available\n\nNot available\n\nstreamrentbuy\n\nNot available\n\nNot available\n\nNot available\n\n*Availability in US\n\nBased on the critically acclaimed video game The Last of Us developed by Naughty Dog, the story of the TV series takes place twenty years after a parasitic fungal infection wreaks havoc across the world that turns humans into zombie-like creatures.

{"id": 227489552, "title": "Mary Earps injury: England star withdraws from Lionesses squad as replacement called up", "text": "England goalkeeper Mary Earps has withdrawn from the squad ahead of Tuesday's Euro 2025 qualifier against France. The Manchester United shotstopper was replaced after just seven minutes on what was her 50th appearance for the Lionesses. a hip injury ended her night early during Friday's 2-1 loss to France at Newcastle's St James' Park. Earps later left the stadium on crutches. She was replaced on the night by Chelsea's Hannah Hampton and Birmingham's Lucy Thomas has been called into the squad for Tuesday's trip to France. England claim that Earps' injury is \"minor\". Sarina Wiegman's side currently sit third in League A Group 3 with four points having won one of their opening three fixtures. The Lionesses are bidding to defend the Euros title they won two years ago and face a return fixture with France this Tuesday. The Lionesses need to finish in the top two positions in the group to automatically qualify for next summer's tournament in Switzerland. Wiegman said after their late loss to the French: \u201cI think our performance was good for most parts of the game. \"The result is really disappointing and I think unnecessary.\u201d She also added: \u201cThat was disappointing. In the second half we controlled the match more but created only \u2018almost\u2019 chances. So it was very frustrating to concede a goal from another set piece, another corner. \"We know France are very good at that and we really wanted to defend set pieces very well. In some moments we did but, in too many moments we didn\u2019t. It\u2019s really disappointing and it\u2019s very frustrating we missed some chances because normally we are very good at that.\" Earps was part of the team that enjoyed success at Wembley back in 2022 and excelled as the team made the World Cup final in Australia. She has just played every minute of United's Women's Super League campaign, one of only three players to do so alongside England compatriots Maya Le Tissier and Katie Zelem. Earps' current contract with United is set to expire next month, and discussions remain ongoing with club hierarchy over a possible extension. She's told Sky Sports: \"I've asked the club for some confirmation on what they're trying to achieve and when I have those answers I'll be able to make a decision. It's up to the club.\" Join our new WhatsApp community and receive your daily dose of Mirror Football content.

As he spoke, he touched on several key elements of Saints training camp including expectations around running back Alvin Kamara's involvement as he navigates a contract dispute with the team, newly-acquired defensive end Chase Young who is recovering from an offseason neck procedure and spoke on the team not having Southern California-based fans in attendance during their practice.\n\nHere are some of the can't-miss quotes and insights from Allen's presser to open camp:\n\nOn Alvin Kamara's expected participation: \"I expect Alvin to be out (on the field),\" Allen said quickly when asked about the star running back. \"He was out here today. He ran the conditioning test. Every indication that we've gotten is that he'll be out here practicing tomorrow.\" That is good news for the team that is bringing in an offense that Kamara should excel in. The team and Kamara have been having contract talks (which Allen declined to comment in detail on) this offseason and there was some reasonable belief that he may have held in while those conversations continued. However now it sounds like the team very much expects Kamara to be a part of practice day one.\n\nAllen added that the team does not expect Kamara to sit out of major portions of practices at this time.\n\nOn Chase Young's progress: Things look to be trending in the right direction for Young as he recovers from his offseason neck procedure. \"Chase Young will participate in some form of practice tomorrow,\" he said. Excellent news for the Saints and the biggest free agency addition in terms of name recognition. Allen gave a similar update on wide receiver Chris Olave, who was placed on the Non-Football Injury list last well. He announced that he would be participating on Wednesday, though they may limit him in an effort to be cautious around his back injury.\n\nOn players that will be out to start camp: With a few players on injury lists for the team, Allen highlighted who, aside from Young will end up missing at least the open of training camp practices. \"We have three players,\" Allen said. \"Tanoh (Kpassagnon), Nephi (Sewell) and Juwan Johnson. Those three players will not be practicing tomorrow.\" He would go on to confirm that he expects everyone else to have some form of presence and participation on Wednesday's opening day of camp.\n\nOn the offensive line: A new-look starting five will grace the field on the Saints' offensive line in 2024. Allen is excited by the young talent they have added to the team that will be look at to step up this year. \"Obviously we've got a couple of incumbent guys in Erik McCoy and Cesar Ruiz,\" he said. \"But I think that after that, there's a lot of jobs that are up for grabs.\" While the head coach does not feel that he can say who the starting five linemen will be Week 1, he does expect things to sort out clearly over the course of camp.\n\nOn relocating practice: The Saints moved practices from their team facilities in Metairie, Lou. this year due to renovations. Practice will now take place on campus at the University of California, Irvine. Allen spoke on both leaving their familiar facilities behind and the benefits of practicing in an environment that keeps the team close to one another. \"Obviously being away from home and away from our fans in New Orleans,\" he said. \"Obviously that's the tough part about being out here in California for this training camp.\" Among the reasons he listed included weather, the provided facilities, the team hotel. But it was about much more than just the digs.\n\n\"I'm excited about waht we can accomplish,\" he said. \"I think when you get into this type of environment, one of the things I think it allows you to do is that it allows you to push the guys (players) harder for longer. There's nothing easy about training camp.\" Allen also noted the diminishing returns that come from practicing in the harsh summer weather of the New Orleans area, which can potentially limit how much a team can go all out during training camp.\n\nOn fans not being present at practices in Irvine: With the relocation of camp, the Saints will not be opening up the practices to fans local to the area. A move that has drawn much criticism. While Allen is not the shot-caller for that kind of decision, he did still speak on the unfortunate circumstance. \"I always enjoy having fans at practice,\" he said. \"That's another change-up that I think envigorates our players. But that's one of the unique thing sabout being out here in Southern California. I think the league came out and said something about having to close these practices and in another market too. So that plays a factor in it.\"\n\nSuch a notion was discussed at an earlier press conference with team president Dennis Lauscha. He had expressed at the time that he was not aware of such an issue wherein the NFL would have rules about fans of out-of-market teams being in attendance at training camps that are happening in competing areas. However, recent reports reveal that the Saints and Las Vegas Raiders are indeed both being held to the league's undeniably needless limitation.", "source": {"uri": "si.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sports Illustrated"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alvin_Kamara", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Alvin Kamara"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dennis_Allen_(American_football)", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dennis Allen (American football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kei_Kamara", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kei Kamara"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Orleans_Saints", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New Orleans Saints"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_coach", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Head coach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chase_Young", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Chase Young"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lineman_(gridiron_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lineman (gridiron football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defensive_end", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Defensive end"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irvine,_California", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Irvine, California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Irvine, California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juwan_Johnson", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Juwan Johnson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Olave", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chris Olave"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erik_McCoy", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Erik McCoy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_agent", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Free agent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wide_receiver", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Wide receiver"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Las_Vegas_Raiders", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Las Vegas Raiders"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_California,_Irvine", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "University of California, Irvine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_California", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Southern California"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Orleans", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "New Orleans"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New Orleans"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metairie,_Louisiana", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Metairie, Louisiana"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Metairie, Louisiana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_crop,w_782,h_439,x_0,y_73/c_fill,w_1440,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/images/voltaxMediaLibrary/mmsport/saints_news_network/01j3gwqjc5537g4g2zbv.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9758116", "eventUri": "eng-9758116", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.05882352941176472, "wgt": 202, "relevance": 1}

Two big names who have been the subject of a lot of speculation are both going to be on the field: Alvin Kamara and Chase Young.\n\n\"Every indication that we've gotten is that he's going to be out here practicing tomorrow, so that's what we expect,\" Allen responded. \"We're looking forward to working with him, you know? I think having him out here, and having him practice, and having him work, that's beneficial for all of us. Obviously with the new system and new offense, I think that's important. And yet I think we all understand there's a business aspect to the game of football. But every indication that we've gotten is that he'll be out here practicing tomorrow.\"\n\nA conventional holdout would have been very expensive for Kamara, so it's not too surprising that he's reported for camp while negotiating a new deal with the Saints. The question is whether he'll limit his participating as a \"hold-in\" but it doesn't sound like that's something Allen is anticipating. Kamara's spot on top of the depth chart isn't as secure as you'd think given Kendre Miller's big-play potential, so it's important the veteran shows he's as great a fit in Klint Kubiak's offense as everyone hopes.\n\nAnd what about Young? The Saints' big free agent acquisition underwent neck surgery the day after he signed his one-year contract, but his recovery progressed better than expected, and he isn't going to miss any time at training camp after all. Allen added that while the Saints will monitor his reps out of an abundance of caution, he's going to be active for the first day of practice.\n\n\"Chase Young will participate in some form at practice tomorrow. We have three players, Tanoh (Kpassagnon), Nephi (Sewell), and Juwan Johnson, those three players will not be practicing tomorrow. Everybody else on the roster will be practicing in some form or fashion. Some maybe a little bit more limited coming off injury and things like that, but everybody else is going to be practicing tomorrow,\" Allen said.\n\nKpassagnon suffered an Achilles injury training this offseason and is likely out for the year, but that hasn't been confirmed yet. Sewell is still recovering from a knee injury he sustained during Dec. 31's win over the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. And Johnson is on the mend after requiring foot surgery in May.\n\nAllen confirmed that wide receiver Chris Olave may also be limited at practice while dealing with a back issue, but it's not serious and he's expected to take on a heavier workload as camp progresses.

But he was with the team when offseason activities resumed again this week and went through the conditioning test on Tuesday.\n\nAllen said that Kamara is fully healthy and said \"it's nothing that's been discussed\" when asked if Kamara would sit out any part of practice due to the contract issue.\n\n\"Having him out here, having him practice and having him work, I think that's beneficial for all of us,\" Allen said. \"Obviously with the new system and the new offense, that's important. I think we all understand there's a business aspect to the game of football, but every indication that we've gotten is that he'll be out here practicing tomorrow.\"\n\nKamara, who turns 29 this week, remains the only major contract the Saints did not restructure in 2024, which leaves his salary cap figure at a team-high $18.5 million.\n\nKamara's current contract was re-negotiated prior to the 2020 season after he missed five practices and runs through the 2025 season. Saints general manager Mickey Loomis declined to discuss specifics of any new contract negotiations, or whether he had talked to Kamara's representation following minicamp.\n\n\"I don't want to get into those kinds of conversations. It's nothing new. It's nothing about him,\" Loomis said. \" ... I'm not one that wants to put things out, or try to influence any negotiation through the media. I think if I have something to say, I say it directly to the agents and the player.\"\n\nIf the Saints do not address Kamara's salary this year, it would likely have to be addressed next year. Kamara's cap figure $29 million in the final year of his deal, largely due to his $22.4 million non-guaranteed base salary.\n\n\"I think one thing that ... you have to understand, and we have to understand is that, I'm going to be conservative here. I'd say 50% of our organization players, coaches, administrators, scouts feel like they're underpaid, right? And believe they deserve and want more money. And how each of us respond to that and act accordingly. You know, listen, it's just, that's a personal issue. And so, I appreciate that he's here,\" Loomis said.\n\nThe Saints will also open up training camp without veteran right tackle Ryan Ramczyk, who will not play this year after the Saints placed him on the season-ending reserve/physically unable to perform list. Ramczyk is dealing with cartilage problems in his knee that date back to the 2021 season.\n\n\"One of the things that doesn't get talked about is how often he went out there without being 100%. And just given everything he's got ... I know how badly he wants to play. And if there was any way possible, he would be playing,\" Loomis said. \"I just appreciate how ... much he's contributed to our team and hopeful that things can turn around. And with a year off, that his knee responds and he can get back out here for us.\"\n\nAllen said all parties involved initially felt optimistic about Ramczyk's progress following a procedure on his knee in the early part of the offseason. But Allen said when the knee did not respond to the surgery as everyone hoped, it became clear that playing in 2024 was unlikely.\n\n\"I think we got to a point where it was pretty obvious, in terms of his mindset being able to play,\" Allen said. \"And I think once the player comes to the realization that, 'Ah, I don't think I'm going to be ready,' then I think it just made sense for us to go ahead and make the move.\"\n\nAllen said that Ramczyk was disappointed but overall \"at peace\" with sitting out the season, but did not close the door on his playing career.\n\n\"I think we're going to leave all options open,\" Allen said. \"I don't think anything past this season is off the table.\"", "source": {"uri": "espn.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ESPN.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dennis_Allen_(American_football)", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dennis Allen (American football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kei_Kamara", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kei Kamara"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irvine,_California", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Irvine, California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Irvine, California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Olave", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chris Olave"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chase_Young", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chase Young"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alvin_Kamara", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Alvin Kamara"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Training_camp", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Training camp"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defensive_end", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Defensive end"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wide_receiver", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wide receiver"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Orleans_Saints", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New Orleans Saints"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mickey_Loomis", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mickey Loomis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salary_cap", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Salary cap"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_manager", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "General manager"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cap_(sport)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cap (sport)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "American football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tackle_(gridiron_football_position)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tackle (gridiron football position)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physically_unable_to_perform", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Physically unable to perform"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scout_(sport)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Scout (sport)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryan_Ramczyk", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ryan Ramczyk"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2023%2F1101%2Fr1246953_2_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9758116", "eventUri": "eng-9758116", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Irvine, California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.08235294117647052, "wgt": 191, "relevance": 1}

The change in venue was necessitated by the construction going on at the facility back home, but the hope is that the temperate weather -- as well as the relative isolation from the outside world -- will prove to be an advantage as the organization looks to snap a three-year playoff drought.\n\nThe first practice was a short one, lasting roughly 90 minutes from the start of the stretching period to the final whistle. Here is a rundown of the most important things to come out of New Orleans' first day of camp.\n\nAttendance and injuries\n\nEveryone who did not start the season on the Physically Unable to Perform list was in uniform and on the practice field Wednesday. Additionally, injured players Tanoh Kpassagnon (Achilles) and Juwan Johnson (foot) were present as spectators while they rehabilitate their injuries.\n\nNew Orleans did not get out of the practice completely unscathed, though. Second-year running back Kendre Miller walked off the field with a trainer just minutes into the individual practice with a hamstring injury, and backup offensive tackle Justin Herron left with a knee injury.\n\nAfter practice, coach Dennis Allen did not mince words when speaking about Miller, who endured a disappointing rookie season that included multiple injuries.\n\n\"That's a player that's going to have to figure out how to stay healthy because it's hard to make the team from the training room,\" Allen said.\n\nThe Saints used the No. 71 pick on Miller in last year's draft. He entered training camp in a competition with veteran Jamaal Williams for the No. 2 running back job.\n\nLineup notes\n\nIt's not worth reading too much into who slotted where when the first- and second-team units lined up Wednesday. The whole point of training camp is to determine who the team will count on throughout the season. But it is good to take note of where things stand on Day 1 to see how it changes throughout camp.\n\nAlong the offensive line, the Saints kept their same lineup from this summer: Taliese Fuaga at left tackle, Nick Saldiveri at left guard, Erik McCoy at center, Cesar Ruiz at right guard and Trevor Penning at right tackle. It is worth noting that offseason signing Oli Udoh, who did not participate in team drills during the offseason program, took snaps as the second-team right tackle.\n\nDefensively, the Saints primarily lined up in their base look -- meaning four defensive linemen, three linebackers and four defensive backs.\n\nNathan Shepherd and Khalen Saunders took first-team snaps -- which was not surprising, considering both of them started all 17 games last year -- while Bryan Bresee and rookie Khristian Boyd worked with the second team.\n\nVeteran Johnathan Abram handled the first team reps at strong safety with Jordan Howden slotting in behind him. Alontae Taylor and Kool-Aid McKinstry backed up Paulson Adebo and Marshon Lattimore at corner, though both Taylor and McKinstry figure to compete for the starting nickel corner job.\n\nYoung participates\n\nAs expected, defensive end Chase Young made his practice debut with the team Wednesday. And, as the Saints said would be the case, they brought Young along slowly.\n\nThe veteran defensive end, who signed a one-year free agent contract with New Orleans this offseason, slotted in behind starters Cam Jordan and Carl Granderson during the individual period, but did not participate in full team drills.\n\nYoung certainly looks the part, and he has shown in the past that he is capable of being a game-wrecking force off the edge. New Orleans will be careful not to push him too hard in his recovery from offseason neck surgery, so it will likely take some time before Young is going full speed against his teammates.\n\nOdds and ends\n\nNew Orleans ran two periods of full-team drills. The first period was run-focused, while the second featured a lot of short passes. On the first play of the second period, quarterback Derek Carr threw a pass directly to Demario Davis, who caught it and returned it for a touchdown. Outside of that play, Carr completed his other three attempts in the period.\n\nOne of those completions was a nifty-looking screen pass to Alvin Kamara. The play started with Kamara in the backfield, then he motioned to the right side of the field. At the snap, Kamara turned his head and caught the screen, then followed his blocks for a nice gain. New offensive coordinator Klint Kubiak is bringing a steady diet of motion into this offense.\n\nKicker Blake Grupe connected on each of his eight field goal attempts, though all of them appeared to come from 35 yards or closer.", "source": {"uri": "nola.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NOLA"}, "authors": [{"uri": "luke_johnson@nola.com", "name": "Luke Johnson", "type": "author", "isAgency":

This trend seems to have continued as well, with second-year running back Kendre Miller suffering a hamstring injury during Wednesday's training camp practice. According to Katherine Terrell of ESPN, he went into the training tent and did not return once that occurred.\n\nMiller dealt with leg issues all of last season as a rookie. He missed time with a patella sprain, grade one hamstring sprain, and pedal ankle sprain at different points throughout the season. This led to him only playing in eight games during his rookie year, with only 41 rush attempts and 11 times targeted. He was still recovering from a knee injury when the Saints drafted him out of TCU.\n\nDennis Allen's take on Miller's hamstring injury was pointed after practice: \"Look, that's a player that's going to have to figure out how to stay healthy. Because it's hard to make the team when you're in the training room all the time.\"\n\nIt has been a tough road for Miller to this point in his career, no doubt, and hopefully things turn around and this is not a lingering injury for the short term future. As of right now, the Saints depth chart at running back seems relatively short with this news:\n\nThere are a few options available in free agency as training camp bodies as well if that ends up being a need. Lynn Bowden Jr. and Eno Benjamin are both available and were on the roster last summer, as is Kareem Hunt who was a reported target for the Saints last year. We will see how this plays out, hopefully it is just a minor injury and Miller gets back out there quickly without issue.

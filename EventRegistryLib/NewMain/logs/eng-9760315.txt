Red Bull have opted for an engine change after a string of tough races for the defending champ - with fans eagerly anticipating the outcome. Despite setbacks, Verstappen's history of making comebacks from low grid positions gives hope for another stunning race result.\n\nFormula 1's defending champion Max Verstappen is expected to receive yet another setback in the shape of a 10-place grid penalty for this weekend's Grand Prix. After experiencing some woes with his power units this season, his engine allowance exceedance is anticipated, seeing a less than ideal starting position for this weekend's Spa-Francorchamps Belgian Grand Prix.\n\nF1 rules indicate that drivers can only use a certain number of engines per season, which currently stands at four, and exceeding this limit will result in a 10-place grid penalty. Verstappen's car lost a power unit back in June's Canadian Grand Prix despite branding a fresh third engine, forcing Red Bull to use his forth and final engine for the Spanish Grand Prix.\n\nAfter suffering another frustrating race in last weekend's Hungarian Grand Prix, which made it three consecutive races without a win, the world champion will see a 10-place grid penalty this weekend as Red Bull have decided to take the hit, Sky Sports have reported.\n\nRelated Nico Rosberg's Reaction to Max Verstappen Blaming Lewis Hamilton for Crash\n\nSky Sports pundit and former Lewis Hamilton teammate Nico Rosberg was quick to put Max Verstappen in his place for the Hungary GP collision.\n\n1 What's Been Said About Max Verstappen for Belgian GP\n\n\"We have heard nothing officially from the team, but I have spoken to individuals with a window on this situation,\" said Craig Slater, Sky Sports' F1 expert.\n\n\"It is a particularly stiff test at the moment. He sounded embattled and frustrated on the team radio in the last race in Hungary and that is because other cars are the Red Bull's match at the moment.\n\n\"Red Bull will revert to a previous spec of car, aerodynamically at least - the set-up at the Hungarian Grand Prix was particularly to deal with the twists and turns of that circuit. It is an efficient car, the Red Bull, at high speed on straight-line circuits like Spa, so maybe they think there is still enough performance to come through the field,\" Slater concluded.\n\nThe 2024 Formula 1 Season\n\nThis year's race for the title is a hot contest - more so than previous years, which saw Verstappen's dominance rule out room for title-place rivalries. This year sees the Dutchman leading McLaren's Lando Norris by 76 points - a gap Red Bull will be eyeing after McLaren's commanding performance in Hungary that landed them first and second on the podium.\n\n\"Does he face losing more of that cushion he has to Norris at the top of the drivers' standings?\" Slater asked - a thought that will certainly be running through the thoughts of many in and around the F1 circuit.\n\nSeeing a grid penalty won't be Verstappen's first time seeking top spot from a setback. Back in 2022, he won a race from 14th place, and in 2023, he won from a starting position of sixth.\n\nRed Bull's principal, Christian Horner, previously weighed-up speculation that an engine change would be coming imminently.\n\n\"We'll have to see how it plays out over the coming races,\" he said back in June. \"But I think it's inevitable that we'll take the next engine at some point.\"\n\nF1 fanatics will be left on the edge of their seats, anticipating Red Bull's next advance in a move that could prove make-or-break for Verstappen's momentum.", "source": {"uri": "givemesport.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "GiveMeSport"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_Verstappen", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Max Verstappen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Bull", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Red Bull"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sky_Sports", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Sky Sports"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formula_One", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Formula One"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hungarian_Grand_Prix", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hungarian Grand Prix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belgian_Grand_Prix", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Belgian Grand Prix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Prix_motorcycle_racing", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Grand Prix motorcycle racing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nico_Rosberg", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nico Rosberg"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circuit_de_Spa-Francorchamps", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Circuit de Spa-Francorchamps"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lewis_Hamilton", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lewis Hamilton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hungary", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hungary"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Hungary"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canadian_Grand_Prix", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Canadian Grand Prix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_Grand_Prix", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Spanish Grand Prix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lando_Norris", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lando Norris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_Horner", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Christian Horner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McLaren", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "McLaren"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netherlands", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Auto_Racing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Auto Racing", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Motorsports", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Motorsports", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Automotive/Auto_Racing", "label": "dmoz/Business/Automotive/Auto Racing", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Rodeo/Bullriding", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Rodeo/Bullriding", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://static0.givemesportimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/mixcollage-25-jul-2024-07-12-am-5502.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9760315", "eventUri": "eng-9760315", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1686274509803922, "wgt": 201, "relevance": 1}

I am very driven to succeed.\n\n\"People can argue that I might not be so vocal on the radio, but that is their opinion and my opinion is that it might have needed to have been said at the time.\n\n\"We are very open-minded and very critical to each other as a team and that has worked well, so I don't expect that to change.\n\n\"It was quite clear that the strategy was wrong. I am very driven and I want to be perfect. If things are not going how they should be, it is quite normal to show your frustration.\n\n\"As a team we learn from it and move on. It is important that we can be critical. In this world, people cannot take criticism like it used to be and I don't want to end up like that.\"\n\nVerstappen, 26, looked on course to waltz to his fourth straight title after he won seven of the opening 10 rounds.\n\nBut he is winless from his last three appearances - the first time that has happened in two-and-a-half years - while McLaren dominated at the Hungaroring.\n\nLando Norris is 76 points adrift of Verstappen with 11 races still remaining.\n\nVerstappen was up beyond 3am on the morning of last Sunday's race as he took part in a sim-racing event inside his motorhome at the circuit.\n\nNico Rosberg, the 2016 world champion, described Verstappen's extra-curricula activity as \"disappointing\", while Red Bull motorsport adviser Helmut Marko suggested the team want to draw a line under their star driver's sim-racing career.\n\nBut Verstappen added: \"I raced until 3am and it is not something new in my life. If you don't win the race, it can be blamed on staying up until 3am or being one kilo overweight, but in Imola I won both (the Grand Prix and a sim race).\n\n\"I have been doing this since 2015. I have won three World Championships, so I know what I can and cannot do and I know myself what is allowed and what is not.\n\n\"We talked about it and I said, 'You don't need to worry'.

This penalty comes as a result of adding a fourth Honda power unit to his car, surpassing the FIA's limit of three power units per driver per season.\n\nThe three-time champion's penalty stems from ongoing engine challenges, notably a power unit failure during the Canadian Grand Prix in June. In response, the Austrian team opted to introduce a new power unit, inadvertently crossing the season's permitted allocation. Sky Sports reports that Red Bull has strategically elected the Spa-Francorchamps circuit for this grid penalty due to its favorable overtaking opportunities, potentially diminishing the impact on Verstappen's performance.\n\nThe current 2024 Drivers' Championship leader, Verstappen holds a substantial 76-point lead over McLaren's Lando Norris. Despite his dominance, Verstappen has not claimed victory in the last three races leading up to the Belgian Grand Prix. His track record at Spa, however, is impressive, with victories in both 2022 and 2023 under challenging conditions.\n\nSky Sports' Craig Slater provided insights into the situation, commenting:\n\n\"We have heard nothing officially from the team but I have spoken to individuals with a window on this situation.\n\n\"It is a particularly stiff test at the moment.

I'm very driven to success thing. I've proven that already,\" said Verstappen.\n\n\"I always want to optimise stuff. People can argue that you might not be so vocal on the radio, but that's their opinion.\n\n\"My opinion is that it needs to be said at the time to maybe also try and force that the second bits would have been a bit different. That's how it goes.\n\n\"We are very open-minded. We are very critical of each other as a team, and that's been working for us very well, so I don't expect that to change.\"\n\nWhen asked that other drivers don't speak to their team how he does, Verstappen responded: \"That's our approach. It's important that you can be critical. In this world we live in now, I think a lot of people can't take criticism very well like it used to be and I don't want to end up like that.\"\n\nVerstappen and Lambiase have experienced a very straightforward relationship, with the pair working together since the Dutchman joined Red Bull in 2016.\n\nThe three-time world champion pointed out that he is quick to praise the team when they do well but also when he's not happy with something, as he did in Hungary.\n\nVerstappen also thinks F1 is unique because everyone can hear what a driver says on the radio, whereas other sports don't have that level of access.\n\n\"In other sports, people say things but they don't have a mic attached to their mouth,\" he explained.\n\n\"But I don't care. I say what I want. That's our sport as well. You are communicating with the pit wall.\n\n\"In other sports, maybe you swear about stuff you didn't like or a team-mate didn't pass the ball and you call them whatever, but there is no mic. That's just our sport I guess.\"\n\nVerstappen was also criticised for taking part in the iRacing Spa 24 Hours until 3am on Sunday morning ahead of the Hungarian Grand Prix.\n\nRed Bull advisor Helmut Marko revealed Verstappen had agreed to not compete in sim races on the night before a race, but the 26-year-old says there were no more sim events planned for the rest of the year anyway.\n\n\"I said you don't need to worry because there are no more races coming up. It's not that I have a ban or whatever. I don't tell them what they do in their private time or during weekends, and that's the same to me,\" said Verstappen.\n\n\"I raced until 3am, it's not something new. For me, it's something that's very important in my life but there are no other sim races coming up anyway.\n\n\"When you lose the race, you will always blame, 'Oh you were staying up until 3am' or 'You were 1kg overweight'. There are always things to make up or argue about.\n\n\"For example, in Imola, I won both of the races. For me, this is nothing new. I've been doing this since 2015. So for me, this is not something that is any different in my progression.\n\n\"I've won three World Championships. I think I know pretty well, what I can and what I cannot do. I'm always very hard on myself, what is allowed and isn't allowed.

Sign up here to receive the Prime Tire newsletter in your inbox every Tuesday and Friday.\n\nSPA, Belgium -- Formula One world champion Max Verstappen says Red Bull has not banned him from sim racing during grand prix weekends as he knows \"pretty well what I can and what I cannot do.\"\n\nVerstappen stayed up until 3 a.m. on Sunday ahead of the Hungarian Grand Prix to participate in an online race with his sim racing team, Team Redline. (The grand prix began at 3 p.m. local time.) He is an avid sim racer, regularly enters major events and has a rig installed in the motorhome he uses to travel to F1 races across Europe.\n\nThe decision to stay up so late drew scrutiny from some pundits (most notably, on Sky Sports' broadcast) during a difficult Hungarian Grand Prix. During the race, Verstappen expressed frustration over Red Bull's strategy calls and then clashed with Lewis Hamilton, leaving him to finish fifth place.\n\nIn a post-Hungary column for the Red Bull-owned website Speed Week, Red Bull adviser Helmut Marko said it was \"no wonder\" criticism had arisen given the result and that the team had agreed with Verstappen that he would \"no longer run simulations so late in the future.\"\n\nOn Thursday at Spa, Verstappen said sim racing so late was \"not something new\" for him and that sim racing was \"something very important in my life.\"\n\nHe denied that Red Bull had imposed any ban or curfew but said there were no other races coming up, so they \"don't need to worry.\"\n\n\"It's not like I have a ban or whatever,\" Verstappen said. \"I also don't need to tell them what they do in their private time and during the weekends. That's the same for me.\"\n\nVerstappen pointed out that he had stayed up late during the Emilia Romagna Grand Prix weekend at Imola in May to take part in the virtual N\u00fcrburgring 24-hour race, one of the biggest events on the sim racing calendar. He still took pole and won the race at Imola, and was part of the victorious four-person crew in the virtual event.\n\n\"It's always when you don't win the race, you will blame it on, 'Ah, you were staying up until 3 a.m., oh he's one kilo overweight,'\" Verstappen said. \"There is always things to make up that you know you can argue about when you don't win a race. But for example, at Imola, I do win the race, both of them. So, for me, this is not something new. I've been doing this since 2015.\n\n\"This is not something that is any different in my preparation. I've won three world championships. I think I know pretty well what I can and what I cannot do, and I'm always very hard on myself what is allowed and isn't allowed.\n\n\"I think with all the experience that I have in Formula One, I think I know quite well what is possible.\"\n\nVerstappen also faced questions about his radio messages to his race engineer, Gianpiero Lambiase, during the Hungarian Grand Prix. The driver regularly questioned the team's strategy calls after being undercut twice in the pits.\n\nVerstappen said after the grand prix that he felt annoyed with the strategy during the race and that critics who suggested he was disrespectful toward the team could \"f -- off.\"\n\nLooking back on Hungary on Thursday, Verstappen felt it was \"quite clear the strategy was wrong\" from the team and that he was \"very driven\" to succeed.\n\nHe said if people did not like his language, then \"don't listen in, turn the volume down,\" and he did not anticipate any changes in his approach going forward.\n\n\"We are very open-minded, very critical of each other, and that's been working for us very well,\" Verstappen said. \"So I don't expect that to change. That's our approach.\n\n\"I think it's important you can be critical because in this world we are living now, I feel anyway a lot of people can't take criticism anymore like it used to be, and I don't want to end up like that.\"\n\nVerstappen said that he and Lambiase would discuss what happened in Hungary \"like we always do\" once his engineer arrives at the track on Thursday but that it was \"quite normal\" to look back on events.\n\nVerstappen's frustration in Hungary reflected the growing pressure on him and Red Bull at the front of the F1 pack, given the recent rise of Norris and McLaren, which now appears to have the fastest car despite trailing in the early part of the season.\n\nVerstappen's former title rival, Hamilton, shared his thoughts on how to deal with experiencing a mid-season drop in car performance, saying: \"You have to be a team leader, a team member.\n\n\"Maybe not so much a team leader, but more so just always remember you are a teammate with lots of people, and you have to act like a world champion.\"\n\nAsked what that is, Hamilton laughed and replied: \"That's a good question. Not like it was last weekend.\"\n\nVerstappen knows his championship lead over Lando Norris will drop further at Spa as he is set to serve a 10-place grid penalty for exceeding the season's allocation of engines.\n\nThe Dutchman said it was \"likely\" he'd take the penalty here, given the ease of overtaking, but he doubted victory was possible - unlike the past two years, where he won despite a grid drop.\n\n\"If you look at our last few races where we haven't particularly been the fastest, I wouldn't say that with 10 places extra, we have a chance of winning,\" he said.", "source": {"uri": "nytimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New York Times"}, "authors": [{"uri": "luke_smith@nytimes.com", "name": "Luke Smith", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hungarian_Grand_Prix", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hungarian Grand Prix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sim_racing", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sim racing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Bull", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Red Bull"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formula_One", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Formula One"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imola", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Imola"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Imola"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_Verstappen", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Max Verstappen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helmut_Marko", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Helmut Marko"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sky_Sports", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sky Sports"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lewis_Hamilton", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lewis Hamilton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Europe"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spa,_Belgium", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Spa, Belgium"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Spa, Belgium"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Belgium"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gianpiero_Lambiase", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gianpiero Lambiase"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emilia_Romagna_Grand_Prix", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Emilia Romagna Grand Prix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Race_engineer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Race engineer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N\u00fcrburgring", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "N\u00fcrburgring"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circuit_de_Spa-Francorchamps", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Circuit de Spa-Francorchamps"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hungary", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hungary"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Hungary"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lando_Norris", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lando Norris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McLaren", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "McLaren"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netherlands", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Auto_Racing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Auto Racing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Adventure_Racing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Adventure Racing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Karting", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Karting", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Snowmobile_Racing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Snowmobile Racing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://cdn.theathletic.com/app/uploads/2024/07/25120336/GettyImages-2163613888-scaled.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9760315", "eventUri": "eng-9760315", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1294117647058823, "wgt": 188, "relevance": 1}

I am very driven to succeed.\n\n\"People can argue that I might not be so vocal on the radio, but that is their opinion and my opinion is that it might have needed to have been said at the time.\n\n\"We are very open-minded and very critical to each other as a team and that has worked well, so I don't expect that to change.\n\n\"It was quite clear that the strategy was wrong. I am very driven and I want to be perfect. If things are not going how they should be, it is quite normal to show your frustration.\n\n\"As a team we learn from it and move on. It is important that we can be critical. In this world, people cannot take criticism like it used to be and I don't want to end up like that.\"\n\nVerstappen, 26, looked on course to waltz to his fourth straight title after he won seven of the opening 10 rounds.\n\nBut he is winless from his last three appearances - the first time that has happened in two-and-a-half years - while McLaren dominated at the Hungaroring.\n\nLando Norris is 76 points adrift of Verstappen with 11 races still remaining.\n\nVerstappen was up beyond 3am on the morning of last Sunday's race as he took part in a sim-racing event inside his motorhome at the circuit.\n\nNico Rosberg, the 2016 world champion, described Verstappen's extra-curricula activity as \"disappointing\", while Red Bull motorsport adviser Helmut Marko suggested the team want to draw a line under their star driver's sim-racing career.\n\nBut Verstappen added: \"I raced until 3am and it is not something new in my life.

Although the drama on the team radio put McLaren in the spotlight, their one-two has brought them a step closer to Red Bull and Max Verstappen in both championships, and it delivered a thriller for everyone else.\n\nMichael Schumacher won at Spa six times, but only took pole position once. So given the circuit's history of pole position to win conversions (or rather, a lack of), and some potential engine changes for a few drivers, it feels like the Belgian Grand Prix has arrived at the right point to deliver another competitive race.\n\nThe weather forecast is showing highs of between 19-21\u00b0C, showers across Friday and Saturday, but calm and dry for Sunday.\n\nDig in to the analysis from Hungary -- did Lando Norris' defiance overshadow Piastri's maiden F1 win? And does McLaren's resurgence put Max Verstappen under pressure?\n\nMcLaren's disappointing decisions with Norris and Piastri. Plus Belgian GP preview | Listen to the latest podcast episode.\n\nSpa-Francorchamps remains one of the most iconic F1 circuits and a favourite of fans and drivers alike. It's one of seven circuits that was part of F1's inaugural season in 1950. Bar two years, it has hosted every Belgian Grand Prix since 1985.\n\nSpa shares similar surroundings to the Austrian Grand Prix mountains with forests and hills of the Ardennes region. The circuit, which sweeps through the forest, has everything you could want: elevation changes, overtaking opportunities and highly unpredictable weather.\n\nIt features the famous Eau Rouge corner, for a long time renowned as one of the toughest corners in F1.\n\nMost wins: Schumacher has the most wins at Spa with six (1992, 1995-1997, 2001-2002), Ayrton Senna is just one behind. Of the current drivers, Lewis Hamilton (2010, 2015, 2017, 2020), Daniel Ricciardo (2014), Charles Leclerc (2019), Verstappen (2021-2023) have all won here.\n\nMost poles: Incredibly, Schumacher has just one pole here, while Hamilton has the most with six (2008, 2013, 2015, 2017-2018, 2020). Of the current drivers, Verstappen (2021), Leclerc (2019, 2023), Carlos Sainz (2022) have all been on pole here.\n\nAfter winning the sprint race on Saturday, Verstappen started from sixth position after getting a new gearbox fitted. It didn't matter -- the Dutchman beat teammate Sergio Perez by a comfortable 22 seconds.\n\nLeclerc, who had started on pole, finished third for Ferrari.\n\nThis track suits Red Bull more than the Hungaroring did, but Verstappen might face a 10-place grid drop if the team decides to make a long-awaited engine change in his car.\n\nThat might shift the advantage to Mercedes, who are likely to thrive, while we know McLaren has a car for all circuits now.\n\nAs we've become used to lately, it should be a wide open fight for the win.", "source": {"uri": "espn.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "ESPN.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oscar_Piastri", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Oscar Piastri"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circuit_de_Spa-Francorchamps", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Circuit de Spa-Francorchamps"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formula_One", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Formula One"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McLaren", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "McLaren"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_Verstappen", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Max Verstappen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belgian_Grand_Prix", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Belgian Grand Prix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pole_position", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Pole position"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hungary", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Hungary"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Hungary"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Schumacher", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Michael Schumacher"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Bull", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Red Bull"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lando_Norris", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lando Norris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Leclerc", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Charles Leclerc"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Austrian_Grand_Prix", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Austrian Grand Prix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ardennes", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ardennes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lewis_Hamilton", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lewis Hamilton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlos_Sainz_Sr.", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Carlos Sainz Sr."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hungaroring", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hungaroring"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sergio_P\u00e9rez", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sergio P\u00e9rez"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ayrton_Senna", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ayrton Senna"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Ricciardo", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Daniel Ricciardo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercedes-Benz", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mercedes-Benz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scuderia_Ferrari", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Scuderia Ferrari"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netherlands", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Auto_Racing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Auto Racing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Motorsports", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Motorsports", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Karting", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Karting", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Device_Drivers", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Device Drivers", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 96}], "image": "https://a2.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2024%2F0724%2Fr1362595_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9760315", "eventUri": "eng-9760315", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2862745098039217, "wgt": 179, "relevance": 1}

However, he defended his actions:\n\n\"People that don't like my language, don't listen in or turn the volume down. I'm very driven to succeed. I've proven that already,\" said Verstappen.\n\n\"I always want to optimise stuff. People can argue that you might not be so vocal on the radio, but that's their opinion. My opinion is that it needs to be said at the time to maybe also try and force that the second bits would have been a bit different. That's how it goes.\"\n\nVerstappen emphasised the importance of being critical within the team: \"We are very open-minded. We are very critical of each other as a team, and that's been working for us very well, so I don't expect that to change.\"\n\nWhen asked why other drivers don't speak to their teams the way he does, Verstappen responded: \"That's our approach. It's important that you can be critical. In this world we live in now, I think a lot of people can't take criticism very well like it used to be and I don't want to end up like that.\"\n\nVerstappen and Lambiase have had a straightforward relationship since the Dutchman joined Red Bull in 2016. The three-time world champion noted that he praises the team when they do well but is also vocal when something displeases him, as seen in Hungary.\n\nVerstappen also highlighted the unique transparency of F1, where radio communications are publicly accessible: \"In other sports, people say things but they don't have a mic attached to their mouth,\" he explained.\n\n\"But I don't care. I say what I want. That's our sport as well. You are communicating with the pit wall. In other sports, maybe you swear about stuff you didn't like or a team-mate didn't pass the ball and you call them whatever, but there is no mic. That's just our sport, I guess.\"", "source": {"uri": "businessday.ng", "dataType": "news", "title": "Businessday NG"}, "authors": [{"uri": "anthony_nlebem@businessday.ng", "name": "Anthony Nlebem", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gianpiero_Lambiase", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gianpiero Lambiase"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_Verstappen", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Max Verstappen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hungarian_Grand_Prix", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hungarian Grand Prix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belgian_Grand_Prix", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Belgian Grand Prix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engineer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Engineer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lewis_Hamilton", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lewis Hamilton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Bull", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Red Bull"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formula_One", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Formula One"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netherlands", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hungary", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hungary"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Hungary"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Romance", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Romance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 89}], "image": "https://cdn.businessday.ng/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Max-Verstappen.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9760315", "eventUri": "eng-9760315", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.0117647058823529, "wgt": 178, "relevance": 1}

Many believed that it was a result of lack of sleep due to a late-night sim race for his Team Redline which forced him to stay up till 3 AM.\n\nAs a result, there have been plenty of reports suggesting that Red Bull has now banned Verstappen from taking part in sim races before a Grand Prix event. However, the Dutchman has now confirmed that there is no such ban on his sim racing.\n\nFollowing the race in Hungary, Helmut Marko explained as per a report from racefans.net that the team has spoken to Verstappen about the situation and both parties have come to a mutual agreement that the Dutchman would not take part in sim-racing during the Grand Prix weekends. However, Verstappen's recent comments suggest otherwise.\n\n\"No, it's not like I have a ban,\" Verstappen was quoted in a report from De Telegraaf. \"We talked about it and I said they don't have to worry because there's no sim race on the schedule for a while. But I also don't have to tell them what they can do in their private time during a race weekend.\"\n\nThe 26-year-old then even mocked his team recently during a livestream when there were talks about one of the members having a night out. As per a post on X, the Dutchman jokingly said, \"Not me of course. I was tucked into bed by 9.\"\n\nVerstappen also explained that the 24 Hours of Spa-Francorchamps sim-race had no effect on his preparation for the Hungarian Grand Prix and that he had gotten more than seven hours of sleep, which is plenty for him. He then revealed that he also followed a similar routine during the Emilia Romagna Grand Prix weekend, a race that he won.\n\nVerstappen then stated that no one criticized him for taking part in sim racing when he was winning F1 races. Verstappen stressed his point by saying that he has been managing sim racing alongside his F1 career since 2015 and has won three championships during that time, so he knows how to balance the two.\n\nInterestingly, Marko revealed that the night before the Hungarian GP, Verstappen had to stay up till 3:00 am because one of his teammates from Team Redline had dropped out of the sim race.

I don't care, I say what I want, but that's our sport naturally. You communicate a lot with the pit wall, you have the opportunity to talk.\n\n\"Maybe in other sports, you swear to yourself about stuff that you didn't like, a teammate didn't pass the ball, you call them whatever it is, there is no mic, just how our sport is I guess.\"\n\nVerstappen also responded to criticism over his participation in a virtual sim race the night before the Hungarian Grand Prix but denied reports that his team had banned him from future events.\n\n\"I raced until 3 a.m., it's not something new and for me, it's something very important in my life. There are no other sim races coming up anyway so nobody has to worry about that,\" he said.\n\n\"I've won three world championships, I think I know pretty well what I can and cannot do. I'm always very hard on myself with what is and isn't allowed and, with all the experience I have in Formula 1, I think I know quite well what is best.\"\n\nVerstappen is 76 points clear in the championship, with 11 of 24 races remaining.\n\nLatest on SportstarParis 2024 Olympics: Marta assists Nunes as Brazil leads against Nigeria in Olympic GamesTeam SportstarParis 2024 Olympics Live Updates, July 25: Indian archery teams qualify for quarterfinals; Marta assist gives Brazil 1-0 lead in football Team SportstarF1: Verstappen won't tone down foul language to please critics ReutersParis 2024 Olympics: July 26 schedule, full list of events, venues, timings in IST, live streaming infoTeam SportstarParis 2024 Olympics: World Champion Spain beats Japan 2-1; Canada beats New Zealand amid spying scandal ReutersREAD MORE STORIES", "source": {"uri": "sportstar.thehindu.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sportstar"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Bull", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Red Bull"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formula_One", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Formula One"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gianpiero_Lambiase", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gianpiero Lambiase"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_Verstappen", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Max Verstappen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hungarian_Grand_Prix", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hungarian Grand Prix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belgian_Grand_Prix", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Belgian Grand Prix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netherlands", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlos_Sainz_Jr.", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Carlos Sainz Jr."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lewis_Hamilton", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lewis Hamilton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scuderia_Ferrari", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Scuderia Ferrari"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "World championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archery", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Archery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Association football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "New Zealand"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "New Zealand"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nigeria", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nigeria"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Nigeria"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Japan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Spain"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Canada"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brazil", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Brazil"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Brazil"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Romance", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Romance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://ss-i.thgim.com/public/incoming/1vj232/article68447102.ece/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1200/2163644080.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9760315", "eventUri": "eng-9760315", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-25", "textStart": 3011, "textEnd": 3018}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-26", "textStart": 3220, "textEnd": 3227}], "sentiment": 0.2784313725490195, "wgt": 175, "relevance": 1}

That's after the latter demonstrated his team-first mentality in the latest leg of the Formula 1 campaign, while Verstappen was scrutinised for not playing a video game into the wee hours of Sunday morning.\n\nNorris, 24, is seen as the most likely contender to challenge Verstappen for this season's world championship, currently sat second in the standings and 76 points behind the titleholder. And the Briton won a lot of hearts after playing a crucial part in McLaren's impressive one-two finish over the weekend.\n\nAfter some convincing from the McLaren team, Norris gave up his lead to allow team-mate Oscar Piastri - who had led for much of the race - to move back in front and secure his first F1 victory. The decision to let Piastri win made up for the earlier pit-stop strategy and acknowledged that he was the stronger driver in Hungary.\n\nMeanwhile, Verstappen had to settle for his second fifth-place finish in three races following a below-par performance. The Dutchman has faced criticism after it was revealed he stayed up until 3am on the day of the race playing a simulator.\n\nThe Daily Express reported how Norris' display of sportsmanship sent a clear message about the unity within the McLaren team in their mission to dethrone Red Bull. That's a far cry from the apparent discord fans have witnessed between Verstappen and his own team-mate, Sergio Perez.\n\nThe 2022 Brazilian Grand Prix in Sao Paulo put those tensions on full display when Verstappen - who had already clinched that season's championship - refused to yield sixth place to Perez, who was vying for second in the overall standings. Despite being instructed by his team to give up the place, Verstappen's refusal became a notorious moment in F1 history.\n\n\"It shows who he really is,\" said a frustrated Perez over the team radio in Sao Paulo. Even team chief Christian Horner was heard offering apologies to his deputy driver, while Verstappen remained unrepentant about his choice.\n\nVerstappen has been a dominant force in F1 since his 2015 debut, but the three-time world champion has often been criticised for his self-centred methods. Meanwhile, McLaren seemingly has a sense of harmony running between its two young drivers.\n\nSupporters were stunned to discover on Sunday that Verstappen had taken part in a 24-hour Spa sim-racing event on the morning of the Hungarian GP. Red Bull advisor Helmut Marko has now confirmed the superstar will be barred from engaging in such activities so close to race days in the future.\n\nSunday's Belgian Grand Prix at Spa will be even more intriguing to watch with Verstappen being handed a 10-place grid penalty over exceeding the engine allowance. And after Norris surrendered his lead late in the race last weekend, he'll be even more resolute to narrow the gap to Verstappen in the standings.\n\nThis article contains affiliate links, we will receive a commission on any sales we generate from it.

He was bad-tempered throughout the race, argued with race engineer Gianpiero Lambiase and, when out of the car, said some of his Red Bull colleagues need to \"wake up\".\n\nIt emerged that the Dutchman had been up until 3am the night before to take part in the 24 Hours of Spa with his Team Redline sim racing outfit. And he was criticised by more than one Sky Sports F1 pundit for doing so.\n\nIt was reported this week that Red Bull have moved to ban Verstappen from sim racing while on F1 duty. But, speaking to reporters including Mirror Sport ahead of this weekend's Belgian Grand Prix, where he will race at Spa-Francorchamps for real, the champion denied that claim.\n\nHe explained: \"We talked about it, I said, 'You don't need to worry, there are no other races coming up'. But no, it's not that I have a ban. I don't need to tell them what to do in their private time over the weekend, and it's the same for me.\"\n\nRegarding the criticism he received, Verstappen said: \"I raced until 3am - it's not something new and, for me, it's something very important in my life. There are no other sim races coming up anyway so no-one has to worry about that. But it's always when you don't win the race that you blame it on, 'You were staying up until 3am', or, 'You're one kilo overweight'.\n\n\"There are always things to make up that you can argue about when you don't win a race, but for example in Imola I did win the race - both of them. For me, this is not something new, I've been doing this since 2015, so for me it's not something that is any different in my preparation.\n\n\"I've won three world championships - I think I know pretty well what I can and cannot do. I'm always very hard on myself with what is and it's allowed and, with all the experience I have in Formula 1, I think I know quite well what is best.\"\n\nVerstappen was also criticised for his criticism of his Red Bull colleagues over the Budapest weekend, but he again defended his actions by adding: \"From my side, it was quite clear that the strategy was wrong. I'm quite driven, like everyone else in the team, to try to be perfect. To do that every single race is very hard, we came close last year.\n\n\"But when things are not going how they should have been, I think it's quite normal that you can share your frustration with it, and that's what I did. When you're full of adrenaline and things are happening in the race that you're not happy with, then you voice your frustration. But also afterwards in the meeting it's quite clear, you talk about these things. What we did was not optimal in terms of how we executed the race, and we learn from it and move on.\"\n\nThis article contains affiliate links, we will receive a commission on any sales we generate from it.

But the Red Bull's front wheels locked up and the car was sent up into the air after rolling over the tyre of the Mercedes.\n\nThe F1 stewards investigated the collision but decided that no driver was predominantly to blame. Speaking to reporters, including Mirror Sport, ahead of this weekend's Belgian Grand Prix, Hamilton said: \"I was really, really surprised by it.\n\n\"I think already I was very relaxed about the situation. I just said, it's just a racing incident, let's just move on. But considering one car was in control, one car was not in control at the time. And if you look at the replay, I'm very, very far from, at the end of the whole move. I'm very, very far from the apex. So, I've left, there's a lot of room on the right-hand side. So, I was very, very surprised.\"\n\nHamilton went on to finish third while Verstappen had to settle for fifth place. The Dutchman had been in a foul mood throughout the race, complaining about his car and Red Bull's \"s**t\" strategy while also having a go at race engineer Gianpiero Lambiase.\n\nWhen out of the car, Verstappen also said some of his colleagues need to \"wake up\" as Red Bull find themselves with more competition at the front of the F1 grid. Asked for his take on his rival's aggressive messages, Hamilton made clear his disapproval of the Dutchman's behaviour.\n\nHe said: \"You have to be a team leader, a team member. Maybe not so much a team leader but more so just always remember you are a team-mate with lots of people and you have to act like a world champion.\" Asked what 'acting like a world champion' entails, he laughed: \"That's a good question... Not like it was last weekend.\"\n\nVerstappen defended his behaviour from the previous weekend and insisted: \"I think it's quite normal that you can share your frustration with it, and that's what I did. When you're full of adrenaline and things are happening in the race that you're not happy with, then you voice your frustration.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Hamilton said he had not spoken with his rival after the Budapest race, other than their interactions in the stewards' room during the investigation. He explained: \"We didn't talk afterwards. We went to the stewards and that's it.\n\n\"Yeah, we've not had a talk. I don't know if we will, if we get time. Maybe we'll talk in the [drivers'] parade this weekend, maybe. I've not felt like there's necessarily a need to, but there might be something he wants to say.

I don't care, I say what I want, but that's our sport naturally.

He also set the record for most wins in a season, 19 of 22 races.\n\nFollowing his fourth victory this year in the fifth race, in China, Verstappen ominously said that his car was \"on rails\" and that he \"could do whatever I wanted to with it.\"\n\nSince that race, the picture has changed. He has won three of eight Grands Prix. He has not won the last three, his longest winless drought since 2021, and there have been seven different winners.\n\nOver the team radio during the last race in Hungary, where he was fifth, Verstappen criticized the car and the strategy. He defended his anger, saying if people did not like his messages then \"they can go home.\"\n\nChristian Horner, the team principal, said Red Bull was still trying to develop the car but was faced with \"diminishing returns.\" That has allowed McLaren and Mercedes to challenge Red Bull and Verstappen. He is 76 points ahead of Lando Norris of McLaren in the drivers' championship. In the constructors' standings, Red Bull's lead is 51 ahead of McLaren.\n\nSince the Miami Grand Prix, in May, the results of Verstappen's teammate, Sergio P\u00e9rez, have fallen. He has scored only 21 points in the last seven races, affecting the team's chances of retaining its constructors' title.\n\nAlthough P\u00e9rez signed a contract extension in June, Horner said the driver was \"under pressure, and when you are under-delivering that pressure only mounts.\"\n\n\"He knows it is unsustainable to not be scoring points,\" he continued.\n\nBefore the Hungarian Grand Prix, Helmut Marko, an adviser to Red Bull, said the team would \"evaluate the situation\" with P\u00e9rez during the summer break.\n\nP\u00e9rez said that he could not let his future \"be a distraction,\" and that he needed to \"focus and work with the team to get out of this difficult period.\"\n\nWith P\u00e9rez struggling, McLaren is Red Bull's nearest challenger and Norris Verstappen's main rival.\n\nNorris won his first Grand Prix, in Miami, in his fifth season with the team. He has finished second five times, including in the last race in Hungary, where his teammate Oscar Piastri also won his first Grand Prix.\n\nIn Austria in June, Norris and Verstappen collided when dueling for the lead. Norris was forced out of the race, and Verstappen finished fifth. Although there were some hard feelings between the friends, they cleared the air.\n\n\"Max has a very different way of racing compared to others, and that's one of the reasons why he's a champion,\" Norris said. \"It's clear how he races. It's tough. It's on the limit. It's what we love, it's what I love.\"\n\nVerstappen said his only consideration after the incident was \"maintaining my relationship with Lando because we are great friends.\"\n\n\"After letting things cool down because emotions run high, we came to the conclusion we really enjoyed our battle,\" he said.\n\nNorris has a strong teammate, Piastri, who was second in Monaco and Austria. Zak Brown, the chief executive of the team, said McLaren could challenge Red Bull for the constructors' championship in the second half of the season.\n\n\"It's going to be dependent upon P\u00e9rez, at the end of the day, because you have to assume Max is going to be first, second or third at every race, and probably more first than thirds,\" Brown said. \"Sergio underperforming is what has opened the window for us.\n\n\"If we have the same points gain we've had the last few races the balance of the year, we'd get the job done.\"\n\nMercedes is again in the battle. Its drivers George Russell and Lewis Hamilton won in Austria and England. For the seven-time champion Hamilton, his victory at the British Grand Prix ended a 56-race drought. He also became the first driver to win one event on nine occasions.\n\nToto Wolff, the team principal, said Mercedes \"is back\" after two years of struggle in 2022 and 2023 to adapt to the aerodynamic regulations. He said, \"It clicked, and suddenly everything that didn't make sense, made sense.\n\n\"It's the result of our development direction. We're finding performance, putting it on the car, and it is translating into lap time, which hadn't been the case for the past two years.\"\n\nHamilton cried in the cockpit of his car after he won and in the arms of his father, Anthony, after he stepped out of it. He said that the drought, after losing a title to Verstappen in the final race of 2021, was tough, and that he had doubted himself.\n\n\"There's been days between 2021 and here where I didn't feel like I was good enough or whether I was going to get back to where I am today,\" said Hamilton, who heads to Ferrari at the end of the year.\n\n\"The important thing is how you continue to get up. You've got to continue to dig deep, even when you feel like you're at the bottom of the barrel, and I had great people around me, continuing to support me and my team.\"\n\nFerrari, in the hunt after Charles Leclerc won his home race in Monaco in May, has fallen away over the last five races, scoring 70 points. He is in third place for the drivers' title, 103 points behind Verstappen, and the team is 67 points behind Red Bull for the constructors' championship.\n\nFr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Vasseur, the team principal, said the problem was aerodynamic and related to an upgrade introduced at the Spanish Grand Prix in June that did not work.\n\nWith 11 races remaining, the titles are on the line for Red Bull and Verstappen. He is demanding more.\n\n\"The last few weekends have been difficult,\" he said. \"It's now up to us to find more performance.\"", "source": {"uri": "nytimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The

Slated for this Sunday, the event is the last before the August break.\n\nA 7.004 km circuit awaits the drivers, who will cover a total distance of 308.052 km over 44 laps.

Spa-Francorchamps has been a venue where Verstappen has taken similar grid penalties in the past and still fought through the field to win, but he says the competitive picture this season makes that scenario unlikely to be repeated.\n\n\"[A penalty is] likely, but I knew of course that it is coming,\" Verstappen said. \"It's not a surprise to me. We'll find out on Sunday how good that is going to be. Some tracks naturally are a bit better than others. Of course on a street circuit, you wouldn't want to have an engine penalty. So yeah, most likely it will be here.\n\n\"Probably yes [damage limitation will be the goal]. If you look at our last few races where we haven't particularly been the fastest, I wouldn't say that with 10 places extra we have a chance of winning. But again, a race can always be turned upside down with moments. We have to be open minded and try to make the best of it. That's what we'll try to do.\n\n\"At the moment, I also don't know how competitive we're going to be here. In a few places there's new tarmac, so we need to see how the tires respond to that as well. So, still a lot of unknowns. Obviously with the weather, quite a bit of rain expected on Friday and Saturday. So we just need to follow the weather and just progress through the weekend, and see how competitive we are.\"\n\nMcLaren's one-two in Hungary sparked debate about whether Lando Norris should have been given priority in order to try and close what is currently a 76-point gap in the drivers' championship, and Verstappen admits he has considered that Norris could be able to make it a close title fight later in the year.\n\n\"Yeah, naturally of course if they are the dominant force and they keep winning, then for sure. But at the end of the day we just need to focus on ourselves, as we can do things better as well in terms of optimizing the car performance. So that's where my attention goes.\n\n\"Of course you have it in the back of your mind, the championship, but I think we first need to focus on just trying to find a bit more performance in the car.\"\n\nVerstappen was frustrated by Red Bull's strategy in Budapest as he finished fifth, and his radio comments came under scrutiny as well his pre-race schedule of competing in a sim race until the early hours of the morning. On both fronts, the three-time world champion says he's unfazed, with Red Bull sharing his disappointment at how the race played out but not questioning his extra-curricular activities.\n\n\"Yeah, I raced until 3am, it's not something new,\" he said. \"For me, it's something very important in my life. Now there are not any other sim races coming up anyway, so no one needs to worry about that. It's always when you don't win the race, you will blame it on, 'Ah, you were staying up until 3am, oh he's one kilo overweight,' there is always things to make up that you know you can argue about when you don't win a race.\n\n\"But, for example at Imola, I do win the race, both of them. For me, this is not something new -- I've been doing this since 2015. So for me, this is not something that is any different in my preparation.\n\n\"I've won three world championships. I think I know pretty well what I can and what I cannot do, and I'm always very hard on myself what is allowed and isn't allowed. I think with all the experience that I have in Formula 1, I think I know quite well what is possible.\n\n\"We talked about it. I said [to Red Bull's Helmut Marko], 'You don't need to worry.' I said there's no other race coming up. But no, it's not like I have a ban or whatever. I also don't need to tell them what they do in their private time and during the weekends.

The three-race winless stretch is his longest drought since 2021.\n\nThis week, Verstappen faces an even greater uphill climb than usual.\n\nFor the third straight year, Verstappen will take a fresh engine at Spa-Francorchamps, incurring an expected 10-place grid penalty. A terminal failure with a new engine in Canada last month left him out of sync in terms of his four allowed power units for 2024, and he will take a fifth this weekend.\n\nA couple of clashes with opponents -- Lando Norris in Austria, Lewis Hamilton in Hungary -- a lack of performance, and race strategies that he has queried have all served frustrate the always blunt Verstappen, who very publicly threw his team under the bus last Sunday in Hungary.\n\nRed Bull introduced upgrades to its RB20 in Hungary but it remained second best to McLaren, while Verstappen struggled to find the right balance. Red Bull is hoping that further performance will be unearthed from the upgrades as time advances, and this weekend's round at the Circuit de Spa-Francorchamps acts as an acid test of their predicament.\n\nSpa-Francorchamps has been a happy hunting ground for Verstappen and Red Bull across the past two seasons, with both the RB18 and RB19 machines flying around the circuit which is spread across seven kilometers of the Ardennes Forest.\n\nIt is a circuit where a compromise is required, due to the largely full throttle blasts of the first and third sectors counterbalanced by the lengthy corner-laden middle sector of the lap -- and in 2022 and 2023 Red Bull was in a different zip code to its rivals.\n\nVerstappen has been down this path before at Spa.\n\nIn 2022, Verstappen won from 14th on the grid at Spa, and last year won from sixth, with victory margins of 17 and 22 seconds respectively, having elected on both occasions to undertake an engine change. In both years, Sergio Perez finished runner-up to complete a Red Bull 1-2.\n\nRed Bull knew then that Verstappen would face a sanction at some stage and has strategically taken the setback at Spa-Francorchamps, a circuit where overtaking is possible, and where mother nature can also intervene to spice up proceedings.\n\n\"We have to be open minded and try to make the best of it,\" Verstappen said. \"That's what we'll try to do. At the moment, I also don't know how competitive we're going to be here. Also a few places there's new tarmac, so we need to see how the tires respond to that as well. So still a lot of unknowns. Obviously with the weather, quite a bit of rain expected on Friday and Saturday. So yeah, just need to follow the weather and just progression through the weekend, and see how competitive we are.\"\n\nVerstappen's teammate Perez remains under scrutiny after a miserable run that has seen him slip to seventh in the championship, and left Red Bull vulnerable to a resurgent McLaren in the Constructors' Championship, with the gap only 51 points.\n\nRed Bull will be aiming to replicate the 1-2 finishes of 2022 and 2023, while Perez dearly needs a strong error-free display in the final race prior to the summer break, during which Red Bull is set to assess his future.\n\nMcLaren is the team in form, having shown strong performance across the recent sequence of events, prior to finally converting its speed into a 1-2 finish in Hungary.\n\n\"I have no idea,\" Norris said on the notion of McLaren being favorites. \"Based on where we were last weekend, yes, but I think last weekend was the first one where I can say we were easily the best team in both qualifying and the race. Spa is completely different, much lower downforce, and this is where Red Bull have been incredible in the past.\"\n\nFor Mercedes Spa-Francorchamps is another test of its recent progress, while Ferrari has an opportunity to assess its SF-24 on a high-speed track amid its struggles since introducing an update package in Spain last month.\n\n\"It's clear McLaren and Red Bull, when they switch it on, have three or four tenths on us,\" Ferrari driver Carlos Sainz, said.\n\nIn the five rounds since its victory in Monaco Ferrari has not contended for another win, and has scored only one podium finish, slipping behind McLaren in the standings.\n\n\"Spa will allow us to verify if we have done a good job over the past few weeks to mitigate the side effects in high speed corners of the update package we introduced recently,\" Ferrari Team Principal, Frederic Vasseur, said. \"The porpoising effect was very low at the Hungaroring, thanks to the evolution of the floor we introduced in Budapest and now we will see if we have fixed it at high speed tracks too.\"", "source": {"uri": "autoweek.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Autoweek"}, "authors": [{"uri":

It all started with David Croft making a reference to the Dutchman's 24 Hours of Virtual Spa stint during the Hungarian GP. Croft's comment came in the midst of some angry radio exchanges between Verstappen and his race-engineer Gianpiero Lambiase, blaming the Dutchman's sleep deprivation for his short-tempered mood.\n\nThe F1 champion's virtual racing teammate Diogo Pinto has now come out issuing a clarification. Reflecting on his 10-hour stint, Pinto put to rest the rumors suggesting Verstappen had a longer stint.\n\nIn fact, Pinto made a specific reference to Verstappen's Hungarian GP race the next day, which led to him going longer than his teammates. Team Redline on Instagram quoted Pinto as saying,\n\n\"Ideally, no driver does more than 8 or 9 hours in a team of 4. But we had Florian with internet issues, Chris with a minor injury at the end, and Max at the F1 Grand Prix. The last 3 stints were challenging. Having the BS guys and our Ford teammates close helped me stay focused since any mistake or drop in pace could mean we would lose the race.\"\n\nHelmut Marko came out in support of Verstappen, citing the 26-year-old's previous achievements in virtual racing which did not affect his performance during F1 race weekends. The Red Bull taskmaster even blamed Lewis Hamilton for the collision that dropped Verstappen to P5.\n\nHowever, he refused to defend Verstappen's angry radio outbursts, dubbing them \"inappropriate\". Red Bull, however, has taken a stern stance on Verstappen's sim racing. While they will not interfere in his other races, the Dutchman has been told to avoid participating in e-races during a Grand Prix weekend.\n\nWhether or not the Dutchman will follow the instructions of Red Bull, only time will tell. However, one thing is clear; he is not thrilled about it in the present. In one of his recent live streams with Team Redline, Verstappen made a reference to the team's orders in a mocking manner.\n\nReferring to another individual, Verstappen revealed they had a night out.

However, former F1 driver and Sky Sports pundit Karun Chandhok believes that the Belgian Grand Prix weekend will push the tide back in Red Bull's favor.\n\nTo begin with, Chandhok explained how diametrically opposite the two tracks are. Whilst the Hungaroring demands an out-and-out high-downforce package, the 4.352-mile-long Circuit de Spa-Francorchamps beckons a more efficient downforce-producing race car.\n\nSpeaking on the Sky Sports F1 podcast, the former HRT driver also highlighted how the Red Bull car is historically more suited to the Spa circuit's configurations, and has tasted much success over the years. In his opinion, if the weather is in Red Bull's favor, the Milton Keynes-based advantage could also have the advantage on the track.\n\nHe explained, \"It [the MCL38] was the quickest car in Hungary. I don't know if it will be the quickest car in Spa. Because Spa is a circuit that has historically suited the Red Bull so well. They are a very efficient car. They have been able to produce very efficient downforce. Assuming [the race is] dry, it will directly favor Red Bull a bit more.\"\n\nWhile Chandhok is of the opinion that Red Bull would be the favorites to bag big points in Belgium, the 40-year-old did give McLaren the credit where it was due. Given where McLaren were at the start of last year, Chandhok feels they have done a tremendous job to be at least an equal match for Red Bull across the range of circuits on the 2024 calendar.\n\nAt the moment, the driver line-up for Red Bull has not been firing on all cylinders. It will be crucial for Perez to put in a good show at Spa if Red Bull are to capitalize on their pace advantage. Moreover, since Red Bull are likely to make a decision about Perez's future within the team after the Belgian GP, the #11 driver will hope to put in a good performance.\n\nOn the other hand, Verstappen will most likely have a mountain to climb through no fault of his own. The Dutchman is handed a 10-place grid penalty after Red Bull decided to fit a new engine into his RB20. Given how the Spa circuit is power-limited, it would help the #1 driver have a brand-new engine in the back of his car.\n\nMoreover, despite the penalty, Verstappen has a decent shot at aiming for at least a podium finish. The Spa Francorchamps circuit often features plenty of overtakes, and Verstappen has made it a habit of performing well on this track. In 2022, the Dutchman stormed through the field to win the Belgian GP from a grid spot of P14.", "source": {"uri": "thesportsrush.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The SportsRush"}, "authors": [{"uri": "anirban_aly_mandal@thesportsrush.com", "name": "Anirban Aly Mandal", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karun_Chandhok", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Karun Chandhok"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hungaroring", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hungaroring"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circuit_de_Spa-Francorchamps", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Circuit de Spa-Francorchamps"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Bull", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Red Bull"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McLaren", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "McLaren"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hungary", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Hungary"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Hungary"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sky_Sports_F1", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sky Sports F1"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belgian_Grand_Prix", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Belgian Grand Prix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sky_Sports", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sky Sports"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auto_racing", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Auto racing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formula_One", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Formula One"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Downforce", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Downforce"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belgium", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Belgium"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Belgium"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netherlands", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Motorsports", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Motorsports", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Autos/Driving_and_Safety", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Autos/Driving and Safety", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Automotive/Retail", "label": "dmoz/Business/Automotive/Retail", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Device_Drivers", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Device Drivers", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 71}], "image": "https://cdn-wp.thesportsrush.com/2024/07/7f2d0687-karun-chandhok-1.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9760315", "eventUri": "eng-9760315", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.419607843137255, "wgt": 153, "relevance": 1}

Not like it was last weekend.\"\n\nVerstappen on Thursday defended his radio conduct, insisting it was \"nothing personal\" against anyone he works with at Red Bull and that the honest remarks worked for him and the reigning world champions.\n\n\"People that don't like my language, don't listen in or change the volume down. I'm very driven to succeed. I've proven that already,\" said Verstappen.\n\n\"I always want to optimise stuff. People can argue that you might not be so vocal on the radio, but that's their opinion.\"\n\nHe added: \"We are very open-minded. We are very critical of each other as a team, and that's been working for us very well, so I don't expect that to change.\"\n\nHamilton, meanwhile, took issue with the Budapest stewards' interpretation of his collision with Verstappen.\n\nAlthough neither driver was predominantly found at fault for a clash which Hamilton himself had already said was a \"racing incident\", meaning no penalty was issued, the stewards did still suggest the seven-time world champion \"could have done more to avoid the collision\".\n\n\"I was really, really surprised by it,\" said the Mercedes driver of the full stewards' judgement, which was issued several hours after the end of the race.\n\n\"I think already I was very relaxed about the situation and just saying 'look, it's just a racing incident, let's just move on'.\n\n\"But considering one car was in control and one car was not in control at the time - obviously when all the wheels are locked, you're not in control - and if you look at the replay at the end of the move I'm very, very far from the apex, so there's a lot of room on the right-hand side.\n\n\"So I was very, very surprised by the stewards. I don't know who typed it up but... that will be a question when I speak to them at some stage.\"\n\nAlthough Mercedes did not have to speed around the hotter and more twisty Hungaroring to repeat their front-running form from the race before at Silverstone, which Hamilton won, the Briton's third-place finish did still extend their podium run to five consecutive races.\n\nThe former champions continue to push forward with car upgrades on the improving W15, which Sky Sports understands will feature a new front wing, floor and beam wing at Spa-Francorchamps this weekend - the final round before F1's summer break.\n\nHamilton has now recorded a podium at three of the last four events, having previously gone a career-worst 12 races without a top-three finish, and the 39-year-old said on Thursday: \"I feel great. I don't feel older than George [who is 26]!\n\n\"I still feel so much youth, am energised, driven and love working with the team.\n\n\"We have got some upgrades this weekend, so I can't wait to see how that feels on the track. Hopefully it's another step in the right direction and I'm excited for the next part of the season.\"\n\nRussell, who won in Austria after the Verstappen-Lando Norris collision but retired from Silverstone with a water leak and then finished only eighth following a poor qualifying in Hungary, said: \"Budapest confirmed that we perform better in the cooler conditions than the hotter races.\n\n\"Going into Spa, I think there's some rain, we have some upgrades, which is really exciting to see if that can take us another step, after what we brought to Canada a few races ago and we want to take the fight to McLaren and Red Bull.", "source": {"uri": "skysports.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "SkySports"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_Verstappen", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Max Verstappen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Bull", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Red Bull"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercedes-Benz", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mercedes-Benz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lewis_Hamilton", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lewis Hamilton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hungarian_Grand_Prix", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hungarian Grand Prix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belgian_Grand_Prix", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Belgian Grand Prix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hungaroring", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hungaroring"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hungary", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hungary"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Hungary"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Budapest", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Budapest"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Budapest"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Hungary"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circuit_de_Spa-Francorchamps", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Circuit de Spa-Francorchamps"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sky_Sports", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sky Sports"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silverstone_Circuit", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Silverstone Circuit"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McLaren", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "McLaren"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Austria", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Austria"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Austria"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Auto_Racing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Auto Racing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Adventure_Racing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Adventure Racing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Karting", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Karting", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://e0.365dm.com/24/07/1600x900/skysports-max-verstappen-lewis-hamilton_6639159.png?20240725183254", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9760315", "eventUri": "eng-9760315", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2078431372549019, "wgt": 149, "relevance": 1}

This followed a contentious collision at the Hungarian Grand Prix, where heated exchanges over the incident and team strategy marked another chapter in the duo's storied rivalry. Hamilton stirred the pot by questioning Verstappen's conduct, suggesting that a true leader should embody the poise and responsibility of their status both on and off the track.\n\nA clash for third place during the Hungarian Grand Prix left Verstappen crossing the line in fifth, exacerbating the tension with frustrated radio communications criticizing his team's strategy and car performance. Although the stewards dismissed the collision as a racing incident, they hinted that Hamilton could have potentially avoided the conflict, a point that surprised and irked the Mercedes driver.\n\nCommenting on Verstappen's fuming radio messages to Red Bull, Hamilton commented, as quoted by Sky Sports F1:\n\n\"You have to be a team leader, a team member.\n\n\"Maybe not such a team leader, just always remember you are a team-mate with lots of people and you have to act like a world champion.\"\n\nWhen probed for more information on what he meant by \"acting like a world champion,\" the British driver responded:\n\n\"That is a good question... Not like it was last weekend.\"\n\nVerstappen, unfazed by critics of his often blunt radio remarks, defended his communication style as effective for his team's dynamics, saying:\n\n\"People that don't like my language, don't listen in or change the volume down. I'm very driven to succeed. I've proven that already.\n\n\"I always want to optimise stuff. People can argue that you might not be so vocal on the radio, but that's their opinion.\n\n\"We are very open-minded.

The Red Bull driver openly criticized his team's strategy over live radio communications after colliding with Hamilton.\n\nHis frustration was palpable as he told his race engineer: \"No mate, don't give me that s*** now. You guys gave me this s*** strategy, OK? I'm trying to rescue what's left.\"\n\nIn response, Stefano Domenicali, CEO of Formula One Group, convened a meeting with team bosses to highlight the necessity of maintaining professionalism over radio communications, according to The Times.\n\nAt present, F1 does not impose penalties or formal reprimands for the use of profane language during team radio communications unless it becomes excessively offensive. However, this incident has sparked discussions on potential changed to these policies. Domenicali's focus is clear: reminding all drivers of the importance of decorum in communications that reach a global audience.\n\nVerstappen, for his part, defended his radio remarks:\n\n\"[If] people don't like my language, then don't listen in, turn the volume down. I'm very driven [for] success, I think I've proven that already, I always want to optimize stuff, now people can argue that he might not be so vocal on the radio, but that's their 'opinion.'\"\n\nHe also expressed his stance on not needing to apologize for his language:\n\n\"I don't think we need to apologize, I think we just need to do a better job. I don't know why people think we cannot be vocal on a radio. This is a sport. If some people don't like that then stay home.\"\n\nThe incident and Verstappen's comments have not gone unnoticed in the broader context of his recent performance struggles. Following a winless streak and facing a 10-place grid penalty at the upcoming Belgian Grand Prix for exceeding his engine allowance, Verstappen's challenges are mounting. Additionally, team advisors at Red Bull have advised him to cut back on late-night sim-racing, suggesting concerns about his focus and preparedness.\n\nHamilton, reflecting on the intense competition, remarked:\n\n\"Obviously the close battle we had at the end was a bit hair-raising, but that's motor racing.\" He humorously added: \"It's not nerve-wracking. When you see the pace at which they closed the gap in certain corners, you just laugh to yourself because it's not something I can do.\"\n\nNewsweek is committed to challenging conventional wisdom and finding connections in the search for common ground.\n\nNewsweek is committed to challenging conventional wisdom and finding connections in the search for common ground.", "source": {"uri": "dnyuz.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "DNyuz"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_Verstappen", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Max Verstappen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formula_One", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Formula One"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lewis_Hamilton", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Lewis Hamilton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oscar_Piastri", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Oscar Piastri"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lando_Norris", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lando Norris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stefano_Domenicali", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stefano Domenicali"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hungarian_Grand_Prix", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hungarian Grand Prix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Race_engineer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Race engineer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formula_One_Group", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Formula One Group"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Bull", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Red Bull"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McLaren", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "McLaren"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belgian_Grand_Prix", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Belgian Grand Prix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newsweek", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Newsweek"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motorsport", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Motorsport"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Radio", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Radio", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 89}], "image": "https://dnyuz.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/F1-News-Max-Verstappen-Radio-Language-Prompts-Response-From-Formula.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9760315", "eventUri": "eng-9760315", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1137254901960785, "wgt": 140, "relevance": 1}

The anthem itself was ... an interesting performance we think it fair to say, with Belgian pop star Antoine Delie doing the honors complete with a large Belgian flag as a cape and some fascinating sunglasses. You can view the perfomance in its entirety here:\n\nNow, let's dive in and break down what happened ... and what nearly happened.\n\nCharles Leclerc keeps his cool\n\nWe start with Ferrari driver Charles Leclerc, who manages to stay calm, cool, and collected as the camera pans past him. There were some indications that the Ferrari driver was \"baffled\" by the performance, but from our vantage point -- and given what we see from the rest of the grid -- it seems Leclerc is one of the few drivers to keep it together.\n\nLewis Hamilton: Pure vibes\n\nNext up? Seven-time world champion Lewis Hamilton.\n\nIf the old saw is true, in that a \"picture is worth a thousand words,\" then this is the definition of steely focus. Hamilton seems completely unfazed by the performance.\n\nOr perhaps the sunglasses are hiding more than we can see.\n\nOscar Piastri, a rookie at the time, clearly knows something is different about this anthem performance. But he also knows that if he is the first to break down, it will undermine the image of a rookie beyond his years in the sport. So Piastri does his best to keep things together, but there is a hint of confusion in his expression.\n\nIt is not quite the moment from the 2023 Austrian Grand Prix where Piastri broke the fourth wall after a jet-pack operator took a tumble, but it is close.\n\nLando Norris holds on for dear life as Fernando Alonso lights the match\n\nNow we are talking.\n\nFor many, this is THE definitive moment from last year's anthem. We start with Fernando Alonso, as the veteran driver is doing everything he can to send the grid into shambles. Alonso knows that if he catches Lando Norris' field of vision, the entire house of cards will come tumbling down.\n\nAnd Norris knows it too. He knows we are just one shared glimpse away from an anthem version of this memorable press conference ahead of the 2019 British Grand Prix, and he is doing everything he can to prevent that from happening.\n\nEventually, however, Alonso gives up and looks ahead, still with a sly grin on his face:\n\nBut, we were just one shared glimpse away from a global incident.\n\nCarlos Sainz and Max Verstappen keep their composure\n\nIn the initial social media clips that made the rounds last summer everything after the above moment between Alonso and Norris was clipped out, largely because the focus seemed to be on Alonso nearly sending the grid into chaos.\n\nBut the extended version, which you can see above, has some incredible moments when the camera pans over some other members of the grid.\n\nNot Carlos Sainz Jr., and Max Verstappen, however. Those two absolutely keep it together.\n\nGeorge Russell fights for his life and nearly loses\n\nYes yes, that's the good stuff.\n\nOnly recently was this extended cut -- the \"Snyder Cut,\" if you will -- brought to my attention so only recently did I learn just how close we really came to the grid breaking down. And not because of Norris-Alonso, but because of Mercedes driver George Russell.\n\nRussell is absolutely on the brink of breaking down in full-throated laughter, and as one member of \"F1 Threads\" noted on Wednesday, it almost looks as if the Mercedes driver is biting the inside of his mouth to keep from full-on laughter.\n\nWhatever works.\n\nBleached-blonde Nico H\u00fclkenberg does his best Fernando Alonso\n\nThat's right ...\n\nNico H\u00fclkenberg turned heads at the Hungarian Grand Prix a year ago when he arrived in Budapest with bleached-blonde hair. That opened up a whole host of questions ahead of the Hungarian Grand Prix regarding whether H\u00fclkenberg timed the new hair color for the release of the Barbie movie, but it also made H\u00fclkenberg stick out like a sore thumb a week later when the grid took in this anthem performance.\n\nAnd, as you can see above, once you get past Lance Stroll and the Alpine duo of Esteban Ocon and Pierre Gasly all managing to keep their cool, along with Kevin Magnussen doing the same, H\u00fclkenberg seems to be doing to Logan Sargeant what Alonso was doing to Norris. Like his British counterpart, Sargeant keeps his focus straight ahead, as he knows full well if he catches H\u00fclkenberg's glance things will spiral out of control.\n\nWill we see a similar anthem performance this weekend?", "source": {"uri": "sbnation.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "SB Nation"}, "authors": [{"uri": "mark_schofield@sbnation.com", "name": "Mark Schofield", "type": "author",

The Red Bull driver openly criticized his team's strategy over live radio communications after colliding with Hamilton.\n\nHis frustration was palpable as he told his race engineer: \"No mate, don't give me that s*** now. You guys gave me this s*** strategy, OK? I'm trying to rescue what's left.\"\n\nIn response, Stefano Domenicali, CEO of Formula One Group, convened a meeting with team bosses to highlight the necessity of maintaining professionalism over radio communications, according to The Times.\n\nAt present, F1 does not impose penalties or formal reprimands for the use of profane language during team radio communications unless it becomes excessively offensive. However, this incident has sparked discussions on potential changed to these policies. Domenicali's focus is clear: reminding all drivers of the importance of decorum in communications that reach a global audience.\n\nVerstappen, for his part, defended his radio remarks:\n\n\"[If] people don't like my language, then don't listen in, turn the volume down. I'm very driven [for] success, I think I've proven that already, I always want to optimize stuff, now people can argue that he might not be so vocal on the radio, but that's their 'opinion.'\"\n\nHe also expressed his stance on not needing to apologize for his language:\n\n\"I don't think we need to apologize, I think we just need to do a better job. I don't know why people think we cannot be vocal on a radio. This is a sport. If some people don't like that then stay home.\"\n\nThe incident and Verstappen's comments have not gone unnoticed in the broader context of his recent performance struggles. Following a winless streak and facing a 10-place grid penalty at the upcoming Belgian Grand Prix for exceeding his engine allowance, Verstappen's challenges are mounting. Additionally, team advisors at Red Bull have advised him to cut back on late-night sim-racing, suggesting concerns about his focus and preparedness.\n\nHamilton, reflecting on the intense competition, remarked:\n\n\"Obviously the close battle we had at the end was a bit hair-raising, but that's motor racing.\" He humorously added: \"It's not nerve-wracking. When you see the pace at which they closed the gap in certain corners, you just laugh to yourself because it's not something I can do.\"", "source": {"uri": "newsweek.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Newsweek"}, "authors": [{"uri": "alex_harrington@newsweek.com", "name": "Alex Harrington", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lewis_Hamilton", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Lewis Hamilton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oscar_Piastri", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Oscar Piastri"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lando_Norris", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lando Norris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_Verstappen", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Max Verstappen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stefano_Domenicali", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stefano Domenicali"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hungarian_Grand_Prix", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hungarian Grand Prix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Race_engineer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Race engineer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formula_One_Group", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Formula One Group"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Bull", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Red Bull"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McLaren", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "McLaren"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formula_One", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Formula One"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belgian_Grand_Prix", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Belgian Grand Prix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motorsport", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Motorsport"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Radio", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Radio", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 91}], "image": "https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2436946/max-verstappen.webp?w=1600&h=900&q=88&f=3deaa63924cf313ccb398514a6b1dc1a", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9760315", "eventUri": "eng-9760315", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1137254901960785, "wgt": 131, "relevance": 1}

And, after discussing the topic with Red Bull, team advisor Helmut Marko suggested Verstappen had agreed to stop taking part in sim races late into the night on grand prix weekends.\n\n\"Max has a different sleep rhythm and he had his seven hours of sleep,\" Marko told the Red Bull-owned publication Speedweek.\n\n\"His late-night sim race on the Hungarian weekend only came about because a driver in his team was cancelled. Nevertheless, we have agreed that he will no longer drive sims so late in future.\"\n\nVerstappen laughed away suggestions that his late night exploits somehow affected him and said he would continue combining it with his F1 duties.\n\n\"We talked about it,\" Verstappen said. \"There is no other sim race coming up anyway, so no one needs to worry about that.\n\n\"So no, it's not that I have a ban or whatever.

After having had a driver stand on the podium just once in the first four rounds of the year -- Lando Norris in Australia after Max Verstappen retired -- it's had at least one car feature in the top three at every grand prix since.\n\nThe culmination of that sharp upwards trajectory was a comprehensive performance in Hungary, where it locked out the front row for the first time in almost 12 years and recorded just its second one-two finish of the last decade.\n\nEvery qualifying session and race from the 2024 FIA Formula One World Championship\u2122 LIVE in 4K. New to Kayo? Start Your Free Trial Today >\n\nCombined with Verstappen's rage-fuelled run to fifth and Sergio P\u00e9rez's seventh-place finish, McLaren took a whopping 27 points out of Red Bull Racing's lead at the weekend. The margin now stands at 51 points, the lowest gap between the two teams since the Australian Grand Prix in March.\n\nIt's also down more than half since the margin peaked at 115 points at the end of the Miami Grand Prix.\n\nMcLaren has been outscoring Red Bull Racing by an average of nine points per round since Miami. On that trajectory it will take it another six races, until the United States Grand Prix in October, to take the lead in the constructors championship.\n\nAnother two rounds scoring as heavily as it did in Hungary would see McLaren hit the lead after the Dutch Grand Prix, the first race after the August break.\n\n\"We're taking a lot of points out of Red Bull; we've taken a lot of points out of Red Bull in the last six or seven races,\" Piastri told select media, including Fox Sports. \"The fight is well and truly on.\n\n\"I don't even think we're really a long shot of winning the championship now; we are a genuine chance to win the constructors championship, which is a very exciting prospect for everyone.\n\n\"I think even at the beginning of the season or after a few races where Red Bull weren't looking as dominant as last year, we kind of thought if things go well for us and not so well for others, then we could be in with a shout.\n\n\"Of course you're always trying to maximise what you can do every weekend regardless of the points on offer or the championship standings, but I think it just goes to show that that's why you try and maximise it, because you never quite know how the fortunes are going to turn.\n\n\"Aiming towards the constructors championship with the team is a really exciting thing to be part of, so I'm looking forward to the challenge.\"\n\nPIT TALK PODCAST: Oscar Piastri has become Australia's fifth grand prix winner after leading a dominant McLaren one-two finish in Budapest, but the result was overshadowed by teammate Lando Norris threatening to pinch victory for himself in a team orders fracas.\n\nPiastri said the result was a massive boost to the team, coming roughly a year after it leapt from the back of the grid to the front of the field with a series of massive game-changing upgrades.\n\n\"It's an incredible position to be in,\" he said. \"To have a one-two and to have it as dominant as we did on Sunday was incredible.\n\n\"I think it's one thing having results when you've capitalised on opportunities from others or had good circumstances, but the weekend we did purely on merit and on performance, which is everything we've been working towards for the last 18 months.\n\n\"I think everyone in the team is extremely proud of everyone's achievements. It's not just Lando and I that drive the cars quickly; it's the whole team giving us the car to do it as well. I hope everyone in the team takes credit for that performance.\"\n\nThis weekend's Belgian Grand Prix will be a fascinating test of McLaren's points trajectory, with Spa-Francorchamps traditionally a Red Bull Racing favourite.\n\nThe team has been unbeatable at the high-speed, Ardennes circuit since the 2022 rule changes.\n\nIn 2022 Verstappen recovered from 14th on the grid to win the race by 18 seconds ahead of his teammate and 27 seconds ahead of anyone else.\n\nThe story was much the same in 2023, when the Dutchman started sixth but beat P\u00e9rez by 22 seconds and the field by 32 seconds.\n\nWhile Red Bull Racing's advantage is clearly reduced this year, if it's going to go well anywhere this season, it'll be here.\n\nWith the Belgian form guide against his team, Piastri stopped short of declaring McLaren a favourite for races going forward, saying the closeness of the pack meant the pecking order would change from track to track, but he said the team had already proved it could be competitive at most circuits.\n\n\"I think there's no denying that we have a very strong car and it's been consistent since Miami. It's been a consistent frontrunner,\" he said.\n\n\"I think Hungary was really the first time for us where we were clearly from the start of the weekend incredibly strong, and I think qualifying really showed that.\n\n\"I hope that we're going to be the favourites in some way for the rest of the year, but I think it's so close at the moment.\n\n\"These cars are still very track dependent, depending on what characteristics you've got with your car.\n\n\"You can't rule out any of the top four teams, really. Ferrari looked a little bit stronger than they had been in Hungary. Red Bull were still in the mix -- I think if Max had different track position, he could have still been a threat. Mercedes have still been strong the last few events as well.\n\n\"I think the order will still change a bit. I think if we are favourites, it's not going to be by much, and if we get it wrong, then there's going to be three other teams snapping at our heels.\n\n\"But there are also going to be races where we're potentially snapping at the heels of others.

Its high-speed bends and rolling elevation changes form an adrenaline rush few other tracks can offer, and triumphing in Ardennes puts a driver's name among some of motorsport's true greats.\n\nEvery qualifying session and race from the 2024 FIA Formula One World Championship\u2122 LIVE in 4K. New to Kayo? Start Your Free Trial Today >\n\nPiastri will be hoping history repeats not just week on week but also decade on decade.\n\nThis time 10 years ago Daniel Ricciardo did the Hungary-Belgium double, claiming his second and third career victories in his first season with Red Bull Racing.\n\nEquipped with the most competitive McLaren car in a generation, a morale boost and a sense of confidence, Piastri will be hoping to replicate the feat.\n\nWILL THE McLAREN DRIVERS BE CALLED ON TO WORK TOGETHER AGAIN?\n\nMcLaren broke some tremendous droughts over the course of the Hungarian Grand Prix weekend.\n\nIts front-row lockout was its first since the end of 2012, almost 12 years ago.\n\nIts one-two finish is its first since the 2021 Italian Grand Prix and just its second since the 2010 Canadian Grand Prix, more than 14 years ago.\n\nBut McLaren's operating principles were almost broken too when Lando Norris spent 20 laps threatening to disobey a team order that ultimately allowed Piastri to win the race.\n\nIt was the first major flashpoint of their young rivalry, and having come at the weekend Piastri turned his speed from being a potential threat to Norris's authority into an actual one, it won't be the last.\n\nNor will it be the last time McLaren calls on its drivers to play the team game.\n\nWhile McLaren was dominant in Budapest, it's unlikely to have such a stranglehold on the field at other tracks. Spa-Francorchamps this weekend, for example, is a totally different layout in totally different conditions.\n\nHistorically it's been a site of immense pain for McLaren.\n\nIn the last 12 years its recorded a best finish of fourth in Belgium. Five times it's walked away without a score.\n\nTo succeed this weekend, there's every chance its driver will need to work together.\n\nThe trust was tested but not broken last weekend. How will it go at the second time of asking?\n\nPiastri said he had no doubt McLaren's principles of teamwork and fairness would hold.\n\n\"First and foremost I'm a McLaren racing driver,\" Piastri told select media, including Fox Sports. \"I'm not racing for Oscar Piastri Racing, I'm racing for McLaren.\n\n\"That's always the big picture, and there's a thousand more people behind me and behind Lando as well.\n\n\"The team orders go both ways. We're very open, very honest about it, and I think in basically all situations it's a very sensible way of going racing.\n\n\"I think we both know that at the end of the day we're racing for the team.\"\n\nSpeaking about last week specifically, the Aussie said he was sympathetic to Norris's mindset divided between individual glory and team success.\n\n\"I think for me I would have done the same thing as Lando did in giving the position back,\" he said. \"I fully understand -- he's a racing driver, so am I.\n\n\"When you're in the lead of a race, it's not a nice thing to have to let it back through, but we are racing for the team, and certain decisions were made on the basis that we're racing for the team and securing a one-two.\n\n\"I think that the end result was the same and would have been reciprocated the other way had we been the other way around.\"\n\nIt remains to be seen, but you can be certain Budapest wasn't the last time Norris and Piastri will be battling for control of a race.\n\nCAN VERSTAPPEN OVERCOME HIS GRID PENALTY TO KEEP STREAK ALIVE?\n\nWhile Red Bull Racing has been good at just about every track since the change of rules in 2022, its form at the Belgian Grand Prix deserves special mention.\n\nRed Bull Racing, led by Max Verstappen, has been totally untouchable in Spa-Francorchamps.\n\nIn 2022 he qualified on pole with an advantage of 0.632 seconds before dropping to 14th with a power unit grid penalty.\n\nHe was unstoppable in the race. He took just 12 laps to take the lead and won the race by 17.8 seconds ahead of teammate Sergio P\u00e9rez. The gap to the next-best car -- Carlos Sainz's Ferrari -- was 26.9 seconds.\n\nLast year's race was even more impressive.\n\nHe took pole by a whopping 0.820 seconds but was dropped to sixth on the grid with a gearbox penalty.\n\nHe passed P\u00e9rez for the lead on lap 18 and won by a massive 22.3 second, gapping his teammate in identical machinery by 0.85 seconds per lap.\n\nThe next-best car -- Charles Leclerc's Ferrari -- finished 32.2 seconds down the road.\n\nPerhaps unsurprisingly, Red Bull Racing has reportedly chosen this race again as the venue for Verstappen to serve a penalty. He'll take a 10-place drop for taking a new internal combustion engine after his power unit failure during practice at the Canadian Grand Prix last month.\n\nHe's also on the bubble for further penalties for being on his final examples of other power unit parts.\n\nBelgium's long straights, ample DRS and big braking zones means overtaking is easier than at other circuits.\n\nBut it's desperately unlikely Verstappen will have such an easy time cutting through the field and onto the podium this season.\n\nThe game has changed in 2024. Whereas in 2022 RBR was in the ascendancy and last year it was enjoying the most one-sided run in the history of the sport, this year the team's been caught up and its title defence is at risk.\n\nMcLaren dominated last week's race in Hungary. While it's a dramatically different style of circuit, its result there was only the culmination of improving form.\n\nThe high-speed, high-efficiency Spa-Francorchamps layout and cool weather should perfectly suit Mercedes, which proved in Silverstone that these are the sorts of conditions in which its car excels.\n\nIt means this weekend's shapes up as a big test of how far Red Bull Racing has fallen in one of its great strongholds. If Verstappen can't put up a fight here, then it'll be hard to call him or the team favourite at most other circuits this season.\n\nPressure peaked on Sergio P\u00e9rez in Hungary last weekend, with speculation rife he was ripe to be turfed from the team by the mid-season break given his weak form.\n\nHe couldn't have picked a worse weekend to crash out of Q1.\n\nThe Mexican was distraught, but on Sunday he put his strong practice pace to good use, climbing nine places from his grid spot to finish seventh, just two places behind Verstappen, to score some six points.\n\nIt was a good race, but it demonstrated P\u00e9rez's problem: he's chronically inconsistent and an unreliable second driver.\n\nP\u00e9rez wasn't hired to win the drivers world championship. While Red Bull Racing has never hindered his ambitions, what it wants from him is enough points to win the teams title and to maximise his result when Verstappen is having a bad day.\n\nHis qualifying crash ensured he achieved neither. In Hungary he should have been in podium contention on an afternoon Verstappen was having a brain snap; instead he was scrambling to recover from a poor qualifying result.\n\nNow he has his second chance -- but it comes with added pressure.\n\nVerstappen's penalty means it will automatically fall to P\u00e9rez to lead the team's Sunday result.\n\nHe must start ahead of Verstappen, and if he gets the most out of the car in qualifying, he will surely be in podium contention on Sunday.\n\nThat's really the only acceptable result this weekend.\n\nHis pace in Hungary was good but his performance wasn't good enough. He now has one chance to make amends, with his career on the line.\n\nPerhaps it's all too late, with signs increasingly pointing to Red Bull Racing having come close to making up on cutting him from the team. After all, one good result by definition is not consistency.\n\nIf that's the case, P\u00e9rez will at least want to bow out on a high.\n\nDaniel Ricciardo had one of his better weekends of the season in Budapest, but his Sunday result was badly compromised by a botched team strategy that eliminated his shot at a points finish.\n\nHad he been able to race with a regular strategy and demonstrate his race pace, he would've almost certainly finished a very comfortable ninth at the head of the midfield.\n\nIt was a crucial race for the Aussie. Just as pressure is on P\u00e9rez to save his seat, so too is Ricciardo's career hanging in the balance.\n\nReserve driver Liam Lawson is waiting in the wings, and some reports suggest Red Bull has resolved to get him onto the grid after the August break.\n\nNo longer thought to be at the top of the list for Red Bull Racing, Lawson's sights are set on Ricciardo's drive.\n\nRicciardo must therefore do enough to convince RBR to take a punt on him as P\u00e9rez's replacement.\n\nPart of that is in P\u00e9rez's hands -- if the team hasn't already made up its mind to turf him.\n\nBut even in that scenario Ricciardo would still have to perform to rise above the background politics of the Red Bull program. While he has the backing of RBR principal Christian Horner, Helmut Marko reportedly favours Yuki Tsunoda finally getting the nod for the senior team.\n\nIt's unlikely Horner will allow himself to be overruled. Driver decisions at RBR are his domain. But the decision on a possible P\u00e9rez replacement carries significant risk for him as a team boss, for if he subs out P\u00e9rez for a driver who loses the constructors championship anyway, his decision-making will be inextricably tied to the outcome.\n\n\"Please compare the Q3 appearances, qualifying results and the race results, and it will be clear,\" Tsunoda said, stating a last-minute case for himself, per Crash.\n\n\"It's quite clear how many points I get compared to other drivers.\n\n\"If you just see the performance, it's quite clear, like I said. It's really clear that I'm the one performing well, even in the top of the midfield, if you compared to all the drivers.\"\n\nRicciardo has beaten Tsunoda in three of the last five races -- though Hungary should have made it four from the last five. He's likewise qualified ahead of the Japanese ace in three of the last four grands prix.\n\nIs that enough to overcome his slow start to the year -- and Tsunoda's 18 months of strong form?\n\nIt's a high-stakes situation for Horner and his team. Ricciardo's job this weekend is to put himself beyond doubt as the best candidate for the job.", "source": {"uri": "foxsports.com.au", "dataType": "news", "title": "Fox Sports"}, "authors": [],

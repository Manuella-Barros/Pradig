The \u201cSummertime Sadness\u201d singer could be seen in a viral video stepping out of a store and appearing caught off guard when she sees a person recording her. \u201cDon\u2019t,\u201d she says before attempting to snatch the phone out of the person\u2019s hand. It\u2019s unclear whether the individual was a fan or a paparazzo. Del Rey, 38, then gets even more heated in a separate video, in which she confronts a larger group of people, saying, \u201cYou followed me with my family! \u2026 Get away from me!\u201d The \u201cDon\u2019t Call Me Angel\u201d singer then starts to walk away but returns to say, \u201cOh, you really think this is uncalled for? Don\u2019t follow me! Don\u2019t follow me!\u201d When another person in the group seemingly tries to defuse the situation, Del Rey snaps back, \u201cI am upset\u201d before reiterating, \u201cDon\u2019t let them follow me.\u201d The \u201cDoin\u2019 Time\u201d singer then gives further insight into what has made her so mad, sharing, \u201cI only have one day here. I work every single day. I have four hours to myself.\u201d However, when a male in the group attempts to get her to calm down by saying, \u201cDon\u2019t scream,\u201d she shouts even louder and responds, \u201cShut up!\u201d After the videos hit the internet, Del Rey further vented via Instagram, \u201cThese a\u2013holes actually told me that they were going to alter the pictures to make me look bad after we got into a fight.\u201d She also claimed the group were \u201cstalkers.\u201d Page Six has reached out to Del Rey\u2019s reps for comment but did not immediately hear back. Meanwhile, the \u201cYoung and Beautiful\u201d singer has been flooded with tons of support from fans. \u201cpoor lana ? im so happy she stood up for herself,\u201d one person commented on social media. Another chimed in, \u201cThey need to stop harassing her.\u201d By Friday night, Del Rey had seemingly already brushed off the entire ordeal. The \u201cBorn to Die\u201d singer hit the stage at the Primavera Sound Porto festival in Portugal.", "summary": "The \"Summertime Sadness\" singer is seen in video trying to snatch a phone out of a person's hand at one point to stop them from recording her.", "url": "https://pagesix.com/2024/06/08/entertainment/lana-del-rey-flips-out-on-stalkers-for-following-her-in-paris/", "image": "https://pagesix.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/06/83466591.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200", "video": "https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/V6XubSx6-guILbWnz.mp4", "publish_date": "2024-06-08 14:26:05", "author": "Eileen Reslen", "authors": ["Eileen Reslen"], "language": "en", "source_country": "us", "sentiment": -0.2}

These two male producers had come from filming FBoy Island and obviously wanted conflict,\" the insider says, adding this was not what Bert signed up for.\n\nRELATED:\n\n\"He actually felt uncomfortable with his producers and their suggestions on how to handle the remaining women,\" the source said, claiming this was the reason he left. \"He no longer felt like he could go on and pretend just for the show.\"\n\nIt was revealed that what was happening on Bert's farm was worlds away from the other farms and it was \"like they were filming a different show\".\n\nKnowing this, many fans are speculating that it must be true, because the pineapple farmer looked quite bored during his 24-hour date with Caitlin Crank, who is the second most likely option according to betting sites for Bert to choose at the end, with him leaving by himself being the most likely option.\n\nFans unsure about Bert and Caitlin's 24-hour date\n\n\"Ummm was it just me or Bert was not at all interested in their date,\" one Facebook fan said of the farmer's 24-hour date with Caitlin.\n\n\"Bert either has chosen just one lady and is going through the motions or is regretting going on the show, in my opinion,\" one user responded.\n\n\"I think he is very interested in her - he is just shy that's all,\" another hit back, with a third agreeing, \"I think he's just fairly reserved.\"\n\n\"No chemistry at all was painful to watch,\" someone else added.\n\nCaitlin attempts to 'dig deeper' with Bert\n\nDuring the date, it was clear that Caitlin wanted to learn more about Bert and his plans for the future.\n\nSpeaking to the cameras, Caitlin said that while she thought it was important to build a friendship with Bert, she wanted to \"dig deeper\" because she felt he was a bit \"closed off\".\n\nWhen she asked him if there was anything he'd like to talk to her about, he said, \"Not particularly, I actually just wanted to hang out, pretty casual I suppose.\"\n\n\"Where do you see yourself in, like, a year's time from now?\" she then asked, trying to 'dig deeper' as she mentioned.\n\n\"Probably flat out, planting pineapples,\" he said with a laugh, not giving much away about where he sees their relationship going.\n\nBert is heard telling the cameras that he got hurt during his last relationship and \"probably put some walls up\" as a result.\n\nLater in the date, Caitlin says that she's had \"so much fun\" with Bert, but it feels like either we aren't seeing that due to editing (which could be highly likely, let's be honest), or she's kidding herself.\n\nBert tells her he's \"probably not the biggest talker in the world, but it means more to me just getting to spend that time to get to know someone\".\n\nSHOP:\n\n\"I do struggle to talk about my emotions on the best of days,\" Bert tells the camera. \"She does have a really comforting energy to her and that obviously relaxes me and helps me to be a little bit more vulnerable, I suppose. So I definitely really enjoy that about her.\"\n\nHowever, the pair did finish positively, with Bert saying the things he likes about her and sharing a kiss, leaving Caitlin to tell the cameras she's \"over the moon\" with how the date went.\n\nFans unconvinced by the pair's chemistry\n\nFans weren't so convinced, with one user writing, \"He doesn't want any of them. He ends up not picking anyone supposedly.\"\n\n\"He shows no interest in anyone,\" another said. \"Not sure if that's the case or he is just closed off to his emotions.\"\n\n\"He's very closed off and just going through the motions with everyone,\" a third said. \"I think he knows going on the show was a mistake but is trying to see it out.

He initially covered football, predominantly Partick Thistle, but later branched out into boxing, rugby, and tennis.\n\nHe covered Ricky Burns from his amateur days and was ringside at the Kelvin Hall in 2010 when the Coatbridge boxer beat Roman Martinez to lift the WBO Super-Featherweight title.\n\nBert, who graduated from Glasgow University with an MA Honours in British, European, and Scottish Medieval History, had corresponded with the Scottish historical novelist Nigel Tranter in his teenage years in the 1980s.\n\nHe left the Glasgow Times to write a series of crime fiction novels, which drew on his time in the police and centred around the adventures of Detective Sergeant Gus Thoroughgood, under the name RJ Mitchell. Tommy Jordan, who was Bert's colleague at the Evening Times for many years, remembers him being a tenacious reporter as well as a larger-than-life character.\n\n\"You never properly appreciated how hard-working Bert was until you had to cover for him on a day off or annual leave,\" he said.\n\n\"He had by far the most amount of clubs to cover and somehow managed to touch base with all of his clubs before most of us had finished breakfast.\n\n\"I remember him saying he was going to meet a contact and came back a couple of hours later sporting a fresh haircut.\n\n\"When joking about his contact being his barber, Bert replied, 'He spends all day speaking to everyone in Maryhill so he is one of the best people to speak to about Partick Thistle. That's what you call thinking out the box and that was pretty much Bert.\n\n\"When in the police, Bert decided he wanted to become a journalist and he had to do it the hard way. He achieved that objective through nothing other than sheer determination and that was the type of colleague he was.\n\n\"He was very much his own man, he was strong enough to stand by the courage of his convictions but more than anything, he was someone who lived for his family - Arlene and Ava.\"\n\nBBC Scotland sports journalist and presenter Phil Goodlad got to know Bert well when he was reporting on Burns' first world title fight and became a close friend. \"We met when Ricky had his world title shot against Martinez in the Kelvin Hall,\" he said. \"Every title defence thereafter, we would share a ringside seat and occasionally go out for a bite to eat beforehand. We would chat about what we were hearing as journalists on the same beat.\n\n\"He was a very talented squash player back in the day and was a sports journalist who valued all other sports. In Scotland, football dominates society and every other sport is a minority sport, whether it be rugby, squash, athletics. You have to fight hard to get some focus on it.\n\n\"I always felt that Bert cared about getting that sport the column inches that he could. Boxing was his big passion. I, along with a number of other journalists, followed Ricky when he was world champion. But Bert had followed him as an amateur coming up through the ranks.\n\n\"He was invested not just in the individual, but in the sport. You always got the impression that when he covered an event he was trying to give the sport, not just the event, some publicity. That is not to say that he didn't appreciate football and rugby. But for him covering a big fight was as much about promoting boxing as anything.\"\n\nPhil added: \"His irreverence always used to make me smile. You could be chatting away with something and suddenly he would come out with something right out of leftfield that would make me chuckle.\n\n\"I always remember when Ricky was world champion there was a line put out before a fight against an challenger from Africa by a London-based PR man about how a cursed pigeon was flying from Africa to Glasgow and this was going to end Ricky's reign.\n\n\"Bert was appalled with the total garbage that was being put out in an official press release. He was a serious journalist and he was having a write about a cursed pigeon! He made me laugh.\n\n\"He wasn't just a sports reporter. He studied medieval history and spent years working in the police. He had lived outside of sport. He subsequently used his experiences when he authored his brilliant DS Thoroughgood books. They leaned heavily on his own personal experiences.\"\n\nBert is survived by his wife Arlene and daughter Ava.\n\nHis funeral will be held at Bridge of Allan Parish Church and then Logie Kirk Cemetery on Thursday at 11am.", "source": {"uri": "glasgowtimes.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Glasgow Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ricky_Burns",

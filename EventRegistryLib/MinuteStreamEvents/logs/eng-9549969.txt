Arag\u00f3n, department of public health director and state public health officer, said in a Wednesday news release.\n\nAccording to the public health department, there are no current links between the fake drugs and authentic Botox, which is manufactured by AbbVie and approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.\n\nThe drug is used to smooth out wrinkles and treat muscle-related conditions such as chronic migraines, overactive bladders and eyelid spasms.\n\nFDA-approved Botox is \"considered safe and effective\" when used as intended, the release said.\n\nHere's how to spot counterfeit Botox, according to the California Department of Public Health.\n\nSymptoms caused by counterfeit Botox are similar to those caused by botulism poisoning.\n\nThey can include drooping eyelids, difficulty swallowing, dry mouth, slurred speech, difficulty breathing, fatigue and generalized weakness, according to the California Department of Public Health.\n\nIf you have any symptoms of botulism poisoning, you should \"contact a health care professional or go to the emergency room immediately,\" the agency said.\n\nIf you're considering getting Botox, the public health department says you should seek treatment at an authorized source.\n\n\"Consumers should only get injections of FDA-approved Botox from licensed and trained professionals in health care settings. Botox should never be purchased online or through unlicensed individuals,\" Arag\u00f3n said in the release.\n\nThe California Medical Board allows for Botox to be administered by a physician, a registered nurse or a physician assistant under a physician's supervision.\n\nWhen in doubt, \"Ask your health care professional if they are licensed and trained to administer Botox,\" the health agency said.\n\nIf you come across counterfeit Botox or suspect it's being used, you can report it on the FDA's website or by calling 800-551-3989.\n\nFake Botox products can also be reported via the California Department of Public Health's Consumer Complaints website.\n\nHealth care professionals can report counterfeit Botox products to the FDA's MedWatch Safety Information and Adverse Event Reporting Program.\n\n2024 The Sacramento Bee.

Here's what to look for", "body": "Fake versions of Botox have popped up in California, raising alarm among public health officials who warn that counterfeit versions of the injections can lead to symptoms such as slurred speech and breathing problems.\n\n\"Counterfeit or incorrectly administered Botox, even in small amounts, can result in serious health problems and even death,\" Dr. Tom\u00e1s J. Arag\u00f3n, director of the California Department of Public Health, warned in a statement Wednesday.\n\nBotox, or botulinum toxin, is used cosmetically to temporarily smooth fine lines on the face. It has also been employed to treat medical conditions such as muscle spasms. The product is derived from a toxin produced by bacteria.\n\nLast month, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said that 22 people from 11 states had reported harmful reactions such as weakness and blurry vision after getting injections, landing some of them in the hospital. They had gotten their injections from unlicensed or untrained people or outside of healthcare settings, such as in a home or spa, according to the federal agency.\n\nSo far, there is no indication that such problems were linked to the genuine Botox product approved by the federal Food and Drug Administration, health officials said. Instead, regulators have found that some patients received counterfeit Botox products or ones from unverified sources. Investigations are underway.\n\n\"We're not even sure what it really is,\" but it's not Botox, said Dr. Adam Friedman, chair of dermatology at George Washington School of Medicine and Health Sciences.\n\nAnd \"when you have an injectable agent that is not what it claims to be, has no quality assurance, no oversight ... there could be a whole bunch of different things that come along for the ride,\" including bacteria or allergens.\n\nBecause the health effects could be delayed, \"I don't think we've actually scratched the surface yet\" of possible consequences from injecting an unknown substance into the body, Friedman said.\n\nThe California Department of Public Health said that since a multistate investigation launched in November, it had received two reports of harmful reactions to counterfeit or mishandled botulinum toxin, which were included in the total figure reported nationally by the CDC.\n\nUnder California law, Botox can be injected only by a physician, or by a registered nurse or physician assistant working under the supervision of a doctor. But state law \"does not restrict where Botox treatments may be performed,\" according to the Medical Board of California. In a statement, Arag\u00f3n urged people to get Botox injections only from \"licensed and trained professionals in healthcare settings.\"\n\nPublic health officials also advised consumers to check with healthcare providers that they were getting Botox from \"an authorized source\" and to ask if they were licensed and trained to administer the injections.\n\n\"If in doubt, do not get the injection,\" the public health department urged.\n\nArag\u00f3n also stressed that Botox should never be purchased online or through \"unlicensed individuals.\" Dr. Debra Johnson, former president of the American Society of Plastic Surgeons, said that online sellers abroad have been creating \"pirated Botox,\" putting it in similar packaging, and then selling it to anyone who will pay.\n\nPhysicians have been getting emails and faxes saying, \"'We've got Botox for cheaper, we've got filler for cheaper' -- and it's all these unregulated places that don't have any FDA oversight,\" Johnson said. Responsible doctors know that's illegal, she said, but \"I'm sure there's some people who would hop at the chance.\"\n\nBotox is manufactured by AbbVie Inc. The California Department of Public Health said that outer cartons of the genuine product include product descriptions for either \"BOTOX\u00ae COSMETIC / onabotulinumtoxinA / for Injection\" or \"OnabotulinumtoxinA / BOTOX\u00ae / for injection\" and list the manufacturer as either \"Allergan Aesthetics / An AbbVie Company\" or \"abbvie.\" They also list the active ingredient as \"OnabotulinumtoxinA.\"\n\nFake products might show the active ingredient as \"Botulinum Toxin Type A,\" include languages other than English, or indicate 150-unit doses, according to the California Department of Public Health. (AbbVie manufactures real Botox products in 50-, 100- and 200-unit dose forms, federal officials said.) Another tipoff to a fake product is the lot number \"C3709C3\" on packaging or vials, regulators have advised.\n\nThankfully, \"there's some really key, distinct features on this fake Botox that distinguish it from the real thing, which has not been contaminated,\" Friedman said. If a consumer is concerned, \"there's nothing wrong with saying, 'Hey, can I check out the box?'\"\n\nIn general, if \"something seems to be too good to be true\" or \"it seems like a bargain when it comes to your health, those should be signals to run,\" he said.\n\nAnyone suffering symptoms from counterfeit Botox -- which are similar to the effects of botulism poisoning from improperly canned foods -- should contact a medical professional or go immediately to an emergency room, CDPH said. Symptoms can include drooping eyelids, trouble swallowing, fatigue, weakness and difficulty breathing.\n\nFake Botox products can be reported to the FDA through its website or by calling (800) 551-3989. In California, people can also tip off the California Department of Public Health by submitting a consumer complaint.", "source": {"uri": "latimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Los Angeles Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Botulinum_toxin", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Botulinum toxin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Counterfeit", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Counterfeit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California_Department_of_Public_Health", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "California Department of Public Health"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centers_for_Disease_Control_and_Prevention", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Centers for Disease Control and Prevention"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_health", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Public health"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Health care"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacteria", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Bacteria"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dysarthria", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dysarthria"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blurred_vision", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Blurred vision"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spa", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Spa"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toxin", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Toxin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spasm", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Spasm"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_and_Drug_Administration", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Food and Drug Administration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_government_of_the_United_States", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Federal government of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AbbVie_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "AbbVie Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physician_assistant", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Physician assistant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injection_(medicine)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Injection (medicine)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Washington", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "George Washington"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Registered_nurse", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Registered nurse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Packaging_and_labeling", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Packaging and labeling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allergen", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Allergen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dermatology", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dermatology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality_assurance", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Quality assurance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health", "label": "dmoz/Health", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Health", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Health", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Specific_Substances/Tobacco", "label": "dmoz/Health/Specific Substances/Tobacco", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Public_Health_and_Safety/First_Aid", "label": "dmoz/Health/Public Health and Safety/First Aid", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Chronic_Illness", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases/Chronic Illness", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Health", "label": "news/Health", "wgt": 83}], "image": "https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/07ccf8d/2147483647/strip/true/crop/484x272+0+0/resize/1200x675!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fad%2Fda%2F748b6a2b477b88e7ce1a201df9f7%2Funnamed.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9549969", "eventUri": "eng-9549969", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1450980392156863, "wgt": 217, "relevance": 1}

Is That A Good Thing?", "body": "Dermatologists warn that lower-priced shots should raise an eyebrow.\n\nBotox is everywhere right now. It's nearly impossible to walk down a city block or through a suburban strip mall without seeing signs in med spas or even hair salon windows advertising it -- sometimes at appealingly reasonable prices. The brand name for botulinum toxin (others include Daxxify, Dysport, and Xeomin), Botox has become so ubiquitous that what was once a hush-hush anti-aging \"tweakment\" for celebrities and those with means is now a household name, with people throwing Botox parties and twenty-somethings getting preventative 'Baby Botox' injections to stave off the signs of aging.\n\nAnd with mass appeal comes mass pricing. On social media, some aestheticians are offering Botox for as little as $7 a unit. Search \"cheap Botox near me\" on Google, and you'll get a long list of local deals, mainly from Groupon, where the drug is deeply discounted. (One such offer I recently spied boasted 40 units for $201 -- and would-be consumers could shave $20 off that price by applying a promo code.) That's less than $5 per unit.\n\nLet's put that in perspective. Sources say the pharmaceutical company that manufactures Botox, Allergan, charges providers around $6-7 per unit, making the average patient cost more like $10-15 per unit (with metropolitan areas charging double that), according to the American Society of Plastic Surgeons. Do the math, and it comes out to about $528 per treatment.\n\nSo how are some offering it for half that?\n\nIt's a sticking point in the industry, with many calling these prices far too good to be true. \"In my mind, the only way to offer Botox for that steep of a discount is if it's not real -- either counterfeit, from another country, or toxin that's just literally fallen off the back of a truck,\" says Bradley Glodny, MD, a cosmetic dermatologist who practices in New York City.\n\nBut surely that's...hyperbole? Maybe not: In April, Dr. Glodny's concerns were validated when the FDA reported that counterfeit Botox was administered in 11 states, including California, Colorado, Florida, Illinois, Kentucky, Nebraska, New Jersey, New York, Tennessee, Texas, and Washington between November 2023 and March 2024. Twenty-two women ranging in age from 25 to 59 reported symptoms of botulism, including drooping eyelids, blurred vision, slurred speech, and muscle weakness, after receiving injections from unlicensed or untrained injectors or in non-healthcare settings, such as homes and spas.\n\nSome cases were so severe they required hospitalization.\n\nAt first glance, the fake vials look strikingly similar to genuine Botox, but there are subtle differences. For starters, the faux bottles are labeled \"botulinum toxin type A\" instead of \"onabotulinumtoxinA\" and contain 150 units (Botox is only available in vials of 50, 100, or 200 units). Another clue is a foreign language on the packaging, according to the FDA.\n\nSo, what can you, as a person who may be toxin-curious, do to protect yourself? Plenty. Let's start here.\n\nBased on the number of reaction posts on social media from cosmetic dermatologists, plastic surgeons, and aesthetic nurses, the recent cases of counterfeit Botox have fueled a longstanding debate in the industry: Who should be injecting these neurotoxins? And why has this luxury medical procedure become something patients -- and some providers -- are willing to bargain for?\n\nSome point to the boom in medical spas across the country coupled with fuzzy, if not flat-out lax, regulations, which have made minimally invasive medical procedures such as Botox more accessible and, in some cases, affordable. According to Market Data Enterprises, it's a 17.5-billion-dollar industry, with nearly 9,000 medical spas operating across the US in 2022 (up from over 5,000 in 2017). Industry revenues have tripled since 2012.\n\nMed spa regulations vary from state to state. In general, practitioners must be licensed physicians or advanced practice registered nurses (APRNs), and many -- but not all -- require businesses to employ a medical director who is a licensed physician. In Texas, for example, med spas must have a physician medical director, but they don't have to be on-site, says Kristin Gunn, a licensed medical aesthetician and co-owner of Beaux MedSpa in Austin, whose partner is an on-site plastic surgeon. \"Texas is trying to change that, but right now, as long as you have an MD on staff, even if they're based 200 miles away, any nurse can inject.\"\n\nSo, has the increase in med spas made Botox and other neurotoxins more affordable? Not exactly. Allegan has reportedly increased its prices for providers recently. However, there are more options now, such as Dysport and Xeomin, which may cost providers less to buy. \"Just like any other consumer product, if you have a larger number of players, there's going to be competitive pricing,\" says Gabby Garritano, a board-certified physician assistant and founder of JECT NYC, a med spa with locations in New York, Los Angeles, and Miami. Buying in bulk from pharmaceutical companies also reduces costs, so large dermatology practices and med spas that do high volumes of injectables may be able to offer lower prices. \"The more you buy, the less pricey it gets,\" says Gunn.\n\nStill, those $7 unit sales give even the busiest med spa owners pause. It doesn't always mean they're using counterfeit neurotoxin, but \"some spas will promote a new injector with deals on Groupon in an attempt to build up their clientele,\" says Garritano. New injector equals less experience, so proceed with caution, say our experts. \"When you see those sales, like 30 units for $199 or even $299, that's a huge red flag,\" says Gunn. \"Even more of a concern than counterfeit product is that the people typically offering lower prices are those with less experience,\" says Gunn.\n\nAnother consideration: Less expensive neurotoxins may be the real deal, but watered down. \"When the vials arrive at a med spa or physician's office, they contain powder, and you can have to reconstitute it with sterile saline,\" says Gunn. Some people use too much saline on purpose, so you're getting a diluted version.\" That means you're getting less, which won't last as long.\n\nThe cost of experience\n\nIn the end, your bill isn't only based on how much your provider pays for the product, but also the injector's skill and experience level. Marina Peredo, MD, a cosmetic dermatologist in New York City and Dix Hills, New York, has been injecting Botox since it was first FDA-approved as a cosmetic treatment in 2002. She's a national investigator and educator for pharmaceutical companies such as Allergan, Galderma, and Merz. \"Botox and fillers are tools,\" Dr. Peredo says. \"The results are in the hands of the injector. Can you really trust someone who just took a weekend course in aesthetics to stick needles in your face?\"\n\nBoth Drs. Peredo and Glodny would leave aesthetic injections up to board-certified dermatologists or plastic surgeons with extensive training, hands-on experience, and a proven track record of excellence. \"A PA or nurse may be very good, but they're only as good as the MD who trained them -- they get zero to no actual dermatologic training in school,\" says Dr. Glodny. \"So, it's all about their clinical experience and an MD taking the time to train them.\"\n\nThe Price is Right: Many cosmetic dermatologists, including Drs. Peredo and Glodny, don't price by the unit. Instead, they offer a per-area (like crow's feet) fee. \"I stopped haggling over units a while ago,\" says Dr. Glodny. \"I charge per area and then do a complimentary touch-up in two weeks,\" he says. \"Other places might charge a lower dollar amount per unit, but they may be lying about the number of units they give you, it's diluted, or it's not real,\" he says.\n\nAnd it's not just about injecting; the provider needs to handle bad reactions, which can occur even in the hands of the most skilled injector. \"One of my mentors told me a long time ago, 'Never perform a procedure where you won't be able to handle the adverse effects,' and that's a super important rule to work by,\" Dr. Glodny says.\n\nOf course, finding a qualified cosmetic dermatologist in a metropolitan area is far easier than in other parts of the country, where dermatologist droughts exist. In those cases, med spas may be your best option. But do your homework: \"I would ask where they did their training and how many years of experience they have,\" Dr. Glodny says. \"There are some nurse practitioners and PAs who train for Allergan and Galderma; I would feel more comfortable going to one of them,\" he says.\n\nThe med spa owners we interviewed agreed that upper-level training is key for nurses, too. \"We had 60 trainings last year alone at JECT for our medical providers,\" says Garritano. \"We don't just offer an onboarding program; we provide continuous training.\" Gunn, who has been injecting neurotoxins for 15 years, trained with a plastic surgeon for an entire year before she started in the biz. \"I would use the white pencil to mark the points on patients' faces; he'd wipe them away and say, 'Try again!'\"\n\nEven top cosmetic dermatologists will hold a sale here and there, and pharmaceutical companies offer coupons and incentives for treatments. That's all fine. But when a price seems too good to be true, it likely is, and requires careful vetting. Aside from asking to see the vial of your neurotoxin and requesting a full curriculum vitae from your injector (we're serious about both of those suggestions), how can you navigate Botox safely?",

However, under-eye Botox, in particular, is becoming increasingly popular. Glam spoke exclusively to Dr. Aanand Geria, a board-certified dermatologist specializing in medical, surgical, and cosmetic dermatology and the founder of New Jersey's Geria Dermatology, to clarify what exactly this process entails and when it should be used.\n\nBotulinum toxin type A -- a neurotoxin sold under brand titles like Botox -- is a neuromodulator that is used to help muscles relax by blocking the neurotransmitter signals that cause muscle contractions. \"Botox relaxes a muscle around the eyes, thereby improving lines and wrinkles,\" Dr. Geria shared. \"More specifically, this will help lessen the appearance of 'crow's feet,' under-eye lines, and the 'jelly roll.'\"\n\nCrow's feet refer to the tiny lines on the sides of our eyes which give the appearance of -- you guessed it -- crow's feet. The skin around our eyes is thinner than anywhere else on our face, so typically, the first signs of aging are wrinkles like this. Meanwhile, jelly rolls refer to the bulging skin under our lower eyelid when we smile or squint. This excess skin creates a puffy look and is the result of our skin's loss of elasticity due to age. Under-eye lines are another result of aging, but their appearance can also be affected by inherited genetic traits, exposure to harmful UV sun rays, and smoking. As Dr. Geria explains, one of the best ways to treat these issues is by getting Botox, but there are a few things to consider.", "source": {"uri": "glam.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Glam"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Botulinum_toxin", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Botulinum toxin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmetics", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cosmetics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dermatology", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dermatology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wrinkle", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Wrinkle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muscle", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Muscle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gelatin", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gelatin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurotoxin", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Neurotoxin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurotransmitter", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Neurotransmitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muscle_contraction", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Muscle contraction"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skin", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Skin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elasticity_(physics)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Elasticity (physics)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strabismus", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Strabismus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultraviolet", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ultraviolet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetics", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Genetics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ageing", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ageing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smoking", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Smoking"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Health/Conditions and Diseases", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Health/Children_and_Adolescents", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Health/Children and Adolescents", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Health/Men", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Health/Men", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Men's_Health/Baldness", "label": "dmoz/Health/Men's Health/Baldness", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Health", "label": "news/Health", "wgt": 84}], "image": "https://www.glam.com/img/gallery/dermatologist-breaks-down-the-benefits-of-under-eye-botox-for-us/l-intro-1714961701.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9549969", "eventUri": "eng-9549969", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2627450980392156, "wgt": 170, "relevance": 1}

Described by blurry vision, shortness of breath, weakness, paralysis,\" Dr. Patel said.\n\nBotox distributor Abbvie wrote in a statement:\n\n\"We have a comprehensive supply chain security program to ensure that all products manufactured are safe, secure, and sold through authorized distribution channels. All reports of counterfeit product are thoroughly investigated by our team and in conjunction with law enforcement and public health authorities where appropriate.\"\n\nSo what's in these counterfeit bottles and how can you tell if its off?\n\n\"They can be super-concentrated Botox, it may not be Botox at all it could just be a little bit of salene, it's not stored properly, there's a lot of impurities potentially,\" Dr. Patel said.\n\nThe injections need to be stored cold at three degrees and the label has a holographic feature, with a distinct font on the packaging.\n\nHere are some red flags to look out for to avoid a Botox bust:\n\n\"Walking into a home, let's say a home, a Botox party, or a place where's there's not a licensed or medical professional.

Am I looking a bit rough? It's part of the human condition to fear ageing, but among millennials and gen Z there seems to be a heightened anxiety around growing older, coupled with an increasingly casual attitude towards getting fillers and Botox compared with previous generations.\n\nAlmost half of millennial women polled by the BBC in 2019 said they believed that having a cosmetic procedure was akin to having a haircut. I can say from experience that it is not. Like many, I have fallen victim to negative anti-ageing rhetoric. After months of staring at my tired face on Zoom calls during lockdown, I felt as if my hot years were slipping through my fingers. When the world opened up, I found a doctor to \"restore\" my hollowed out under-eyes with 1ml of filler. I was barely 28.\n\nI spent \u00a3700 on two rounds of filler with a trained doctor, who placed it into my upper cheek, instead of directly under my eye, to reduce the risk associated with under-eye treatments. But even though I paid top whack and went to the renowned Harley Street, my face did not take as well to the second round of filler, and it has left a visible dent under one of my eyes that I now obsess over in photos.\n\nDespite this, getting more \"tweakments\" has still crossed my mind. Recently, after a period of prolonged stress, I became paranoid that it was showing on my face. \"I'm getting Botox,\" I told several friends, convinced I was developing forehead lines. But I didn't cave in and I'm glad, as once I started looking after myself again, they disappeared.\n\nBeauty tweakments such as dermal fillers and Botox are increasingly favoured by younger people. In 2022, 27% of US patients receiving Botox were 34 or younger, compared with 21% in 2015, according to the American Academy of Facial Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery. The idea is to stop wrinkles before they start, with some calling it \"baby Botox\", or \"prejuvenation\". On TikTok young people are lauded for incorporating these treatments into their skincare routine, with many equating it with self-care. Anecdotally, around a third of my female friends, all of us barely out of our 20s, have hopped on the trend. One got Botox largely for her wedding. Another has been getting filler touch-ups in her lips and cheeks since her late 20s.\n\nSo why are we all so desperate to pretend we're not growing older? There is a collective and largely premature fear of ageing. For my generation, being perpetually online and scrolling through the lives of others must also be a factor. It keeps us locked into a constant state of comparison. Then, the stream of bad news on war and the climate crisis is making us all depressed, anxious and nervous about dying. And in a time of economic uncertainty, millennials and gen Z are also unable to tick off traditional checkpoints of adulthood, so the idea that many alter their appearance to turn back the clock makes perfect sense to me. For women, our looks are aesthetic capital after all - and being beautiful can unlock social and professional success.\n\nBut these treatments often don't come with warnings; it's up to the consumer to research potential pitfalls. Botched cosmetic procedures among young people are on the rise, with too many treatments taking place in unregulated beauty salons and carried out by unqualified practitioners. Last month, three women in the US contracted HIV from \"vampire facials\", cosmetic procedures intended to rejuvenate the skin, when an unlicensed New Mexico medical clinic reused needles that should have been disposed of. It caused understandable alarm worldwide as the first such case of transmission via a needle during cosmetic surgery.\n\nThe pursuit of youth keeps many of us in a chokehold. And while I'm all for female personal agency when it comes to cosmetic treatments, looking young is not a panacea for all life's woes. One friend who loves fillers said to me recently: \"I can't stay 28 for ever, but the aim is to look 28 for ever.\" I'm trying to reject the message that it's wrong for women to look their true age. It can be hard to tune out the noise, but the alternative may mean a future marred by self-doubt, expensive treatments or even regret. I think I'll stick with the eye bags.", "source": {"uri": "theguardian.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Guardian"}, "authors": [{"uri": "georgina_lawton@theguardian.com", "name": "Georgina Lawton", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millennials", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Millennials"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Botulinum_toxin", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Botulinum toxin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ageing", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Ageing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_lockdowns", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "COVID-19 lockdowns"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zoom_(software)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Zoom (software)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_condition", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Human condition"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Periorbital_puffiness", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Periorbital puffiness"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hairstyle", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hairstyle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmetics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cosmetics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skin", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Skin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhetoric", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rhetoric"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Death"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "BBC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anxiety", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Anxiety"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TikTok", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "TikTok"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injectable_filler", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Injectable filler"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Academy_of_Facial_Plastic_and_Reconstructive_Surgery", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "American Academy of Facial Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harley_Street", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Harley Street"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wrinkle", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Wrinkle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paranoia", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Paranoia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Botched_(TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Botched (TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vampire", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Vampire"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Mexico", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "New Mexico"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New Mexico"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Home/Family/Pregnancy", "label": "dmoz/Home/Family/Pregnancy", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Health", "label": "news/Health", "wgt": 85}], "image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e9a37e43f897279dbb815096dde036d530ff3066/0_179_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n&s=7f4d667046c8c2f27443bb185a93b905", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9549969", "eventUri": "eng-9549969", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1686274509803921, "wgt": 160, "relevance": 1}

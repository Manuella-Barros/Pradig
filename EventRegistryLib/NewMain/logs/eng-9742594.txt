While the Congress party has been missing Chandy's political acumen in its day-to-day running, people close to him have been on a mission to ensure that there is no end to the path of philanthropy he showed them.\n\nOommen Chandy's son Chandy Oommen, who succeeded his father as Puthuppally's MLA, is leading the welfare and charity works in the name of the former chief minister with a set of activities initiated by the Oommen Chandy Foundation, a charitable trust. As part of the programmes commemorating the former chief minister on his first death anniversary, the foundation will open Oommen Chandy Sports Arena, a football turf at Kooroppada in Puthuppally constituency, on Thursday. The turf was built on a 50-cent land donated by Maliyekkal Charitable Trust.\n\nChandy Oommen told Onmanorama that several people from different parts of the state have come up offering land for various projects in the name of his father. The foundation chaired by Chandy has Dr Mohan Thomas as its secretary.\n\nThe foundation has already received one acre of land at Vakathanam and it will be used for a housing project. A lodging facility for cancer patients and their caretakers is planned at a six-cent plot in Thiruvananthapuram.\n\n\"Another person has offered a 10-cent plot at Chengannur to build an orphanage. In Kozhikode, someone is ready to donate one acre of land. We want to explore the possibility of a social science institute there,\" Chandy Oommen said. He said the foundation will be distributing medicines worth Rs 4 lakh to the needy at Vellarada panchayat in Thiruvananthapuram.\n\nChandy Oommen said the foundation will be focussing on health, education, sports and housing.\n\nGovernor Arif Mohammed Khan will be attending the Oommen Chandy commemoration events in Kottayam, organised by the foundation, on Thursday. AICC general secretary (organisation) K C Venugopal will formally inaugurate the foundation at a separate event.\n\nChandy Oommen brushed aside the recent reports of a political controversy relating to the foundation. There were reports that a section of the 'A' group leaders in Congress, who have been staunch Oommen Chandy loyalists, were unhappy as they were not consulted about the formation of the foundation. Rubbishing such reports, Chandy Oommen said he was only focussing on his works and not controversies. A senior Congress leader who was close to Oommen Chandy said the controversy was baseless and Chandy had all right to go ahead with the foundation's works. Though the Congress had announced it would launch a charity organisation in the name of Oommen Chandy, no steps have been taken yet.\n\nMeanwhile, Oommen Chandy's wife Mariyamma Oommen and eldest daughter Maria Oommen are also active in charity works in his name with an initiative named Oommen Chandy Sneha Sparsham. The initiative has been launched by Manna Charitable Trust run by Mariamma and Mariam since 2012. As part of Oommen Chandy's death anniversary, the trust will be conducting medical camps, providing educational assistance and handing over documents of a pledged house by paying the mortgage amount.", "source": {"uri": "onmanorama.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "OnManorama"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_minister", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Chief minister"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oommen_Chandy", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Oommen Chandy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Member_of_the_Legislative_Assembly_(India)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Member of the Legislative Assembly (India)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_National_Congress", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Indian National Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kochi", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kochi"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Kochi"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kerala", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kerala"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Kerala"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thiruvananthapuram", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Thiruvananthapuram"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Thiruvananthapuram"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Onmanorama", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Onmanorama"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panchayati_raj_in_India", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Panchayati raj in India"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kooroppada", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kooroppada"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vakathanam", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Vakathanam"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Vakathanam"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vellarada", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Vellarada"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Vellarada"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puthuppally,_Kottayam", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Puthuppally, Kottayam"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_rupee", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Indian rupee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lakh", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lakh"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cancer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chengannur", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chengannur"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Chengannur"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kozhikode", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kozhikode"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Kozhikode"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arif_Mohammad_Khan", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Arif Mohammad Khan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_India_Congress_Committee", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "All India Congress Committee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Governor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kottayam", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kottayam"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Kottayam"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society", "label": "dmoz/Society", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Philanthropy", "label": "dmoz/Society/Philanthropy", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Philanthropy/Cheer_and_Support", "label": "dmoz/Society/Philanthropy/Cheer and Support", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 89}], "image": "https://img.onmanorama.com/content/dam/mm/en/kerala/top-news/images/2023/9/10/oommen-chandy-file.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9742594", "eventUri": "eng-9742594", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Kochi"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.0980392156862746, "wgt": 218, "relevance": 1}

Joseph, Benny Behnan, and Thiruvanchoor Radhakrishnan\n\nWith just a day left to mark the first death anniversary of former Chief Minister and Congress stalwart Oommen Chandy, a storm appears to be brewing within the 'A' group over the formation of a charitable society in his memory.\n\nThe Oommen Chandy Foundation, a brainchild of Chandy Oommen, MLA, son of the late leader, has been launched without consulting the Congress and has excluded close confidants of the late leader like K.C. Joseph, Benny Behnan, and Thiruvanchoor Radhakrishnan. While these leaders have not publicly aired their grievances, Mr. Oommen's independent actions have stoked a fire of discontent, particularly among the 'A' group leaders.\n\nThe foundation will be formally unveiled on July 18, the first death anniversary of Oommen Chandy. According to Mr. Oommen, the foundation and its office will be inaugurated by AICC general secretary K.C. Venugopal in Kottayam on the late leader's commemoration day.\n\nRumours are doing the rounds that senior 'A' group leaders will boycott the events organised by the foundation in Puthuppally on July 18. Instead, they will be present at a separate commemoration event organised by the District Congress Committee at Mamman Mappila Hall in Kottayam on the same day.\n\nMiffed at the development, the senior 'A' group leaders are also plotting to establish a foundation in Oommen Chandy's name on their own. \"The party will proceed with an earlier decision by the KPCC to establish a foundation in Oommen Chandy's name,\" a Congress leader, speaking on condition of anonymity, revealed.\n\n'Apolitical initiative'\n\nMr. Chandy, on his part, brushed off the allegations, asserting that the initiative is apolitical. \"I am the only politician in the foundation. The other trustee member is based in Qatar,\" he said.\n\nHe emphasised that numerous leaders are involved in the organising committee to host the foundation's programmes, though they are not official members. To back his point, he referenced the Ashraya Foundation established by Oommen Chandy. \"Even I was not a member of Ashraya, which had only people from Puthuppally as its members. However, we have been consulting with the Ashraya foundation,\" he explained.\n\nRead Comments", "source": {"uri": "thehindu.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Hindu"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oommen_Chandy", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Oommen Chandy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K._C._Venugopal", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "K.

His property was at risk of being confiscated and Puthusseri sought Chandy's help in extending the repayment period for the loan.\n\nChandy tried getting in touch with one of the directors of the bank, but his call went unanswered. After trying for nearly an hour and a half without success, Chandy advised them to hold on to hope as he pursued other avenues. Disheartened, they left the CM's office, in the feeling that nothing would come of their visit.\n\nHowever, they had reached Pattom on their way back, when Puthusseri received a call from Chandy asking them to return immediately. The CM had managed to contact the bank's director and resolve the issue. \"That was Oommen Chandy. He never made false promises,\" recounts Puthusseri.\n\nA year after Chandy's passing on July 18, people continue to flock to his tomb at St George Orthodox Church in Puthuppally, showcasing his enduring mass appeal.

But his memories are alive and fresh. How do you look back on a year without him?\n\nI have never felt that my father was not with me. Because the people who were with him are with us now. All those who felt they were orphaned by Oommen Chandy's demise have been with me. And I am with them because I feel the same way.\n\nPeople who were with him did not make us feel his absence. The Congress too has treated us the same way. People of Puthuppaly give me more love than they used to give him. They are aware of his absence. So they give more love and care than they gave him.\n\nYou entered electoral politics suddenly. How strong was the legacy of Oommen Chandy? Does that shade reduce the political heat? Are you worried that you now have to travel alone?\n\nI am not worried at all. I think he is always with me. I am nothing without him. Wherever I go, his name is the first people take. At many programmes, instead of saying Chandi Oommen, they call out Oommen Chandi. In a recent function, someone read my father's profile as my profile. I think Oommen Chandy is still in the mind of the person who wrote it. I think that is my strength.\n\nFor OC (as the former CM was called), people were at the centre of his politics. He would make quick decisions and would go out on his limbs to get them implemented. How much have you copied that in your politics?\n\nHe was ready ready to face any situation. He could turn any adversity into his advantage. He could see the bright side of the worst criticism he faced. And he implemented that in his life. It is impossible to copy him. I am trying to follow in his footsteps.\n\nWhen Appa held the public relations programme in Kottayam, he was among the people without rest from the morning. I was involved in supplying kanji (rice porridge) for those who came there. Then some reports noted that 'Oommen following the footsteps of Chandy'.\n\nI also make many quick decisions. But since I don't have as much experience as Appa, it will not be like him. For the development of sports in Puthuppally constituency, about Rs 2 crore have been given to various institutions. However, the government has not yet taken action or permitted to use it.\n\nPolitical opponents still fear Oommen Chandy's achievements on the development front. Even Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan tried to silence such discussions. They even hesitate to mention OC's name. They are creating an alternative to the public outreach programme. How do you view them?\n\nI welcome efforts to erase his legacy. Because no matter how they ignore or insult him, his name and achievements will only shine bright. Because Appa stood for the truth. No amount of insults matters because only truth will survive. Running a public outreach programme is not an easy task. Only those people with his experience can listen to people's complaints for hours together and find a solution immediately.\n\nWhat is one moment you wish you had your father's advice?\n\nDuring the election for sure. It was his great desire to see me contest the election and become a people's representative.\n\nWhen do you miss him the most?\n\nHe used to have solutions for everything. And his decisions were always right. Be it politics, state development, or home affairs, he would make the right decision. I personally thought that his decision regarding the Solar Commission was wrong.\n\nBut time has proven him right.\n\nHow do you view the controversy that senior Congress leaders were not included in the formation of the Oommen Chandy Foundation?\n\nNo senior Congress leader is part of the Ashraya Foundation he formed. Can say he chose to omit leaders like KC Joseph and Thiruvanchoor Radhakrishnan because their relationship had soured? Even I am not there.\n\nWhen I started a foundation, I named it after Oommen Chandy. There is no controversy about it. I spoke to Joseph. He said that he would participate in the commemoration programme in Kottayam and that would put an end to the rumour. Some people are trying to insult our family by circulating fake news. The turf will be inaugurated by Thiruvanchoor.", "source": {"uri": "onmanorama.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "OnManorama"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_minister", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Chief minister"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oommen_Chandy", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Oommen Chandy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puthuppally,_Kottayam", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Puthuppally, Kottayam"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malayala_Manorama", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Malayala Manorama"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Member_of_the_Legislative_Assembly_(India)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Member of the Legislative Assembly (India)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_National_Congress", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Indian National Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_rupee", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Indian rupee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crore", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Crore"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rice", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kottayam", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kottayam"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Kottayam"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fake_news", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fake news"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thiruvanchoor_Radhakrishnan", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Thiruvanchoor Radhakrishnan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kerala_Congress", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kerala Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinarayi_Vijayan", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pinarayi Vijayan"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Romance", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Romance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 85}], "image": "https://img.onmanorama.com/content/dam/mm/en/kerala/top-news/images/2023/8/11/chandy-oommen-66.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9742594", "eventUri": "eng-9742594", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.03529411764705892, "wgt": 200, "relevance": 1}

It was in his second tenure that the solar scam took place.\n\nWritten by John Mundakayam, who headed the Thiruvananthapuram bureau of the Malyala Manorama for several decades, his book contends that the solar scam was orchestrated to politically and personally destroy Oommen Chandy.\n\n\"The opposition believed smearing Chandy's image was essential to regain power, leveraging his popularity from projects like the Kochi Metro Rail and the Vizhinjam project. The scandal began when certain ruling party members conspired with the opposition,\" says Mundakayam.\n\nHe traces the origin of the scam when widespread discussions about solar energy as an alternative to hydroelectric projects and Team Solar led by Biju Radhakrishnan and Saritha S. Nair, emerged.\n\nThey defrauded investors by falsely claiming connections with leaders. When complaints surfaced, both were arrested, sparking rumours about Nair's ties to Chief Minister Chandy. Allegations of her frequent visits to Chandy's office added a political angle to the scandal.\n\n\"The politically motivated allegations scaled the scam to fraudulent schemes worth 10,000 crore rupees and significant losses to the treasury, along with sexual harassment allegations. Despite investigations by state police and the CBI, none of the accusations were proven,\" says the book.\n\nThe book also reveals the political conspiracy involving opposition members, ruling party factions, and the bar mafia who were unhappy with the policy changes.\n\nThe book will be launched a day after Chandy's first death anniversary with numerous functions at the church where he is interred at Puthupally in Kottayam and other places in the state.\n\nCongress leader Shashi Tharoor will launch the book here on July 19 with popular writer Rosemary receiving the first copy.\n\nLeader of the Opposition V.D. Satheesan will preside and former diplomat Venu Rajamani will introduce the book.\n\nInitially, the opposition's accusations were financial but shifted to sexual when investigations found no government support for Team Solar.\n\nThese allegations led to statewide violence and a Secretariat blockade.\n\nMundakkayam writes that he was contacted by fellow journalist and friend, who headed the CPI-M channel Kairali at the time, John Brittas, presently a Rajya Sabha member, to explore options for settling the staged protest.\n\nThe book gives more behind-the-scenes details of CPI-M leaders negotiating with Chandy to end the strike despite John Brittas's denial and attempts to suppress the information.\n\nThe book points out Chandy's secret meeting with Biju Radhakrishnan who was to address a complaint about Nair's relationship with a cabinet member and Chandy despite coming under pressure never revealed about the meeting.

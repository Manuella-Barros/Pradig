Cowser answered with a drive to right-center off Joe Jim\u00e9nez (1-2) that cleared the wall despite an impressive leaping effort by center fielder Michael Harris II.\n\n\"I thought he robbed it at first,\" Cowser said. \"Really glad it went over.\"\n\nCowser entered as a defensive replacement in right field at the start of the eighth, with the Orioles up 2-0. After Olson's homer, he made a nice catch in the corner in foul ground. Then came his one chance at the plate.\n\n\"I knew that if I came into the game, I was going to get an at-bat,\" Cowser said. \"Coaches in the tunnel did a great job, kind of gave me an idea of who I was going to face.\"\n\nCraig Kimbrel worked a perfect ninth against the franchise he's most associated with, earning his 16th save in 19 chances.\n\nAtlanta has dropped five straight for the first time since 2017 -- the last year the Braves didn't win the NL East. They entered Wednesday night 10 games behind first-place Philadelphia.\n\nPovich allowed five hits without a walk and struck out six. The 24-year-old left-hander was called up last week to help a Baltimore staff that lost John Means and Tyler Wells to season-ending injuries. Those problems haven't slowed the Orioles much lately. They've allowed nine runs during this six-game streak.\n\nBaltimore scored two in the third against Spencer Schwellenbach. Cedric Mullins hit a leadoff double, and Jorge Mateo singled and stole second. Mullins came home on Gunnar Henderson's groundout. When Adley Rutschman hit a grounder to first, Olson's throw home was low and skipped past catcher Sean Murphy. Mateo scored to make it 2-0.\n\nPovich allowed six runs in 5 1/3 innings in his debut at Toronto. He permitted a couple singles to start the fourth against Atlanta, then struck out Austin Riley and got out of the jam on a couple grounders. The Braves had two more hits off him in the sixth but didn't score. They've left 18 men on base through the first two games of this series.\n\n\"No walks on the night for our whole pitching staff,\" Orioles manager Brandon Hyde said. \"No walks for Cade Povich. That's something we talked a lot about with him at the end of spring, about command and how important command of your fastball is and being able to land offspeed in fastball counts for strikes. And he did all that tonight.\"\n\nUP NEXT\n\nThe Orioles try for a three-game sweep Thursday, sending Cole Irvin (6-2) to the mound against Reynaldo L\u00f3pez (3-2).\n\nAP MLB:

The crew open with Nebraska baseball in the NCAA Stillwater Regional and how the trip can show the Huskers how much...\n\nSpencer Schwellenbach and Cade Povich stood together during batting practice inside Camden Yards on Tuesday evening in Baltimore. Catching up before they clash.\n\nThe two former Nebraska pitchers had plenty to talk about ahead of an historic major-league meeting of past Huskers. NU hurlers have gone on to make a combined 563 MLB starts spanning nearly a full century, but never have two started a game against each other at baseball's highest level.\n\nUntil now. Two old Big Red teammates from 2020 and 2021 who were drafted 39 picks apart three years ago. Schwellenbach, the right-hander with the Atlanta Braves. Povich, the lefty with the Orioles. They're set to pitch against each other at 5:35 p.m. central with the game streaming on MLB.TV and Fubo and on MLB Extra Innings.\n\n\"We've stayed in touch pretty much since then,\" Povich told local reporters this week. \"We've been talking about it this last week, basically, and how cool it's going to be. We're both really excited.\"\n\nBoth are in their debut major-league seasons, finding opportunities amid other injuries to the Atlanta and Baltimore rotations. Schwellenbach owns an 8.38 earned-run average in two starts -- five innings against the Nationals and 4 2/3 at Boston -- with nine strikeouts, three walks and 12 hits allowed. Povich made his first MLB start last week, lasting 5 1/3 frames in Toronto striking out a pair with five hits and four walks allowed.\n\nRare are other instances when former Nebraska pitchers could have met on the mound. Joba Chamberlain (New York Yankees) and Brian Duensing (Minnesota Twins) combined to start 40 games in 2009 but never against each other. Past Huskers Bob Sebra and Tim Burke were both with Montreal in 1986 and started a total of 15 contests that season.\n\nIt's possible a third NU pitcher could also see action Wednesday in Braves reliever Aaron Bummer. Bummer -- taken in the 19th round in 2014 -- has thrown 22 innings this season and last pitched Sunday.\n\nSchwellenbach is the Braves No. 3 prospect via MLB Pipeline while Povich is No. 9 for the Orioles.\n\nSchwellenbach -- from Saginaw, Michigan -- was one of the biggest recruiting wins for former NU coach Darin Erstad and became a star shortstop and closer for the Huskers while being named college baseball's best two-way player in 2021. Povich is a Bellevue West graduate who began his college career playing juco ball and was Nebraska's first commitment under coach Will Bolt.\n\nAnother former Nebraska pitcher last in Lincoln in 2019, Matt Waldron, is slated to make his 14th start this season with San Diego on Friday evening against the New York Mets.\n\nPhotos: 2024 Big Ten Baseball Tournament Championship", "source": {"uri":

Cowser answered with a drive to right-center off Joe Jim\u00e9nez (1-2) that cleared the wall despite an impressive leaping effort by center fielder Michael Harris II.\n\n\"I thought he robbed it at first,\" Cowser said. \"Really glad it went over.\"\n\nCowser entered as a defensive replacement in right field at the start of the eighth, with the Orioles up 2-0. After Olson's homer, he made a nice catch in the corner in foul ground. Then came his one chance at the plate.\n\n\"I knew that if I came into the game, I was going to get an at-bat,\" Cowser said. \"Coaches in the tunnel did a great job, kind of gave me an idea of who I was going to face.\"\n\nCraig Kimbrel worked a perfect ninth against the franchise he's most associated with, earning his 16th save in 19 chances.\n\nAtlanta has dropped five straight for the first time since 2017 -- the last year the Braves didn't win the NL East. They entered Wednesday night 10 games behind first-place Philadelphia.\n\nPovich allowed five hits without a walk and struck out six. The 24-year-old left-hander was called up last week to help a Baltimore staff that lost John Means and Tyler Wells to season-ending injuries. Those problems haven't slowed the Orioles much lately. They've allowed nine runs during this six-game streak.\n\nBaltimore scored two in the third against Spencer Schwellenbach. Cedric Mullins hit a leadoff double, and Jorge Mateo singled and stole second. Mullins came home on Gunnar Henderson's groundout. When Adley Rutschman hit a grounder to first, Olson's throw home was low and skipped past catcher Sean Murphy. Mateo scored to make it 2-0.\n\nPovich allowed six runs in 5 1/3 innings in his debut at Toronto. He permitted a couple singles to start the fourth against Atlanta, then struck out Austin Riley and got out of the jam on a couple grounders. The Braves had two more hits off him in the sixth but didn't score. They've left 18 men on base through the first two games of this series.\n\n\"No walks on the night for our whole pitching staff,\" Orioles manager Brandon Hyde said. \"No walks for Cade Povich. That's something we talked a lot about with him at the end of spring, about command and how important command of your fastball is and being able to land offspeed in fastball counts for strikes. And he did all that tonight.\"\n\nUP NEXT\n\nThe Orioles try for a three-game sweep Thursday, sending Cole Irvin (6-2) to the mound against Reynaldo L\u00f3pez (3-2).", "source": {"uri":

Big Ten Baseball shared the news on its X (formerly Twitter) account as Schwellenbach will be the starting pitcher for the Atlanta Braves and Povich will star for the Baltimore Orioles. The game will be played at Camden Yards at 6:35 p.m. ET.\n\nSchwellenbach made his MLB debut on May 29 against the Washington Nationals. In the game, the 24-year-old allowed three earned runs on five hits in five innings. Schwellenbach made another start on June 5 against the Boston Red Sox and allowed six earned runs on seven hits in 4.2 innings. He is still looking for his first win in the big leagues.\n\nPovich made his first MLB start last week. Like Schwellenbach, Povich struggled, allowing six runs on five hits and four walks in 5.1 innings or work. He was called up against pitching at Triple-A Norfolk.\n\nSchwellenbach and Povich were standout players at Nebraska. During the 2021 season, the Cornhuskers reached the Fayetteville Retional of the NCAA Division I baseball tournament. Schwellenbach won the John Olerud Award which is given to the nation's best two-way player after finishing the season with a .284 batting average while posting 0.57 ERA in 18 pitching appearances. Povich recorded a 3.11 ERA, 88 strikeouts, an opponent batting average of .244 and a 6-1 record.\n\nAfter Schwellenbach made his MLB debut, Braves manager Brian Snitker shared his thoughts on the young pitcher. \"I thought his stuff was real good,\" said, per ESPN. \"He handled himself really well, I thought. It was very impressive, I thought.\"\n\nBefore making his debut Povich talked about taking that next step after having success in the minors. \"I definitely feel like I'm ready,\" he said on Glenn Clark Radio in April, per PressBoxOnline.com \"Obviously up there, it's a whole other ballgame still and you're not going to fully know until you're actually in there,\" Povich said. \"Everything feels good. I feel like I've been able to figure out some of the struggles that I've had in the past and understand what I need to work on and how I need to work on certain things, kind of backtrack in a way. I'm just trying to take it one game at a time, one pitch at a time and just see where it takes me.\"", "source": {"uri": "on3.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "On3"}, "authors": [{"uri":

The Braves lost all three games against the host Los Angeles Dodgers in early May.\n\nAtlanta is assured of being held without a series victory for the fifth time in its past six chances dating to late May, with the lone bright spot in that stretch winning two of three at home against the Oakland Athletics from May 31 to June 2. The Braves did split a two-game set with the Boston Red Sox over that period, but they also lost three of four to the Washington Nationals twice.\n\nCade Povich pitched six scoreless innings in his second MLB outing for Baltimore on Wednesday, but Atlanta tied it when Matt Olson hit a two-run homer off Keegan Akin (2-0) in the eighth. Cowser answered with a drive to right-center field off Joe Jim\u00e9nez (1-2) that cleared the wall despite an impressive leaping effort by center fielder Michael Harris II.\n\n\"I thought he robbed it at first,\" Cowser said. \"Really glad it went over.\"\n\nCowser entered as a defensive replacement in right field at the start of the eighth with the Orioles up 2-0. After Olson's homer, he made a nice catch in the corner in foul ground. And then came his one chance at the plate.\n\n\"I knew that if I came into the game, I was going to get an at-bat,\" Cowser said. \"Coaches in the tunnel did a great job, kind of gave me an idea of who I was going to face.\"\n\nBaltimore closer Craig Kimbrel worked a perfect ninth against the MLB franchise he is most associated with, earning his 16th save in 19 chances this year.\n\nAtlanta (35-30) has dropped five straight for the first time since 2017 -- the last year the Braves didn't win their division. The Braves are currently second in the NL East, 10 games behind the league-leading Philadelphia Phillies and four games ahead of the division's third-place Nationals.\n\nPovich allowed five hits without a walk and struck out six batters for the Orioles (45-22), who are second in the American League East behind the MLB-leading New York Yankees. The 24-year-old left-hander was called up last week to help a staff that lost John Means and Tyler Wells to season-ending injuries.\n\nThose problems haven't slowed the Orioles much lately. They've allowed all of nine runs during this six-game streak.\n\nBaltimore scored two runs in the third against Spencer Schwellenbach. Cedric Mullins hit a leadoff double, and Jorge Mateo singled and stole second. Mullins came home on Gunnar Henderson's groundout. When Adley Rutschman hit a grounder to first, Olson's throw home was low and skipped past catcher Sean Murphy. Mateo scored to make it 2-0.\n\nPovich allowed six runs in 5 1/3 innings in his debut against the host Toronto Blue Jays last Thursday. He permitted a couple singles to start the fourth against Atlanta, then struck out Austin Riley and got out of the jam on a couple grounders. The Braves had two more hits off him in the sixth but didn't score.\n\nAtlanta has left 18 men on base through the first two games of this series.\n\n\"No walks on the night for our whole pitching staff,\" Orioles manager Brandon Hyde said. \"No walks for Cade Povich. That's something we talked a lot about with him at the end of spring, about command and how important command of your fastball is and being able to land off-speed (pitches) in fastball counts for strikes. And he did all that tonight.\"\n\nThe scheduled starting pitchers for Wednesday's game are Baltimore left-hander Cole Irvin (6-2, 2.87 ERA) and Atlanta right-hander Reynaldo L\u00f3pez (3-2, 1.85).",

While a number of Huskers have made the Big Show, and even pitched, none have ever been starting pitchers on opposite teams in the same game.\n\nSchwellenbach and the Braves are at Povich and the Orioles at 5:35 p.m. CDT. The game can be seen streamed on MLB.TV and Fubo and on MLB Extra Innings.\n\nAccording to Baseball Reference, the last time two college teammates started against each other was when former Florida Gators Brady Singer and Dane Dunning met in a Royals-White Sox matchup.\n\nIn his two starts for the Braves this season, Schwellenbach is 0-2 with an 8.38 ERA. He has allowed 12 hits, walked three, and struck out nine.\n\nPovich will be making just his second big league start. He lost at Toronto last week, going 5.1 innings with six earned runs on five hits, striking out a pair of Blue Jays.\n\nThese two join Matt Waldron as former Huskers to pitch Major League Baseball games this season.\n\nPovich and Schwellenbach led Nebraska to a winner-take-all regional final at Arkansas in 2021.

Cowser answered with a drive to right-center off Joe Jim\u00e9nez (1-2) that cleared the wall despite an impressive leaping effort by center fielder Michael Harris II.\n\nCraig Kimbrel worked a perfect ninth against the franchise he's most associated with, earning his 16th save in 19 chances.\n\nAtlanta has dropped five straight for the first time since 2017 -- the last year the Braves didn't win the NL East. They entered Wednesday night 10 games behind first-place Philadelphia.\n\nPovich allowed five hits without a walk and struck out six. The 24-year-old left-hander was called up last week to help a Baltimore staff that lost John Means and Tyler Wells to season-ending injuries. Those problems haven't slowed the Orioles much lately. They've allowed nine runs during this six-game streak.\n\nBaltimore scored two in the third against Spencer Schwellenbach. Cedric Mullins hit a leadoff double, and Jorge Mateo singled. Mullins came home on Gunnar Henderson's groundout. When Adley Rutschman hit a grounder to first, Olson's throw home was low and skipped past catcher Sean Murphy. Mateo scored to make it 2-0.\n\nPovich allowed six runs in 5 1/3 innings in his debut at Toronto. He permitted a couple singles to start the fourth against Atlanta, then struck out Austin Riley and got out of the jam on a couple grounders.

Catching up before they clash.\n\nThe two former Nebraska pitchers had plenty to talk about ahead of an historic major-league meeting of past Huskers. NU hurlers have gone on to make a combined 563 MLB starts spanning nearly a full century, but never have two started a game against each other at baseball's highest level.\n\nUntil now. Two old Big Red teammates from 2020 and 2021 who were drafted 39 picks apart three years ago. Schwellenbach, the right-hander with the Atlanta Braves. Povich, the lefty with the Orioles. They're set to pitch against each other at 5:35 p.m. central with the game streaming on MLB.TV and Fubo and on MLB Extra Innings.\n\n\"We've stayed in touch pretty much since then,\" Povich told local reporters this week. \"We've been talking about it this last week, basically, and how cool it's going to be. We're both really excited.\"\n\nPeople are also reading...

Schwellenbach owns an 8.38 earned-run average in two starts -- five innings against the Nationals and 4 2/3 at Boston -- with nine strikeouts, three walks and 12 hits allowed. Povich made his first MLB start last week, lasting 5 1/3 frames in Toronto striking out a pair with five hits and four walks allowed.\n\nRare are other instances when former Nebraska pitchers could have met on the mound. Joba Chamberlain (New York Yankees) and Brian Duensing (Minnesota Twins) combined to start 40 games in 2009 but never against each other. Past Huskers Bob Sebra and Tim Burke were both with Montreal in 1986 and started a total of 15 contests that season.\n\nIt's possible a third NU pitcher could also see action Wednesday in Braves reliever Aaron Bummer. Bummer -- taken in the 19th round in 2014 -- has thrown 22 innings this season and last pitched Sunday.\n\nSchwellenbach is the Braves No. 3 prospect via MLB Pipeline while Povich is No. 9 for the Orioles.\n\nSchwellenbach -- from Saginaw, Michigan -- was one of the biggest recruiting wins for former NU coach Darin Erstad and became a star shortstop and closer for the Huskers while being named college baseball's best two-way player in 2021. Povich is a Bellevue West graduate who began his college career playing juco ball and was Nebraska's first commitment under coach Will Bolt.\n\nAnother former Nebraska pitcher last in Lincoln in 2019, Matt Waldron, is slated to make his 14th start this season with San Diego on Friday evening against the New York Mets.\n\n0 Comments Love 0 Funny 0 Wow 0 Sad 0 Angry 0\n\nTags Omaha.com

Cade Povich dazzled with six scoreless innings in his home debut, but Matt Olson evened the score with a two-run blast in the eighth inning. The mood shifted at Camden Yards, but Colton Cowser restarted the party in a hurry.\n\nAfter entering as a defensive replacement in the seventh inning, Cowser stepped up with one on and one away in the eighth. The rookie received a first-pitch fastball and delivered the swing of the night. The Orioles' unofficial class clown launched a ball that managed to clear the center-field wall and a leaping Michael Harris. The blast provided Baltimore a 4-2 advantage, and Craig Kimbrel slammed the door in the ninth.\n\nPovich delivered the exact type of outing needed to remain in the rotation conversation moving forward. In his first game at Camden Yards, Povich kept Atlanta off the board for six innings. He allowed five hits, struck out six, and did not walk a batter.\n\nThe 24-year-old featured improved command after allowing six earned runs in his major league debut. He threw 63-of-89 pitches for strikes, and struck out at least one batter in each of the first five innings.\n\nPovich retired the side in order to start the game. He danced around a hit by pitch in the second, and retired Ozzie Albies after a two-out single in the third. His first real test came in the fourth inning after consecutive singles by Marcell Ozuna and Olson to start the frame.\n\nThe Nebraska product responded with a perfectly placed curveball that sent Austin Riley down swinging. He nearly ended the inning with a grounder to third base, but Adam Duvall escaped the double play by hustling to first. Since one groundball wasn't enough, Povich generated another quick bouncer from Sean Murphy to end the inning.\n\nPovich struck out two during a clean fifth inning before facing his final test in the sixth. Ozuna managed a one-out single to the Bermuda Triangle in right field, and Riley ripped a two-out liner to the hole at short. Brandon Hyde allowed Povich to face Duvall, and the lefty generated a harmless pop up to end the threat.\n\nDillon Tate did his job in the seventh, but Keegan Akin let the big fly slip in the eighth. Akin allowed a leadoff single to Albies before Olson erased Baltimore's advantage. He managed to complete the inning with a pair of flyouts, but things looked dicey with a few high-leverage relievers unavailable in a tie game.\n\nAdley Rutschman struck out looking to start the bottom half, but Ryan Mountcastle put the go-ahead run on base with an infield single.\n\nCowser took it from there.\n\nKimbrel retired the side with a groundout, strikeout and a lineout to center.\n\nThe Orioles struck first with a pair of runs in the third inning. Cedric Mullins slapped a leadoff double, and Jorge Mateo reached on a bloop single to right. Mateo stole second to place two runners in scoring position, and Olson took the easy out at first on a grounder by Gunnar Henderson.\n\nWith the Birds leading, Rutschman followed with another grounder to first. This time, Olson fired home, but Mateo's speed seemed to impact the throw. The ball sailed beyond the catcher, Mateo touched home plate, and Rutschman slid into second with a 2-0 lead.\n\nMullins notched Baltimore's only multi-hit game, while seven others contributed toward the hit column. The Orioles clinched a series victory, and Baltimore will go for the sweep tomorrow afternoon with Cole Irvin on the mound.\n\nThe night was particularly special for the Nebraska family with Povich facing fellow Husker Spencer Schwellenbach. Schwellenbach did his job with only two runs allowed in six innings, but Povich won the battle.\n\nWhen asked if Povich did enough to remain in Baltimore, Brandon Hyde provided a candid, but non-committal answer. \"Pitching plans are definitely up in the air right now,\" Hyde said. \"We are series to series.\"", "source": {"uri": "camdenchat.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Camden

The eccentric outfielder backed up his rookie teammate, coming off the bench and clobbering a go-ahead, two-run homer in the eighth to propel Baltimore to a 4-2 win over the Braves. The Orioles have won six straight games and are a season-high 23 games above .500.\n\nCowser, who entered as a defensive replacement in the top of the eighth, pounced on a first-pitch fastball from Braves reliever Joe Jim\u00e9nez and deposited it 392 feet, just past the outstretched arm of center fielder Michael Harris II. As the 24-year-old neared second base and realized it was a homer, he high-stepped in excitement like a youngster hitting his first blast.\n\nCowser emerged this season as a near-everyday player and an American League Rookie of the Year candidate. However, he's slumped recently with just two long balls since he was named the AL's Rookie of the Month for his scorching-hot April. His last big fly was May 26, and by the reaction from the announced crowd of 24,122 at Oriole Park and their loud moos, it was well worth the wait.\n\nIn his first start in front of Baltimore fans, Povich was masterful, looking wise beyond his years and flummoxing Braves hitters without issuing a single walk. The Orioles youngster, aided by speedsters Cedric Mullins and Jorge Mateo providing the offense, was in line for his first win before Olson's 420-foot shot off reliever Keegan Akin.\n\nPovich, a top 100 prospect in Baseball America's rankings, made his debut in Toronto last week, allowing six runs across 5 1/3 innings for what manager Brandon Hyde described as an unlucky stat line. Wednesday, his six strikeouts, zero walks and zero runs allowed on five hits accurately depicted how dominant he was -- a flash of the type of pitcher the southpaw can be.\n\nCloser Craig Kimbrel came in for the ninth and maintained his recent dominance, retiring the side in order for the 433rd save -- fifth on MLB's all-time list -- of his distinguished career.", "source": {"uri":

Video courtesy of Oklahoma State Athletics.\n\nA dream night of former Nebraska pitchers in a major-league game disappointed only in that none of them got the win.\n\nThe first-ever matchup of past Huskers starting against each other at the MLB level didn't disappoint Wednesday night at Camden Yards in Baltimore. Braves right-hander Spencer Schwellenbach and Orioles lefty Cade Povich each threw exactly six innings and 89 pitches in a true pitchers duel the home team eventually won 4-2.\n\nPovich -- in his second outing in the majors -- fired six shutout innings with five hits allowed, no walks and six strikeouts. The Bellevue West graduate departed in line his first win before the bullpen blew the 2-0 lead in the seventh.\n\nSchwellenbach also enjoyed his best career appearance in his third MLB start. His only damage came in the third after a double and bloop single set up consecutive Orioles RBI groundouts. He otherwise mostly cruised, mixing a mid-90s fastball with a deceptive changeup and low slider. The former Big Red shortstop stabbed a liner in the fourth to start a double play and fanned three overall.\n\nThe combined line for the NU teammates in 2020 and 2021: 12 innings, 2 runs, 2 walks and nine strikeouts.\n\nThe game included two other Husker ties in Braves reliever Aaron Bummer -- drafted after the 2014 season -- and Cody Asche, the 2011 Nebraska All-America infielder who is the Orioles' hitting coordinator. Bummer came on in a two-on, two-out jam in the seventh and coaxed a groundout to first base on four pitches.\n\nNebraska coach Will Bolt watched the game from a few rows up behind home plate inside Camden Yards. He visited the Orioles broadcast booth in the top of the second and spoke with the Braves' field reporter in the bottom of the third recounting stories about the 24-year-old starters taken a round apart in the 2021 draft.\n\n\"It's like a proud papa -- it's pretty sentimental thinking about their journey,\" Bolt said. \"... To see them fulfill their dream , especially this quickly, to get to the big leagues? Very, very proud.\"\n\nBolt grinned that the only thing he was rooting for was a low-scoring game. \"He's got the curveball going tonight it looks like, so that's a good thing,\" the coach said in the second inning when Povich whiffed Sean Murphy on a curveball in the dirt.\n\nFamily of both starters was on hand along with NU academic advisor Katie Jewell and former Huskers baseball athletic trainer Jerry Weber. All posed for pictures afterward, including Povich and Schwellenbach swapping jerseys.\n\nSchwellenbach said before the game that Povich had texted him congratulations when he was called up from Double-A last month. He repaid the favor last week. The two then began to realize their next starts might actually align.\n\n\"I was like, 'Dude, we're going to be pitching against each other!'\" Schwellenbach said during a Bally Sports interview.\n\nAs the zeroes piled up into the third inning, former Husker Kyle Perry -- a teammate of both starters -- jokingly posted on social media that Schwellenbach, a college shortstop, should \"grab a bat.\"\n\nO's manager Brandon Hyde afterward said the headline for Povich's outing was no walks -- the southpaw threw 63 of 89 pitches for strikes. The team remains series to series with its pitching decisions amid injuries and a stretch loaded with games.\n\n\"The way he kept them off balance was so impressive,\" Hyde said. \"... That was everything we needed and more.\"\n\nPovich said he \"could feel my body a little bit more\" in his second start in front of a crowd of 24,122. Having it happen with his former teammate on the other side made it better. They shared an embrace on the field afterward.\n\n\"It was just awesome, a special moment,\" Povich said.\n\nSchwellenbach is the Braves No. 3 prospect via MLB Pipeline while Povich is No. 9 for the Orioles. NU hurlers had gone on to make a combined 563 MLB starts spanning nearly a full century but never had two started a game against each other in nearly a century until Wednesday.\n\nSchwellenbach -- from Saginaw, Michigan -- was one of the biggest recruiting wins for former NU coach Darin Erstad and became a star shortstop and closer for the Huskers while being named college baseball's best two-way player in 2021. Povich began his college career playing juco ball and was Nebraska's first commitment under coach Will Bolt.\n\nPhotos: 2024 Big Ten Baseball Tournament Championship", "source": {"uri": "omaha.com",

Braves right-hander Spencer Schwellenbach and Orioles lefty Cade Povich each threw exactly six innings and 89 pitches in a true pitchers duel the home team eventually won 4-2.\n\nPovich - in his second outing in the majors - fired six shutout innings with five hits allowed, no walks and six strikeouts. The Bellevue West graduate departed in line his first win before the bullpen blew the 2-0 lead in the seventh.\n\nSchwellenbach also enjoyed his best career appearance in his third MLB start. His only damage came in the third after a double and bloop single set up consecutive Orioles RBI groundouts. He otherwise mostly cruised, mixing a mid-90s fastball with a deceptive changeup and low slider. The former Big Red shortstop stabbed a liner in the fourth to start a double play and fanned three overall.\n\nPeople are also reading...

Bummer came on in a two-on, two-out jam in the seventh and coaxed a groundout to first base on four pitches.\n\nNebraska coach Will Bolt watched the game from a few rows up behind home plate inside Camden Yards. He visited the Orioles broadcast booth in the top of the second and spoke with the Braves' field reporter in the bottom of the third recounting stories about the 24-year-old starters taken a round apart in the 2021 draft.\n\n\"It's like a proud papa - it's pretty sentimental thinking about their journey,\" Bolt said. \"...To see them fulfill their dream, especially this quickly, to get to the big leagues? Very, very proud.\"\n\nBolt grinned that the only thing he was rooting for was a low-scoring game. \"He's got the curveball going tonight it looks like, so that's a good thing,\" the coach said in the second inning when Povich whiffed Sean Murphy on a curveball in the dirt.\n\nFamily of both starters was on hand along with NU academic advisor Katie Jewell and former Huskers baseball athletic trainer Jerry Weber. All posed for pictures afterward, including Povich and Schwellenbach swapping jerseys.\n\nSchwellenbach said before the game that Povich had texted him congratulations when he was called up from Double-A last month. He repaid the favor last week. The two then began to realize their next starts might actually align.\n\n\"I was like, 'Dude, we're going to be pitching against each other!'\" Schwellenbach said during a Bally Sports interview.\n\nAs the zeroes piled up into the third inning, former Husker Kyle Perry - a teammate of both starters - jokingly posted on social media that Schwellenbach, a college shortstop, should \"grab a bat.\"\n\nO's manager Brandon Hyde afterward said the headline for Povich's outing was no walks - the southpaw threw 63 of 89 pitches for strikes. The team remains series to series with its pitching decisions amid injuries and a stretch loaded with games.\n\n\"The way he kept them off balance was so impressive,\" Hyde said. \"...That was everything we needed and more.\"\n\nPovich said he \"could feel my body a little bit more\" in his second start in front of a crowd of 24,122. Having it happen with his former teammate on the other side made it better. They shared an embrace on the field afterward.\n\n\"It was just awesome, a special moment,\" Povich said.\n\nSchwellenbach is the Braves No. 3 prospect via MLB Pipeline while Povich is No. 9 for the Orioles. NU hurlers had gone on to make a combined 563 MLB starts spanning nearly a full century but never had two started a game against each other in nearly a century until Wednesday.\n\nSchwellenbach - from Saginaw, Michigan - was one of the biggest recruiting wins for former NU coach Darin Erstad and became a star shortstop and closer for the Huskers while being named college baseball's best two-way player in 2021. Povich began his college career playing junior college ball and was Nebraska's first commitment under coach Will Bolt.\n\n0 Comments Love 0 Funny 0 Wow 0 Sad 0 Angry 0\n\nTags Omaha.com

The eccentric outfielder backed up his rookie teammate, coming off the bench and clobbering a go-ahead, two-run homer in the eighth to propel Baltimore to a 4-2 win over the Braves. The Orioles have won six straight games and are a season-high 23 games above .500.\n\nCowser, who entered as a defensive replacement in the top of the eighth, pounced on a first-pitch fastball from Braves reliever Joe Jim\u00e9nez and deposited it 392 feet, just past the outstretched arm of center fielder Michael Harris II. As the 24-year-old neared second base and realized it was a homer, he high-stepped in excitement like a youngster hitting his first blast.\n\nCowser emerged this season as a near-everyday player and an American League Rookie of the Year candidate. However, he's slumped recently with just two long balls since he was named the AL's Rookie of the Month for his scorching-hot April. His last big fly was May 26, and by the reaction from the announced crowd of 24,122 at Oriole Park and their loud moos, it was well worth the wait.\n\nIn his first start in front of Baltimore fans, Povich was masterful, looking wise beyond his years and flummoxing Braves hitters without issuing a single walk. The Orioles youngster, aided by speedsters Cedric Mullins and Jorge Mateo providing the offense, was in line for his first win before Olson's 420-foot shot off reliever Keegan Akin.\n\nPovich, a top 100 prospect in Baseball America's rankings, made his debut in Toronto last week, allowing six runs across 5 1/3 innings for what manager Brandon Hyde described as an unlucky stat line. Wednesday, his six strikeouts, zero walks and zero runs allowed on five hits accurately depicted how dominant he was -- a flash of the type of pitcher the southpaw can be.\n\nCloser Craig Kimbrel came in for the ninth and maintained his recent dominance, retiring the side in order for the 433rd save -- fifth on MLB's all-time list -- of his distinguished career.\n\nBaltimore is 45-22 and two games back of the AL East-leading New York Yankees, whose game Wednesday versus the Kansas City Royals has yet to conclude.", "source": {"uri": "baltimoresun.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The

Was Wednesday night's Camden Yards debut one of the best games he has ever pitched in his life?\n\n\"It's hard to compare to minor league games,\" he said. Then the 24-year-old rookie thought, and walked it back a bit. \"I think when you can go six shutout against a team like the [Atlanta] Braves in a major league game, it's definitely up there.\"\n\nThrough those six scoreless frames, Povich struck out six, allowed five hits and walked none. Outside of a second-inning hit-by-pitch, manager Brandon Hyde said the performance was \"everything we needed and more.\" \"Unbelievable,\" was another word Hyde used after the 4-2 win, the Orioles' sixth straight.\n\nTo the big league stage, this is all new. The left-handed starter was called up last week and made his major league debut in Toronto -- a better-than-it-looks six-run, five-hit introduction.\n\nPovich's latest start was his first time at Camden Yards not watching from the stands or, more recently, without there being snow on the ground. And the opposite starting pitcher, Spencer Schwellenbach, was a former teammate at Nebraska. That meant -- whether it was his best game ever or not -- family members, trainers, friends and former coaches were all in attendance to see it.\n\nThrough all the ancillary notes to the infant stage of a career in which he's still finding his footing, to those who have known him longer than these two starts, this performance is no surprise.\n\n\"I mean, he throws like [Max] Fried,\" Schwellenbach said, comparing the rookie with his Braves teammate, the best left-handed starter in baseball. \"When he gets on the mound, you know what you're gonna get. [At Nebraska] every Friday, when he'd come out and throw, you knew you were gonna get zero, maybe one run.\"\n\nNebraska coach Will Bolt watched Wednesday's quality start with Povich's family from their seats back up behind home plate. Bolt was washed over by such pride being in attendance.\n\nHe harkened back to his favorite Povich memory.\n\nIt was late May 2021, mere months before he was drafted at No. 98 overall by the Minnesota Twins. The Cornhuskers returned home for their final series of the regular season against Michigan. They already clinched the top seed in the Big Ten Conference, and after a spring marred by COVID-related attendance restrictions, they were greeted by a season-high 5,434 fans.\n\nPovich pitched that night in Lincoln, Nebraska. The game itself didn't bare much extrinsic weight, similar to Povich's home debut at Camden Yards. But like Wednesday night, he took to the mound before a crowd wearing the same colors as him, yearning to see him pitch.\n\n\"He had an immaculate inning in the first inning,\" Bolt deadpanned, before flashing a grin. \"Ready for the moment. ... Just another ah-ha moment for Cade Povich of just like, this guy is destined for some big things.\"\n\nPovich didn't impress quite so immediately in this one. Although there were signs of the composed nature -- this time in front of 24,122 fans -- lauded by those who know him well.\n\nLike in the sixth inning, when the Braves had two runners on base with two outs. Pitching coach Drew French paid Povich a mound visit, but the Orioles left him in. Povich delivered two 91 mph fastballs and escaped the jam on the latter with popout from Adam Duvall.\n\n\"He's very unbothered by the moment,\" Orioles relief pitcher Bryan Baker said. \"He's just kind of our there doing his thing.\"\n\nBaker, who is on the Orioles' active roster for the first time this season, spent the early portion of this spring with Povich in Triple-A Norfolk. The 29-year-old couldn't pinpoint specific moments emblematic of Povich's ice-cold nature on the mound but rather waxed eloquently about the sum of the parts from those two shared months.\n\n\"Especially this year, pitch count would get high a little bit every once in a while, but they struggle to string together multiple hits in the same inning off of him, it's very evident,\" Baker said. \"It's like he knows he needs to get out of the inning or whatever it may be. It just seems like he's not really amped up by the moment. It seems like he's steady. It may not be that way but appears that way.\"\n\nNerves can be a cruel offender.\n\nPovich acknowledged he's finally starting to feel his body again two starts in. He ate breakfast fine and did a better job of getting lunch down before Wednesday's start.\n\n\"It's still baseball,\" Povich said. \"So just kind of calming everything down. Making pitches. ... I know I have an unbelievable defense behind me and all I gotta do is fill up the zone.\"\n\nPovich joined the Orioles organization at the 2022 deadline as the biggest piece in the at-the-time controversial trade of All-Star closer Jorge L\u00f3pez. He methodically rose up Baltimore's farm system, reaching an apex this spring as he lowered his walks and was recognized as a top 100 prospect by Baseball America.\n\nAny advice for this early stint now with his two debuts in the rearview mirror?\n\n\"The only thing I would tell him is keep doing what he's doing,\" Baker said. \"He's got the stuff. Being around it a lot more this season, it's very impressive. He's the kind of guy that you just gotta make sure he goes right at guys because his stuff is that good.\"\n\nBaker called his teammate's fastball \"invisible.\" \"There are a lot of terms for it,\" he said, plainly meaning Povich hides the pitch well, making it tough for batter's to recognize. \"But it's sneaky. It's a good heater.\"\n\nLive pitching aside, Povich is impressing those around the Orioles' clubhouse with his approach.\n\n\"He came into that start in Toronto prepared,\" Hyde said. \"It wasn't just a one-sided conversation, but he actually did some homework before he faced him. That shows you a lot about who he is and how important this is to him and the professionalism part. So, yeah, I've been really impressed with how he's gone about his business so far.\"\n\nRelief pitcher Danny Coulombe is noticing how much the new guy wants to learn. Catcher James McCann, who was behind the plate last Wednesday, said \"his poise, his demeanor coming in, first big league start, I was impressed.\"\n\nBolt saw the same head-in-the-books study patterns at Nebraska.\n\nPovich often picked the brain of their pitching coaches. He was intentional about getting the most out of every bullpen session. He was taking note of his teammates too, Bolt said, talking grips and other approaches.\n\n\"You could just kind of tell right away,\" Bolt said, \"that he was gonna be that type of kid that really soaked it all in.\"\n\nThe biggest difference between his first start in Toronto and second back in Baltimore?\n\n\"I was more prepared learning from some of our other starters throughout this week,\" Povich said. \"Picked up on some cues just to be prepared going into the start with [knowing] who I'm facing.\"\n\nTo Orioles fans, Povich's outing was a sign of another potentially fruitful option in an ever-in-flux rotation. To his longtime teammates and Nebraska kin, he's the former 6-foot-3 high schooler who was 165 pounds soaking wet and believed he could make it.\n\nThey see the kid who threw 80 mph as a junior in high school then played at South Mountain Community College in Phoenix, Arizona. Yet still, always harbored the self belief to get here.\n\n\"He was at the bottom of the litter,\" Bolt said. \"And so he had to scrap his way through with that belief that he was good enough to do it. Now that he's all grown up, so to speak, it just really shines through when you have that big presence on the mound now, that used to be the little guy that had to earn everything he got.\"",

This week's leads with a former two-way player whose career path took a different turn. A native of Saginaw, Michigan who played shortstop and served as a closer at the University of Nebraska, Spencer Schwellenbach is currently a member of the Atlanta Braves starting rotation.\n\nHis big-league debut came sooner than expected. The 24-year-old right-hander was drafted in 2021 -- Atlanta selected him in the second round -- but because of Tommy John surgery he didn't take the mound until last year. At the time of his May 29 call-up, Schwellenbach had just 110 minor-league innings under his belt. Moreover, he hadn't thrown a pitch above the Double-A level.\n\nHis two-step call-up is something he'll never forget.\n\n\"They actually told me I was going to Triple-A,\" said Schwellenbach. \"I showed up in Gwinnett, threw a bullpen, and after I got done they asked if I was all packed up to go to Virginia. I said, 'Yeah, I've got all my stuff here.' They were like, 'Well, unpack your stuff, you're throwing in Atlanta on Wednesday.' I was so taken off guard that I didn't know what to say. It was like, 'holy crap.' I called my parents, my fiancee, my brothers, my sister. It was awesome.\"\n\nResults-wise, his two MLB starts -- one against the Washington Nationals and another against the Boston Red Sox at Fenway Park -- have been somewhat less than awesome. While his attributes -- composure paired with a 96-mph fastball and solid secondaries -- were apparent in each outing, he nonetheless allowed nine runs over nine-and-two-thirds innings.\n\nWhich brings us to how he is now on the mound, and not stationed on the infield dirt.\n\n\"I always said that I was a better position player, just because I wanted to be a shortstop,\" Schwellenbach said of his days as a Michigan prep. \"But I was probably a better pitcher. I loved doing both. And honestly, I worked so hard to be a position player -- again, that's what I wanted -- but after I got to college I kind of realized that if I wanted to play as long as I can, I was probably going to have to be a pitcher.\"\n\nWhile that may be true, his numbers at Nebraska show that he was no slouch with the bat; Schwellenbach slashed a solid .282/.405/.423 in his three collegiate seasons. He also threw just 31-and-two-thirds innings as a Cornhusker, all of them in his draft year. An arm ailment that predated his 2021 Tommy John surgery by three years was the reason why.\n\n\"When I got there, I had a little elbow issue,\" explained Schwellenbach, who chose Nebraska over the University of Michigan and Michigan State (the only schools that wanted him as a two-way player). \"The coaches said, 'You know what? Don't even worry about pitching. We love you as an infielder, so just focus on that right now.'\"\n\nIn time, he began to believe that his pitching days were over. His elbow hadn't fully recovered from a procedure he'd had done in 2019, and when the pandemic hit it had been close to two years since he'd toed a slab. In his mind, a return to the mound was... well, it wasn't on his mind at all.\n\nThen something happened when he was back in Saginaw, waiting for the world to return to a semblance of normal.\n\n\"When COVID hit, I had a lot of time at home,\" recalled Schwellenbach. \"I had a hockey net in my backyard, as well as a home plate, and one day I went out there with a bucket of balls and started pitching into the net. I thought to myself, 'Man, I can still do this.' That's when I decided I wanted to pitch again.\"\n\nThat he proceeded to do so with a high level of success -- 10 saves and a 0.57 ERA in his junior year, despite a compromised arm that would soon require surgery -- cemented his future.\n\n\"Scouts thought that my pitching, with a hurt elbow, was better than where I was position player-wise,\" said Schwellenbach. \"The [Braves] took a chance on me. They thought, 'Let's get his elbow healthy and roll with that.' Obviously, I'm really happy with how it's worked out. My dream was always to play in MLB, and while in those dreams it was as a shortstop, it just so happens that it's as a pitcher.\"\n\nKik\u00e9 Hern\u00e1ndez committed an error during an in-game interview on Friday night. Asked after the game if the interview impacted him on the play, the Los Angeles Dodgers third baseman said, \"Maybe a little bit.\" Subsequently asked if he'd reconsider being mic'd up during a game, he replied \"No, because we're getting paid.\"\n\nAccording to the Associated Press story that quoted Hern\u00e1ndez, \"Baseball's collective bargaining agreement calls for a player to receive a $10,000 stipend for wearing a two-way microphone for at least one inning of a regular-season game. The amount rises to $15,000 in the postseason.\" The story went on to say that Dodgers manager Dave Roberts wasn't aware that his third baseman was being interviewed while on the field.\n\nHern\u00e1ndez's suggestion that a stipend makes an error acceptable is questionable, and so is the fact that a broadcast entity -- this particular game was on Apple TV -- is willing to shell out that kind of money for a few minutes of what is often inane banter. That said, at least they're willing to pay for something they feel adds to the broadcast (even if it usually doesn't). The Los Angeles Angels and Toronto Blue Jays continue to have their radio teams call away games remotely rather than send them on the road. That's not simply questionable, it is flat out embarrassing.\n\nCecil Fielder and Prince Fielder each hit 319 home runs. Which of the father-son combo had highest single-season total?\n\nHank Allen, an outfielder who played for three teams -- primarily the Washington Senators -- from 1966-1973 died this past week at age 83. The brother of should-be Hall of Famer Dick Allen and Rod Allen, the Wampum, Pennsylvania native became a scout and a horse trainer after his playing days.\n\nHank Foiles, a catcher who played for seven teams in a career that spanned the 1953-1964 seasons, died in late May at age 94. Primarily employed in a backup role -- he logged just 353 hits -- Foiles represented the Pittsburgh Pirates in the 1957 All-Star Game.\n\n-- -- -\n\nThe answer to the quiz is Cecil Fielder, with 51 home runs with the Detroit Tigers in 1990. Prince Fielder hit 50 for the Milwaukee Brewers in 2007.\n\n-- -- --\n\nAdley Rutschman and Bobby Witt Jr. were the top picks in the 2019 draft. You can have either one going forward. Which are you taking?\n\nI asked that question in a Twitter poll a few days ago, fully expecting a relatively close race. What I got instead was a landslide. Of the more than 1,400 votes cast, 89.2% went to the Kansas City Royals shortstop. The Baltimore Orioles catcher received a paltry 10.8%.\n\nWitt is the younger of the two. He turns 24 later this week, while Rutschman celebrated his 26th birthday back in February. How much of a difference that made to voters is hard to say. Ditto the fact that Witt is off to a spectacular start this season. An early contender for AL MVP, the sweet-swinging infielder has a 159 wRC+ and 4.2 WAR -- which isn't to say that Rutschman hasn't likewise been performing at a high level. Playing a position largely lacking star power, he has a 134 wRC+ and 2.1 WAR.\n\nAs for their respective careers to date, Rutschman has played in 326 games and has a 131 wRC+ and 13.3 WAR, while Witt has played in 372 games and has a 115 wRC+ and 12.4 WAR.\n\nDoes the better future for these young superstars truly belong to Witt? Only time will tell.\n\nFollowing the polling as it went along, I observed Gwynn holding a steady lead only to be ultimately overtaken by Davis. The final results were Davis 29.7%, Gwynn 28.8%, Dawson 26.4%, and Clark 15.1%.\n\nMy vote went to the last-place finisher. Clark -- whose career 138 wRC+ and 50.6 WAR reside in Vladimir Guerrero-David Ortiz territory -- led the senior circuit in several categories that year, most notably on-base percentage (.459) and slugging percentage (.597). Moreover, Clark's 176 wRC+ was not only tops in MLB, it was 20-plus points higher than those of Davis and Gwynn. Even more notably, it was 50-plus points higher than that of Dawson, who as the record books show won the polling that matters most. Thanks largely to league-leading home run (49) and RBI (137) totals, \"The Hawk\" was voted MVP by the BBWAA.\n\nDaichi Ohsera threw the 102nd no-hitter in Japanese baseball history on Friday as the Hiroshima Carp beat the Chiba Lotte Marines 4-0 in inter-league action. The 32-year-old right-hander walked five and fanned two in the 129-pitch effort.\n\nAlso in inter-league action, Livan Moinelo recorded the first base hit of his professional career while also pitching the Fukuoka SoftBanks Hawks to a 10-1 win over the Yokohama DeNa BayStars (NPB's Pacific League has a DH; the Central League does not). A 29-year-old Cuban-born left-hander, Moinelo has a 1.70 ERA in 69 innings.\n\nKazuma Okamoto has 10 home runs to go with a .271/.361/.467 slash line in 249 plate appearances for the Yomiuri Giants. The 27-year-old corner infielder came into the year having averaged 34 home runs over the past six NPB seasons.\n\nGuillermo Heredia has a KBO-best .379 batting average to go with a .425 on-base percentage, .537 slugging percentage, and 150 wRC+ in 252 plate appearances with SSG Landers. The 33-year-old former MLB outfielder joined the Incheon, South Korea-based club prior to last season.\n\nDo Yeong Kim continues to be one of the best young players in Korea's top league. The 20-year-old Kia Tigers third baseman is slashing .346/.391/.602 with 16 home runs in 272 plate appearances. He also has 21 stolen bases in 23 attempts.\n\nDespite his having pitched for 13 seasons, many of you -- especially younger readers of this column -- probably aren't familiar with Ron Perranoski. You should be. The longtime lefty reliever led the National League in appearances three times while pitching for the Los Angeles Dodgers, and twice he led the American League in saves while a member of the Minnesota Twins. Perranoski had a pair of 4.5 bWAR seasons. In 1963, with the Dodgers, he went 16-3 with 21 saves and a 1.67 ERA. In 1969, with the Twins, he went 9-10 with 31 saves and a 2.11 ERA. All told, Perranoski pitched in 737 games, all but one of the bullpen.\n\n-- -- --\n\nJamie Westbrook got his first big-league hit on Wednesday, and it was a long time coming. The soon-to-turn-29-year-old, Boston Red Sox infielder/outfielder has been in pro ball since 2013, and he'd played in over 1,100 games -- with six different organizations, no less -- when he stepped up to the plate at Fenway Park and stroked a pinch-hit single against Atlanta reliever Jimmy Herget.\n\nAfter the game, I asked Braves manager Brian Snitker how much he can appreciate such a moment from the opposing dugout.\n\n\"It's really cool when a kid has worked his way up and went through everything, the grind of baseball, as I well know it,\" said Snitker, who managed in the minors for two decades before finally getting his own big-league opportunity. \"I'm always happy for a player like that when they get that first hit. His family was probably here. His girlfriend, his wife, whatever. Good for him.\"\n\nHouston Astros prospect John Garcia went 5-for-5 with five doubles for the High-A Asheville Tourists on Wednesday. The 23-year-old, Dominican-born catcher/first baseman was drafted out of Grambling State University by the Astros in 2022. He is slashing .287/.369/.446 on the season.\n\nC.J. Kayfus is slashing .353/.448/.612 with eight home runs in 201 plate appearances between High-A Lake County and Double-A Akron. Promoted to the higher of the two levels earlier this week, the 22-year-old outfielder/first baseman was drafted in the third round last year by the Cleveland Guardians out of the University of Miami.\n\nCarson Skipper is 3-0 with three saves, an 0.41 ERA, a 2.03 FIP, and 29 strikeouts in 22 innings for the High-A Spokane Indians. The 24-year-old left-hander in the Colorado Rockies organization was drafted out of Auburn University in 2022.\n\nChandler Champlain has a 3.33 ERA and a 3.55 FIP to go with 61 strikeouts and 42 hits allowed over 54 innings between the Double-A Northwest Arkansas Naturals and the Triple-A Omaha Storm Chasers. The 24-year-old right-hander was acquired by the Kansas City Royals from the New York Yankees in July 2022 as part of the Andrew Benintendi trade.\n\nBraiden Ward -- featured here in Sunday Notes two weeks ago -- has slashed .404/.508/.654 in 66 plate appearances since being promoted to Double-A Hartford. The 25-year-old outfielder/second baseman in the Colorado Rockies organization has a 193 wRC+ between Hartford and High-A Spokane.\n\n-- -- --\n\nLeft on the cutting-room floor from my conversation with Milwaukee Brewers rookie southpaw Robert Gasser -- the feature ran a week ago Thursday -- were his thoughts on experiencing the major leagues for the first time. I asked Gasser what the highlight had been thus far, expecting him to cite his impressive debut performance. What I got instead was something refreshingly different.\n\n\"It's got to be playing at places like this,\" replied Gasser, who was sitting alongside me in the visiting dugout at Fenway Park prior to batting practice. \"This is just my fourth stadium, and the first one that's been outside. The others (Milwaukee, Houston, and Miami) were all indoors. My second outing was actually a day game in Milwaukee with the roof open, but you have that surrounding area, so it still feels like a dome. When you play at a place like this, with all the history, it's really cool. You walk up the steps [into the dugout] and I can only imagine the people who have walked them. It's really cool.\"\n\nLuis Arraez is chasing a third-straight batting title, and he's doing so with a skill set that is no longer highly-valued in MLB. Barry Bloom wrote about it at Sportico.\n\nBryce Rainer is a two-way player projected to go in the top half of the first round of this summer's draft. Cole Jacobson profiled the California prep for MLB Pipeline.\n\nThe Minnesota Twins recently changed their opposing-hitter scouting charts from a nine-box strike zone to halves; up or down, in or out. Tyler Kepner explained why in his must-read Sliders column at The Athletic (subscription required).\n\nElly De La Cruz played in his 162nd MLB game on Friday. Since making his MLB debut on June 6 of last year, the 22-year-old Cincinnati Reds shortstop has 148 hits, 24 home runs, 69 stolen bases, and 4.5 WAR.\n\nJordan Montgomery and Blake Snell have combined to throw 70 innings and allow 61 runs this season. Fellow free agent signing Seth Lugo has thrown 84-and-a-third innings and allowed 21 runs.\n\nBob Gibson gave up a home run to the first batter he faced in the big leagues, Los Angeles Dodgers third baseman Jim Baxes. A decade and a half later, the Hall of Fame right-hander gave up a grand slam to the penultimate batter he faced in the big leagues, Chicago Cubs first baseman Pete LaCock.\n\nSchoolboy Rowe went 43-21 with a 3.57 ERA for the Detroit Tigers across the 1934-1935 seasons. At the plate, he slashed .307/.360/.434 with five home runs over 243 plate appearances.\n\nOn today's date in 1975, Joe Rudi drove in the deciding run in the top of the 15th inning as the Oakland Athletics edged past the Baltimore Orioles 4-3. Vida Blue, who went on to finish the year 22-11 with a 3.01 ERAn over 278 innings, came on to record the final out for the second of his two career saves.\n\nOn today's date in 1933, the Chicago White Sox tied the game with five runs in the ninth inning, then walked off the Detroit Tigers courtesy of a Luke Appling home run in the bottom of the 14th. Ted Lyons, whose 260 wins are the most in White Sox franchise history, threw five scoreless innings in relief for the win.\n\nPlayers born on today's date include Scarborough Green, an outfielder who played for the St. Louis Cardinals in 1997 and for the Texas Rangers in 1999-2000. A native of Creve Coeur, Missouri, Green had a career-best day on September 28, 200 when he logged three hits and swiped five bases.\n\nAlso born on today's date was Mack Wheat, a catcher who played for the Brooklyn Dodgers from 1915-1919 and for the Philadelphia Phillies in 1920-1921. A native of Polo, Missouri, he was the brother of Hall of Fame outfielder Zack Wheat. A third sibling, Buck Wheat, played and managed in the minor leagues.", "source": {"uri": "blogs.fangraphs.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "blogs.fangraphs.com"}, "authors": [{"uri":

Cowser answered with a drive to right-center off Joe Jim\u00e9nez (1-2) that cleared the wall despite an impressive leaping effort by center fielder Michael Harris II.\n\nCraig Kimbrel worked a perfect ninth against the franchise he's most associated with, earning his 16th save in 19 chances.\n\nAtlanta has dropped five straight for the first time since 2017 -- the last year the Braves didn't win the NL East. They entered Wednesday night 10 games behind first-place Philadelphia.\n\nPovich allowed five hits without a walk and struck out six. The 24-year-old left-hander was called up last week to help a Baltimore staff that lost John Means and Tyler Wells to season-ending injuries. Those problems haven't slowed the Orioles much lately. They've allowed nine runs during this six-game streak.\n\nBaltimore scored two in the third against Spencer Schwellenbach. Cedric Mullins hit a leadoff double, and Jorge Mateo singled. Mullins came home on Gunnar Henderson's groundout. When Adley Rutschman hit a grounder to first, Olson's throw home was low and skipped past catcher Sean Murphy. Mateo scored to make it 2-0.\n\nPovich allowed six runs in 5 1/3 innings in his debut at Toronto. He permitted a couple singles to start the fourth against Atlanta, then struck out Austin Riley and got out of the jam on a couple grounders. The Braves had two more hits off him in the sixth but didn't score.

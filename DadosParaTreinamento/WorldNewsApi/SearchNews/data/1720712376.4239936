{"id": 231994876, "title": "Israel extends Al Jazeera ban by 45 days, citing security threat", "text": "A ban on Al Jazeera\u2019s operations in Israel was extended for another 45 days by Israel\u2019s telecoms regulator on Sunday after the cabinet agreed its broadcasts posed a threat to security. A Tel Aviv court last week upheld an initial 35-day ban on Al Jazeera operations in Israel, imposed by the government on national security grounds, which ended on Saturday. In a separate ruling on a petition by Al Jazeera against the closure, Israel\u2019s Supreme Court described the measure against the Qatari-backed broadcaster channel as \u201cprecedent-setting\u201d. It gave Israel\u2019s government until August 8 to offer arguments for \u201cwhy it should not be determined that the Law Preventing a Foreign Broadcaster from Harming National Security\u201d is void. Al Jazeera had told the court it did not incite violence or terrorism and that the ban was disproportionate, court documents showed. The channel, which has criticised Israel\u2019s military operations in Gaza, said it planned to appeal the latest ban extension. The network\u2019s broadcasts on the cable and satellite companies and access to its websites will remain blocked, Israel\u2019s communications ministry said. \u201cWe will not allow the terrorist channel Al Jazeera to broadcast from Israel and endanger our fighters,\u201d said Shlomo Karhi, adding that the law authorised him as communications minister to take such action against foreign broadcasters. \u201cIn light of the seriousness of the damage to the security of the state I am convinced that the closure orders will be extended in the future as well,\u201d he said. Judge Shai Yaniv had said he had been provided with evidence, which he did not specify, of a long-standing and close relationship between the Palestinian Islamist group Hamas and Al Jazeera, accusing the channel of promoting Hamas\u2019 goals. Al Jazeera said it \u201crejects all the minister\u2019s claims, excuses and accusations\u201d. Israeli authorities raided a Jerusalem hotel room used by Al Jazeera as its office on May 5 and said they were shutting the operation down for the duration of the Gaza war.", "summary": "Judge Shai Yaniv had said he had been provided with evidence of a long-standing and close relationship between Hamas and Al Jazeera, accusing the channel of promoting Hamas\u2019 goals.", "url": "https://www.scmp.com/news/world/middle-east/article/3265968/israel-extends-al-jazeera-ban-45-days-citing-security-threat", "image": "https://cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2024/06/09/9f2d6f98-75fa-4f5b-9f76-18d25c64ae1c_e7f80195.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-09 14:03:22", "author": "Reuters", "authors": ["Reuters"], "language": "en", "source_country": "cn", "sentiment": -0.367}

He honoured the invitation and has been detained as I am talking with you,\" an anonymous source at the EFCC told the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN).\n\nThe arraignment, initially scheduled for Tuesday, was postponed due to the EFCC's request to amend the charges.\n\nThis legal proceeding marks Sirika's first trial appearance, bringing significant public and media attention to the case.

However, the defense counsel, Kanu Agabi, sought bail for Sirika based on self-recognition, a request opposed by the prosecutor, Rotimi Jacobs. Despite the opposition, Justice Sylvanus Oriji granted bail to Sirika and his daughter of one hundred million naira each with two sureties in like sum.\n\nThe sureties are required to declare to an affidavit, and failure to meet the bail conditions would result in the defendants being remanded in prison pending compliance. This development follows the detainment of Sirika by the EFCC on April 23 before his arraignment.\n\nThe charges against Sirika include allegations of awarding consultancy contracts to Tianaero Nigeria Limited for the startup of Air Nigeria, with Prof. Gabriel Tillman, reportedly an associate of the former Minister, acting as the alter ego of the firm.\n\nTianaero received N1.3 billion for its consultancy services. Additionally, Sirika is accused of awarding a contract worth approximately N1.4 billion for the construction of the apron at Katsina Airport to Al-Duraq Global Investment Limited, a company owned by his daughter and son-in-law.\n\nLast May, following the hasty launch of Nigerian Air, investigative journalist David Hundeyin reported that Sirika was being fraudulent by presenting a rented plane to Nigerians. In his report, Hundeyin noted that that unveiled aircraft, a Boeing 737-800 with registration number, ET-APL, belonged to the Ethiopian Airlines - and was still in active service with the company.\n\nAviation expert and analyst, Captain Ado Sanusi, also said in an interview with ChannelsTV then that it is practically impossible for Nigeria Air to start commercial passenger operation in two days given the rigorous process involved, upholding the Hundeyin's report that the launch was fraudulent.\n\nAlthough in June 2022, Sirika disclosed that the majority shares of 49 percent of the Nigeria Air project will be owned by Ethiopian Airlines, 46 percent by Nigerians while the Federal Government will own just five percent of the shares, the unveiling of just one plane not backed by operational infrastructure, among other things, created doubts and questions about the national carrier.\n\nAgainst this backdrop, the House of Representatives launched an investigation. During the investigation, the Nigerian Airspace Management Agency (NAMA) told members of the committee that the aircraft bearing Nigerian colors was on a chartered flight to Nigeria. According to other stakeholders who confirmed NAMA's disclosure, a chartered flight could be painted in any color and with any inscriptions.\n\nConsequently in June 2023, the House of Representatives declared the launch of Nigerian Air fraudulent, ordering that the national carrier project, which reportedly gulped N85 billion, be suspended immediately.\n\nThe case against Sirika and his co-defendants, which has long been anticipated, is one of several others that allegedly took place under the administration of Buhari. Anti-graft said that this development, like several others, serves as a stark reminder of the persistent challenges posed by deep-rooted corruption in Nigeria's governance system.\n\nThey note that the alleged misappropriation of funds meant for crucial aviation projects reflects a systemic issue that undermines trust in governance and diverts resources away from much-needed infrastructure development. The ramifications of such alleged corruption in public office are profound, particularly in the context of Nigeria's economic development.\n\nSuch corruption not only erodes public confidence but also hampers the country's ability to attract investment and foster sustainable economic growth, they say.\n\nThe current Minister of Aviation, Festus Keyamo, has suspended the Nigerian Air project. Keyamo, who pledged reforms in the aviation sector, announced that all arrangements initiated under Sirika, including the proposed Nigeria Air project, have been halted to facilitate a thorough audit of contracts.", "source": {"uri": "tekedia.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Tekedia"}, "authors": [{"uri": "samuel_nwite@tekedia.com", "name": "Samuel Nwite", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}],

conditions.\n\nSirika was arraigned on a 6-count amended criminal charge before the court.\n\nBefore plea taking, the prosecution counsel, Rotimi Jacobs SAN, informed the court of an amended charge by the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) dated May 7, and filed on May 8, which was not opposed by Counsel to the defendants.\n\nAfter the charge was read and the defendants had pleaded not guilty, Jacobs urged the court for expeditious hearing of the case.\n\nAt this juncture, Kanu Agabi SAN, counsel for Sirika (1st defendant) informed the court of his client's bail application dated May 6.\n\nAll the defendants moved their bail applications, and asked the court to be liberal in the bail conditions.\n\nInterjecting, Jacobs told the Court that all the defendants are on administrative bail and urged the court to grant bail on the condition that will make them appear for their trials.\n\nIn his ruling on the bail application, Justice Oriji granted bail to each of the defendants in the sum of 100m with two sureties each.\n\nThe court held that the sureties must own landed property within the FCT with valid land titles.\n\nAlso, the sureties must depose to an affidavit of means.\n\nThe Court also restricted the defendants from traveling abroad without its permission.\n\nTrial has been fixed for 10, 11 and 20 June.\n\nThe EFCC dragged the former minister and others before the court for alleged fraud and abuse of office.\n\nThe ex-minister and others are facing a six-count amended charge to the tune of N4.135b.\n\nThe third defendant arraigned

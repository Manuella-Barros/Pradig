After nearly two years bouncing between hotels, Candice, 33, was so desperate for a home she begged Haringey Council to move her in before renovation works were complete. But she claims the state is so bad that their dog died after swallowing flooded water, her daughter has been bullied, and family wishes they were back in hotels, even with their total lack of privacy. \u2018We\u2019re living in s***\u2019, Candice told Metro.co.uk, \u2018quite literally we\u2019re living in s***.\u2019 Candice, who lives with her son, 15, and daughter, 14, claims the council has not responded to her calls and emails requesting help for a year. Haringey Council said it has sent workers to address a roof leak and a plumbing issue in January and May this year, which Candice confirmed. But when Metro.co.uk visited the house, it appeared these problems were still not fixed. The stench greets you as you step through the front door next to a broken pane of glass covered with a wooden board. There\u2019s a such a steady drip of water from the kitchen ceiling, Candice uses an umbrella when she enters (Picture: Metro.co.uk) \u2018Contaminated\u2019 water leaks from the bathroom down to the kitchen, where Candice has surrendered pots and pans in the sink and a pizza in the oven. She unsheathes an umbrella on the rare occasion she goes inside the flooded room. \u2018We don\u2019t come in here anymore\u2019, Candice said. \u2018We don\u2019t use it. We don\u2019t cook in here, nothing. I order food \u2013 breakfast, lunch dinner. We don\u2019t eat in here. \u2018I don\u2019t know what the connection is between all of it, but the water is in some way contaminated. \u2018Even when I wash the stuff, the stench is there.\u2019 The oven, kitchenware and sink are out-of-bounds in the flooded kitchen (Picture: Metro.co.uk) Candice added: \u2018When it first started, we used to clean it constantly. The amount of cleaning products, then my sister sent her cleaner to help it. \u2018I gave up on it. What\u2019s the point? We were doing this for months.\u2019 The smell is at its worst in the conservatory, sealed behind closed doors with cardboard and a mattress propped against it in a desperate bid to banish the odour. \u2018I can feel it in my brain sometimes, the stench of it\u2019, Candice said. \u2018I cannot breathe.\u2019 Despite the heaters not working, the room feels swampy \u2013 warm and humid like they\u2019re on full blast. The brown water pooled on the floor smells like it\u2019s fresh from a sewer. Washing machines sit in a pool of brown sludge in the conservatory (Picture: Metro.co.uk) \u2018Shower, flush the toilet, anything to do with water, we\u2019re getting it down here\u2019, Candice said. \u2018I\u2019m literally in and out [of the shower]\u2019, she added, \u2018we\u2019ve never had a bath here, ever.\u2019 They can\u2019t use the washing machine either because it\u2019s banished to that back room. Instead they fork out for a laundrette, another cost on top of the ready made meals. Of the downstairs rooms, only the living room is free from flooding. But even there Candice is \u2018suffering\u2019. She sleeps on the sofa so her two kids have rooms of their own. But she moved it three times in a week because mice are chewing away inside. The bathroom floods and water leaks into the rooms below every time the taps are run or toilet is flushed, Candice said (Picture: Metro.co.uk) \u2018When I\u2019m sitting there, I can see the mice running underneath me\u2019, Candice said. \u2018If I didn\u2019t have to sleep on that, it would be outside.\u2019 She showed Metro.co.uk a video in which you can hear a mouse \u2018singing\u2019 as \u2018loud as day\u2019. \u2018I heard that all night. I don\u2019t know what\u2019s happened to it now, but I\u2019ve put some extra mousetraps down.\u2019 At night they hear the rodents \u2018scratching\u2019 inside a hole in the daughter\u2019s bedroom wall. \u2018They move so fast\u2019, Candice said. Next door in her son\u2019s room, the ceiling leaks when it rains, dripping on the 15-year-old while he sleeps or studies for his GCSEs. \u2018We\u2019ve moved my bed to the side, we moved everything\u2019, the teen said. \u2018But that gets wet, my PS5 got wet. Everything just gets wet.\u2019 \u2018I can\u2019t live like this anymore\u2019, Candice told Metro.co.uk (Picture: Metro.co.uk) The family is at breaking point. Candice\u2019s daughter has been bullied at school since she brought friends over to the house. Her son won\u2019t invite any over because he\u2019s embarrassed. Their three-year-old dog died after swallowing some of the water flooding the house, Candice believes. \u2018I\u2019m very angry\u2019, Candice said. \u2018but I\u2019m more angry at the fact that it\u2019s made my relationship with my children a distant one. \u2018We\u2019re not as close as we were before. Everyone is unhappy.\u2019 She said: \u2018I can\u2019t live like this anymore. Mentally and physically I can\u2019t do this. I\u2019m losing it. I\u2019m actually losing it.\u2019 They have nowhere else to live, and despite numerous attempts to contact Haringey Council and arrange repairs, Candice said she hasn\u2019t had a reply since last year. Candice has scattered powder and rat traps around the house to keep away mice and ants (Picture: Metro.co.uk) She said: \u2018It\u2019s basically been going on since we moved in. \u2018There have been odd little things here and there, but because they haven\u2019t rectified anything, it\u2019s just gotten worse every time it keeps happening. \u2018They\u2019ve come out a few times, but now there\u2019s nothing. They don\u2019t respond. They don\u2019t come out.\u2019 Candice added: \u2018It\u2019s not one person I\u2019m contacting. It\u2019s the CEO, the chief executive, my housing manager, someone else in their team. \u2018No one is responding. I\u2019ve CC\u2019d everybody in under one email \u2013 not one of you can respond? They still haven\u2019t responded to my solicitor.\u2019 Candice has been visited by a repair worker this week since Metro.co.uk raised her concerns. A spokesperson for Haringey Council said: \u2018We fully understand and appreciate the concern this is causing Candice and are working hard to resolve the issues. \u2018This is a Private Sector Lease agreement where the council and homeowner will be required to undertake repairs. \u2018We have undertaken several repairs which included attending the property in May 2024 to fix a leak in the bathroom. \u2018We also attended on a few occasions to solve drainage issues with the last known repair carried out in January 2024. \u2018We have not had any new reported incidents since, but we will do a further comprehensive assessment of the drainage systems and investigate the leak to see if any further remedial works are required. \u2018Some of the repairs such as to windows and doors are the responsibility of the property owner and we will chase that up with them. Now that we are aware of the problem with mice infestation, we will immediately investigate. \u2018We are also aware of the issues with the roof, but we were not granted access when we visited the property and have now agreed to do a drone survey.\u2019 Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk.

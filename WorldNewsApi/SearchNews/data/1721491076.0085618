During the summer months, housekeeping \u201cwork becomes even more challenging and potentially hazardous for cleaning crews,\u201d the blog reads. \u201cDuring the summer months, the weather can be hot and humid, which makes it difficult and uncomfortable to clean when the air conditioner is turned off. The combination of heat, humidity, and working in this environment can lead to heat-related illnesses. Therefore, we ask on the days we clean your home, that you have the air conditioning turned on. This will help our employees clean your home efficiently, and will keep them safe and healthy,\u201d it continues.

James joined The Davey Pattison Band when the singer returned to Scotland after spending 40 years in America playing huge arenas and stadiums as lead vocalist with rock groups like Gamma and the Robin Trower Band, as well as releasing two solo albums in the States. Enthusiastic drummer, James usually starts performing with a full set of gnashers, but reckons the vibrations created when battering his drum kit causes the tooth to fall out and he\u2019s left to finish the set with a toothless grin. The offending tooth is a dental crown that has come loose and for the past few months James has been buying dental cement and pushing the tooth back into place hoping this would solve the problem without needing a potentially painful trip to the dentist Now, his bandmates have been urging James, 50, to bite the bullet and visit a dentist to get to the root of the problem before their next gig at The Bungalow, in Paisley on June 29. James, from Wishaw, Lanarkshire said: \u201cIt\u2019s quite embarrassing having to spit out the tooth that\u2019s come loose in the middle of a song and I\u2019m left with this gap at the front of my mouth. \u201cIt\u2019s happened at quite a few gigs now and after each time, I cover the post in dental cement, push it back in and think I\u2019ve sorted the problem myself. \u201cWhen we\u2019re rehearsing I don\u2019t even bother keeping the tooth in and just pull it out until we\u2019re finished.\u201d Davey Pattison joked: \u201cYou always get teething problems when you start a new band, but what\u2019s going on with James is ridiculous! Although, give him his due, when his tooth does fall out he never misses a beat. \u201cHe\u2019s a great drummer and he gives it all he\u2019s got when playing, but no one wants to see a tooth flying through the air in the middle of our set. \u201cAnd to crown it all would be one of the guys in the band getting clouted in the back of the head with James\u2019s tooth. \u201cI really hope he gets it sorted for the gig at The Bungalow later this month.\u201d Go to https://tickets-scotland.com/ for tickets to The Davey Pattison Band gig at The Bungalow, Paisley, on June 29 and to find out if James has got his flying tooth firmly fixed in his mouth.", "summary": "ROCK star singer Davey Pattison always knew there would be teething problems when he started his new band.", "url": "https://www.glasgowworld.com/community/drummer-gets-stick-from-bandmates-as-tooth-keeps-falling-out-when-hes-playing-4669262", "image": "https://www.glasgowworld.com/webimg/b25lY21zOmNhNDMzYWExLTcxZDctNDVkMC1iOTU3LTc5Y2I2OWZhYWQ4MTplMzM3MjQ5Ni05NTQzLTRmYmMtYTBhMi1jZjY3MDE2MTU2YzE=.jpg?width=1200&enable=upscale", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-18 00:01:44", "author": "Norman Macdonald", "authors": ["Norman Macdonald"], "language": "en", "source_country": "gb", "sentiment": -0.425}

The conviction followed a November 2023 conviction on two counts of perjury relating to the withdrawal of funds from the City of Baltimore's Deferred Compensation Plan. She faces up to 40 years in prison.\n\nIn a letter to Biden, the NAACP and 14 other groups argued Mosby was unfairly targeted and convicted \"after enduring the political persecution and malicious prosecution of the Trump Administration's Department of Justice (DOJ).\"\n\n\"We are deeply concerned that the last administration abused their power to advance a meritless indictment against Ms. Mosby and worse, the current administration's U.S. Department of Justice ignored a clear political motive of the malicious prosecution against Ms. Mosby,\" the letter states.\n\nThe groups allege that it was Mosby's commitment to accountability and racial equity that drew the ire of federal officials, including Trump.\n\nIn February 2020, William Barr criticized prosecutors including Mosby in a speech before law enforcement.\n\nFollowing the murder of George Floyd by police, Mosby appeared frequently on national TV and in newspapers as an authority on police misconduct and police prosecutions. When Trump threatened to deploy federal agents to Baltimore in July 2020, Mosby said she would prosecute any federal agents who engaged in unlawful actions against Baltimore citizens.\n\nIn August that year, the letter said, Mosby learned she was under federal investigation, \"a move widely perceived as retaliation for her courageous stance in protecting her constituents' constitutional rights.\"\n\nAccording to the letter, Mosby was wrongfully convicted in November. Though the DOJ argued she did not require the funds she withdrew from the retirement plan because she retained her full salary, the NAACP and other groups said she did meet an objective standard to qualify for the withdrawal.\n\nAdditionally, though 739 individuals withdrew funds from their retirement accounts without being charged for improper withdrawals, including three within her agency, Mosby was the only person charged. She was then denied due process and the opportunity to testify and present exculpatory evidence, the letter states.\n\nHer February conviction was based on the misrepresentation of a $5,000 \"gift\" on a mortgage application. The letter to Biden argued that during the trial, expert testimony confirmed Mosby was improperly advised.\n\nThe letter concludes that the financial implications fall far below the Department of Justice's usual million dollar threshold.\n\n\"We expect that political persecutions and malicious prosecutions pursued during the Trump Administration would not continue in the Biden Administration,\" the letter states. \"Ms. Mosby's case is not the only one -- it is the latest and one of the most egregious cases. This matter should be corrected because it is a miscarriage of justice and an example of the last administration's misuse of authority.\"\n\nThe letter was also signed by Black to the Future Action Fund, Black Voters Matter, Black Women's Roundtable, Color of Change, Fair and Just Prosecution, National Action Network, National Bar Association, National Black Justice Coalition, National Black Law Students Association, National Coalition on Black Civic Participation, National Council of Negro Women, National Urban League and Until Freedom and World Without Genocide.\n\nDerrick Johnson, president and CEO of the NAACP, said Mosby's conviction is an example of how Black Americans are targeted by the justice system.\n\n\"We've watched, decade after decade, as Black Americans have faced wrongful prosecution at the hands of those who seek to promote injustice,\" Johnson said in a statement.\n\n\"The only thing Marilyn Mosby is guilty of is the desire to provide her family with a better life. The sad reality is, as Black women take their rightful places in positions of power, dark forces seek to tear down both their progress, and that of our community. The NAACP refuses to stand idly by as injustice takes the wheel, driving us down a path of further disparity. We are proud to stand alongside our partners in calling on President Biden and the Department of Justice to reemphasize their commitment to racial equity by pardoning Attorney Mosby. Enough is enough. It's time to stand with Black women.\"", "source": {"uri": "thehill.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Hill"}, "authors": [{"uri": "cheyanne_m_daniels@thehill.com", "name": "Cheyanne M.

The defense also is challenging the sentencing guidelines.\n\nThe prosecution has not yet filed its memorandum, so the government's sentencing request remains unknown. Mosby faces a maximum of 40 years in prison, but maximum sentences are rare.\n\nMosby's sentencing memorandum is expected to be filed imminently.\n\nSimultaneously, Mosby is seeking a presidential pardon, an unusual move for a defendant who has not been sentenced. She has spent the past week doing media appearances in which she described the prosecution as politically motivated retribution for her efforts to reform the criminal justice system.\n\nThe NAACP and 14 other civil rights organizations also have joined in calling for Mosby to receive a pardon. The organization's letter claims that Mosby is the victim of a malicious prosecution that began under former President Donald Trump, with whom Mosby publicly tangled.\n\n\"We are deeply concerned that the last administration abused their power to advance a meritless indictment against Ms. Mosby and worse, the current administration's U.S. Department of Justice ignored a clear political motive of the malicious prosecution against Ms. Mosby,\" the coalition of civil rights organizations wrote in their letter.\n\nThe prosecution has taken place under the Biden-nominated U.S. Attorney for Maryland, Erek Barron. His office declined to comment Thursday.\n\nWhile the investigation into her started earlier, Mosby wasn't indicted until January 2022, nearly a year after Biden took office.\n\nMosby has not formally applied for a pardon, according to the Office of the Pardon Attorney, which usually reviews petitions before passing on recommendations to the president. Experts say Mosby may be trying to catch the attention of President Joe Biden in an effort to bypass the formal application process. Presidents can issue pardons at any time, not just after sentencing.\n\nThe White House press secretary was noncommittal this week when asked about pardoning Mosby.\n\nIt's not clear how the pardon campaign will be received at Mosby's May 23 sentencing. In general, judges look favorably on defendants to take responsibility for their actions, but Mosby has remained defiant, insisting that she did nothing wrong by withdrawing money from her city retirement account and using it to put down payments on two Florida vacation properties.\n\nJurors disagreed, finding that Mosby committed perjury when she claimed to have suffered a pandemic-related financial loss in order to pull money out of her retirement account early under federal legislation that offered emergency economic relief during the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nA second jury convicted Mosby of one count of mortgage fraud in February. That verdict centered on the government's claim that Mosby submitted a false \"gift letter\" when she applied for a mortgage on one of the Florida properties.", "source": {"uri": "baltimoresun.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Baltimore Sun"}, "authors": [{"uri": "madeleine_o_neill@baltimoresun.com", "name": "Madeleine O'Neill", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pardon", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pardon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marilyn_Mosby", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Marilyn Mosby"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malicious_prosecution", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Malicious prosecution"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perjury", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Perjury"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mortgage_fraud", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mortgage fraud"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Probation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indictment", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Indictment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/District_attorney", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "District attorney"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_and_political_rights", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Civil and political rights"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defendant", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Defendant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baltimore", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Baltimore"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Baltimore"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NAACP", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NAACP"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criminal_justice", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Criminal justice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Attorney", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Attorney"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Justice", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of Justice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maryland", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Maryland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Maryland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Coronavirus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Office_of_the_Pardon_Attorney", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Office of the Pardon Attorney"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House_Press_Secretary", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "White House Press Secretary"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mortgage_loan", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mortgage loan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "White House"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Victims", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Victims", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Prisons", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Prisons", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Research", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Research", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://www.baltimoresun.com/wp-content/uploads/migration/2023/11/15/XE6XQLKPCNAD5MVCO3W6WWDEZE.jpg?w=640", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9551198", "eventUri": "eng-9551198", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-23", "textStart": 2388, "textEnd": 2394}], "sentiment": -0.1607843137254902, "wgt": 229, "relevance": 1}

Indirectly, that is, but she's back just the same.\n\nFormer state's attorney for Baltimore -- and current convicted felon -- Marilyn Mosby was the subject on Tuesday of the NAACP and a group of other civil rights organizations when they called on Joe Biden to pardon the former state official as she faces up to 40 years in prison following several convictions.\n\nLet's first jump ahead to Mosby's convictions and then come back to the NAACP's contention that Mosby was both \"politically\" and \"maliciously persecuted\" motivated by Donald Trump's Justice Department. Trust me, it'll be more fun (and obvious) that way.\n\nOn November 9, 2023, Mosby was ... convicted on two counts of perjury, relating to the withdrawal of funds from the City of Baltimore's Deferred Compensation Plan claiming that she suffered adverse financial consequences during the COVID-19 pandemic while she was Baltimore City State's Attorney. Mosby faces a maximum sentence of five years in federal prison for each of the two counts of perjury.\n\nThen...\n\nA federal jury [on February 6, 2024] convicted Mosby ... on the federal charge of making a false mortgage application when she was Baltimore City State's Attorney, relating to the purchase of a condominium in Long Boat Key, Florida.\n\n[...[\n\nU.S. Attorney Erek L. Barron said [of the verdict]: \"We humbly respect the court's considered rulings, opposing counsels' zealous advocacy, and the wisdom of both jury verdicts in this case and we remain focused on our mission to uphold the rule of law.\"\n\nMosby faces a maximum of 30 years in federal prison for making a false mortgage application.\n\nIs the potential sentence in the last case overly harsh? I can't answer that -- I'm neither a prosecutor nor a defense attorney. But I can say this:\n\nThe NAACP and 14 other groups argued in a letter to Biden that Mosby was unfairly targeted and convicted \"after enduring the political persecution and malicious prosecution of the Trump DOJ.\"\n\nWe are deeply concerned that the last administration abused their power to advance a meritless indictment against Ms. Mosby and worse, the current administration's U.S. Department of Justice ignored a clear political motive of the malicious prosecution against Ms. Mosby.\n\nHow so? Here's a question for any member of the NAACP -- or a local Lion's Club, for that matter. Would you get away with such charges on which Ms. Mosby was indicted and ultimately convicted? (No. Let's move to the next question).\n\nNow, let's pretend that either of both of the cases constituted political and/or malicious persecution, particularly under the watch Donald Trump. So please explain to me how that reality conflates with Mosby being convicted in two different trials, one on November 9, 2023, and one on February 6, long after Trump and his presumed influence left office. You can't -- never mind.\n\nThe letter ends, thusly:\n\nWe expect that political persecutions and malicious prosecutions pursued during the Trump Administration would not continue in the Biden Administration,\" the letter states. \"Ms. Mosby's case is not the only one -- it is the latest and one of the most egregious cases.

judge in Manhattan threatens to throw Trump in jail over a gag order that is suspect at best -- not necessarily for its validity but based solely on the activist judge's political intent.\n\nMeanwhile, Stormy Daniels's testimony was a trip, huh?\n\nRELATED:\n\nAnalysis: Marilyn Mosby's Attempted Silencing of Fox Affiliate Further Exposes CNN Fraud Brian Stelter", "source":

but the NAACP said she did meet an objective standard qualifying her for withdrawal.\n\n\"In contrast, 739 individuals withdrew funds from their retirement accounts without being charged for improper withdrawals, including three within her agency,\" the letter reads. \"Ms. Mosby was the only person charged.\"\n\nThe letter describes the charges as a \"miscarriage of justice and an example of the last administration's misuse of authority.\"\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM THE WASHINGTON EXAMINER\n\nWhile the letter points the blame to the Trump administration, Democratic U.S. attorney Erek Barron brought the charges against Mosby, and the case has been handled by Biden-nominated U.S. District Judge Lydia Kay Griggsby.\n\nFor the past several weeks, Mosby has promoted an online petition calling for Biden to pardon her, and it has received 9,000 signatures so far.", "source": {"uri": "washingtonexaminer.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Washington Examiner"}, "authors": [{"uri":

So far, a website has been created and a petition has garnered over 16,000 signatures to date.\n\nIn an appearance on MSNBC last week, Mosby said she did nothing wrong and asked for a presidential pardon.\n\n\"I think that is appropriate,\" Mosby said. \"I know that I have done absolutely nothing wrong, nothing criminal, nothing to be separated from my children for 40 years as a result of withdrawing $90,000 of my own money.

All six officers were either acquitted or had their charges dropped in the politically-motivated case.\n\nMosby, appearing with MSNBC's resident race-baiter Joy Reid, claimed she did \"absolutely nothing wrong, nothing illegal, nothing criminal\" and suggested that Joe Biden dismissing her conviction would be \"appropriate.\"\n\nDespite being a Democrat, Mosby claims the conviction was a \"political attack\" on her, despite all officials involved being Democrat and the trial taking place in a city that is overwhelmingly Democrat. Mosby claimed her decision to charge the six Baltimore officers was why she \"found herself on the other side of the courtroom.\"\n\nMoasby was convicted of illegally withdrawing funds from her city retirement account, using the COVID-19 pandemic as a \"hardship,\" and then using those funds to buy a condo in Florida. She was also convicted of perjury for lying on a mortgage application for the same Florida home.\n\nThe mortgage application scheme was for purchasing a $428,000 home in Longboat Key, Florida, where she also lied about receiving a $5,000 gift from her husband. However, the $5,000, which was used to secure a lower interest rate, was after she initially sent the funds to her husband, and then he returned them as a \"gift.\"\n\nReid, who will never be accused of being a genius, told Mosby she was \"stunned\" that she was prosecuted for withdrawing her \"own money\" while claiming Mosby's past run-ins with Republicans was the basis for her being charged.\n\nThat is ludicrous since, according to the Capital Gazette, she was indicted by Democrat US Attorney Erek Barron, and her trial was presided over by Judge Lydia Kay Griggsby, a Biden appointee.\n\n\"If they can do this to Marilyn Mosby, who had the audacity to challenge the status quo, they can do this to anybody,\" Mosby told Reid.\n\n\"I want this justice system that I fought so hard to equalize and to balance the scales of justice where the business model is based off the backs of black and brown people.\"\n\nMosby has been promoting an online petition to Biden comprising almost 10,000 signatures requesting she be pardoned, which she claims she didn't launch herself.\n\nDespite appearing on national television to gain sympathy and plead for a pardon, Mosby herself has not yet submitted an application to the Office of the Pardon Attorney, which reviews pardon cases and submits them to the office of the president.\n\nMosby continued, telling Reid, \"I know that I've done absolutely nothing wrong, nothing criminal, and to be separated from my children for 40 years as a result of withdrawing $90,000 of my own money [under false pretenses], it just makes absolutely no sense to me.\"\n\n\"They have done this to demonize me, to vilify me, and to break me...I've lost everything.\"\n\nHowever, Mosby's critics claim her reign as Baltimore County DA has contributed to the crime problems currently plaguing the city.\n\n\"The consequences of that failed leadership are going to last for generations,\" Medal of Valor recipient and police officer Dave Goitia told the Daily Mail following Mosby's February conviction.\n\n\"The victims are the people of Baltimore that suffer violent crime because of a police department that is completely demoralized,\" Goitiia continued, referring to the aftermath of the Freddy Gray police indictments.\n\nMosby's response in the Gray case came after days of riots in Baltimore following his in-custody death. Many critics claim Mosby's charging of the officers was politically motivated and intended to soothe racial tensions in the city. Some law enforcement officials said she gave in to pressure from rioters and targeted the six officers as \"sacrificial lambs.\"\n\nDespite being indicted by a grand jury in 2022, Mosby ran for office again that same year and lost to her challenger, Ivan Bates, who took a stronger stance on crime.\n\nDuring her fraud trial, prosecutor Aaron Zelinsky told jurors that she repeatedly lied on mortgage applications, telling the court:\n\n\"She was the top prosecutor in the city of Baltimore and oversaw hundreds of lawyers. You know what prosecutors know a lot about? Fraud. Mortgage fraud.\"\n\nMosby may have lost more than her freedom, however. The Daily Mail also reports that federal prosecutors are seeking to seize her Florida luxury condo that sits along the state's Gulf Coast. That home is one of two vacation properties Mosby purchased in the Sunshine State during the COVID-19 pandemic using money withdrawn from her city retirement account.\n\nFor corrections or revisions, click here.

In fact, prosecutors said, the money came from Mosby herself.\n\nOn the perjury charge, jurors found Mosby lied about experiencing a pandemic-related financial loss to withdraw money from her city retirement account under the CARES Act.\n\nThough a federal judge split the charges into two separate trials, prosecutors said the charges were linked: Mosby lied to withdraw the retirement money, which she used to put down payments on a pair of luxury Florida vacation homes, and lied about her finances when she applied for mortgages on the properties.\n\nMosby bought a $545,000 house near Disney World in Kissimmee in the summer of 2020 and a $476,000 condo in Longboat Key, across the street from the Gulf of Mexico, in early 2021.\n\nMosby's sentencing is on May 23 at 10:30 a.m. at the

She believes this -- as do organizations that should know better, including the NAACP -- despite the cases against her having proceeded under a Democratic U.S. Attorney for the District of Maryland, and a Democratic-nominated judge, who granted her request to change venue in her two jury trials from Baltimore to the courthouse in predominantly Democratic and Black, Prince George's County.\n\nAdditional fact: She asked for an investigation against her.\n\nMs. Mosby can be called to the witness stand against herself. On July 23, 2020, she asked the Baltimore City's Inspector General's Office to open an investigation into her travel and financial disclosures, which were under fire: \"I am therefore asking you -- an independent authority -- to investigate my financial disclosures and travel. I am willing to share with you any and all documentation you request, including bank account statements, credit card statements, and inner-office financial ledgers.\"\n\nThe invitation may have been directed toward the city's IG, but it was heard by all applicable law enforcement agencies, including at the federal level. In other words, after thrusting herself into the investigatory limelight, she is complaining about the culmination of her own handiwork.\n\nMs. Mosby's political persecution theory enters the domain of the preposterous. The United States Attorney in Maryland, Erek L. Barron, is a Democrat appointed by President Joe Biden and confirmed by the United States Senate. Maryland is an overwhelmingly Democratic State. Its governor is a Democrat. Its two United States Senators are Democrats. Its eight-member congressional delegation is Democratic with one exception. Jury pools are predominantly Democratic in Maryland. Judge Lydia Kay Griggsby, the federal judge presiding over the Mosby prosecutions, is a Biden-appointed federal judge. To borrow from former Democratic presidential candidate Walter Mondale, \"Where's the beef,\" Ms. Mosby?\n\nShe is a seasoned attorney. She knows the multiple constitutional safeguards that protect against injustice: proof of guilt beyond a reasonable doubt, jury unanimity, the privilege against self-incrimination, the right to confront your accusers, an impartial judge, and a prohibition on racial or gender discrimination in jury selection. Indeed, the Constitution posits that it is better that some guilty should go free than to convict the innocent. Armed with these procedural protections, Ms. Mosby was convicted beyond a reasonable doubt by two separate juries. She may attack her convictions on appeal or in collateral proceedings.\n\nShe decrees, however, that she is innocent. But there would be no criminals if they could be judges in their own cases. Her protestation is reminiscent of President Richard Nixon's, \"I am not a crook,\" and former Maryland Governor and Vice President Spiro Agnew's repeated denials of bribe-taking. Law is not like Lewis Carroll's \"The Hunting of the Snark\" where whatever the Bellman says \"three times is true.\"\n\nMs. Mosby argues: \"I've been accused of doing something that I have not done. I'm innocent. I'm facing 40 years for withdrawing funds from my retirement savings. The United States government, a global superpower, is actually coming for me. This is all related to this prior administration. Who has the power now to do something about that is this administration.\"\n\nMs. Mosby takes \"alternative facts\" to a new level. She had full opportunities to establish her innocence before two impartial juries and failed. She is not accused -- she has been convicted of two counts of perjury and one count of mortgage fraud. The investigation into her dealings might have begun under the Trump administration, but she was prosecuted by the Biden administration. Her request for a pardon tacitly concedes her guilt. Acceptance of a pardon is accepting that a crime was committed.\n\nThe NAACP's letter to the White House, calling for Ms. Mosby's pardon is equally embarrassing. Among other things, the letter asserts, \"Marilyn was denied due process; the opportunity to testify and present exculpatory evidence.\" It speaks volumes, however, that no due process violations are identified. No proof is forthcoming that Ms. Mosby was denied an opportunity to testify in her own defense or otherwise present exculpatory evidence. The statements are sheer ipse dixit.\n\nTo believe Ms. Mosby and the NAACP, you would have to believe that the Biden administration conspired with its predecessor Trump administration and with a Democratic United States Attorney, a Democratic federal judge, and two Democratic juries to convict Ms. Mosby of concocted crimes because they were terrified of her progressive law enforcement views.\n\nIf you believe that, I have the Brooklyn Bridge to sell you.\n\nThe NAACP has tarnished its credentials by its eagerness to die on Ms. Mosby's hill. There are genuine cases of injustice, but Ms. Mosby's is not one of them.", "source": {"uri": "baltimoresun.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Baltimore Sun"}, "authors": [{"uri":

He defied expectations of some City Hall insiders by entering the race at all. Cash-poor in his campaign fund and his reputation damaged by testimony he delivered during the federal criminal trial of his ex-wife Marilyn Mosby, Nick Mosby waited until the eve of the Feb. 9 filing deadline to officially jump in.\n\nSince then, Cohen and Sneed have been outpacing the council president in fundraising while Mosby has struggled to deliver accurate reports to the Maryland State Board of Elections.\n\nCohen, a Democratic councilman who has represented District 1 since 2016, has outspent Mosby nearly 4-to-1 since the start of the year. In April, he made his biggest media purchases to date, dropping $330,000 on television commercials, online advertising and robocalls to city residents. He spent an additional $25,000 on printing.\n\nSupporters of Cohen's campaign include numerous labor unions and some noteworthy business owners. In his last finance report, he reported maximum $6,000 donations from the Baltimore Teachers Union and Service Employees International Union Local 32BJ. Earlier this year, he reported a $5,000 donation from Bill Stromberg, former CEO of T. Rowe Price, $2,000 from Scott Plank, founder of developer War Horse Cities, and $3,000 from Community Dev. Holdings, a company located at the address of the Cordish Companies.\n\nCohen, who now represents areas including Highlandtown, Fells Point and Canton, has remained largely positive in his advertising for the citywide council president race despite past disagreements with Mosby that have spilled into the public. Cohen's television ads have touted support from Baltimore State's Attorney Ivan Bates, a Democrat who endorsed him, and featured supporters in the small business community.\n\nSneed, who represented an East Baltimore district before losing a 2020 bid for council president to Mosby, has taken her publicly financed campaign in a different direction -- lobbing attacks on both Cohen and Mosby. In an online ad funded by Sneed, a narrator accuses Cohen of being \"funded by developers and bankers.\" A separate ad takes aim at Mosby, displaying headlines about his unpaid water bills and an accusation made by prosecutors during his ex-wife's trial that he claimed fraudulent charitable contributions on his taxes. Mosby has not been charged with a crime.\n\n\"Baltimore can't afford more corruption. We can't afford Nick Mosby,\" the ad states.\n\nSneed has run separate ads on television with a more positive spin. In those, she emphasized that her campaign has been funded by public money. \"I'll be focused on Baltimore's problems, not my own,\" Sneed said in the ad.\n\n\"No skeletons here,\" said her daughter Rae Sneed as she opened a closet door.\n\nThe ads are evidence of spending by Sneed that has not been reported on her campaign finance disclosures. Sneed has received $243,000 in public campaign financing, but only reported spending $37,000. Kevin Gillogly, her campaign manager, acknowledged omissions and said her actual spending ahead of the last campaign finance reporting deadline was about $136,400. The campaign plans to amend several past reports to include the expenditures, he said. Gillogly estimated that the campaign has spent another $100,000 on media since the April 26 closing date for those reports.\n\nBecause Sneed is receiving public financing, her donors can give no more than $150 each. She has claimed contributions from 640 city residents, Gillogly said.\n\n\"I feel like we're the ma and pa (stores) running up against Walmart,\" Gillogly said of the fundraising differences in the campaign so far. \"But at the same time we're in this fight. We fundamentally believe we're in this.\"\n\nPolling suggests otherwise. A poll conducted for The Baltimore Sun, University of Baltimore and FOX45 from April 7-11 showed Cohen with 40% of the vote to Mosby's 21% among likely primary voters surveyed. Sneed trailed with 17% support. Another 19%, however, said they remained undecided.\n\n2024 voter guide: Candidates for Baltimore City Council president\n\nMosby's campaign has been less visible than those of his challengers. During a fundraising push in late 2023 Mosby raised $168,700, and he's collected $111,400 since then. Between January and the end of April, he reported spending $148,500, about $68,000 of it for mailings to voters.\n\nMosby's donations have been in question since he submitted a report in early April detailing more than $49,000 in contributions from credit card processor Paragon Solutions. His campaign acknowledged at the time that the donations were an error and said they would file an amendment.\n\nThat amended report, containing more than 100 new transactions, was filed on April 18, but it still contained numerous errors. A $9,281 donation was listed from Baltimore Gas & Electric PAC, a total that would have been a violation of the state's $6,000 maximum if accurate. BGE spokesman Nick Alexopulos said at the time that the PAC had given only $450 to Mosby's campaign.\n\nA second amended report was filed May 3 detailing $28,000 in new contributions from at least 23 donors. More than $11,000 of new expenditures were added, and the donation from BGE's PAC was corrected to reflect a $450 donation.\n\nIn late April, the Maryland State Board of Elections sent Mosby a letter noting the potential errors on his report and ordering him to provide receipts, disbursements and bank statements to support his filings for the entire election cycle.\n\nAsked about the mistakes, Mosby said his campaign treasurer, Erika Aisha Dorsey, was new to the job. (Records show she was replaced on Tuesday.) Mosby acknowledged that numerous items were incorrectly entered.\n\n\"She did the best job she could do. She did the first report fine, but made a lot of errors in the second report,\" Mosby said. \"That's why we went out and hired a compliance firm to just go through the entire report. We've moved on.\"\n\nNewly reported donors to Mosby's campaign include CMDS Management, Dawei Liu and Kevin Pfeffer who each gave $6,000. Clinic Management and Development Services (CMDS) runs a residential treatment center in northeast Baltimore, and Pfeffer is the group's CEO and founder. In 2020, the group tried to open a residential treatment center on Harford Road that was blocked by the Board of Municipal and Zoning Appeals. CMDS sued the city over the decision in 2021, and litigation is ongoing.\n\nRoger Hartley, dean of the University of Baltimore's College of Public Affairs, said the council president race has been overshadowed, as it often is, by the mayoral race this cycle. But with the incumbent Mosby at risk of losing his seat and the chairmanship of the city's spending board on the line, it's far from a sleeper, he said.\n\n\"Usually in a race like that, you're not going to attract a serious challenge if the incumbent is well-liked,\" Hartley said.\n\nHartley said he doubts the final margin will be as wide as polls have indicated, but if it is, the winner could emerge with a \"super mandate.\"\n\n\"That could be a very interesting race,\" he said.", "source": {"uri": "baltimoresun.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Baltimore Sun"}, "authors": [{"uri": "emily_opilo@baltimoresun.com", "name": "Emily Opilo", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nick_Mosby", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nick Mosby"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Campaign_finance", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Campaign finance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baltimore", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Baltimore"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Baltimore"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baltimore_City_Council", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Baltimore City Council"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advertising", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Advertising"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Stromberg", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bill Stromberg"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oglala_Lakota_County,_South_Dakota", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Oglala Lakota County, South Dakota"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Oglala Lakota County, South Dakota"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marilyn_Mosby", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Marilyn Mosby"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canton,_Baltimore", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Canton, Baltimore"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baltimore_City_Hall", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Baltimore City Hall"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Highlandtown,_Baltimore", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Highlandtown, Baltimore"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SEIU_32BJ", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "SEIU 32BJ"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robocall", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Robocall"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Union_(American_Civil_War)", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Union (American Civil War)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco_Board_of_Supervisors", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "San Francisco Board of Supervisors"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_of_Maryland", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Government of Maryland"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T._Rowe_Price", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "T.

While Baltimore's attorney general, she refused to go after criminals and openly stated that she was on a mission to keep Black people out of jail. She lied about police behaviors and went after officers in questionable ways. Her behaviors led to a severe rise in crime.\n\nFrom local TV reports, it seems the letter to Biden presented only a partial picture of Ms. Mosby. Some say her convictions reflect racial bias. That's interesting because the prosecutor was a Black man with impressive credentials and the juries were both racially mixed. The prosecutor was a Biden appointee, not a Trump agent.\n\nSo what is up? Has the NAACP become racist? Have their Democratic connections brought into a once-honorable organization the Democrats' tendency to lie about what it doesn't like, to attack opponents and/or to cover up their wrongdoing?\n\nI believe there's another possible answer: They have bought the victim profile that the Democrats have painted for them, and they use it to protect criminals and give themselves advantages not afforded to average citizens. If this is so, race relations in the U.S. are not just in sad shape, but in a dangerous place.\n\nI ask the NAACP and the other organizations that signed this letter to look at their request anew and to allow justice to progress.

Young, Black, and charismatic, she developed a reputation on the national stage as a \"progressive prosecutor.\" She appeared regularly in the national media as an expert on police accountability and earned headlines for progressive actions including ending the prosecution of marijuana possession and other low-level offenses.\n\nOn May 1, nine years to the day after Mosby announced charges in the Gray case, she appealed to the public for sympathy for her own legal woes. \"I've done absolutely nothing wrong, nothing illegal, nothing criminal,\" she insisted during an interview with MSNBC's Joy Reid. On May 23, Mosby will be sentenced on three federal charges for fraud and perjury related to the purchase of two homes in Florida. She also mentioned that she is seeking a pardon from President Joe Biden. The NAACP is supporting her request, and a petition is circulating online in support as well.\n\nMosby's dramatic fall from grace is a familiar story in U.S. politics: The career of an otherwise seemingly laudable politician is ended by personal greed and/or issues unrelated to their leadership in office. Yet, the story of Mosby's career is told very differently among Baltimore insiders and close observers. Her progressive bona fides haven't been broadly accepted in Baltimore, beginning with her handling of the Gray case. And she has been accused of \"malicious\" and \"vindictive\" prosecutions.\n\nThere is an ironic twist to Mosby's journey from prosecutor to defendant: She and her supporters, including Reid, have made similar accusations about the federal prosecutor, Leo Wise, who indicted her and who is currently prosecuting Hunter Biden. Wise's anti-corruption efforts in Baltimore brought down a police squad known as the Gun Trace Task Force, a police commissioner, a mayor, a state senator, a prominent attorney, and Mosby. The local media portrayed Wise as cleaning house in the city, but he has his own controversial history. Mosby's case is a tale of two prosecutors, both of whom built their reputations on anti-corruption but faced similar accusations of political targeting.\n\nWise's backstory as a \"bulldog\" has been told in the media but largely in a way that minimizes Mosby's claims. In 2008, Wise was named as the first chief counsel of the Office of Congressional Ethics. Within two years, he resigned from the role after there were complaints about racial and political targeting. At one point, he had eight open investigations, all of them targeting Black Democratic members of the House. He was also criticized for selecting investigations on a whim; letting investigations become public news, sometimes before elections; and digging into personal finances. The Congressional Black Caucus drafted a resolution to limit Wise's discretion. Wise moved to the U.S. Attorney's Office in Maryland in 2010, where he worked mostly on financial fraud and embezzlement cases for several years.\n\nMeanwhile, in 2015, Mosby took over as the Baltimore State's Attorney. Within four months, her office was consumed by the Freddie Gray case. She faced her first public accusations of a \"malicious prosecution\" from the officers in the case and their supporters. The officers filed a lawsuit that was ultimately thrown out by the Supreme Court, so it wasn't taken seriously. They did, however, have a point.\n\nMosby was widely praised for her seemingly bold and progressive charges in the Gray case. Yet, the fanfare around the case overshadowed the fact that Gray's cause of death was left mysterious after four trials with no convictions. Prosecutors argued Gray suffered a broken neck from being thrown forward in the van while it was in motion because he wasn't wearing a seatbelt. The judge pointed out that there was no evidence to support that theory, and he faulted the prosecutors for legally unsound charges, like alleging assault while making claims about actions merely being negligent.\n\nAs the author of an investigative book on the Gray case, I obtained unreleased evidence showing that officers used excessive and deadly force on Gray when they stopped the van around the corner from where they arrested him and took him out of the van to shackle his legs, as some witnesses had told the media. Case files show that prosecutors knew about this evidence from early on and didn't share it with the medical examiner or during the trials. Instead, they explicitly argued in court that the officers did not use force on Gray at all, aside from reckless driving.\n\nCase files and notes from Mosby's office further show that prosecutors rushed the charges before investigating most of the evidence and that politics was in play in their decisionmaking. Ultimately, the officers who cried \"malicious prosecution\" benefited from Mosby's office not pursuing the stronger brutality case. But they were not wrong that she put a politically expeditious narrative above the facts and law.\n\nNot long after the officers were acquitted, Mosby was being publicly accused of a \"malicious prosecution\" again, but this time by Baltimore activists. Two months after Gray's arrest, in June 2015, Keith Davis Jr. was shot more than 30 times by police who believed he had committed a robbery. Rather than prosecute the officers, Mosby's office prosecuted Davis, who survived, first for the robbery and then, when he was acquitted on those charges, for a murder charge filed days after his robbery acquittal. Police claimed that Davis had murdered someone on the same day of his arrest, despite no apparent motive or connection to the victim.\n\nFor the next six years, Mosby would not stop prosecuting Davis for the murder, despite two hung juries and two overturned convictions, one resulting from a discredited jailhouse informant. While she appeared on cable news programs and in Op-Eds as an exemplar of a \"progressive\" prosecutor, her office turned Davis into \"the most aggressively prosecuted man in American history,\" according to legal scholar Colin Miller.\n\nMosby's zeal against Davis is hard to reconcile with her approach in the Gray case. One factor seemed to be her antagonism towards Davis' wife, Kelly Davis, who became a vocal opponent. In 2022, a judge accused Mosby of having a \"presumption of vindictiveness\" and \"personal animosity\" toward the Davis family and their supporters based on statements and actions.\n\nAccusations of vindictiveness continued to follow Mosby, including claims of retaliatory and politicized treatment of employees in lawsuits and affidavits. Still, Mosby remained popular and was reelected in 2018.\n\nMosby's reelection took place during a period of intense corruption scandals in Baltimore. Wise was prosecuting a string of high-profile cases, including the Gun Trace Task Force and Mayor Catherine Pugh, who pleaded guilty to fraudulently selling copies of children's books she had written to nonprofit organizations and other groups in exchange for money and political favor. In 2020, Wise took over as chief of the Fraud and Public Corruption Unit in Maryland.\n\nThere was one major red flag in Wise's Baltimore portfolio, though: His targets continued to be almost all Black. Shortly after he took office, he indicted police commissioner Darryl DeSousa, a Black man, for failure to pay taxes. He did not indict the white police commanders who oversaw the Gun Trace Task Force, one of whom was named in court as a conspirator. Wise did indict two white Gun Trace Task Force officers, but only because they ended up being heard on a wiretap that was tracking a drug crew. The officers had extraordinary records of complaints but were not under investigation until the wiretap.\n\nWise seemed to approach his new role in Baltimore as he did his position in Congress. The Baltimore defense bar also became concerned with his apparent antagonism toward lawyers. He indicted and convicted Kenneth Ravenell, a prominent Black attorney, for money laundering. He then indicted Ravenell's own attorney and defense investigator for obstruction of justice. He was unsuccessful in those additional cases. Wise even accused the National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers of taking laundered money from Ravenell at one point.\n\nMosby was Wise's last major corruption target in Baltimore. A year before her indictment, in March 2021, Wise's office made it known to the press that Mosby and her husband, Nick Mosby, the City Council president, were under investigation. The Baltimore Office of the Inspector General had published a report showing that Marilyn Mosby was not properly reporting on her extensive travel and was running a questionable nonprofit. Nick Mosby seemed to retaliate against the OIG by seeking to limit its independence. There was a cloud of apparent impropriety around the Mosbys during 2021.\n\nYet, Marilyn Mosby was never indicted for anything to do with the OIG report. Wise finally indicted her in January 2022 for making false statements on financial documents in 2020, which had allowed her to purchase two properties in Florida -- arguably minor, victimless crimes. According to the indictment, she had falsely checked a box indicating a COVID-related hardship to access her retirement income, and she wasn't honest about her finances on mortgage applications.\n\nMosby's attorney spoke out, claiming that Wise was leading a racist and \"selective and vindictive\" prosecution. He cited examples of Wise making inflammatory statements about her office in the past. He also noted that, as it was an election year, Wise had previously donated to Mosby's two opponents. Sherrilyn Ifill, the former president of the NAACP Legal Defense Fund, spoke out on Twitter: \"There must be a federal prosecutor assigned just to Black mayors.\"\n\nThe local support for Mosby was limited, though. Especially for activists and city residents who supported Keith Davis Jr., Mosby being prosecuted by an arguably vindictive prosecutor was her just deserts.\n\nIn 2023, Wise was demoted and removed from his position as anti-corruption chief. He was also removed from prosecuting the Mosby case. His boss, U.S. Attorney Erek Barron, had taken over in 2021 and had put some checks on him. As in Congress, Wise had a brief but intense reign in Maryland that ended with a whimper. He transitioned to the DOJ's public integrity section, where he has been attracting controversy during his prosecution of Hunter Biden for tax and gun offenses -- a case Biden's team claims is \"politically motivated.\"\n\nUltimately, Wise's impact in Baltimore was to indict a handful of police officers for racketeering and try a series of other financial cases with narrow targets. But the cultures of police brutality, cover-ups, prosecutorial misconduct, and even purchasing political influence in Baltimore largely remain unbothered, and both Mosby and Wise played important roles in limiting the fallout.", "source": {"uri": "slate.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Slate Magazine"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressivism",

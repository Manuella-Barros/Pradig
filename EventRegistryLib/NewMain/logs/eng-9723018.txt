Two trips to the United States to face world class junior lightweight opponents in the past 18 months had ended in disastrous fashion. Murderous punchers Emanuel Navarrete and Oscar Valdez finished him off inside the distance of what were otherwise competitive fights, leaving him languishing with a record of 2-2 in his last four outings.\n\nCritics will argue that Sydneysider Dib, 31, was tailormade for Wilson, and in a sense he was. Against Navarrete and Valdez, Wilson only got into trouble when he opted to trade with the heavy-handed Mexican duo. Dib, with a modest record of 11 knockouts out of 21 wins against one loss, was never going to be the guy to shake him up early and drag him into a brawl in their scheduled 10-round fight.\n\nFor the first two rounds Dib used every inch of the ring, circling left and right and challenging Wilson to come find him. The game plan seemed to be to frustrate Wilson into making mistakes. When that didn't work, Dib knew he would need to engage more.\n\nThings heated up in late in round three when a Wilson right uppercut followed by a left rip found their target. Not to be outdone, Dib fired home a right cross to the jaw.\n\nThe fourth round saw the body attack come into play for Wilson as he fired off a pair of left hooks downstairs late in the round before finding Dib's chin with a crunching right hand. Dib regrouped in the fifth, bloodying Wilson's nose early in proceedings but had the favor returned late in the same stanza.\n\nDib pushed forward in the sixth, landing counter rights over the left hand lead of Wilson, who was looking a little reckless. Late in the round Wilson landed a jarring left hook and a stiff right cross, but Dib had already banked his best round of the fight so far.\n\nIn the seventh, Wilson poured on the pressure, determined to see if Dib could withstand his ferocious attacks. At the halfway point, a thunderous rip to the body visibly hurt Dib. And although he snuck through a couple of good right hands himself, the attack to the midriff left him reeling.\n\nSensing he had his opponent hurt, Wilson went in for the kill in the eighth - and he did it in style. A short left hook to the whiskers rocked Dib early in the round, sending him backwards on his heels. Wilson jumped on him, pushing him back to give himself a little space, then landed a long left hook to the chin of Dib who was backed up against the ropes. One final left hook crumpled Dib to the canvas.\n\nReferee Les Fear stopped the contest at the 0:45 mark of the round. Wilson was leading on all three judges' scorecards at the time of the stoppage, 68-65 and 67-66 twice.\n\nThe finish was as beautiful as it was savage.\n\n\"The game plane was to box and pick my shots,\" said Wilson (14-3, 8 KOs) after the win on the Sam Goodman vs Chainoi Worawut undercard. \"I knew if I paced myself, the shot would come. I didn't even mean to hurt him but when I did, I followed it up with another couple of left hooks.\"\n\nWilson has been calling out former Ring lightweight champion George Kambosos Jr (21-3, 10 KOs) for some time and he didn't let the opportunity slip him by in the post-fight interview.\n\n\"I've been calling out for that fight for quite some time now,\" Wilson said of the 31-year-old Sydneysider, who is 1-3 in his past four bouts.\n\n\"Me and my team, my manager Glen Jennings, we really want that fight. The move to lightweight tonight was purely for that reason.\n\n\"It's a fight that Australia deserves. And doesn't George want his own domestic showdown? I certainly do. Let's get it on. Let's get it happening.\"", "source": {"uri": "ringtv.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Ring"}, "authors": [{"uri": "anthony_cocks@ringtv.com", "name": "Anthony Cocks", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liam_Wilson", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Liam Wilson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hook_(boxing)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Hook (boxing)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/\u00d3scar_Valdez", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "\u00d3scar Valdez"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Kambosos_Jr", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "George Kambosos Jr"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wollongong_Entertainment_Centre", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wollongong Entertainment Centre"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emanuel_Navarrete", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Emanuel Navarrete"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weight_class", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Weight class"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lightweight", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lightweight"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_featherweight", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Super featherweight"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caboolture,_Queensland", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Caboolture, Queensland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Caboolture, Queensland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wollongong", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wollongong"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Wollongong"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queensland", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Queensland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Queensland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knockout", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Knockout"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sydney", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sydney"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Sydney"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexico", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mexico"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Mexico"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Card_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Card (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coach_(sport)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Coach (sport)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Referee", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Referee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Australia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Biology/Sociobiology", "label": "dmoz/Science/Biology/Sociobiology", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://www.ringtv.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/liam-wilson-vs-emanuel-navarrete-GettyImages-1246777210.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9723018", "eventUri": "eng-9723018", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1372549019607843, "wgt": 224, "relevance": 1}

Wilson was in control of the space and distance and boxing aggressively, but he took a flash right hand near the close of the second round.\n\nThere was greater variety to Wilson's work near the end of the third, when he landed a right uppercut and then a left hook to the body, but Dib was still catching him with occasional rights.\n\nThe action started to open up in the fifth. Wilson became a more stationary target and bled from the nose because he stayed inside too long without moving his head, but Dib was also bleeding. Wilson was able to land shots through the pressure and attrition he always enjoys bringing, and there was further good action in the next, with both throwing fiery combinations and both scoring regularly.\n\nThey slugged away in the seventh, too. Dib was not using the ring as much and was more prepared to trade, but he also attempted to hold a couple of times, and Wilson either tried to push him away or target him on the inside. Dib scored with a good right hand to round off the seventh, but the momentum had not fully turned.\n\nAs the eighth of the scheduled 10 rounds opened, Wilson tumbled to the deck in what was ruled a slip, but moments after restarting he hurt Dib with a crunching left hook. Dib flew back into the ropes, his right hand trapped between the strands, and Wilson cracked him with another left hook, shutting Dib's lights off. As the Sydney native slid to the canvas, Wilson lashed in a couple more shots. Dib, emphatically, was down and out; Wilson celebrated by calling out George Kambosos Jr.\n\nIt by then had taken Mounir Fathi barely two minutes to stop Anton Markovic.\n\nMarkovic was dropped twice, once by a thunderous right hand, and although he made it back to his feet, Fathi flew in, throwing both hands and forcing the referee's timely intervention.", "source": {"uri": "boxingscene.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "BoxingScene.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billy_Dib", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Billy Dib"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liam_Wilson", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Liam Wilson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jab", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jab"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lightweight", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lightweight"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Boxing_Federation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "International Boxing Federation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hook_(boxing)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hook (boxing)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/\u00d3scar_Valdez", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "\u00d3scar Valdez"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boxing", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Boxing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wollongong", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wollongong"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Wollongong"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uppercut", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Uppercut"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Kambosos_Jr", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "George Kambosos Jr"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boxing_ring", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Boxing ring"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sydney", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sydney"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Sydney"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Biology/Sociobiology", "label": "dmoz/Science/Biology/Sociobiology", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 95}], "image": "https://www.boxingscene.com/uploads/liam-wilson%20(4)_1692848686.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9723018", "eventUri": "eng-9723018", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2784313725490195, "wgt": 210, "relevance": 1}

against Vasiliy Lomachenko and Devin Haney, twice.\n\nDib added that he has also started discussions with Kambosos's US agent Lou DiBella about a potential bout later this year.\n\nThe showdown would continue a long-running rivalry between the Dib family and Kambosos, who for some time called out the popular Sydneysider who rose to fame as IBF featherweight champ.\n\nIn 2016, Dib and Kambosos also made headlines over a backstage altercation at a Sydney fight night event, with both camps offering different accounts to how things played out.\n\nKambosos, apparently, was backstage to support good mate Todd Carney, and readying to walk out with him to the ring for a fight against Chris Sandow when he and Dib crossed paths.\n\nWhile accounts of what took place differ greatly, with some suggesting punches were thrown, Dib insists the pair have since \"buried the hatchet\" and are now \"definitely sweet\".\n\n\"But this is boxing and George Kambosos is a big name,\" he said with a grin. \"So if we can get ourselves that fight, why not?\"\n\nApart from his own longtime rivalry with Kambosos, Dib reminded that 'Uwee' also came close to upsetting the former lightweight king way back in their amateur days.\n\nAll of which adds even more intrigue to his impending showdown with Wilson, a two-time super featherweight title challenger who is now moving up for the sole purpose of a Kambosos fight.\n\nYet 'Billy The Kid' insists it will be his brother who wins that opportunity inside Wollongong Entertainment Centre.\n\n\"Because Liam has shown a lot of vulnerability,\" Dib said of the fighter who recently suffered world title losses against Oscar Valdez and Emmanuel Navarrete.\n\n\"The smaller guys have been knocking him out.\n\n\"Both Navarrete and Valdez have done a job on Liam while three years ago Joe Noynay iced him too.\n\n\"Then in the rematch, I don't know what happened there but Joe seemed to take a bit of a dive.\n\n\"Obviously Liam has great power, checkmate power.\n\n\"But if you get past that you can drown him in the later rounds and I think that's exactly what my brother is going to do.\"\n\nAnd as for what happens with a win?\n\n\"Sets up a showdown with George Kambosos, no doubt,\" he continued.\n\nBOXING: GOODMAN V WORAWUT | WBC Super Bantamweight World Title Eliminator | WED 10 JULY 7PM AEST | Order Now with Main Event on Kayo Sports.\n\n\"None of the big names in world boxing want to fight George because he's coming off what is effectively four losses.\n\n\"I know he got that gift in the IBO world title fight (a contentious win against Englishman Maxi Hughes), but he really is on the rebuild.\n\n\"And I know speaking with Lou DiBella -- who is a good friend of mine -- that George will be looking to rebuild and so there is definitely an opportunity there for an all-Australian showdown.\n\n\"I've told Lou what the situation is and he's said to me 'get your brother to win and we'll go from there'.\"\n\nDespite their undeniable confidence in fight week, Team Dib were visibly shocked at Tuesday's weigh-in when Uwee came in almost half-a-kilo over the lightweight limit.\n\nHowever, the Sydneysider was then given the mandatory two hours to go make weight, which he did - with a No Limit staffer confirming his second attempt was \"right on the button\".\n\nElsewhere, and when asked how things were these days between himself and Kambosos, Billy Dib stressed the two popular Aussie fighters were both done with feuding.\n\n\"We've buried the hatchet,\" Dib stressed.\n\n\"George is a father, a good guy and is out there working for his family.\n\n\"But this is also boxing and he's a big name, so if we can get him why not?", "source": {"uri": "foxsports.com.au", "dataType": "news", "title": "Fox Sports"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Event_(TV_channel)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Main Event (TV channel)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billy_Dib", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Billy Dib"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lightweight", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lightweight"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boxing", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boxing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Australia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Kambosos_Jr", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "George Kambosos Jr"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kayo_Sports", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kayo Sports"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox_Sports_(Australia)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fox Sports (Australia)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Boxing_Council", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "World Boxing Council"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pay-per-view", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pay-per-view"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_in_Australia", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Time in Australia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_bantamweight", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Super bantamweight"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sydney", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sydney"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Sydney"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New Zealand"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "New Zealand"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vasiliy_Lomachenko", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Vasiliy Lomachenko"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Devin_Haney", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Devin Haney"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lou_DiBella", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lou DiBella"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amateur_boxing", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Amateur boxing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_featherweight", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Super featherweight"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Boxing_Federation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "International Boxing Federation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/\u00d3scar_Valdez", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "\u00d3scar Valdez"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Featherweight", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Featherweight"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maxi_Hughes", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Maxi Hughes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wollongong_Entertainment_Centre", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wollongong Entertainment Centre"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Boxing_Organization", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "International Boxing Organization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "England"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "England"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing/Fan_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing/Fan Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing/History", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://content.api.news/v3/images/bin/200c5fd3e620500e764609eccfebb688", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9723018", "eventUri": "eng-9723018", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-10", "textStart": 710, "textEnd": 717, "freq": 2}], "sentiment": -0.2470588235294118, "wgt": 207, "relevance": 1}

Australian fight fans deserve it. And doesn't George want an all-Australian showdown? I do. Let's get it happening.\"\n\nIt was a back and forth sledge between Wilson and Kambosos that could ignite their rivalry.\n\nWilson kicked it off when he predicted Vasiliy Lomachenko would \"use his head as a speedball\" ahead of Kambosos' world title fight with the Ukrainian legend.\n\nIn March, Wilson was in a fire fight against Oscar Valdez in Arizona, and was stopped in the eighth round.\n\nMoments after the stoppage, Kambosos Tweeted: \"Damn used his head as a speedball. #ouch\".\n\nWilson hit back at that comment on Wednesday night, mentioning Kambosos' brave 11th round stoppage loss to Lomachenko in May.\n\n\"Well, same as what Lomachenko did,\" Wilson said when asked about the 'speedball' comment. \"That's fair. I'm calling him out right now.\n\n\"If he thinks I got folded by Valdez, the same thing happened with him and Lomachenko.\n\n\"I come to fight, I can punch and he's a good boxer - he's tough and durable.\n\n\"Can he take my damage, or will he outbox me? There's only one way to find out.\n\n\"I'm sure he lies in bed at night thinking, 'I really want an all-Australian showdown'\n\n\"I'm his dance partner, there's no one else out there. Let's get it out there.\"\n\nNo Limit CEO George Rose said a fight between Wilson and Kambosos would rival the Tim Tszyu vs Jeff Horn blockbuster of 2020, and will work towards making it happen.\n\n\"Liam's world class, he's taking a step up in weight and now he needs a dancing partner,\" Rose told this masthead. \"George Kambosos is a great dancing partner for Liam Wilson.\n\n\"I think George would've got confidence out of watching tonight. I think he would've seen things he can probably excel in against Liam.\n\n\"George just had the massive fight against Lomachenko, which was a great opportunity for him, but he needs a bounce back fight to put him back at the top tier.\n\n\"What better way than a massive domestic match-up against the guy who's put his hand up as the best lightweight in the country?\"\n\nRose also weighed in on Kambosos' Tweet following Wilson's loss to Valdez.\n\n\"George speaks his mind and he spends a lot of time on Twitter,\" he said. \"When he reads this, he'll know that Liam's ready for it.\n\n\"He knows.

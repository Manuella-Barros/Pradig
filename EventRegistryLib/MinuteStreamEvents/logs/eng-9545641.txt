Quite the opposite, in fact: when he signed a two-year contract extension last year, he suggested that he could even stay beyond 2025.\n\nGuardiola previously admitted that he felt he 'failed' at Bayern by not winning the Champions League while with the German giant, which means he could perhaps be tempted to go back and rectify that at some point. He also still owns an apartment in Munich.\n\nBayern Munich sporting director Max Eberl said after the 3-1 defeat by Stuttgart last weekend: \"In life, it's sometimes surprising: doors close, you're disappointed beyond measure. And all of a sudden, doors open that you thought three weeks ago were impossible.\"\n\nXabi Alonso's Bayer Leverkusen sit 15 points ahead of Bayern Munich in the Bundesliga as things stand. If Leverkusen avoids defeat in its final two games of the campaign, it will become the first German side to go a full season unbeaten.\n\nLiverpool.com says: It will be fascinating to see what Manchester City looks like when Guardiola leaves. Losing him would be similar to the Reds losing Klopp, even if the bond at Anfield between fans and manager is stronger. It is highly unlikely that the club will stay at the exact same level because of the elite level that the Catalan has operated at for so long, but then the same logic can be applied to Liverpool when Klopp leaves.\n\nIt seems likely that almost no matter who is in charge, Manchester City, Liverpool and Arsenal will be the leading three teams in the Premier League in the coming seasons. But that only makes it more likely that Guardiola would want to stay longer in England and remain involved in that rather than move elsewhere. Liverpool and Arsenal would both be handed a boost if Guardiola left, but don't count on it happening just yet.", "source": {"uri": "liverpool.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Liverpool"},

former club 'dreaming of re-hiring Man City boss'", "body": "Bayern Munich are reportedly dreaming of re-hiring former boss and current Manchester City head coach Pep Guardiola, whose Etihad deal expires in 2025.\n\nOne of Pep Guardiola's former clubs are reportedly dreaming of re-hiring the Manchester City boss should he soon call time on his Etihad career.\n\nThe 53-year-old's contract situation has led to some uncertainty surrounding his future at the Etihad, as his terms only run until the end of the 2024-25 campaign.\n\nGuardiola signed his most recent renewal towards the end of 2022 and has hinted in the past few months that he could sign another extension, but nothing has been agreed yet.\n\nThe former Barcelona manager was linked with a sensational return to Camp Nou earlier this year when Xavi announced his intentions to step down, although the latter has now made a U-turn on his future.\n\nHowever, another one of Guardiola's erstwhile sides - Bayern Munich - are on the hunt for a new leader, as there are no indications that Thomas Tuchel will also reverse his decision to move on this summer.\n\n\u00a9 Reuters\n\nBayern 'not giving up hope of Guardiola return'\n\nAccording to German outlet Kicker, the former Bundesliga champions are keeping their fingers crossed that Guardiola could be lured back to the Allianz Arena one day, as he still owns an apartment in Munich.\n\nThe report claims that the treble-winning coach still visits the German city from time to time after his successful stint in Munich from 2013 to 2016, where he won 124 of his 161 matches in charge.\n\nBayern won three straight Bundesliga titles and a Club World Cup crown with Guardiola in the dugout, but he failed to lead FC Hollywood to Champions League glory, which he claimed made his time at the club a failure.\n\nAfter masterminding Barcelona's triumphs in the competition in 2009 and 2011, Guardiola had to wait another 12 years to conquer Europe again, overseeing Man City's 1-0 win over Inter Milan in the 2022-23 showpiece.\n\nHowever, City's dreams of another sensational treble were crushed at the hands of Real Madrid in the quarter-finals, although they are still on course for Premier League and FA Cup glory.\n\nBayern frustrated in search for new head coach\n\n\u00a9 Reuters\n\nBayern are also mourning their Champions League hopes in the wake of Wednesday's astonishing 2-1 semi-final second-leg defeat to Real Madrid, who will meet Borussia Dortmund in the Wembley showpiece.\n\nJoselu's late brace means that the Bavarians will end the season trophyless before Tuchel bids farewell, but their search for the German's successor has hit roadblock after roadblock so far.\n\nFirstly, Xabi Alonso rejected the chance to coach Bayern and other European admirers by electing to stay with Bayer Leverkusen, while Ralf Rangnick also snubbed the Allianz Arena job in favour of staying loyal to Austria.\n\nEx-Real boss Zinedine Zidane has publicly ruled himself out of the running too, while Julen Lopetegui has supposedly become the latest name to turn down the gig as he prepares to replace David Moyes at Wolverhampton Wanderers.\n\nA reunion with Julian Nagelsmann - now in charge of Germany - is dead in the water too, leaving Manchester United's Erik ten Hag as the purported top candidate, but even their interest in the Dutchman is now said to have cooled.", "source": {"uri": "sportsmole.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sports Mole"}, "authors": [{"uri": "ben_knapton@sportsmole.co.uk", "name": "Ben Knapton", "type": "author",

That resulted in a report in Kicker on Monday suggesting there is interest at Bayern in re-appointing Guardiola this summer, although the same report concedes that the manager has no intention of leaving Manchester City at this time.\n\nGuardiola has a contract at City until the summer of 2025, which would take his tenure to nine years. He has spoken in the past of intending to honour the contracts he signs, without leaving a club before the end of a contract unless results dictate that he cannot continue.\n\nALSO READ: Josko Gvardiol can help force Pep Guardiola into unthinkable Man City call\n\nALSO READ: The Man City summer transfer that has sparked protests amid a potential UEFA hearing\n\nNext summer could be an important one for City. They are playing in the FIFA Club World Cup in June-July 2025 which could complicate Guardiola's departure, while reports suggest a decision could be due at the end of next season on the 115 charges from the Premier League on alleged Financial Fair Play breaches.\n\nLast year, in his first press conference since those charges were announced, Guardiola was firm that: \"I am not moving from this seat,\" and has been clear that City must be given the opportunity to clear their name in an independent setting.\n\nHe said at the time he would remain in charge even if potential punishments included relegation to League Two. Earlier this season he reiterated that stance when he said he is more likely to stay at City if they are kicked out of the top flight than if they win the Champions League again.\n\n\"You are questioning like we have been punished. And in the moment we are innocent until guilt is proved,\" he said. \"I know the people want it. Wait and see it and after the sentence has been done we will come here and explain it. But absolutely I will not consider my future [if] it depends being here or being in League One. Absolutely.\n\n\"There is more chance to stay if we are in League One than if we win the Champions League. Why should I not believe, what's changed?\n\n\"It's not the case because the judge and the court and the Premier League lawyers and our lawyers at the end make both defence in front of the judge and after he will decide. I didn't change for one second my opinion about it - take time, wait and see what they decide and after we accept the resolution.\"\n\nGuardiola also discussed his future after leading City to the treble last season, insisting that nothing had changed regarding his stance on his future since finally lifting the Champions League with the Blues.\n\n\"I signed a contract for another two years because I feel comfortable - and nothing has changed whether we won (the treble) or didn't win,\" he said - even hinting at a potential extension past next summer.\n\n\"I am happy and the people are happy, the board and the hierarchy especially, because they decide in the end which manager is going to lead this group of players.\n\n\"If they are satisfied, I am still satisfied. I want to defend what we won and maybe at the end of the season, if I am tired, we will talk with the club - or maybe extend more.\"\n\nGuardiola has dropped other hints over staying as the season has gone on, and as his contract moves into its final year there will be more questions asked of his stance - particularly as the Premier League decision approaches. Premier League CEO Richard Masters said a decision will be made 'soon', which could impact Guardiola's contract talks too.\n\nAfter winning the treble, Guardiola travelled to Abu Dhabi to meet City owner Sheikh Mansour with the three trophies, and the Blues were back in Abu Dhabi in January for a warm weather training camp. He has regular contact with chairman Khaldoon Al Mubarak, CEO Ferran Soriano and Sporting Director Txiki Begiristain.\n\nWhether Guardiola would be open to returning to Bayern after leaving City is another matter, but Guaridola recently told ESPN Brazil that he would like to manage an international team at a major tournament.\n\n\"I would like to train a national team for a World Cup or a European Championship. I would like that,\" he said. \"I don't know who would want me! To work for a national team they have to want you, just like a club. I never thought about [winning a World Cup].

Guardiola has been at the City helm since 2016.\n\nThe Spaniard has achieved extraordinary success in his senior managerial career, beginning with Barcelona in 2008. A hugely successful four-year spell saw the club win the continental treble, two UEFA Champions League and three consecutive La Liga titles.\n\nAt his next stop at Bayern Munich between 2013 and 2016, Guardiola delivered three straight Bundesliga titles before making City the team to beat in England and Europe.\n\nHowever, Souness thinks Guardiola's managerial success is mostly due to the top players he has inherited from his predecessors rather than his own managerial genius. He said on William Hill's Three Up Front podcast (as per Mirror):\n\n\"Pep Guardiola has managed three clubs, and in all of those, he has had the best group of players in whatever league he's been in\".\n\n\"He took over from Frank Rijkaard at Barcelona where he had Lionel Messi, Andres Iniesta, Xavi and many others. He went to Bayern Munich after they had just won the Quadruple. Then he came to Manchester City where he took over a side that both Manuel Pellegrini and Roberto Mancini had won the Premier League with.\"\n\nSouness continued:\n\n\"He took over an exceptional group of players in every case. City are the richest team in England, and they only needed the slightest bit of tweaking when he took over. He obviously manages players very well, but there is no genius there. It is just about having the best players\".\n\n\"If you have an average manager with great players, then you have a chance at being successful. I've been in dressing rooms where everything had been set in stone for the squad by the players that came before us, so the manager barely had to speak to us.\"\n\nGuardiola's City have won the UEFA Super Cup and FIFA Club World Cup this season.\n\nWhat's next for Pep Guardiola's Manchester City?\n\nManchester City are in the midst of a superb season. Having won two titles this season, they are on course to win another two.\n\nPep Guardiola's side are looking to win an unprecedented Premier League four-peat, trailing leaders Arsenal by a point but have a game in hand. They next take on Fulham away on Saturday (May 11).\n\nAfter taking on Tottenham Hotspur (May 14, away) and West Ham United (May 19, home), City take on Manchester United in the FA Cup final on May 25, hoping to defend their title.", "source": {"uri": "sportskeeda.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sportskeeda"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graeme_Souness", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Graeme Souness"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pep_Guardiola", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pep Guardiola"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester_City_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Manchester City F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FC_Barcelona", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "FC Barcelona"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treble_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Treble (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England_national_football_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "England national football team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liverpool_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Liverpool F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FC_Bayern_Munich", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "FC Bayern Munich"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midfielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Midfielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/La_Liga", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "La Liga"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_Champions_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "UEFA Champions League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_Rijkaard", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Frank Rijkaard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andr\u00e9s_Iniesta", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Andr\u00e9s Iniesta"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xavi", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Xavi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roberto_Mancini", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Roberto Mancini"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manuel_Pellegrini", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Manuel Pellegrini"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bundesliga", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bundesliga"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "UEFA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lionel_Messi", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lionel Messi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFA_Club_World_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "FIFA Club World Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_Super_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "UEFA Super Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FA_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "FA Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tottenham_Hotspur_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tottenham Hotspur F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arsenal_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Arsenal F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fulham_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fulham F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premier_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Premier League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester_United_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Manchester United F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Ham_United_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "West Ham United F.C."}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Statistics", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Statistics", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Negro_Leagues", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Negro Leagues", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cue_Sports/Pool", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cue Sports/Pool", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Social", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Social", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Players", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Players", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://staticg.sportskeeda.com/editor/2024/05/5f254-17152778372078-1920.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9545641", "eventUri": "eng-9545641", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-11", "textStart": 2349, "textEnd": 2355}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-14", "textStart": 2394, "textEnd": 2400}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-19", "textStart": 2429, "textEnd": 2435}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-25", "textStart": 2498, "textEnd": 2504}], "sentiment": 0.5450980392156863, "wgt": 177, "relevance": 1}

Does Mateo Kovacic stay alongside Rodri, or will Jack Grealish force his way back into the side?\n\nGuardiola must weigh up sticking with a winning team to get the four victories between City and the double, or bringing back some of the key figures from last year's treble-winning team. Some players will have to move around to accommodate returning faces, or even drop out of the side all together.\n\nALSO READ: New deal, FFP stance, next job - What Guardiola has said on Man City future amid Bayern Munich links\n\nALSO READ: Man City may only have two free spots in their best starting XI for title run-in and FA Cup final\n\nOne player who is getting calls from the stands to start more often is Stefan Ortega. Ederson has looked shaky in his last two games, and has recovered from an injury issue between those two outings. Guardiola has told Ortega that Ederson remains number one, despite the backup goalkeeper saying he could leave in the summer if he doesn't get enough playing time.\n\nGuardiola wants Ortega to stay and there is a contract offer on the table, but with the German unlikely to feature in the final three Premier League fixtures, that could leave just 90 minutes to decide his future.\n\nIf Sergio Gomez got any minutes between now and the end of the campaign, City will likely be winning comfortably. Gomez is firmly down the pecking order and may look to leave this summer after two seasons on the fringes. Any minutes he does get must be used to show City what he can do, or put himself in the shop window.\n\nMatheus Nunes is unlikely to leave and is happy with his progress this term, but is another unlikely to feature much this month. He will hope to persuade Guardiola of his abilities if he does get off the bench, with reports of midfield reinforcements arriving before next season.\n\nThree players not in danger of leaving City are Phil Foden, Kevin De Bruyne and Julian Alvarez - although they will all be keen to stake their claims for the number 10 spot ahead of next season.\n\nDe Bruyne is the current occupant when fit and Guardiola insists the Belgian will not play anywhere else. That has nudged Foden out wide. Often, Alvarez has dropped to the bench and he may now be left with an impact role.\n\nAlvarez must do what he did against Wolves, when he came off the bench to score, using his reduced game-time to be as effective as possible. Meanwhile, Foden will be doing all he can to persuade Guardiola that he can displace De Bruyne in the middle. De Bruyne has to respond to that competition and lock in his position ahead of next season.\n\nAny player stating their case in the last four finals will do their chances no harm when decisions come to be made over their future.", "source": {"uri": "manchestereveningnews.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Manchester Evening News"}, "authors": [{"uri": "joe_bray@manchestereveningnews.co.uk", "name": "Joe Bray", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pep_Guardiola", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pep Guardiola"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stefan_Ortega", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Stefan Ortega"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ederson_(footballer,_born_1993)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ederson (footballer, born 1993)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rodri_(footballer,_born_1996)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rodri (footballer, born 1996)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R\u00faben_Dias", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "R\u00faben Dias"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Grealish", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jack Grealish"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treble_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Treble (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Stones", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "John Stones"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FC_Bayern_Munich", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "FC Bayern Munich"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester_City_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Manchester City F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manuel_Akanji", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Manuel Akanji"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sergio_G\u00f3mez_(footballer,_born_2000)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sergio G\u00f3mez (footballer, born 2000)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Gomez_(footballer)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Joe Gomez (footballer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FA_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "FA Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premier_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Premier League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goalkeeper_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Goalkeeper (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matheus_Nunes", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Matheus Nunes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_De_Bruyne", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kevin De Bruyne"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolverhampton_Wanderers_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midfielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Midfielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phil_Foden", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Phil Foden"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Interactive", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Interactive", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Pets/Free_Services", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Pets/Free Services", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Paper_and_Pencil/Tic-Tac-Toe", "label": "dmoz/Games/Paper and Pencil/Tic-Tac-Toe", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://i2-prod.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/article28957200.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_GettyImages-2147548943.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9545641", "eventUri": "eng-9545641", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1058823529411765, "wgt": 136, "relevance": 1}

It was the Argentine who won the early penalty for Haaland to put away and then again to score a worldie to put them back ahead in a game that had started to frustrate them.\n\nKevin De Bruyne wasn't risked at Craven Cottage as he continued to be nursed through an ongoing hamstring injury, yet Alvarez's performance in his absence had made up Guardiola's mind. Two had to become three.\n\nALSO READ: Everything Guardiola has said on Man City future amid Bayern Munich links\n\nALSO READ: Man City rivals disprove latest excuse being readied for 115 charges\n\n\"He helped me a lot to understand that maybe in the future I have to adjust something to make both he and Kevin play. In tight games, where we play against defences with five at the back, this will be so so important,' said the City boss afterwards.\n\n\"It's not just the goal and the penalty. It's the intensity in the pressure, keeping the ball, and the vision because he is an incredible, exceptional player. Not just scoring goals - he knows exactly where the other players are and the movements, everything he does.\"\n\nGuardiola can go overboard in press conferences but this was sincere - and backed up six days later when De Bruyne returned to the side and Alvarez and Haaland stayed in it. This season, he has proven a handy replacement for both men when they have spent months on the sidelines.\n\nTheir return - and the form of Phil Foden - has limited Alvarez again, and goals began to desert the forward as he lost a regular place in the team; he went eight games without scoring in March and April. However, he scored a striker's goal in the win at Brighton and then managed another lovely effort off the bench against Wolves.\n\nThat was his 100th appearance for City, and if he has had to spend plenty of those on the bench it was significant that he found the net as well; this was his 10th league goal of the season and 18th in all competitions. 20 is within reach with four games to go.\n\nHitting that target depends on how many minutes he is given, although his recent performances are giving Guardiola every encouragement to use him in every game even if it is not from the start. Alvarez may feel like he is no further on than he was the last time City came down to Craven Cottage, but holding his position with this level of squad competition should not be underestimated and there is every chance he can have a decisive say in the final weeks.", "source": {"uri": "manchestereveningnews.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Manchester Evening News"}, "authors": [{"uri": "simon_bajkowski@manchestereveningnews.co.uk", "name": "Simon Bajkowski", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erling_Haaland", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Erling Haaland"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pep_Guardiola", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pep Guardiola"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_De_Bruyne", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Kevin De Bruyne"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fulham_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fulham F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester_City_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Manchester City F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Craven_Cottage", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Craven Cottage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FC_Bayern_Munich", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "FC Bayern Munich"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolverhampton_Wanderers_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brighton", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Brighton"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Brighton"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phil_Foden", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Phil Foden"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work/Work-Life_Balance", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work/Work-Life Balance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Historical", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Historical", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Farkle", "label": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Farkle", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Paper_and_Pencil/Tic-Tac-Toe", "label": "dmoz/Games/Paper and Pencil/Tic-Tac-Toe", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 51}], "image": "https://i2-prod.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/article26818449.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_GettyImages-1252417603.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9545641", "eventUri": "eng-9545641", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.09019607843137245, "wgt": 129, "relevance": 1}

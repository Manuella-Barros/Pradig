Farrell, 47, called the makeup on the upcoming Max series an \u201cextraordinary thing\" and credited artist Mike Marino as the mastermind behind the Penguin's aesthetic. \u201cHe created the puppet, and I'm the marionette, is the way I think of it.

The Banshees of Inisherin star said that there were only a few scenes with the Penguin in the 2022 movie, and he wanted more. \u201cI just knew there was so much to do with it \u2014 age it up, age it down,\u201d he said at the time. Though he didn\u2019t go into much more detail about the upcoming show during his SiriusXM appearance, Farrell said he hopes audiences will enjoy the spinoff about Oswald Copplebot. \u201cA lot of great people put a lot of hard work into it,\" he stated. Farrell first portrayed the Penguin in the 2022 film The Batman. The film's box office success was what prompted a spinoff show featuring the Gotham City villain to be ordered straight to series.

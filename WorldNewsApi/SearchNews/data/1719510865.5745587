{"id": 223691720, "title": "Major supermarket now 'most expensive' for basics as staple 13% pricier than last week", "text": "Shoppers who are hoping for some relief from the relentless rise in grocery prices will be saddened to know that one supermarket has just increased the price of a staple item by nearly 13 per cent since last week. Manchester Evening News' weekly comparison of the six main supermarkets has been tracking the price of eight items - mince, chicken, a two-pint bottle of milk, a loaf of bread, coffee, teabags, butter and beans - for over two years now. After significant price increases last year, things seemed to be slowing down a bit much to the relief of shoppers, many of whom have been struggling to make ends meet during the cost of living crisis. So it's now disappointing news that Tesco has raised the price of its 300g pack of two chicken breasts from \u00a32.35 to \u00a32.65 since last week. This pushes the cost of its basket of essentials up from \u00a312.32 to \u00a312.62, making it the priciest of them all. Lidl remains the cheapest for the second week in a row with a price of \u00a312.11, followed by Aldi's \u00a312.14, Morrisons' \u00a312.27 and Sainsbury's and Asda, both at \u00a312.33. Aldi disputes the results of the weekly comparison, arguing that it doesn't consider like-for-like products or 'the higher quality' of its goods. The supermarket points out, for instance, that Aldi beans are 20g heavier than Sainsbury's and that Aldi teabags are 'better quality than the comparative products used'. Asda has also disputed it, arguing that the small sample of products does not provide a comprehensive view of prices and fails to account for its deals. The supermarket maintains that its Just Essentials range is the largest and cheapest available, rivalling Aldi's. The full list of all products from each supermarket can be found below.

Scientists forecast a record-breaking 2024 hurricane season with up to 25 named storms. The changing climate may lead to more major hurricanes and slower, stalled storms causing devastating flooding. Small island states like Dominica must confront the legacy of colonialism in building climate resilience.When Hurricane Beryl hit the Grenadine Islands on July 1, its 150-mph winds and awesome storm surge made it the earliest category 5 storm (the most destructive grade on the Saffir-Simpson hurricane wind scale) the tropical Atlantic has seen. An active hurricane season in 2024 was forecast well in advance. However, the speed at which Beryl intensified, jumping from tropical-storm strength with winds averaging 70mph to major-hurricane status with 130mph winds in just 24 hours, astounded scientists.\n\n\"Beryl is a storm more typical of the heart of hurricane season than of June, and its rapid intensification and strength have likely been driven by unusually warm waters,\" says Brian Tang, an associate professor of atmospheric science at the University at Albany, State University of New York.\n\nAs the world heats faster due to record fossil fuel emissions, research suggests that there are more unpleasant surprises to come.\n\nIn a narrow band of the mid-Atlantic Ocean where most hurricanes form, sea surface temperatures are anomalously high. In fact, the ocean's heat content - a measure of how much energy is contained in the surface water that hurricanes draw strength from - was close to its average for September on July 1.\n\nWater accumulates heat slowly, so it is alarming to see ocean heat near its usual peak at the start of summer. If the tropical Atlantic is already producing such storms, what might the rest of the hurricane season hold?\n\n\"If the National Hurricane Centre's early forecast, released May 23, is right, the North Atlantic could see 17 to 25 named storms, eight to 13 hurricanes, and four to seven major hurricanes by the end of November,\" says Jhordanne Jones, a postdoctoral research fellow who studies how climate change affects the scientific effort to predict hurricanes at Purdue University.\n\n\"That's the highest number of named storms in any preseason forecast.\"\n\nSeawater hotter than 26 degrees Celsius (79\u00b0F) is the lifeblood of hurricanes. Warm, moist air is another prerequisite. But that's not all these monsters need to reach the limits of their savagery: consistent winds in the upper and lower atmosphere are also necessary to keep cyclonic storms spinning.\n\nA shift from El Nino to La Nina - two opposite phases in a long-term temperature pattern in the Pacific - is expected later this summer. This could tamp down trade winds that might otherwise tear a hurricane's vortex apart. Jones says:\n\n\"La Nina may indicate an early start to the season as well as a longer season, as La Nina - along with a warm Atlantic - maintains a hurricane-friendly environment earlier and longer within the year.\"\n\nYou might expect global heating to bring more hurricanes. But that's not what research has found so far, according to Ben Clarke (University of Oxford) and Friederike Otto (Imperial College London), two scientists who try to attribute the role of climate change in extreme weather events.\n\n\"Warm, moist air and high ocean temperatures are in ample supply in a rapidly warming world. Yet there is no evidence that hurricanes are happening more often, nor do scientists expect this to change with further climate change,\" they say.\n\nInstead, hurricanes that do occur are more likely to be major storms like Beryl. Conditions for breeding hurricanes will be found further north and south of the equator too, since the ocean is heating rapidly everywhere. And Atlantic hurricanes may form outside of the season (June 1 to November 30) that people have come to expect them in.\n\n\"There is also evidence that they are moving more slowly, and are increasingly likely to completely stall near the coast, leading to more flooding as more rain is dumped over one place. This was one reason why Hurricane Harvey, which struck Texas and Louisiana in 2017, was so destructive,\" Clarke and Otto say.\n\nThe trio of deadly hurricanes (Harvey, Irma and Maria) that hammered the Atlantic in quick succession that summer gave people little respite. These \"storm clusters\", as climate adaptation researcher Anitha Karthik (Edinburgh Napier University) calls them, are a growing weather trend that is making hurricane-prone areas increasingly inhospitable.\n\n\"When Hurricane Maria struck the eastern Caribbean island of Dominica in 2017, it caused the kind of devastation which is unthinkable to larger countries,\" says Emily Wilkinson, an expert in climate resilience at the University of the West Indies.\n\n\"The category 5 hurricane damaged 98 per cent of building roofs and caused USD 1.2 billion (950 million pound) in damage. Dominica effectively lost 226 per cent of its GDP overnight.\"\n\nVowing to become the first climate-resilient nation, Dominica set about rebuilding homes, bridges and other infrastructure. Conserving the forests and reefs that buffer rain, wind and waves was a priority, Wilkinson says. But in trying to build a sustainable future from the wreckage of Maria, Dominica had to contend with its past as a European colony - a fate shared by many small-island states in the Caribbean and elsewhere.\n\n\"Across most Caribbean islands, hazard exposure is about the same, but research shows that poverty and social inequality drastically magnify the severity of disasters,\" say Levi Gahman and Gabrielle Thongs, lecturers in geography, also at the University of the West Indies.\n\nDominica had a plantation economy imposed on it by the British that squandered the island's productive potential and funnelled its wealth overseas, Wilkinson says.\n\n\"Yet Dominica also has the Caribbean's largest remaining indigenous community, and the Kalinago people have farming practices that combine crop diversification with planting methods that help stabilise slopes,\" she adds.\n\nClimate-vulnerable states can draw from advantages such as these to navigate an uncertain future. But the experiences of Caribbean islands show how a supposedly historical process like colonialism still claims lives in the present.\n\nMounting storms will add greater urgency to demands for \"climate reparations\" to the formerly colonised world from rich countries that have contributed most to the climate problem.", "source": {"uri": "economictimes.indiatimes.com", "dataType": "news",

The two together pack a powerful punch when it comes to hurricanes.\n\n\"La Ni\u00f1a typically increases Atlantic hurricane activity,\" Colorado State forecasters said. La Ni\u00f1a lacks the wind shear associated with El Ni\u00f1o that helps tear apart developing storms or keeping others from intensifying.\n\n\"Sea surface temperatures in the eastern and central Atlantic are currently at record warm levels and are anticipated to remain well above average for the upcoming hurricane season.\"\n\nThose warm Atlantic waters provide an environment favorable for both the development and intensification of hurricanes, CSU said.\n\nWhat is the average number of hurricanes in a hurricane season?\n\nBased on averages from 1991 to 2020, an average Atlantic hurricane season has 14.4 named storms, according to the National Hurricane Center.\n\nThe average number of hurricanes is 7.2 and the average number of major hurricanes is 3.2, CSU said. That makes predictions for 2024 well above the average.\n\nThe first named storm typically forms in mid to late June, the first hurricane tends to form in early to mid-August, and the first major hurricane forms in late August or early September, although there have been exceptions to all of these.\n\nCountdown clock: When will 2024 hurricane season end?\n\nThe 2024 Atlantic hurricane season started June 1.

In fact, the ocean's heat content - a measure of how much energy is contained in the surface water that hurricanes draw strength from - was close to its average for September on July 1.\n\nWater accumulates heat slowly, so it is alarming to see ocean heat near its usual peak at the start of summer. If the tropical Atlantic is already producing such storms, what might the rest of the hurricane season hold? A bumper season \"If the National Hurricane Centre's early forecast, released May 23, is right, the North Atlantic could see 17 to 25 named storms, eight to 13 hurricanes, and four to seven major hurricanes by the end of November,\" says Jhordanne Jones, a postdoctoral research fellow who studies how climate change affects the scientific effort to predict hurricanes at Purdue University.\n\n\"That's the highest number of named storms in any preseason forecast.\" Seawater hotter than 26 degrees Celsius (79\u00b0F) is the lifeblood of hurricanes. Warm, moist air is another prerequisite. But that's not all these monsters need to reach the limits of their savagery: consistent winds in the upper and lower atmosphere are also necessary to keep cyclonic storms spinning.\n\nA shift from El Ni\u00f1o to La Nina - two opposite phases in a long-term temperature pattern in the Pacific - is expected later this summer. This could tamp down trade winds that might otherwise tear a hurricane's vortex apart. Jones says: \"La Nina may indicate an early start to the season as well as a longer season, as La Nina - along with a warm Atlantic - maintains a hurricane-friendly environment earlier and longer within the year.\" You might expect global heating to bring more hurricanes. But that's not what research has found so far, according to Ben Clarke (University of Oxford) and Friederike Otto (Imperial College London), two scientists who try to attribute the role of climate change in extreme weather events.\n\n\"Warm, moist air and high ocean temperatures are in ample supply in a rapidly warming world. Yet there is no evidence that hurricanes are happening more often, nor do scientists expect this to change with further climate change,\" they say.\n\nInstead, hurricanes that do occur are more likely to be major storms like Beryl. Conditions for breeding hurricanes will be found further north and south of the equator too, since the ocean is heating rapidly everywhere. And Atlantic hurricanes may form outside of the season (June 1 to November 30) that people have come to expect them in.\n\n\"There is also evidence that they are moving more slowly, and are increasingly likely to completely stall near the coast, leading to more flooding as more rain is dumped over one place. This was one reason why Hurricane Harvey, which struck Texas and Louisiana in 2017, was so destructive,\" Clarke and Otto say.\n\nThe trio of deadly hurricanes (Harvey, Irma and Maria) that hammered the Atlantic in quick succession that summer gave people little respite. These \"storm clusters\", as climate adaptation researcher Anitha Karthik (Edinburgh Napier University) calls them, are a growing weather trend that is making hurricane-prone areas increasingly inhospitable.\n\nClimate colonialism \"When Hurricane Maria struck the eastern Caribbean island of Dominica in 2017, it caused the kind of devastation which is unthinkable to larger countries,\" says Emily Wilkinson, an expert in climate resilience at the University of the West Indies.\n\n\"The category 5 hurricane damaged 98 per cent of building roofs and caused USD 1.2 billion (950 million pound) in damage. Dominica effectively lost 226 per cent of its GDP overnight.\" Vowing to become the first climate-resilient nation, Dominica set about rebuilding homes, bridges and other infrastructure. Conserving the forests and reefs that buffer rain, wind and waves was a priority, Wilkinson says. But in trying to build a sustainable future from the wreckage of Maria, Dominica had to contend with its past as a European colony - a fate shared by many small-island states in the Caribbean and elsewhere.\n\n\"Across most Caribbean islands, hazard exposure is about the same, but research shows that poverty and social inequality drastically magnify the severity of disasters,\" say Levi Gahman and Gabrielle Thongs, lecturers in geography, also at the University of the West Indies.\n\nDominica had a plantation economy imposed on it by the British that squandered the island's productive potential and funnelled its wealth overseas, Wilkinson says.\n\n\"Yet Dominica also has the Caribbean's largest remaining indigenous community, and the Kalinago people have farming practices that combine crop diversification with planting methods that help stabilise slopes,\" she adds.\n\nClimate-vulnerable states can draw from advantages such as these to navigate an uncertain future. But the experiences of Caribbean islands show how a supposedly historical process like colonialism still claims lives in the present.\n\nMounting storms will add greater urgency to demands for \"climate reparations\" to the formerly colonised world from rich countries that have contributed most to the climate problem.

What to know", "body": "The 2024 hurricane season may be more active for South Carolina and other states than previously thought, a new forecast shows.\n\nColorado State University researchers recently released an updated forecast that predicts a more active Atlantic hurricane season then what they previously reported. The hurricane season is expected now to have 25 named storms, up from the 23 the researchers predicted early in the year. The updated forecast comes after Hurricane Beryl tore through Texas, leaving millions of people without power earlier this week, according to the Associated Press.\n\n\"Hurricane Beryl, a deep tropical Category 5 hurricane, is also a likely harbinger of a hyperactive season,\" the Colorado State University report reads. \"This forecast is of above-normal confidence. We anticipate a well above-average probability for major hurricane landfalls along the continental United States coastline and in the Caribbean.\"\n\nThe Atlantic hurricane season started June 1 and ends Nov. 30.\n\nHurricane prediction breakdown\n\nInformation collected through early July indicates that the 2024 Atlantic hurricane season will have activity well above the 1991-2020 average, CSU states. The probability of U.S. major hurricane landfall is estimated to be far above the long-period average.\n\nCSU estimates that in 2024 there will be 25 named storms (average is 14.4), 120 named storm days (average is 69.4), 12 hurricanes (average is 7.2), 50 hurricane days (average is 27, six major hurricanes (average is 3.2) and 16 major hurricane days (average is 7.4). These numbers include the three named storms that have appeared this season, Alberto, Beryl and Chris.\n\nNOAA\n\nThe latest CSU forecast falls more in line with the hurricane season prediction the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration made earlier this year.

A category 5 hurricane has sustained winds of at least 157 mph.\n\nAn average hurricane season produces 14 named storms, of which seven lead to hurricanes and three become major cyclones.\n\nThe CSU forecasters cite two primary reasons for above average hurricane forecasts. Seas are hotter than they are normally, providing more energy to feed tropical cyclones. Also, the absence this year of an El Nino weather pattern, which was present in 2023. El Nino produces strong winds that break apart hurricanes.\n\n\"While early season storm activity in the western Atlantic typically has little relationship with overall basinwide activity, deep tropical hurricane activity in the tropical Atlantic and eastern Caribbean (such as we saw with Beryl) is often associated with hyperactive seasons,\" according to the forecast.\n\nIn a May forecast U.S. government meteorologists said they expect between four and seven major hurricanes among a projected eight to 13 hurricanes, which could result from an expected 17 to 25 named tropical storms.", "source": {"uri": "app.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Asbury Park Press"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saffir\u2013Simpson_scale", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Saffir\u2013Simpson scale"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorado_State_University", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Colorado State University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tropical_cyclone", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tropical cyclone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hurricane_Beryl", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Hurricane Beryl"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rapid_intensification", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rapid intensification"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weather_forecasting", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Weather forecasting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meteorologist", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Meteorologist"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Landfall", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Landfall"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maximum_sustained_wind", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Maximum sustained wind"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yucat\u00e1n_Peninsula", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petroleum", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Petroleum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caribbean", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Caribbean"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlantic_hurricane", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Atlantic hurricane"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexico", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mexico"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Mexico"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamaica", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jamaica"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Jamaica"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grenada", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Grenada"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Grenada"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/El_Ni\u00f1o", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "El Ni\u00f1o"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_government_of_the_United_States", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Federal government of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlantic_Ocean", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Atlantic Ocean"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Earth_Sciences", "label": "dmoz/Science/Earth Sciences", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Family/Pregnancy", "label": "dmoz/Home/Family/Pregnancy", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Earth_Sciences/Atmospheric_Sciences", "label": "dmoz/Science/Earth Sciences/Atmospheric Sciences", "wgt": 40}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Management/Strategy_and_Forecasting", "label": "dmoz/Business/Management/Strategy and Forecasting", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Public_Health_and_Safety/Tropical_Health", "label": "dmoz/Health/Public Health and Safety/Tropical Health", "wgt": 12}], "image": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/27846136851c10a9778b46a67716f9aab4dd2c25/c=0-215-600-553/local/-/media/AsburyPark/2014/07/03/brnnqx1iuaiffhm.jpg?auto=webp&format=pjpg&width=1200", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9716615", "eventUri": "eng-9716615", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-11-30", "textStart": 1055, "textEnd": 1062}, {"amb": false, "date": "-04-13", "textStart": 1089, "textEnd": 1097}], "sentiment": -0.02745098039215688, "wgt": 199, "relevance": 1}

FGN21 HURRICANES-EARTH WARMING How Hurricanes Will Change as the Earth Warms By Jack Marley, Environment + Energy Editor, UK Edition | LatestLY", "body": "London, Jul 9 (The Conversation) When Hurricane Beryl hit the Grenadine Islands on July 1, its 150-mph winds and awesome storm surge made it the earliest category 5 storm (the most destructive grade on the Saffir-Simpson hurricane wind scale) the tropical Atlantic has seen.\n\nAn active hurricane season in 2024 was forecast well in advance. However, the speed at which Beryl intensified, jumping from tropical-storm strength with winds averaging 70mph to major-hurricane status with 130mph winds in just 24 hours, astounded scientists.\n\nAlso Read | Ram Buxani Dies: Prominent Indian Businessman and ITL Cosmos Group Chairman Passes Away at 83 in UAE.\n\n\"Beryl is a storm more typical of the heart of hurricane season than of June, and its rapid intensification and strength have likely been driven by unusually warm waters,\" says Brian Tang, an associate professor of atmospheric science at the University at Albany, State University of New York.\n\nAs the world heats faster due to record fossil fuel emissions, research suggests that there are more unpleasant surprises to come.\n\nAlso Read | Paramount Layoffs: Entertainment Company To Continue Job Cuts Until Skydance Deal Closes, Says Report.\n\nIn a narrow band of the mid-Atlantic Ocean where most hurricanes form, sea surface temperatures are anomalously high. In fact, the ocean's heat content - a measure of how much energy is contained in the surface water that hurricanes draw strength from - was close to its average for September on July 1.\n\nWater accumulates heat slowly, so it is alarming to see ocean heat near its usual peak at the start of summer. If the tropical Atlantic is already producing such storms, what might the rest of the hurricane season hold?\n\nA bumper season\n\n\"If the National Hurricane Centre's early forecast, released May 23, is right, the North Atlantic could see 17 to 25 named storms, eight to 13 hurricanes, and four to seven major hurricanes by the end of November,\" says Jhordanne Jones, a postdoctoral research fellow who studies how climate change affects the scientific effort to predict hurricanes at Purdue University.\n\n\"That's the highest number of named storms in any preseason forecast.\"\n\nSeawater hotter than 26 degrees Celsius (79\u00b0F) is the lifeblood of hurricanes. Warm, moist air is another prerequisite. But that's not all these monsters need to reach the limits of their savagery: consistent winds in the upper and lower atmosphere are also necessary to keep cyclonic storms spinning.\n\nA shift from El Ni\u00f1o to La Nina - two opposite phases in a long-term temperature pattern in the Pacific - is expected later this summer. This could tamp down trade winds that might otherwise tear a hurricane's vortex apart. Jones says:\n\n\"La Nina may indicate an early start to the season as well as a longer season, as La Nina - along with a warm Atlantic - maintains a hurricane-friendly environment earlier and longer within the year.\"\n\nYou might expect global heating to bring more hurricanes. But that's not what research has found so far, according to Ben Clarke (University of Oxford) and Friederike Otto (Imperial College London), two scientists who try to attribute the role of climate change in extreme weather events.\n\n\"Warm, moist air and high ocean temperatures are in ample supply in a rapidly warming world. Yet there is no evidence that hurricanes are happening more often, nor do scientists expect this to change with further climate change,\" they say.\n\nInstead, hurricanes that do occur are more likely to be major storms like Beryl. Conditions for breeding hurricanes will be found further north and south of the equator too, since the ocean is heating rapidly everywhere. And Atlantic hurricanes may form outside of the season (June 1 to November 30) that people have come to expect them in.\n\n\"There is also evidence that they are moving more slowly, and are increasingly likely to completely stall near the coast, leading to more flooding as more rain is dumped over one place. This was one reason why Hurricane Harvey, which struck Texas and Louisiana in 2017, was so destructive,\" Clarke and Otto say.\n\nThe trio of deadly hurricanes (Harvey, Irma and Maria) that hammered the Atlantic in quick succession that summer gave people little respite. These \"storm clusters\", as climate adaptation researcher Anitha Karthik (Edinburgh Napier University) calls them, are a growing weather trend that is making hurricane-prone areas increasingly inhospitable.\n\nClimate colonialism\n\n\"When Hurricane Maria struck the eastern Caribbean island of Dominica in 2017, it caused the kind of devastation which is unthinkable to larger countries,\" says Emily Wilkinson, an expert in climate resilience at the University of the West Indies.\n\n\"The category 5 hurricane damaged 98 per cent of building roofs and caused USD 1.2 billion (950 million pound) in damage. Dominica effectively lost 226 per cent of its GDP overnight.\"\n\nVowing to become the first climate-resilient nation, Dominica set about rebuilding homes, bridges and other infrastructure. Conserving the forests and reefs that buffer rain, wind and waves was a priority, Wilkinson says. But in trying to build a sustainable future from the wreckage of Maria, Dominica had to contend with its past as a European colony - a fate shared by many small-island states in the Caribbean and elsewhere.\n\n\"Across most Caribbean islands, hazard exposure is about the same, but research shows that poverty and social inequality drastically magnify the severity of disasters,\" say Levi Gahman and Gabrielle Thongs, lecturers in geography, also at the University of the West Indies.\n\nDominica had a plantation economy imposed on it by the British that squandered the island's productive potential and funnelled its wealth overseas, Wilkinson says.\n\n\"Yet Dominica also has the Caribbean's largest remaining indigenous community, and the Kalinago people have farming practices that combine crop diversification with planting methods that help stabilise slopes,\" she adds.\n\nClimate-vulnerable states can draw from advantages such as these to navigate an uncertain future. But the experiences of Caribbean islands show how a supposedly historical process like colonialism still claims lives in the present.\n\nMounting storms will add greater urgency to demands for \"climate reparations\" to the formerly colonised world from rich countries that have contributed most to the climate problem.

Hurricane Emily, which became the first Category 5 July hurricane with winds of 160 mph in 2005, formed two weeks later than Beryl, according to NOAA.\n\nVon Ohlen and Rosencrans both note that while nothing is guaranteed when predicting hurricanes more than a few days away, it appears NOAA's prediction of 4 to 7 major hurricanes during the 2024 hurricane season is on pace to be proven accurate.\n\n\"I am seeing nothing that would make me back off that prediction,\" Rosencrans said.\n\nVon Ohlen says Long Island could see some rain later in the week as the storm works its way up the United States.\n\nWhile no hurricane's eye has hit Long Island since Hurricane Gloria in 1985, Long Island and the region sustained powerful, damaging hits from Superstorm Sandy in 2012, remnants of Hurricane Isaias in 2020, and Hurricane Ida in 2021.\n\nStill, Von Ohlen says, an \"above-normal\" forecast should be taken seriously in all areas where a hurricane could hit.\n\n\"Long Islanders should be aware the probabilities of a general active season are higher across the board,\" he said. \"Stay ready and stay in touch with your forecast.\"", "source": {"uri": "newsday.com", "dataType":

The first named hurricane of the season, Beryl is the earliest Category 5 Atlantic hurricane ever recorded, and also the first Category 4 hurricane to form in the Atlantic in the month of June -- a portent of what experts say is a hurricane season that will be much more intense than usual. It was also abnormal because of where it formed, farther south and east than is typical for storms of this magnitude.\n\nAfter tearing through the Caribbean and the Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula, the storm landed in southeast Texas, canceling more than a thousand flights and cutting power for more than two million residents. The storm killed at least 15 people.\n\nHurricane season usually runs from June 1 to Nov. 30, with most storms developing between mid-August and mid-October. A broad swath of the Caribbean, the Gulf of Mexico and the Atlantic seaboard of the United States is affected by the storms. If you're planning to travel during this hurricane season, here's what you should know.\n\nHow bad will hurricane season be this year?\n\nThe National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration has predicted an 85 percent chance of a more active than normal season. An average season has about 14 named storms, but researchers at Colorado State University forecast that this year there will be 25, including six hurricanes that are Category 3 or higher.\n\nMore hurricanes are likely to occur because of the above-average water temperatures in the Caribbean and the tropical Atlantic. These warmer waters provide fuel for hurricanes and tend to be associated with lower pressure and a more unstable atmosphere, creating an environment conducive to storms, Phil Klotzbach, a senior research scientist in the department of atmospheric science at Colorado State, wrote in an email.\n\nIt seems as if the season is off to an early start. Why?\n\nWarmer ocean temperatures are causing the hurricane season to start earlier than usual. Normally, storms would develop later in the season once the ocean has warmed, but this year parts of the Atlantic are already at 84 degrees, 2 to 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit above normal, according to Dr. Klotzbach.

This combination of conditions typically is quite favorable for hurricane formation and intensification.\"\n\nKlotzbach, in an emailed response to Compass queries, said one important caveat is \"even if our forecast is accurate, we cannot say where these storms will form and track\".\n\nHe added, \"The key is to be prepared and have a plan in place. If storms do threaten, please follow the advice of local emergency managers.\"\n\nThe combined death toll from the storm had risen to 18 as of Tuesday morning - 10 in the Caribbean and eight in the US.\n\nCSU, in its forecast Tuesday, said it has increased the overall forecast numbers slightly, due in part to Hurricane Beryl.\n\n\"Hurricane Beryl, a deep tropical Category 5 hurricane, is also a likely harbinger of a hyperactive season. This forecast is of above-normal confidence. We anticipate a well above-average probability for major hurricane landfalls along the continental United States coastline and in the Caribbean,\" it said.\n\nThe CSU forecast team currently issues seasonal forecasts in early April and then updates it in early June, July and August.\n\nSome years, Klotzbach said, there is very little change made to the forecast from the first prediction in April to the final one in early August, but other years there are more substantial changes. So far this year, CSU issued the same forecast in June that it did in April and have slightly increased it in July.\n\n\"The primary reason why we increased the overall forecast today is due to Hurricane Beryl. While typically early season storm activity does not have much relationship with the rest of the season's activity, when it occurs in the tropical Atlantic and eastern Caribbean, it tends to portend an extremely busy hurricane season. Normally, that portion of the Atlantic basin is not conducive for storm formation this early in the season, due to dry air, dust and relative cool ocean temperatures,\" he said.\n\nThe CSU team said it expects 120 named storm days, 12 hurricanes, 50 hurricane days, six major (Category 3, 4 and 5) hurricanes and 16 major hurricane days.\n\n\"These numbers include Alberto, Beryl and Chris. The probability of U.S. major hurricane landfall is estimated to be well above its long-period average. We predict Atlantic basin Accumulated Cyclone Energy (ACE) and Net Tropical Cyclone (NTC) activity in 2024 to be ~185% of their 1991-2020 average,\" it added.\n\nKlotzbach said since CSU is forecasting overall seasonal levels, \"Beryl has already generated a large amount of activity, so consequently, the forecast for the rest of the season hasn't really changed that much\".\n\nSea surface temperatures averaged across the hurricane Main Development Region of the tropical Atlantic and Caribbean remain near record warm levels, the CSU team said.\n\n\"Extremely warm sea surface temperatures provide a much more conducive dynamic and thermodynamic environment for hurricane formation and intensification,\" it added.\n\nCSU said it anticipates a cool neutral El Ni\u00f1o-Southern Oscillation or La Ni\u00f1a during the peak of the Atlantic hurricane season, \"resulting in reduced levels of tropical Atlantic vertical wind shear\".\n\nAs with all hurricane seasons, the CSU has reminded coastal residents that \"it only takes one hurricane making landfall to make it an active season. Thorough preparations should be made every season, regardless of predicted activity\".\n\n\"Our confidence this year is higher than normal for a July forecast based on the strength and persistence of the current hurricane-favorable large-scale environmental conditions,\" it added.\n\nThe next CSU forecast is scheduled for 6 Aug.\n\nThough a lull in hurricane activity is anticipated in the coming weeks in the Atlantic basin, Colorado State University research scientist Levi Silvers says it is key that the community remains prepared with an plan action in place for any storm activity.\n\nThe Cayman Islands had a close call with Hurricane Beryl, now a tropical storm, as it passed 44 miles southwest of the islands at its closest point of approach last Thursday. It was a Category 3 storm at that stage.\n\nWhile the islands escaped serious damage, Caribbean countries such as Jamaica, Grenada and Union Island were not so fortunate and are still dealing with the severe impacts from the storm.\n\nSilvers, speaking with the Cayman Compass on Monday, says the limited impact on the Cayman Islands could be attributed to the size of the storm at the time and the circulation of its bands as it passed by.\n\nHowever, he said while Cayman escaped serious damage, residents should still keep their hurricane supplies ready and plans in place as the warmer sea temperatures will continue to fuel storms.\n\n\"I think [Beryl] really confirmed what the impact of that warm sea surface temperature is and that's one of the primary things that we were saying is going to drive a super active season is that abnormally warm surface water, and this really confirms that,\" Silvers said.\n\nHe said weather models and forecast tracks were getting better at prediction.\n\nHe said CSU's Tropical Meteorology Project is maintaining its projection of as many as 23 named storms, with winds of 39 mph or higher, for the hurricane season.\n\nOf those named storms, 11 are expected to become hurricanes, with winds of at least 74 mph; and five of those hurricanes are expected to strengthen to Category 3 or higher, becoming major storms with winds of at least 111 mph.\n\nThe key record-breaking characteristic of Beryl, he said, is the early formation of such a strong storm ahead of the peak of the Atlantic hurricane season, which is from August to October.\n\n\"People just need to be prepared and I think people can do this. I think our culture can adapt, and can know how to prepare for these things. People on the Cayman Islands are probably much better than a lot of other communities dealing with tropical storms. I imagine you will have more tropical storms that directly impact the Cayman Islands this year. I just hope it's not like Category 4 hurricanes,\" Silvers said.\n\nLooking at Hurricane Beryl's rapid development and sustained intensity, Silvers said, brings a level of accuracy in the projections that have been issued.\n\n\"We felt very confident this would be an extremely active season. So it's interesting to see it off to such an active start and I think that helps us be more confident in the verification of that [projection]. But we're also grateful that Beryl wasn't worse,\" he said.\n\nSilvers said part of the reason they issue forecasts is to try to help people have a plan and be prepared so that they can relax, \"because nobody can sustain being really stressed all the time\".\n\n\"If you make a plan, then you just know, 'I have my plan, I have my supplies right here, this is what I'm going to do. These are the people I'd contact. These are the things that have to happen for me to evacuate or something like that'. Then you can pay attention, but not be stressed, and that's our hope,\" he said.\n\nSilvers added this is the CSU's recommendation to people even if a quiet season were forecasted.\n\n\"A quiet season [will] still have a few storms and those few storms are going to hit somewhere. So people need to be prepared, even in a really quiet season. Once they're prepared, the hope is that the anxiety levels can actually go down, not go up,\" he said.\n\nBeryl, on Monday, continued to batter Texas as a tropical storm.\n\nThe storm has broken a few records on its path through the Caribbean.\n\nBeryl is now the earliest Atlantic Category 5 hurricane on record, breaking the old record by Hurricane Emily on 17 July 2005. It attained Category 5 status on 2 July.\n\nThe storm spent 4.5 days as a major (Category 3+) hurricane and clocked 9.75 named storm days.\n\nIts 65 mph/24-hour intensification rate from 29-30 June was the fastest on record for an Atlantic named storm this early in the calendar year.\n\nThe previous earliest 65 mph/24-hour intensification rate was Bertha from 6-7 July 2008, according to statistics shared by CSU meteorologist Philip Klotzbach.", "source": {"uri": "caymancompass.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Cayman Compass"}, "authors": [{"uri": "reshma_ragoonath@caymancompass.com", "name": "Reshma Ragoonath", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hurricane_Beryl", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hurricane Beryl"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saffir\u2013Simpson_scale", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Saffir\u2013Simpson scale"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/El_Ni\u00f1o\u2013Southern_Oscillation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "El Ni\u00f1o\u2013Southern Oscillation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_M._Gray", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "William M.

In June, CSU researchers said that there would be 23 named storms, 11 hurricanes and five major hurricanes.\n\nBetween 1991 and 2020, an average season has consisted of 14 named storms, seven of which become hurricanes and three that form into major hurricanes.\n\nCSU experts noted that this forecast comes with \"above-normal confidence,\" while pointing out that the Atlantic and Caribbean remain at record-warm temperatures. It also said that Hurricane Beryl, a Category 1 hurricane that made landfall on the Texas coast overnight Monday, foreshadows a busy season ahead.\n\nOver the past nine years, Colorado State has admitted that their predictions, especially this early in the season, are not always accurate. The estimates are supposedly correct 64% of the time.\n\nThe National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration released a similar forecast in May, predicting that there would be 17 to 25 named storms, 8 to 13 hurricanes and 4 to 7 major hurricanes that would reach Category 3 and higher.\n\nThe estimates provided by the administration were \"the highest NOAA has ever issued for the May outlook,\" according to NOAA administrator Rick Spinrad.\n\nChance of Gulf landfall\n\nCSU experts say that areas within a 50-mile radius of Florida are at the highest risk of named storms and hurricanes.\n\nThe probability of a storm landing within a 50-mile radius of Louisiana is 80%, according to the forecast, and the likelihood is lower for hurricanes at 52%. There is a low chance of a major hurricane making landfall near Louisiana, or 21%.\n\nAccording to the report, major hurricanes this season are likely to make major landfall along the continental United States coastline and in the Caribbean.\n\nRecent storm activity\n\nSince June 1, or the start of hurricane season, there have been three named storms: Alberto, Beryl and Chris.\n\nOn June 19, Tropical Storm Alberto formed in the Gulf, nearly three hundred miles southeast of Brownsville, Texas, after spinning in the Bay of Campeche for days.\n\nBefore making landfall on Monday, Hurricane Beryl broke records after becoming the earliest Category 4 hurricane to form in the Atlantic.

Typically, early-season activity has little correlation with how a hurricane season will go, but Beryl brings up several exceptions.\n\nThe first is its formation location in the deep tropics so early in the season. Storms in the deep tropics tend to develop during the heart of hurricane season (August to October), so Beryl's formation and rapid intensification east of the Lesser Antilles could be a signal that this part of the Atlantic is ready much earlier than usual.\n\nSecond, as CSU meteorologist Phil Klotzbach notes, Beryl lasted for a very long time and was quite potent: \"Hurricane Beryl was an extremely impressive hurricane, generating the most ACE of any individual hurricane activity prior to 1 August on record.\"\n\nSeasons with storms of this caliber were all above-average and had an average of 10 hurricanes, according to Klotzbach.\n\nSeason well ahead of schedule already: With Beryl (first hurricane) and Chris (third named storm) already in the record books, we're now weeks ahead of schedule. The average third tropical storm typically forms on August 3, followed by the fourth tropical storm on August 15. The first hurricane typically forms on August 11, followed by the second hurricane on August 26.\n\nThe two main drivers of an active season remain the same, both with increasing confidence:\n\n1. The Atlantic's record warmth: Much of the Caribbean, Gulf of Mexico and tropical Atlantic remain much warmer than average as we head through the summer. If other factors are equal, the deeper and warmer ocean water is, the stronger a hurricane can become.\n\nSea surface temperatures remain at record levels across the basin, according to Brian McNoldy.\n\nThis absurd warmth in the deep tropics helped lead Beryl to become such an early Cabo Verde storm and the earliest Category 5 on record in the Caribbean.\n\n2. La Ni\u00f1a expected by the peak of this season: NOAA's Climate Prediction Center is forecasting neutral conditions in the equatorial eastern Pacific to cool and become La Ni\u00f1a by the heart of this hurricane season, with a greater than 70% chance of developing.\n\nThis matters because it's one of the strongest influences on hurricane season activity.\n\nIn general, La Ni\u00f1a Atlantic hurricane seasons have less wind shear that can otherwise rip storms apart, and rising, unstable air that is more conducive for thunderstorms, the building blocks of tropical storms and hurricanes.\n\nSo this means instead of El Ni\u00f1o acting as a gentle brake on hurricane season, La Ni\u00f1a could instead step on the gas pedal.\n\nWe could \"run out of names\": This outlook of 25 storms implies we could exhaust the 2024 list of hurricane names.\n\nA committee of the World Meteorological Organization maintains lists of names for tropical cyclones around the world. Each year, there's a list of 21 Atlantic Basin names that repeat every six years, unless one or more of them is so deadly and/or destructive that its name is retired.\n\nSo if we use up all names through William this year, a supplemental names list will be tapped, beginning with Adria.\n\nOnly two other Atlantic hurricane seasons in which names have been used have pushed beyond 21 storms.\n\nIn 2005 (28 storms) and 2020 (30), an alternate list of Greek alphabet letters was used for additional storms beyond the 21st storm. But use of the Greek alphabet was retired in 2021 due to confusion among Greek letters that sound similar (such as Zeta, Eta, Theta), especially if they were active at the same time.\n\nWe've already used the first three names on the list.\n\n- From Strong El Ni\u00f1o To La Ni\u00f1a: How Past Seasons Have Turned Out", "source": {"uri": "weather.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Weather Channel"}, "authors": [{"uri": "weather_channel@weather.com", "name": "Weather Channel", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saffir\u2013Simpson_scale", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Saffir\u2013Simpson scale"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tropical_cyclone", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tropical cyclone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hurricane_Beryl", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Hurricane Beryl"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorado_State_University", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Colorado State University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlantic_Ocean", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Atlantic Ocean"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tropics", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Tropics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accumulated_cyclone_energy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Accumulated cyclone energy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/La_Ni\u00f1a", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "La Ni\u00f1a"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weather_forecasting", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Weather forecasting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlantic_hurricane", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Atlantic hurricane"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meteorologist", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Meteorologist"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rapid_intensification", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rapid intensification"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesser_Antilles", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lesser Antilles"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gulf_of_Mexico", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gulf of Mexico"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caribbean", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Caribbean"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hurricane_Eta", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hurricane Eta"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hurricane_Zeta", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hurricane Zeta"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Meteorological_Organization", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "World Meteorological Organization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equator", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Equator"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_Prediction_Center", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Climate Prediction Center"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sea_surface_temperature", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sea surface temperature"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_alphabet", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Greek alphabet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/El_Ni\u00f1o", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "El Ni\u00f1o"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cape_Verde", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cape Verde"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Cape Verde"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Earth_Sciences", "label": "dmoz/Science/Earth Sciences", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Family/Pregnancy", "label": "dmoz/Home/Family/Pregnancy", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Food/Seasonings", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Food/Seasonings", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Earth_Sciences/Atmospheric_Sciences", "label": "dmoz/Science/Earth Sciences/Atmospheric Sciences", "wgt": 39}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Public_Health_and_Safety/Tropical_Health", "label": "dmoz/Health/Public Health and Safety/Tropical Health", "wgt": 13}], "image": "https://s.w-x.co/sat_info_tropical_beryl_8_720.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9716615", "eventUri": "eng-9716615", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-01", "textStart": 1627, "textEnd": 1635}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-03", "textStart": 1984, "textEnd": 1992}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-15", "textStart": 2035, "textEnd": 2044}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-11", "textStart": 2085, "textEnd": 2094}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-26", "textStart": 2132, "textEnd": 2141}], "sentiment": 0.2078431372549019, "wgt": 184, "relevance": 1}

They now expect an additional hurricane (a total of 12 for the season) and two more named storms (a total of 25 for the season).\n\n\"Hurricane Beryl, a deep tropical Category 5 hurricane, is also a likely harbinger of a hyperactive season,\" the updated forecast says.\n\nThere is a bit of short-term good news, however: \"Following Beryl, it does look like the Atlantic season will quiet down temporarily,\" Phil Klotzbach, a hurricane researcher at Colorado State University, told USA TODAY.\n\nThat reprieve is expected to be short-lived, as Klotzbach believes the risk could increase by the end of the month.\n\nOnce the storm season restarts in a couple of weeks, it may come back with a vengeance, forecasters say.\n\nHurricane forecasters brace for a dangerous hurricane season\n\nSome experts say Beryl, the earliest Category 5 hurricane on record, is a confirmation of their fears about this hurricane season.\n\nThat was a \"hugely ominous start to the season,\" said chief science officer Steve Bowen of Gallagher Re, a reinsurance firm, on X, formerly Twitter. \"If you were doubtful of the seasonal hyperactive forecasts, this should be a wake-up call.\"\n\nForecasters have predicted a busy hurricane season in the Atlantic Basin this year; one forecast predicted as many as 33 named storms. An average year sees 14.\n\n\"We are likely going to see more extreme record-breaking storms this season as water temperatures continue to be very anomalously warm AND we transition to La Ni\u00f1a, which generally acts to reduce vertical wind shear in the tropical Atlantic and therefore enhance hurricane activity,\" noted University of Miami meteorologist Brian McNoldy on his blog.\n\nPrime Atlantic hurricane season is August, September and October, with the most activity taking place from Aug. 15-Oct. 15.\n\nWhen will the next Atlantic hurricane form?\n\nThere isn't much going on in the tropics at the moment - and it's not uncommon for July to be \"generally quiet\" when it comes to tropical storms and hurricanes, according to Weather.com meteorologist Danielle Banks.\n\nIn fact, the long-term average for July tropical cyclones in the Atlantic is only 1. That's based on data from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) that goes back to 1851.\n\nAnd overall, only about 8% of the Atlantic hurricane season's named storms since 1851 have occurred in July, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Association's Hurricane Research Division.\n\nDust is making it hard for hurricanes to form -- for now\n\nOne reason for the lull over the next couple of weeks will be the dry, dusty, air that's spreading across the Atlantic Ocean from the Sahara Desert in northern Africa: \"Although the water temperatures are warm enough to support tropical development and further intensification, dry air and dust are suppressors for storm development,\" Banks said.\n\n\"Basically the dust acts like a lid and storms struggle to form,\" she added.\n\nThe plume of dust can reach the mainland United States, also cutting down storm formation in the Gulf of Mexico, according to WTXL-TV meteorologist Casanova Nurse.\n\nThat mass of extremely dry and dusty air known as the Saharan Air Layer forms over the Sahara Desert and moves across the North Atlantic every three to five days from late spring to early fall, peaking in late June to mid-August, according to NOAA.", "source": {"uri": "usatoday.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "USA Today"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Warm waters fuel hurricanes.\n\n\"Extremely warm sea surface temperatures provide a much more conducive dynamic and thermodynamic environment for hurricane formation and intensification,\" the department said in an online post.\n\nThe department also described Hurricane Beryl as \"a likely harbinger of a hyperactive season.\" While Beryl made landfall in Texas as a Category 1 storm, it earlier set a record by becoming the earliest Category 5 storm in a calendar year as it tore through the Caribbean and parts of Mexico.\n\nIncluding Beryl and short-lived tropical storms Alberto and Chris, the department's forecast now calls for 25 named storms this season, up from 23 when the first forecast was released in April.\n\nChris made landfall near Veracruz, Mexico, shortly after reaching tropical-storm strength on June 30. Alberto affected parts of Texas, Louisiana and Mexico in mid-June.\n\nThe university department's new forecast includes 12 hurricanes, up from the initial estimate of 11. Also, six hurricanes, instead of the initially forecast five, are projected to reach Category 3 or higher status to qualify as major systems.\n\nExpressing \"above-normal confidence\" in its projections, the department said it continues to anticipate a \"well above-average probability for major hurricane landfalls along the continental United States coastline and in the Caribbean.\"\n\nBut with more than one-sixth of the storm season finished, the projection of a U.S. landfall has dipped slightly, from 62% when the outlook was first released in April to 57%, according to the department.\n\nMost years, the average is 43%.\n\nThe landfall projection for the U.S. coastline that includes parts of Florida south and east of Cedar Key is now at 31%, down from the earlier 34%. Since 1880, the yearly average is 21%.\n\nColorado State isn't alone in predicting a highly active hurricane season.\n\nThe National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration forecast up to 25 named storms, with as many as 13 reaching hurricane strength and four to seven packing Category 3 or stronger winds.\n\nExperts at the University of Pennsylvania's School of Arts & Sciences, meanwhile, forecast an eye-opening 33 named storms.\n\nThe 2023 season was the fourth most-active on record with 20 named storms, including seven that reached hurricane strength and three major storms.\n\nBy

In the updated forecast, meteorologists increased numbers related to all-season activity, including named storms and major hurricanes. In their original forecast, released in April, CSU called for 23 named storms during the 2024 season. Now, the university says they expect a couple more, at 25. So far this season, we've already seen 3 named storms: Tropical Storm Alberto, Hurricane Beryl and Tropical Storm Chris.Hurricane Beryl made history for not only being the first hurricane of the 2024 season but also for breaking records in terms of intensity. Beryl quickly strengthened into a monster Category 5 hurricane, and it happened earlier than any hurricane in history.RELATED: Hurricane Beryl broke records. Climate change is a main contributor, NOAA saysBefore Beryl, the earliest Category 5 hurricane to form was Hurricane Emily, but that wasn't even until July 16, 2005.CSU has now called for at least one additional major hurricane this season. Officials originally forecasted five major hurricanes forming during the 2024 season, but that number is now up to 6.The total number of hurricanes forecasted this season has also increased, going from 11 to 12. Though Florida did not feel many impacts from the busy June month, the trends point to above-normal activity that has the chance to affect the state later this season.Using data from CSU's updated forecast, Florida's chance of seeing a named storm within 50 miles is extremely high, at 95%. On average, this number is usually only 86%.Chances for hurricanes within 50 miles of the state are also up. The chance of any hurricane approaching Florida is at 71%, while the chance of a Category 3 or higher hurricane approaching Florida is at 40%. Both probabilities have jumped to numbers much higher than the average. The National Hurricane Center is currently monitoring a disturbance off Florida's coast. WATCH: Surviving the Season | 2024 Hurricane Special from WESH 2>> Click here to read WESH 2's 2024 hurricane season forecast\n\nOn the heels of record-breaking Hurricane Beryl, Colorado State University has released an updated version of its 2024 hurricane season forecast.\n\nIn the updated forecast, meteorologists increased numbers related to all-season activity, including named storms and major hurricanes.\n\nIn their original forecast, released in April, CSU called for 23 named storms during the 2024 season. Now, the university says they expect a couple more, at 25.\n\nSo far this season, we've already seen 3 named storms: Tropical Storm Alberto, Hurricane Beryl and Tropical Storm Chris.\n\nHurricane Beryl made history for not only being the first hurricane of the 2024 season but also for breaking records in terms of intensity. Beryl quickly strengthened into a monster Category 5 hurricane, and it happened earlier than any hurricane in history.\n\nRELATED: Hurricane Beryl broke records. Climate change is a main contributor, NOAA says\n\nBefore Beryl, the earliest Category 5 hurricane to form was Hurricane Emily, but that wasn't even until July 16, 2005.\n\nCSU has now called for at least one additional major hurricane this season. Officials originally forecasted five major hurricanes forming during the 2024 season, but that number is now up to 6.\n\nThe total number of hurricanes forecasted this season has also increased, going from 11 to 12.\n\nThough Florida did not feel many impacts from the busy June month, the trends point to above-normal activity that has the chance to affect the state later this season.\n\nUsing data from CSU's updated forecast, Florida's chance of seeing a named storm within 50 miles is extremely high, at 95%. On average, this number is usually only 86%.\n\nChances for hurricanes within 50 miles of the state are also up. The chance of any hurricane approaching Florida is at 71%, while the chance of a Category 3 or higher hurricane approaching Florida is at 40%.\n\nBoth probabilities have jumped to numbers much higher than the average.\n\nThe National Hurricane Center is currently monitoring a disturbance off Florida's coast.\n\nWATCH: Surviving the Season | 2024 Hurricane Special from WESH 2", "source": {"uri": "wesh.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "WESH"}, "authors": [{"uri": "averi_kremposky@wesh.com", "name": "Averi Kremposky", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hurricane_Beryl", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hurricane Beryl"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saffir\u2013Simpson_scale", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Saffir\u2013Simpson scale"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorado_State_University", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Colorado State University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tropical_cyclone", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tropical cyclone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tropical_Storm_Alberto_(1994)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tropical Storm Alberto (1994)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Oceanic_and_Atmospheric_Administration", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_change", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Climate change"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tropical_Storm_Chris_(1988)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tropical Storm Chris (1988)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Hurricane_Center", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "National Hurricane Center"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Earth_Sciences", "label": "dmoz/Science/Earth Sciences", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Food/Seasonings", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Food/Seasonings", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Earth_Sciences/Atmospheric_Sciences", "label": "dmoz/Science/Earth Sciences/Atmospheric Sciences", "wgt": 37}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Math/Number_Theory", "label": "dmoz/Science/Math/Number Theory", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Management/Strategy_and_Forecasting", "label": "dmoz/Business/Management/Strategy and Forecasting", "wgt": 14}], "image": "https://kubrick.htvapps.com/htv-prod-media.s3.amazonaws.com/images/florida-impact-668e927ead32e.jpg?crop=1.00xw:1.00xh;0,0&resize=640:*", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9716615", "eventUri": "eng-9716615", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2005-07-16", "textStart": 1011, "textEnd": 1024, "freq": 2}], "sentiment": 0.1058823529411765, "wgt": 182, "relevance": 1}

It has forecasters concerned about what could happen next - KION546", "body": "Typically, early season storms aren't indicative of what's to come later in the season because the necessary atmospheric conditions for powerful storms aren't yet in place. But Beryl broke the mold.\n\n\"Normally, early-season storm activity doesn't tell us much about what is going to happen the rest of the time,\" Phil Klotzbach, a hurricane expert and research scientist at Colorado State University, told CNN. \"But when storms are strong in the tropical Atlantic and eastern Caribbean, it tends to be a harbinger of a very busy season.\"\n\nThe busiest part of Atlantic hurricane season doesn't typically begin until mid-August and peaks in September, but Beryl - which initially formed in late June - behaved like it already arrived. The water Beryl raced through was as warm as it should be in September, so it behaved like a September hurricane.\n\nIt's something forecasters warned could happen even before the season got underway.\n\n\"Beryl confirms what we thought about (this) season, that given the extremely warm (water) temperatures that we currently have, we could experience mid-season-type storms earlier than normal,\" Klotzbach said.\n\nOcean temperatures in the Atlantic basin remain historically warm and have been for more than a year, particularly where Beryl first became a hurricane. Warm oceans are a major consequence of a world warming due to fossil fuel pollution and provide the fuel for tropical systems to explode in strength at a breakneck pace.\n\nBeryl rapidly intensified faster than any other storm on record this early in the season when its winds increased by 65 mph in just 24 hours, according to Klotzbach. Rapid intensification is becoming more likely as the climate crisis advances.\n\n\"Beryl's early and rapid intensification is indicative of the types of extreme weather events we may see more frequently in a warming world,\" according to Mona Hemmati, a postdoctoral research scientist at Columbia University's Climate School. Beryl \"encapsulates many of the fears scientists have for this hurricane season,\" Hemmati told CNN.\n\nThe storm took advantage of extremely warm waters and eventually strengthened into the Atlantic's earliest Category 5 hurricane on record - one of several milestones no other early July hurricane has reached.\n\nForecasters increase hurricane season predictions after Beryl\n\nBeryl's unprecedented performance only solidified a chorus of expert voices - including Klotzbach's team at Colorado State - who called for a hyperactive hurricane season well before the first three named storms - Alberto, Beryl and Chris - formed.\n\n\"This early season activity is a likely warning sign that things are going to be very busy once we move closer to the peak of the season,\" Klotzbach cautioned.\n\nKlotzbach's group of forecasters at Colorado State increased the number of named storms, hurricanes and major hurricanes expected this season in an update to their hurricane season forecast Tuesday. They now predict the Atlantic season will have 25 named storms including 12 hurricanes, half of which will become major hurricanes of at least Category 3 strength.\n\nThe forecast also relies on a burgeoning La Ni\u00f1a that should ease wind shear - the change in wind speed or direction at different heights in the atmosphere - over the Atlantic. High levels of wind shear can tear apart an active storm or prevent one from forming in the first place. Without it, more storms could form and strengthen.\n\nBut extremely warm water will stick around through the peak of hurricane season and storms could take full advantage of it to overcome wind shear, just like Beryl did.\n\nThe extremely warm water kept Beryl incredibly strong, even in the face of disruptive wind shear that should have weakened it considerably. This also happened during last year's hurricane season when El Ni\u00f1o brought increased wind shear but incredibly warm water still helped 20 named storms form.\n\nFor now, a brief pause in Atlantic tropical activity is expected over the next week or two due in part to a large area of dry, dusty air and some bouts of moderately disruptive wind shear.\n\nPlumes of dry air filled with Saharan dust traveling across the Atlantic from Africa are typical around this time of year. It can sometimes even reach the United States and help produce stunning sunsets.\n\nBut dry, dusty air isn't a friend to tropical systems. It cuts off the moisture a system needs to survive, so the National Hurricane Center isn't highlighting any areas to watch for tropical development over the next week.\n\nWhen the break will end and the busiest part of hurricane season will get underway is the \"million dollar question,\" according to Klotzbach. Tropical activity could ramp up again later in July or hold off until August depending on how several atmospheric factors play out in the next couple of weeks, he told CNN.\n\nEither way, with such an extreme ocean heat to tap into, Beryl proved the door is wide open for a prolific season.\n\nCNN's Rachel Ramirez contributed to this report.\n\nThe-CNN-Wire\n\n\u2122 & \u00a9 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

They now expect an additional hurricane (a total of 12 for the season) and two more named storms (a total of 25 for the season).\n\n\"Hurricane Beryl, a deep tropical Category 5 hurricane, is also a likely harbinger of a hyperactive season,\" the updated forecast says.\n\nThere is a bit of short-term good news, however: \"Following Beryl, it does look like the Atlantic season will quiet down temporarily,\" Phil Klotzbach, a hurricane researcher at Colorado State University, told USA TODAY.\n\nGraphics: As Hurricane Beryl tears through the Caribbean, a look at its record-breaking path\n\nThat reprieve is expected to be short-lived, as Klotzbach believes the risk could increase by the end of the month.\n\nOnce the storm season restarts in a couple of weeks, it may come back with a vengeance, forecasters say.\n\nSome experts say Beryl, the earliest Category 5 hurricane on record, is a confirmation of their fears about this hurricane season.\n\nThat was a \"hugely ominous start to the season,\" said chief science officer Steve Bowen of Gallagher Re, a reinsurance firm, on X, formerly Twitter. \"If you were doubtful of the seasonal hyperactive forecasts, this should be a wake-up call.\"\n\nForecasters have predicted a busy hurricane season in the Atlantic Basin this year; one forecast predicted as many as 33 named storms. An average year sees 14.\n\n\"We are likely going to see more extreme record-breaking storms this season as water temperatures continue to be very anomalously warm AND we transition to La Ni\u00f1a, which generally acts to reduce vertical wind shear in the tropical Atlantic and therefore enhance hurricane activity,\" noted University of Miami meteorologist Brian McNoldy on his blog.\n\nPrime Atlantic hurricane season is August, September and October, with the most activity taking place from Aug. 15-Oct. 15.\n\nThere isn't much going on in the tropics at the moment - and it's not uncommon for July to be \"generally quiet\" when it comes to tropical storms and hurricanes, according to Weather.com meteorologist Danielle Banks.\n\nIn fact, the long-term average for July tropical cyclones in the Atlantic is only 1. That's based on data from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) that goes back to 1851.\n\nAnd overall, only about 8% of the Atlantic hurricane season's named storms since 1851 have occurred in July, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Association's Hurricane Research Division.\n\nOne reason for the lull over the next couple of weeks will be the dry, dusty, air that's spreading across the Atlantic Ocean from the Sahara Desert in northern Africa: \"Although the water temperatures are warm enough to support tropical development and further intensification, dry air and dust are suppressors for storm development,\" Banks said.\n\n\"Basically the dust acts like a lid and storms struggle to form,\" she added.\n\nThe plume of dust can reach the mainland United States, also cutting down storm formation in the Gulf of Mexico, according to WTXL-TV meteorologist Casanova Nurse.\n\nThat mass of extremely dry and dusty air known as the Saharan Air Layer forms over the Sahara Desert and moves across the North Atlantic every three to five days from late spring to early fall, peaking in late June to mid-August, according to NOAA.", "source": {"uri":

However, the speed at which Beryl intensified, jumping from tropical-storm strength with winds averaging 70mph to major-hurricane status with 130mph winds in just 24 hours, astounded scientists.\n\n\"Beryl is a storm more typical of the heart of hurricane season than of June, and its rapid intensification and strength have likely been driven by unusually warm waters,\" says Brian Tang, an associate professor of atmospheric science at the University at Albany, State University of New York.\n\nAs the world heats faster due to record fossil fuel emissions, research suggests that there are more unpleasant surprises to come.\n\nIn a narrow band of the mid-Atlantic Ocean where most hurricanes form, sea surface temperatures are anomalously high. In fact, the ocean's heat content - a measure of how much energy is contained in the surface water that hurricanes draw strength from - was close to its average for September on July 1.\n\nWater accumulates heat slowly, so it is alarming to see ocean heat near its usual peak at the start of summer. If the tropical Atlantic is already producing such storms, what might the rest of the hurricane season hold? A bumper season \"If the National Hurricane Centre's early forecast, released May 23, is right, the North Atlantic could see 17 to 25 named storms, eight to 13 hurricanes, and four to seven major hurricanes by the end of November,\" says Jhordanne Jones, a postdoctoral research fellow who studies how climate change affects the scientific effort to predict hurricanes at Purdue University.\n\n\"That's the highest number of named storms in any preseason forecast.\" Seawater hotter than 26 degrees Celsius (79\u00b0F) is the lifeblood of hurricanes. Warm, moist air is another prerequisite. But that's not all these monsters need to reach the limits of their savagery: consistent winds in the upper and lower atmosphere are also necessary to keep cyclonic storms spinning.\n\nA shift from El Ni\u00f1o to La Nina - two opposite phases in a long-term temperature pattern in the Pacific - is expected later this summer. This could tamp down trade winds that might otherwise tear a hurricane's vortex apart. Jones says: \"La Nina may indicate an early start to the season as well as a longer season, as La Nina - along with a warm Atlantic - maintains a hurricane-friendly environment earlier and longer within the year.\" You might expect global heating to bring more hurricanes. But that's not what research has found so far, according to Ben Clarke (University of Oxford) and Friederike Otto (Imperial College London), two scientists who try to attribute the role of climate change in extreme weather events.\n\n\"Warm, moist air and high ocean temperatures are in ample supply in a rapidly warming world. Yet there is no evidence that hurricanes are happening more often, nor do scientists expect this to change with further climate change,\" they say.\n\nInstead, hurricanes that do occur are more likely to be major storms like Beryl. Conditions for breeding hurricanes will be found further north and south of the equator too, since the ocean is heating rapidly everywhere. And Atlantic hurricanes may form outside of the season (June 1 to November 30) that people have come to expect them in.\n\n\"There is also evidence that they are moving more slowly, and are increasingly likely to completely stall near the coast, leading to more flooding as more rain is dumped over one place. This was one reason why Hurricane Harvey, which struck Texas and Louisiana in 2017, was so destructive,\" Clarke and Otto say.\n\nThe trio of deadly hurricanes (Harvey, Irma and Maria) that hammered the Atlantic in quick succession that summer gave people little respite. These \"storm clusters\", as climate adaptation researcher Anitha Karthik (Edinburgh Napier University) calls them, are a growing weather trend that is making hurricane-prone areas increasingly inhospitable.\n\nClimate colonialism \"When Hurricane Maria struck the eastern Caribbean island of Dominica in 2017, it caused the kind of devastation which is unthinkable to larger countries,\" says Emily Wilkinson, an expert in climate resilience at the University of the West Indies.\n\n\"The category 5 hurricane damaged 98 per cent of building roofs and caused USD 1.2 billion (950 million pound) in damage. Dominica effectively lost 226 per cent of its GDP overnight.\" Vowing to become the first climate-resilient nation, Dominica set about rebuilding homes, bridges and other infrastructure. Conserving the forests and reefs that buffer rain, wind and waves was a priority, Wilkinson says. But in trying to build a sustainable future from the wreckage of Maria, Dominica had to contend with its past as a European colony - a fate shared by many small-island states in the Caribbean and elsewhere.\n\n\"Across most Caribbean islands, hazard exposure is about the same, but research shows that poverty and social inequality drastically magnify the severity of disasters,\" say Levi Gahman and Gabrielle Thongs, lecturers in geography, also at the University of the West Indies.\n\nDominica had a plantation economy imposed on it by the British that squandered the island's productive potential and funnelled its wealth overseas, Wilkinson says.\n\n\"Yet Dominica also has the Caribbean's largest remaining indigenous community, and the Kalinago people have farming practices that combine crop diversification with planting methods that help stabilise slopes,\" she adds.\n\nClimate-vulnerable states can draw from advantages such as these to navigate an uncertain future. But the experiences of Caribbean islands show how a supposedly historical process like colonialism still claims lives in the present.\n\nMounting storms will add greater urgency to demands for \"climate reparations\" to the formerly colonised world from rich countries that have contributed most to the climate problem.

On Monday, it made landfall in Texas, United States, as a Category 1 storm, flooding streets and knocking out power for more than two million people in the state.\n\nHurricanes, or tropical storms, form over warm ocean waters near the equator. When the warm, moist air from the ocean surface rises upward, a lower air pressure area is formed below. Air from surrounding areas with higher air pressure rushes into this low pressure area, eventually rising, after it also becomes warm and moist.\n\nAs warm, moist air rises, it cools down, and the water in the air forms clouds and thunderstorms. This whole system of clouds and winds gains strength and momentum using the ocean's heat, and the water that evaporates from its surface. Storm systems with wind speeds of 119 kmph and above are classified as hurricanes.\n\nHurricanes are classified using the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale into five categories (Category 1 to Category 5) based on their sustained wind speeds. While Category 1 hurricanes bring winds of 119 to 153 kmph, Category 5 hurricanes, which are the strongest, have winds of 252 kmph or higher. Storms that reach Category 3 and higher are considered major hurricanes due to their potential to inflict significant damage.\n\nHow did Beryl become a Category storm?\n\nWithin 24 hours of emerging as a tropical depression with winds of 56.3 kmph on June 28, Beryl transformed into a hurricane. Over the next 24 hours, it rapidly intensified to become a Category 4 hurricane. At that point, Beryl was the first Category 4 hurricane to form in June, according to National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). The earliest emergence of a Category 4 hurricane was previously seen in the case of Hurricane Dennis on July 8, 2005.\n\nOn July 1, Beryl made landfall on Grenada's Carriacou Island as a Category 4 hurricane with sustained winds of over 241 kmph. As it travelled through the Caribbean Sea, it continued to gain strength, and became a Category 5 hurricane on July 2. This made it the earliest Category 5 hurricane seen during the Atlantic hurricane season on record. In fact, the Atlantic has only seen one Category 5 hurricane on record in July -- Hurricane Emily, on July 16, 2005.\n\nBeryl was also the strongest July Atlantic hurricane on record, with winds of 265.5 kmph, according to NOAA.\n\nWhy did Beryl become a Category 5 hurricane so early?\n\nThe hurricane season in the Atlantic begins in June and lasts until November. Generally, the first major hurricanes do not form until September. This is because till that time, the ocean is not warm enough either at the surface, or deeper down to fuel such strong hurricanes, according to NOAA.\n\nThis is what makes Beryl so unprecedented. Although it is difficult to attribute a specific hurricane to global warming, scientists see unusually warmer oceans as the primary reason behind Beryl turning into a powerful storm this early in the season.\n\nSince last year, ocean temperatures in the Atlantic -- and across the world -- have mostly been in record-breaking territory. Not only are sea surface temperatures rising, ocean heat content (OHC) -- a measure of the amount of heat present in ocean water -- is also soaring, which is a bigger worry. The graph shows that this year's OHC (in red), for the area of the Atlantic Ocean where most major hurricanes like Beryl form, has been far above the 2013-2023 average (in blue).\n\n\"For storms like Beryl... if it were moving over a part of the ocean where the warm water was skin deep, it would easily churn up cooler water to the surface, [which can reduce its intensity]... But in this case... the warm water is so deep, it's just going to churn up more warm water. The hot water goes down to probably about 100 to 125 meters deep... It is pretty crazy,\" Brian McNoldy, an atmospheric scientist at the University of Miami, told Science News last week.\n\nWhat happens next?\n\nScientists are still debating over how exactly climate change impacts hurricanes. There is agreement, however, that at the very least, climate change makes hurricanes more prone to rapid intensification -- where maximum wind speeds increase very quickly.\n\nThe frequency and magnitude of these rapid intensification events in the Atlantic seems to have spiked between 1971 and 2020, according to a 2023 study published in the journal Nature.\n\nTherefore, as the world and its oceans continue to become warmer, scientists are concerned that even more powerful hurricanes could form in the near future.\n\n\"We're essentially 'stacking the deck' of extreme events against ourselves, making events like Hurricane Beryl not only possible, but more likely,\" Andra Garner, an assistant professor at Rowan University, told the BBC.", "source": {"uri": "indianexpress.com",

Forecasters said that they increased their overall predictions due \"in part\" to Hurricane Beryl, which made landfall in southern Texas Monday morning as a Category 1 storm.\n\nThose predictions are a slight bump from the team's last forecast report, released on June 11, which predicted 23 named storms, 11 hurricanes and five major hurricanes. The National Hurricane Center (NHC) defines a major hurricane as any cyclone that is listed as a Category 3 or higher.\n\nTuesday's report also provided an updated forecast on U.S. sites likely to be struck by a major hurricane this year. The CSU team said that the entire East Coast, including Florida, has a 31 percent chance of being impacted by a major storm. Along the Gulf Coast of the Florida Panhandle west to the city of Brownsville, Texas, forecasters said there is a 38 percent chance of at least one major storm hitting those states.\n\nThe probabilities are a slight decrease from CSU's report in June, where East Coast states were given a 34 percent chance of enduring a Category 3 storm or higher. That same report put the Gulf Coast at a 42 percent chance of facing a major hurricane.\n\n\"Coastal residents are reminded that it only takes one hurricane making landfall to\n\nmake it an active season for them,\" read the report. \"Thorough preparations should be made for every season, regardless of how much activity is predicted.\"\n\nThe Tropical Weather and Climate Research Team said in its report that its predictions are \"based on statistical and dynamical models which will fail in some years.\" Forecasters also noted that predictions are not made about where storms may \"specifically\" hit the U.S. costal region.\n\n\"The probability of landfall for any one location along the coast is very low and\n\nreflects the fact that, in any one season, most U.S. coastal areas will not feel the effects of a hurricane no matter how active the individual season is,\" read the report.\n\nThe National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) has predicted 2024 to be an above-average hurricane season. Agency forecasters predict there will be 17 to 25 named storms, with eight to 13 of those cyclones turning into hurricanes and four to seven becoming major hurricanes.\n\nBeryl was the first hurricane to make landfall in the U.S. this year. The storm began forming on June 28 and reached Category 5 strength as it roared across the Caribbean islands, where at least 11 people died. As of Tuesday, The New York Times reported, the storm has killed at least seven people in Texas and eight in Louisiana.\n\nPower is also out for millions of residents in both states. The violent storm reached wind speeds of up to 80 mph and led to heavy rains, flooding and property damage in Houston and the surrounding areas. The Times reported that several of the storm-related deaths were caused by trees toppled by the wind.\n\nBeryl rapidly became a Category 4 storm after forming southeast of the Caribbean late last month. Hurricane expert Michael Lowry previously told Newsweek that the storm's strength was \"unheard of\" this early in the hurricane season. According to Lowry, \"the typical date of the first major hurricane is September 1, so Beryl is a full two months ahead of schedule.\"", "source": {"uri": "newsweek.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Newsweek"}, "authors": [{"uri": "kaitlin_lewis@newsweek.com", "name": "Kaitlin Lewis", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saffir\u2013Simpson_scale", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Saffir\u2013Simpson scale"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Landfall", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Landfall"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorado_State_University", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Colorado State University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tropical_cyclone", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tropical cyclone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K\u00f6ppen_climate_classification", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "K\u00f6ppen climate classification"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Coast_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "East Coast of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hurricane_Beryl", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hurricane Beryl"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gulf_Coast_of_the_United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gulf Coast of the United States"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlantic_hurricane", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Atlantic hurricane"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Hurricane_Center", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National Hurricane Center"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida_Panhandle", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Florida Panhandle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brownsville,_Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Brownsville, Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Brownsville, Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newsweek", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Newsweek"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Oceanic_and_Atmospheric_Administration", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_York_Times", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The New York Times"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caribbean", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Caribbean"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flood", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Flood"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Houston", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Houston"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Houston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louisiana", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Louisiana"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Louisiana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Earth_Sciences/Atmospheric_Sciences", "label": "dmoz/Science/Earth Sciences/Atmospheric Sciences", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Public_Health_and_Safety/Tropical_Health", "label": "dmoz/Health/Public Health and Safety/Tropical Health", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Environment", "label": "news/Environment", "wgt": 49}], "image": "https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2425071/states-most-likely-get-hit-bymajorhurricane.webp?w=1600&h=900&l=54&t=45&q=88&f=4f30f172c621b57e8f022e4d32efc304", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9716615", "eventUri": "eng-9716615", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-11", "textStart": 562, "textEnd": 569}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-28", "textStart": 2613, "textEnd": 2620}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-09-01", "textStart": 3459, "textEnd": 3470}], "sentiment": 0.1058823529411765, "wgt": 176, "relevance": 1}

When comparing the 2024 hurricane season to the average, this season is way ahead of schedule.\n\nWe've had 3 named systems already - Alberto, Beryl and Chris. We usually don't have three until early August.\n\nAdditionally, our first hurricane and major hurricane occurred in June. That typically happens much later in the season.\n\nThe first named storm usually occurs around June 20. June storms also typically form in the Gulf of Mexico and the Caribbean. For the start of the season, we were on schedule, with Tropical Storm Alberto forming on June 19 over the western Gulf.\n\nThen Beryl formed and rewrote our record books.\n\nBeryl formed out in the Atlantic and became the eastern-most June hurricane. It then rapidly strengthened in a way usually only ever seen in September. The extremely warm Atlantic waters are to thank for this, as usually the waters are not warm enough until September to support the development of a hurricane that strong and that far east.\n\nBeryl became the earliest Category 4 and Category 5 hurricane to form in the Atlantic on record (which dates back to 1851). It was also the strongest June and July hurricane ever recorded.\n\nOn Tuesday, July 9, a respected group of scientists at Colorado State University who give hurricane season predictions, increased their seasonal outlook. They bumped their expected number of named storms from 23 to 25, hurricanes from 11 to 12, and major hurricanes from 5 to 6.

The storm's track brought it onshore early Monday morning along the middle Texas coast and for the most part Louisiana was spared the bulk of torrential rains, high winds, and storm surge. Our neighbors in Texas were not so lucky but in true Texas fashion, they're pulling themselves back up and getting on with the recovery.\n\nHurricane Beryl was the first major hurricane of the 2024 Hurricane Season. What's remarkable about that is that Beryl achieved major hurricane status earlier in the season and faster than any other storm in history. This observation as well as new data from the tropics has prompted a well-known hurricane forecaster to up the ante on the 2024 season.\n\nThe tropical weather forecasters at Colorado State University have earned a solid reputation for predicting tropical weather each year. The school's meteorology department had already issued a preseason forecast for 2024 that was very robust.\n\nThe fact that we are barely a month and a week into the season and there have already been three named storms shows that the outlook for a busy season appears to be on target. Unfortunately, CSU forecasters now say they may have underestimated the 2024 season and have issued a revised forecast.\n\nThe adjusted CSU forecast now calls for one more hurricane and one more major hurricane. That would bring the total number of named storms in 2024 to 25. CSU forecasters now say 12 of those 25 storms will be hurricanes and six of those twelve hurricanes will reach major hurricane status.\n\nThe Colorado State Team based their updated forecast on extremely high sea surface temperatures and the fact that ocean temperatures in the Pacific are now in a La Nina phase. That change in Pacific water temperatures affects wind shear across the Gulf of Mexico, the Caribbean, and the tropical Atlantic.

At the time, these were the highest hurricane numbers ever forecast by the group.\n\nThe high numbers are driven by the switch from El Nino to La Nina that is ongoing in the Pacific, alongside very warm sea surface temperatures in the Atlantic.\n\nENSO-neutral conditions are ongoing in the Pacific with a La Nina watch in effect. The Climate Prediction Center forecasts La Nina to form from July to September and last through the winter.\n\nLa Nina brings more favorable conditions for hurricanes due to reduced wind shear across the Atlantic. Wind shear and warm waters are the main ingredients for hurricanes.\n\nThe effects of the very warm Atlantic have already been seen with Hurricane Beryl, which formed farther east than any storm of its kind on record this time of year.\n\nRapid intensification of tropical systems can be driven by warm sea surface temperatures. Beryl strengthened rapidly from a tropical depression to a Category 4 hurricane within two days before landfall in the Windward Islands, then strengthened further into a Category 5 hurricane at the start of July - the earliest on record.\n\nThis was largely due to the anomalously warm waters in the Main Development Region and the Caribbean Sea.\n\nBeryl has dissipated after making landfall in Texas on Monday morning as a Category 1 hurricane\n\nThere is no development expected in the next 7 days, thanks to a large plume of Saharan dust that is moving across the Atlantic. Typically, the Saharan Air Layer will keep tropical activity to a minimum before tapering off by mid-August as the peak of hurricane season begins.\n\nEvery hurricane season can be bad when a storm hits your area.

Continued near record-warm temperatures in the tropical Atlantic, and the likely emergence of La Ni\u00f1a during the peak of the season.\n\nHurricane Beryl is also to blame in a way.\n\nBeryl was the second named storm of 2024 in the Atlantic, the first 2024 hurricane and the earliest Category 5 hurricane on record in the basin. Beryl made its third and final landfall on Monday on the Texas Coast as a Category 1 hurricane and killed at least 10 people in the U.S. alone.\n\nThe CSU team said Beryl, which also brought destruction in the Caribbean and on Mexico's Yucatan Peninsula, is \"a likely harbinger of a hyperactive season.\"\n\nThere have also been two tropical storms so far this season: Alberto and Chris. Both of those were on the weaker side and made landfall on Mexico's Gulf Coast.\n\nForecasters added that they believe there is a \"well-above-average probability of major hurricane landfalls along the continental United States coastline and in the Caribbean\" during the rest of the season.\n\nHere are the updated forecasts for U.S. landfall probabilities of a major hurricane (Category 3 or stronger storm):\n\n* Entire U.S. coastline: 57 percent\n\n* U.S. East Coast including Florida peninsula: 31 percent\n\n* U.S. Gulf Coast (from Florida Panhandle westward): 38 percent\n\nThe CSU team thinks La Nina will make its presence felt during the peak of the season, which usually falls in September. La Nina tends to decrease wind shear in the tropical Atlantic, making it easier for storms to develop and intensify.\n\nThere also continues to be very warm water in tropical development hot spots across the Atlantic basin, which would only serve to fuel storms as they track westward.\n\nThe researchers also looked at Beryl, which formed much farther east much earlier in the season than what's typical.\n\nThe report said that activity that deep in the tropics this early \"is often associated with hyperactive seasons.\"\n\nThe Atlantic hurricane season began June 1 and ends on Nov. 30.\n\nNOAA issued its Atlantic season outlook in late May and is also expecting an active season:\n\nNOAA forecasters plan to update their forecast in August.", "source": {"uri": "al.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "al"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saffir\u2013Simpson_scale", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Saffir\u2013Simpson scale"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorado_State_University", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Colorado State University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tropical_cyclone", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tropical cyclone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Landfall", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Landfall"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tropical_Atlantic", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tropical Atlantic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/La_Ni\u00f1a", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "La Ni\u00f1a"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caribbean", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Caribbean"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlantic_hurricane", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Atlantic hurricane"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexico", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mexico"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Mexico"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hurricane_Beryl", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hurricane Beryl"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gulf_Coast_of_the_United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gulf Coast of the United States"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contiguous_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Contiguous United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yucat\u00e1n_Peninsula", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlantic_Ocean", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Atlantic Ocean"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tropical_cyclogenesis", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tropical cyclogenesis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida_Panhandle", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Florida Panhandle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Oceanic_and_Atmospheric_Administration", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Coast_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "East Coast of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tropics", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tropics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wind_shear", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wind shear"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Earth_Sciences/Atmospheric_Sciences", "label": "dmoz/Science/Earth Sciences/Atmospheric Sciences", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Public_Health_and_Safety/Tropical_Health", "label": "dmoz/Health/Public Health and Safety/Tropical Health", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://www.al.com/resizer/v2/SK57C2DIQJCTDEFP3ZSS7TLLOI.jpg?auth=defeb34deba7e96465f5549ea19e5228f36a3fe6f9659b8339978cfe8d926375&width=1280&quality=90", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9716615", "eventUri": "eng-9716615", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-11-30", "textStart": 321, "textEnd": 328, "freq": 2}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-01", "textStart": 2549, "textEnd": 2555}], "sentiment": -0.05098039215686279, "wgt": 174, "relevance": 1}

Hurricane Beryl broke records by being the earliest recorded major storm to form in June, causing widespread destruction across the Caribbean. The severity of this storm is attributed to climate change, as it developed faster and earlier in the year than storms of a similar nature. Today, News Five's Britney Gordon sat down with a few climate change experts to learn why this phenomenon is occurring and how climate change impacts the way Caribbean countries must adapt to hurricane preparedness. Here's that story.\n\nEvery day, the livelihoods of millions of people across the Caribbean are threatened by climate change. Whether in the tourism sector, or the fisherfolks out at sea, the loss of flora and fauna due to global warming has an impact on everyone in the region. However, these impacts are becoming more dangerous as the Earth continues to warm. Hurricanes are becoming more intense, droughts more severe, and those with little to no means of survival are much more vulnerable to these threats. Doctor Colin Young, Executive Director of the Caribbean Community Climate Change Center, explains how the climate is affecting the formation of storms.\n\n\"The same way the world is warming up in terms on land from greenhouse gases. These are your carbon dioxide and methane and other gases that trap the heat that the ocean is also absorbing the heat. And the warmer the ocean gets, the more likely it is that when hurricanes form, that they get stronger quicker. And so the intensity. Is the issue that you saw with burial. And why is this scary? It's scary because it gives very little time for people to get ready and for the authorities to warn persons to either move out of the part of the stop of the storm or to do the preparations that that you need.\"\n\nYoung further explains that traditionally, at the start of hurricane season, ocean temperatures reach a peak of around eighty degrees in June, which would not provide enough energy to sustain the formation of a hurricane. However, the past thirteen months have displayed record-breaking temperatures in the Atlantic. At the formation of the season's most recent hurricane, Beryl, ocean temperatures were on average eighty-four degrees; temperatures that are typically witnessed during September and October. With such high temperatures, the turnaround time between storms becoming major hurricanes is becoming shorter, and more difficult to predict. Michael Taylor, Director of Climate Studies at the University of the West Indies', in Jamaica, provides additional insight into this dilemma.\n\n\"What we don't have the greatest of science to do right now is predict the rapid intensification, as you have said, so it's not that we didn't get a warning that there would be a hurricane, but the amount of time to prepare for this severity of the hurricane now is reduced, and that has a significant impact because it means, you know, the preparations you'd have been doing for a tropical storm or a tropical depression suddenly have to become preparations overnight for a major hurricane.\"\n\nTaylor emphasizes the need to adequately prepare for the storms due to this phenomenon. The rapid intensification of storms has occurred in the past, as was witnessed in southern Mexico with Hurricane Otis in 2023. Within twenty-four hours, the tropical storm intensified into a category five hurricane. As was witnessed with Hurricane Beryl, storms are now strengthening to sustain intensity across multiple countries. For poorer communities, this can mean devastation, as they struggle to prepare.\n\n\"The Caribbean is at the frontline of the war on climate change. Our people are suffering the damages and we're paying in lives and livelihoods from these hurricanes.\"\n\nClimate Change is happening now and the most vulnerable are at the forefront of the impacts. At COP27 in 2022, several countries around the world pledged to contribute to the Loss and Damage Fund, which is meant to alleviate the impact of climate change in vulnerable nations, including Small Island Developing States, SIDS. However, that money is yet to be delivered.", "source": {"uri": "edition.channel5belize.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Channel 5"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_change", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Climate change"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caribbean", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Caribbean"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tropical_cyclone", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tropical cyclone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlantic_Ocean", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Atlantic Ocean"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hurricane_Beryl", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hurricane Beryl"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K\u00f6ppen_climate_classification", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "K\u00f6ppen climate classification"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flora", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Flora"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fauna", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fauna"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sea_surface_temperature", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sea surface temperature"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drought", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Drought"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Earth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tourism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tourism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effects_of_climate_change", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Effects of climate change"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saffir\u2013Simpson_scale", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Saffir\u2013Simpson scale"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caribbean_Community", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Caribbean Community"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenhouse_gas", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Greenhouse gas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methane", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Methane"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_dioxide", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Carbon dioxide"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gas", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rapid_intensification", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rapid intensification"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Small_Island_Developing_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Small Island Developing States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_the_West_Indies", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "University of the West Indies"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexico", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mexico"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Mexico"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamaica", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jamaica"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Jamaica"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Earth_Sciences/Atmospheric_Sciences", "label": "dmoz/Science/Earth Sciences/Atmospheric Sciences", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Public_Health_and_Safety/Tropical_Health", "label": "dmoz/Health/Public Health and Safety/Tropical Health", "wgt": 100}], "image": null, "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9716615", "eventUri": "eng-9716615", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.2392156862745098, "wgt": 169, "relevance": 1}

In nearly every category, forecasters are calling for the seasons to be more robust:\n\nAccumulated Cyclone Energy is a sum of tropical storm and hurricane wind duration and intensity, so experts consider it a more accurate depiction of a season's activity than simply the number of storms.\n\nClimate researcher Brian McNoldy with the University of Miami's Rosenstiel School of Marine, Atmospheric, and Earth Science wrote on X that Hurricane Beryl, the earliest Category 5 hurricane on record, contributed mightily to this year's ACE.\n\nBeryl \"has boosted the 2024 tally to an incredible level for so early in the season. The ACE is higher than any other year on record by this date, and is actually already higher than 14% of all entire hurricane seasons going back to 1851!\"\n\nThe Colorado State report also details the probabilities of at least one major hurricane landfall in different regions after July 8.\n\nForecasters said the continental U.S. coastline has a 57% chance of a major hurricane strike. Historically, there's a 43% chance.\n\nAnd the U.S. East Coast, including Florida, has a 31% chance of a major hurricane strike. Historically for the East Coast, there's a 21% chance.\n\nThe Gulf Coast from the Florida Panhandle to the Mexico border has a 38% chance this year. Historically, there's a 27% chance.\n\nColorado State's Philip Klotzbach, who specializes in Atlantic basin hurricane forecasts, wrote on X that one reason for the very active forecast was the \"significant potential for La Ni\u00f1a development. La Ni\u00f1a typically increases Atlantic hurricane activity via decreases in Caribbean/tropical Atlantic vertical wind shear,\" he wrote.\n\nA La Ni\u00f1a is a natural weather phenomenon in which cool water upwellings along the Pacific coast of South America result in global weather patterns, including less wind over the tropical Atlantic.\n\nAnother factor is high sea-surface temperatures. Hot water fuels hurricanes, and the Atlantic has been exceptionally hot this year.\n\nAs of Sunday, average sea-surface temperatures in the tropical Atlantic were actually just below what they were during 2023, which was exceptionally hot. But they're well above the 1991-to-2020 average. Hurricane Beryl may have helped cool this off a tad, and a massive plume of Saharan dust that is currently over the Atlantic can also cool oceans to some extent, according to McNoldy.\n\nKlotzbach went on to write that while there as been a bit of anomalous cooling in parts of the Atlantic, \"most of the North Atlantic remains much warmer than normal, favoring hurricane activity. This anomalous warmth is (the) primary reason why CSU's seasonal hurricane forecast for 2024 is calling for such an active season.\"\n\n\u00a92024 South Florida Sun Sentinel.

But they want to remind people -- it only takes one that affects you to make it an \"active\" season.\n\nHOUSTON -- Just one day after Hurricane Beryl slammed into the Texas coast, researchers at Colorado State released their updated Atlantic Hurricane Season forecast and they're now calling for a more active season than what was in their original forecast.\n\nKeep in mind - regardless of just how busy a hurricane season is, it just takes one to devastate a community. Beryl was evidence of that.\n\nWith the update that came out on Tuesday, Colorado State University increased its number of named storms from 23 to 25. Of those 25, they now call for 12 hurricanes, up from 11. And of those 12 hurricanes, their forecast says six will be major. That's one more than they previously believed would be major hurricanes.\n\nIn their report released on Tuesday, they noted that sea surface temperatures in the main region for hurricane development are near record warmth levels. That provides a better environment for formation and intensification. They also still anticipate a La Ni\u00f1a during the peak of the season, which would bring less vertical wind shear to keep storms from strengthening. Colorado State University researchers said Hurricane Beryl was a sign of a very active season ahead.\n\nYou can read their full report released on Tuesday here.\n\n_______________________________\n\nRELATED: Nacogdoches County issues local disaster declaration after Tropical Storm Beryl causes significant damage\n\nRELATED: 250 hospital beds being set up at NRG Arena in aftermath of Beryl", "source": {"uri": "khou.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "KHOU 11 Houston"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorado_State_University", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Colorado State University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tropical_cyclone", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tropical cyclone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saffir\u2013Simpson_scale", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Saffir\u2013Simpson scale"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hurricane_Beryl", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hurricane Beryl"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlantic_hurricane", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Atlantic hurricane"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlantic_Ocean", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Atlantic Ocean"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tropical_Storm_Beryl_(2012)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tropical Storm Beryl (2012)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disaster_area", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Disaster area"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/La_Ni\u00f1a", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "La Ni\u00f1a"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sea_surface_temperature", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sea surface temperature"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wind_shear", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wind shear"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nacogdoches,_Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nacogdoches, Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Nacogdoches, Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Earth_Sciences", "label": "dmoz/Science/Earth Sciences", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Food/Seasonings", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Food/Seasonings", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Earth_Sciences/Atmospheric_Sciences", "label": "dmoz/Science/Earth Sciences/Atmospheric Sciences", "wgt": 33}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Telecommunications/Call_Centers", "label": "dmoz/Business/Telecommunications/Call Centers", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Management/Strategy_and_Forecasting", "label": "dmoz/Business/Management/Strategy and Forecasting", "wgt": 11}], "image": "https://media.khou.com/assets/KHOU/images/c7d7f411-de17-4fdb-a0a8-4b256e8e7d96/20240710T014337/c7d7f411-de17-4fdb-a0a8-4b256e8e7d96_1140x641.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9716615", "eventUri": "eng-9716615", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.09019607843137245, "wgt": 164, "relevance": 1}

Before that, it had wrought destruction in the Caribbean.\n\nBeryl was the first Category 4 hurricane to be recorded in June since records began in 1851, according to the National Hurricane Centre.\n\nThe storm was the first hurricane of this season and also the earliest Category 5 ever recorded for the Atlantic hurricane season.\n\nAt one point, Beryl strengthened to a Category 5 event with winds of 270 kph (165 mph). It barrelled from the tropical Atlantic Ocean - before razing homes across several Caribbean islands\n\nAt many as seven dead have been reported in Grenada, St. Vincent and the Grenadines and Jamaica. Venezuela saw three deaths. Some reports have put the death toll at as high as 22, with $5bn worth of damage by July 5, said Inside Climate News.\n\nSome researchers have even said global heating led to Beryl's wind and rain being 10-30% more intense.\n\nCaribbean islands, with developing economies, have been hit especially hard, though they had little to do with the fossil fuel burning that had led to the climate crisis.\n\nMore Atlantic hurricanes could be on the way.\n\nThe 2024 Atlantic hurricane season is expected to be highly active, according to projections. The season started on June 1.\n\nIf the National Hurricane Centre's early forecast, issued on May 23, is correct, the North Atlantic could see 17 to 25 named storms, eight to 13 hurricanes and four to seven major hurricanes by the end of November, according to the Conversation.\n\nThat's the highest number of named storms ever in any US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) pre-season forecast.\n\n\"Climate change and, in particular, warming oceans are fuelling ever more powerful hurricanes, in the Atlantic and around the world,\" Michael Mann, a professor at the University of Pennsylvania, told Salon.\n\n\"For each 1\u00b0C of warming (which, he says, is about how much the oceans have warmed) we observe a roughly 12% increase in peak wind speeds, which corresponds to a roughly 40% increase in peak intensity (which is proportional to the third power of the wind's peak),\" he said.\n\nThis increase is \"now readily observable,\" continued Mann. \"I

This comes after Hurricane Beryl devastated parts of the Caribbean, Mexico, and Texas, leaving a trail of death and destruction in its wake.\n\n\"Hurricane Beryl, a deep tropical category 5 hurricane, is also a likely harbinger of a hyperactive season,\" warned the CSU forecast, which was released on Tuesday.\n\nBeryl is not a hurricane anymore as it gradually weakened since it made landfall in Mexico. However, in its devastation, the storm has killed at least 14 people, including at least 3 in the United States. It also caused much damage in Grenada and Jamaica, as well as Mexico's Yucatan Peninsula. Homes have been smashed to ruin, while many parts of Texas are still without power.\n\nCSU meteorologists announced that they expect six major hurricanes, with wind speeds above 111 miles per hour (178 kilometers per hour) in their forecast. They also expect that there will be 12 hurricanes from 25 named storms before the season ends on November 30, according to Reuters. This is more than their previous forecast of at least five major hurricanes out of 11 hurricanes from 23 named storms.\n\nThere are two primary reasons cited by the CSU forecasters, and these include the fact that the seas are hotter than usual. The warmer seas provide more energy that could feed into the creation of tropical cyclones. The other reason is the absence this year of an El Nino weather pattern, which produces strong winds that often break apart hurricanes.\n\n\"While early season storm activity in the western Atlantic typically has little relationship with overall basinwide activity, deep tropical hurricane activity in the tropical Atlantic and eastern Caribbean (such as we saw with Beryl) is often associated with hyperactive seasons,\" noted the CSU forecast.\n\nREAD MORE: Hurricane Beryl Kills 3 in the US, Leaves Jamaica with Food Shortage\n\nHurricane Beryl is only the second named storm in the Atlantic this year and it has already caused many problems, including in Texas which only had its power woes increase, as millions find themselves without electricity in the state.\n\nAccording to Politico, nearly 3 million homes and businesses do not have electricity, while some parts of the state have found themselves flooded, prompting dozens of high-water rescues. State officials have now warned that it could take several days to restore power.\n\nMeanwhile, in the Caribbean, the hurricane has taken a financial toll on some of the countries it devastated, particularly Jamaica and Granada, where much of the destruction happened.\n\n\"There is no doubt this disaster will have a major impact on Grenada's economic situation,\" said Prime Minister Dickon Mitchell during a press briefing, \"We are talking hundreds of millions of dollars in losses and hundreds of millions of dollars to rebuild.\"\n\nMitchell emphasized the need to rebuild structures resistant to storms as the wood houses on the island would be difficult to insure.\n\nREAD MORE: Midwest Flooding Causes Bridge Connecting Iowa to South Dakota to Collapse, Evacuations Triggered\n\nWATCH: Hurricane Beryl hammers Texas coast, knocks out power for millions -

In nearly every category, forecasters are calling for the seasons to be more robust:\n\n-- The number of named storms jumped from 23 to 25. The 1991 to 2020 average is 14.4.\n\n-- Total hurricanes jumped from 11 to 12. The 1991 to 2020 average is 7.2.\n\n-- Major hurricanes increased from five to six. The 1991 to 2020 average is 3.2.\n\n-- Accumulated Cyclone Energy (ACE) increased from 210 to 230. The 1991 to 2020 average is 123.\n\nAccumulated Cyclone Energy is sum of tropical storm and hurricane wind duration and intensity, so experts consider it a more accurate depiction of a season's activity than simply the number of storms.\n\nClimate researcher Brian McNoldy with the University of Miami's Rosenstiel School of Marine, Atmospheric, and Earth Science wrote on X that Hurricane Beryl, the earliest Category 5 hurricane on record, contributed mightily to this year's ACE.\n\nBeryl \"has boosted the 2024 tally to an incredible level for so early in the season. The ACE is higher than any other year on record by this date, and is actually already higher than 14% of all entire hurricane seasons going back to 1851!\"\n\nThe Colorado State report also details the probabilities of at least one major hurricane landfall in different regions after July 8.\n\nForecasters said the continental U.S. coastline has a 57% chance of a major hurricane strike. Historically, there's a 43% chance.\n\nAnd the U.S. east coast, including Florida, has a 31% chance of a major hurricane strike. Historically for the east coast, there's a 21% chance.\n\nThe Gulf Coast from the Florida Panhandle to the Mexico border has a 38% chance this year. Historically, there's a 27% chance.\n\nColorado State's Philip Klotzbach, who specializes in Atlantic basin hurricane forecasts, wrote on X that one reason for the very active forecast was the \"significant potential for La Ni\u00f1a development. La Ni\u00f1a typically increases Atlantic hurricane activity via decreases in Caribbean/tropical Atlantic vertical wind shear,\" he wrote.\n\nA La Ni\u00f1a is a natural weather phenomenon in which cool water upwellings along the Pacific coast of South America result in global weather patterns, including less wind over the tropical Atlantic.\n\nAnother factor is high sea-surface temperatures. Hot water fuels hurricanes, and the Atlantic has been exceptionally hot this year.\n\nAs of July 7, average sea surface temperatures in the tropical Atlantic were actually just below what they were during 2023, which was exceptionally hot. But they're well above the 1991 to 2020 average. Hurricane Beryl may have helped cool this off a tad, and a massive plume of Saharan dust that is currently over the Atlantic can also cool oceans to some extent, according to McNoldy.\n\nKlotzbach went on to write that while there as been a bit of anomalous cooling in parts of the Atlantic, \"most of the North Atlantic remains much warmer than normal, favoring hurricane activity. This anomalous warmth is [the] primary reason why CSU's seasonal hurricane forecast for 2024 is calling for such an active season.\"", "source": {"uri": "orlandosentinel.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Orlando Sentinel"}, "authors": [{"uri": "bill_kearney@orlandosentinel.com", "name": "Bill Kearney", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saffir\u2013Simpson_scale", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Saffir\u2013Simpson scale"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tropical_cyclone", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tropical cyclone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accumulated_cyclone_energy", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Accumulated cyclone energy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorado_State_University", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Colorado State University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Florida", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "South Florida"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hurricane_Beryl", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hurricane Beryl"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Landfall", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Landfall"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tropical_Atlantic", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tropical Atlantic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K\u00f6ppen_climate_classification", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "K\u00f6ppen climate classification"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/La_Ni\u00f1a", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "La Ni\u00f1a"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gulf_Coast_of_the_United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gulf Coast of the United States"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contiguous_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Contiguous United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Coast_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "East Coast of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Miami", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "University of Miami"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Earth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlantic_Ocean", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Atlantic Ocean"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saharan_dust", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Saharan dust"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Upwelling", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Upwelling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sea_surface_temperature", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sea surface temperature"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida_Panhandle", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Florida Panhandle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocean", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ocean"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_Ocean", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pacific Ocean"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_America", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "South America"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caribbean", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Caribbean"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlantic_hurricane", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Atlantic hurricane"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorado", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Colorado"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Colorado"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexico", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mexico"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Mexico"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Earth_Sciences/Atmospheric_Sciences", "label": "dmoz/Science/Earth Sciences/Atmospheric Sciences", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Public_Health_and_Safety/Tropical_Health", "label": "dmoz/Health/Public Health and Safety/Tropical Health", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://www.orlandosentinel.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/TFL-Z-Beryl-Tropical-Weather-Texas_199870060.jpg?w=640", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9716615", "eventUri": "eng-9716615", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-08", "textStart": 1571, "textEnd": 1577}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-07", "textStart": 2661, "textEnd": 2667}], "sentiment": 0.192156862745098, "wgt": 160, "relevance": 1}

They also say the respite may be short-lived.\n\n\"Following Beryl, it does look like the Atlantic season will quiet down temporarily,\" Phil Klotzbach, a hurricane researcher at Colorado State University, told USA TODAY.\n\nKlotzbach's team made national news earlier this year with a seasonal outlook that included the highest number of hurricanes they ever predicted.\n\nSo it's little surprise that Klotzbach sees more storms on the horizon: \"conditions look to become more favorable again by the end of July.\"\n\nOnce the storm season restarts in a couple of weeks, it may come back with a vengeance, forecasters say.\n\nSome experts say Beryl, the earliest Category 5 hurricane on record, is a confirmation of their fears about this hurricane season.\n\nThat was a \"hugely ominous start to the season,\" said chief science officer Steve Bowen of Gallagher Re, a reinsurance firm, on X, formerly Twitter. \"If you were doubtful of the seasonal hyperactive forecasts, this should be a wake-up call.\"\n\nForecasters have predicted a busy hurricane season in the Atlantic Basin this year; one forecast predicted as many as 33 named storms. An average year sees 14.\n\n\"We are likely going to see more extreme record-breaking storms this season as water temperatures continue to be very anomalously warm AND we transition to La Ni\u00f1a, which generally acts to reduce vertical wind shear in the tropical Atlantic and therefore enhance hurricane activity,\" noted University of Miami meteorologist Brian McNoldy on his blog.\n\nPrime Atlantic hurricane season is August, September and October, with the most activity taking place from Aug. 15-Oct. 15.\n\nThere isn't much going on in the tropics at the moment - and it's not uncommon for July to be \"generally quiet\" when it comes to tropical storms and hurricanes, according to Weather.com meteorologist Danielle Banks.\n\nIn fact, the long-term average for July tropical cyclones in the Atlantic is only 1. That's based on data from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) that goes back to 1851.\n\nAnd overall, only about 8% of the Atlantic hurricane season's named storms since 1851 have occurred in July, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Association's Hurricane Research Division.\n\nOne reason for the lull over the next couple of weeks will be the dry, dusty, air that's spreading across the Atlantic Ocean from the Sahara Desert in northern Africa: \"Although the water temperatures are warm enough to support tropical development and further intensification, dry air and dust are suppressors for storm development,\" Banks said.\n\n\"Basically the dust acts like a lid and storms struggle to form,\" she added.\n\nThe plume of dust can reach the mainland United States, also cutting down storm formation in the Gulf of Mexico, according to WTXL-TV meteorologist Casanova Nurse.\n\nThat mass of extremely dry and dusty air known as the Saharan Air Layer forms over the Sahara Desert and moves across the North Atlantic every three to five days from late spring to early fall, peaking in late June to mid-August, according to NOAA.", "source": {"uri":

Those three storms are included in the forecast count.\n\nThe tropics have since quieted down since Hurricane Beryl came ashore, with no tropical activity expected in the next seven days thanks to a widespread Saharan dust layer in the Atlantic. But the Atlantic basin is still primed and ready for a busy season once the dust layers abate later in the season.\n\n\"Sea surface temperatures averaged across the hurricane Main Development Region of the tropical Atlantic and Caribbean remain near record warm levels,\" the CSU team wrote, adding those warm waters are an ample source of fuel for tropical development.\n\nIn addition, El Ni\u00f1o is gone, and the ensuing neutral or budding La Ni\u00f1a pattern that is likely to be in place for the peak of the hurricane season later this summer will reduce wind shear that would also typically inhibit tropical storm development.\n\nEL NI\u00d1O CLIMATE PATTERN OFFICIALLY ENDS AS FLIP TO HURRICANE-FUELING LA NI\u00d1A LOOMS\n\n\"Hurricane Beryl, a deep tropical Category 5 hurricane, is also a likely harbinger of a hyperactive season,\" CSU forecasters wrote. \"This forecast is of above-normal confidence. We anticipate a well above-average probability for major hurricane landfalls along the continental United States coastline and in the Caribbean.\"\n\nCSU forecasters now give a 57% probability that a major hurricane (Category 3 or higher) will strike the U.S. coastline this season. An average season has a 43% chance. More specifically, they give a 31% probability that a major hurricane will strike the Atlantic Coast or Florida Peninsula and a 38% chance of a major hurricane making landfall along the Gulf Coast (including the Florida Panhandle).\n\nThe CSU forecast remains in line with NOAA and 14 other forecasting agencies and computer models in predicting an above-average hurricane season - and in some cases, a well-above-average season.\n\nIf the 25 named storms come to fruition, the National Hurricane Center would exhaust its main list of 22 hurricane names for 2024 and resort to a secondary list of names. An average season has 14 named storms, with seven becoming hurricanes.\n\nHERE'S WHAT HAPPENS IF WE RUN OUT OF HURRICANE NAMES THIS YEAR\n\n\"As with all hurricane seasons, coastal residents are reminded that it only takes one hurricane making landfall to make it an active season,\" CSU forecasters said. \"Thorough preparations should be made every season, regardless of predicted

Beryl, however, rapidly accelerated from a minor storm to a category four event in just two days.\n\nThis deadly intensification was aided by unusually hot ocean temperatures along much of Beryl's path, scientists say, with seawater heated by the climate crisis helping provide the storm with extra energy over the past 10 days.\n\n\"Beryl would be astounding to happen anyway, but for it to form in June is completely unprecedented,\" said Brian McNoldy, a climate scientist at the University of Miami. \"It's just remarkable to see sea temperatures this warm.\n\n\"I don't think anyone would expect an outlier like this to happen, it exceeded expectations. With a climate-change influenced ocean, we are making extreme storms like this more likely to happen.\"\n\nWhile ocean temperatures around the world have been steadily marching upwards as the planet heats due the burning of fossil fuels, the past year has been \"off the charts\", according to McNoldy. Last year was the ocean's hottest on record, with marine heatwaves sweeping 90% of the globe's oceans. This surge in heat has barely paused, with sea surface temperatures records tumbling every single day for 12 months in a row until March.\n\nA slice of the tropical Atlantic stretching from central America to Africa called the main development region is the main spawning area for most hurricanes and this stretch has been \"amazingly warm\" in recent weeks, McNoldy said. In places across the northern Atlantic, temperatures have been as much as 5C (9F) above normal in the past month.\n\nOcean temperatures in the region typically peak in September or October but the extra heat has delivered such conditions unusually early this year. \"In the Caribbean Sea it has actually been warmer than its usual peak since mid-May, which is absolutely crazy,\" said McNoldy. \"If the ocean already looks like it's the peak of hurricane season, we are going to get peak hurricanes.\"\n\nTemperatures across much of the Gulf of Mexico, meanwhile, are \"essentially as warm as bathtub water,\" said Alex DaSilva, lead hurricane expert at AccuWeather. \"Those warm waters are at the surface, and they extend hundreds of feet down. Warm waters act like jet fuel for hurricanes, and it won't take long for temperatures to rebound in the wake of Beryl.\"\n\nThe persistently elevated ocean temperatures portend a potentially disastrous hurricane season, with the National Ocean and Atmospheric Administration forecasting eight to 13 hurricanes until November, up from the usual seven. The onset of the periodic La Nina climate conditions could further propel such storms. \"Beryl is a worrying omen for the rest of the season,\" McNoldy said. \"This won't be the last of these storms.\"\n\nWhile climate change isn't necessarily increasing the overall number of hurricanes, scientists have found evidence that storms are now becoming fiercer, gaining in strength quicker and even moving more slowly. Hurricanes are drawing their power from warmer oceans, while also unleashing more severe bouts of rainfall due to the extra moisture held in the Earth's atmosphere due to global heating.\n\nRising ocean heat poses new threats in terms of damaging hurricanes - some scientists want a new \"category 6\" classification to be added to storms above 192mph - but also to the vast network of life, including humanity, which depends on the marine expanse that covers 70% of the planet.\n\nOceans are soaking up vast quantities of human-created emissions and heat, which is shielding people on land from even worse temperature rises but also warping fish populations, dissolving away coral reefs and shellfish, robbing the seas of oxygen and potentially upending foundational ocean currents.\n\nSuch dramatic changes to the oceans will have an extraordinary legacy beyond individual human lifespans, scientists warn. \"The time scale of the oceans is not as fast as the atmosphere,\" Celeste Saulo, secretary general of the World Meteorological Organization, said earlier this year. \"Once a change is established, I would say it's almost irreversible in time scales that go from centennial to millennial.\"", "source": {"uri": "aol.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hurricane_Beryl", "type": "wiki", "score":

Beryl bulldozed the Caribbean, made its way through Mexico and then plowed into Texas. As of the time of publication, over 2.1 million Texans are without power, just as a severe heat wave descends on the region.\n\nThe increasing severity of hurricanes acutely stresses power grids like those in Texas, which could adversely affect everything from homes to health care facilities. It could cost a city \"billions of dollars to recover from these deadly storms that sent hurricane-force winds through the city's downtown,\" Radley Horton, professor at the Columbia Climate School and climate scientist at Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory, recently said on the Columbia Energy Exchange podcast.\n\n\"These extreme events [are] happening more quickly than we thought.... We don't have the resources to invest at the level we need to in adaptation, and we have a tendency not to protect our most vulnerable populations, even before you bring in the variable of climate change.\"\n\nMeanwhile, the short time it took Beryl to intensify -- from a tropical depression (or cyclone) into a Category 4 hurricane in just 48 hours -- has also caused alarm. Its rapid increase in intensity is most likely linked to climate change. (Back in 2017, media outlets even opined on expanding storm-strength rankings after Hurricane Irma remained at 185 mph for two days.) And the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration predicts this Atlantic hurricane season will be 85% more active than normal.\n\nAs hurricane frequency and intensity grow, so will death tolls and costly destruction. \"Urban development has added impervious surfaces, intensifying runoff with any excessive rainfall,\" Mona Hemmati, a research scientist at Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory, which is part of the Columbia Climate School, posted on X, as Beryl descended on Texas. \"As the climate warms, more intense rainfall is expected, worsening existing flooding issues. There is a real need for infrastructure and urban planning initiatives to address this ongoing issue!\"\n\nOf course, \"normal\" is a nebulous term in these days of accelerated climate change. Amid Beryl's sweeping devastation -- which Grenada's prime minister referred to as \"unimaginable\" -- this storm has rattled scientists studying how quickly climate change may be reshaping our expectations of hurricane season.\n\nHurricanes form when warm waters evaporate from an ocean surface and rise into the cooler air above it. This creates storm clouds and releases heat, as the earth's rotation causes this atmospheric occurrence to spin with increasing momentum as it grows larger.\n\nThis year, the transition from El Ni\u00f1o conditions, a climate phenomenon that raises ocean-surface temperatures, to the more-than-likely presence of La Ni\u00f1a, its cooler counterpart, will also play a part in the Atlantic's hurricane activity this year. Each impacts hurricanes in different ways: Where El Ni\u00f1o tends to stoke hurricanes in the central and eastern Pacific basins, La Ni\u00f1a increases them in the Atlantic.\n\nThe first red flag is how early Beryl developed. According to the National Hurricane Center, the first \"major\" hurricane typically forms in late August or early September. This year, warmer-than-usual oceans have exacerbated hurricane season.\n\n\"When we look at this year, we haven't just had exceptional atmospheric temperatures, the oceans across much of the world...have been exceptionally warm,\" says Horton. \"That gives more fuel for tropical storms, for hurricanes, because you really need a warm ocean in order for those storms to be able to form.\"\n\nThis activity disrupts our ecosystems, too. Just four years ago, after Hurricane Maria ravaged Puerto Rico, Maria Uriarte, a forest ecologist at Columbia, sounded the alarm that biodiversity will also suffer from climate-driven storms.\n\n\"These hurricanes are going to kill more trees. They're going to break more trees. The factors that protected many trees in the past will no longer apply,\" she told State of the Planet. \"Forests will become shorter and smaller, because they won't have time to regrow, and they will be less diverse.\" Images from Grenada alone seem to indicate that Beryl has caused massive environmental damage, alongside wiping out countless buildings and homes.\n\nBeryl has managed to shift the way scientists look at hurricanes. While we can't blame climate change for causing hurricanes, we can link it with their severity.\n\n\"Some feedbacks could be kicking in that lead to more warming at a faster rate than climate models suggest,\" Horton says. \"So it's not that the greenhouse gas concentrations are higher than we thought; it's what if we're going to get more warming for a given amount of greenhouse gas concentrations than we thought we would.\"\n\nBecause, simply put, warm waters power hurricanes. \"The really big takeaway for me,\" Horton says of the increasing occurrence of climate events, \"is that I believe we have underestimated the societal impacts, the damage caused by one-and-a-half degrees [of climate warming]. That is the biggest issue.\"", "source": {"uri": "phys.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "Phys.org"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_change", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Climate change"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tropical_cyclone", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tropical cyclone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Columbia_Climate_School", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Columbia Climate School"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saffir\u2013Simpson_scale", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Saffir\u2013Simpson scale"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lamont\u2013Doherty_Earth_Observatory", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Lamont\u2013Doherty Earth Observatory"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beaufort_scale", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Beaufort scale"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urban_planning", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Urban planning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climatology", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Climatology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrical_grid", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Electrical grid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat_wave", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Heat wave"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Health care"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caribbean", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Caribbean"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlantic_hurricane", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Atlantic hurricane"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Columbia,_South_Carolina", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Columbia, South Carolina"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Columbia, South Carolina"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexico", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mexico"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Mexico"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hurricane_Irma", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hurricane Irma"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth's_rotation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Earth's rotation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/La_Ni\u00f1a", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "La Ni\u00f1a"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaporation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Evaporation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/El_Ni\u00f1o", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "El Ni\u00f1o"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface_runoff", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Surface runoff"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_the_United_Kingdom", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Prime Minister of the United Kingdom"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocean", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ocean"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grenada", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Grenada"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Grenada"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puerto_Rico", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Puerto Rico"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Puerto Rico"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Earth_Sciences/Atmospheric_Sciences", "label": "dmoz/Science/Earth Sciences/Atmospheric Sciences", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Environment", "label": "news/Environment", "wgt": 59}], "image": "https://scx2.b-cdn.net/gfx/news/2024/beryl-sets-off-alarm-b.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9716615", "eventUri": "eng-9716615", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.09019607843137256, "wgt": 148, "relevance": 1}

It can collect important air and sea data from storms and is able to withstand the strongest of them, as seen with Hurricane Beryl, which eventually upgraded to a Category 5, making it the earliest storm to reach that category on record.\n\n\"You have to get pretty lucky to get a hurricane. So that's one advantage of the Saildrones,\" said Greg Foltz, principal investigator for Saildrone research at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. \"We can actually move them and get a lot more data that way, by moving them into the path of hurricanes.\"\n\nThe drone is one of 12 Saildrones to be deployed this hurricane season to collect data for NOAA. Saildrones are 1,000-pound uncrewed surface vehicles (USV) powered by wind and solar energy.\n\nThis Saildrone was expected to deliver hurricane monitoring data for NOAA beginning the first week of August, but it deployed from St. Thomas early to intercept Hurricane Beryl, according to Saildrone Inc. Director of Marketing Jenn Virskus.\n\nFoltz said the idea behind the Saildrone was to try to get unique measurements at the bottom of the hurricane, where it meets the ocean's surface.\n\n\"[It] is very difficult to do and hadn't really been done in the past, except if there happened to be an instrument in the path. So the idea was to put something that could be actively directed into a hurricane's path and then measure continuously as a hurricane went over it,\" Foltz said.\n\nSaildrones can collect a range of hurricane data including wave height, ocean currents and surface air temperature. The data is used directly in hurricane forecasting and advisories. Last hurricane season, it was used in dozens of forecasts and was able to warn people about the heights of waves or rip currents in the ocean, Foltz said.\n\n...continued", "source": {"uri": "arcamax.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ArcaMax"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hurricane_Beryl", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hurricane Beryl"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unmanned_aerial_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Unmanned aerial vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tropical_cyclone", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tropical cyclone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Oceanic_and_Atmospheric_Administration", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puerto_Rico", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Puerto Rico"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Puerto Rico"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knot_(unit)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Knot (unit)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unmanned_surface_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Unmanned surface vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rip_current", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rip current"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocean_current", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ocean current"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_energy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Solar energy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weather_forecasting", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Weather forecasting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temperature", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Temperature"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint_Thomas,_U.S._Virgin_Islands", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Saint Thomas, U.S. Virgin Islands"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Saint Thomas, U.S. Virgin Islands"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States Virgin Islands"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Earth_Sciences/Atmospheric_Sciences", "label": "dmoz/Science/Earth Sciences/Atmospheric Sciences", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Public_Health_and_Safety/Tropical_Health", "label": "dmoz/Health/Public Health and Safety/Tropical Health", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://resources.arcamax.com/newspics/297/29715/2971554.gif", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9716615", "eventUri": "eng-9716615", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1215686274509804, "wgt": 146, "relevance": 1}

Although it had weakened into a Category 1 storm before hitting Houston earlier this week, Beryl still managed to flood highways, topple trees, and leave over 2 million Texans without power.\n\nMeteorologist Matt Lanza of Space City Weather said the storm's endurance also surprised him, hardly losing steam in the hours it spent above land. But there's danger in treating a storm like Beryl as an anomaly, Lanza warned. \"We should absolutely be treating Hurricane Beryl as a trial run for what could come,\" he said.\n\nJust because Houston was hit hard and early in this year's hurricane season doesn't mean the city couldn't get hit again, especially in what is expected to be a historically active hurricane season. For that reason, Lanza said residents should fine-tune their hurricane plans, stocking up on supplies when needed or figuring out evacuation routes in the event of a Category 3 storm or higher. \"I imagine a lot of people will leave at the first sign of another storm,\" Lanza said. \"On the other hand, some people may have seen that wind...and decided it's not that bad and they'll stay put.\"\n\nMuch has been written about this year's dire hurricane forecast. The National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration projected 17 to 25 named storms and seven major hurricanes to form this hurricane season between June 1 and November 30. In an ERCOT hearing earlier this year, Texas A&M climate researcher William Baule warned that experts had never before seen conditions so favorable to hurricanes in the Gulf. At the time, Baule estimated there was a 1 in 2 chance that a hurricane would make landfall in Texas. He also estimated there was a 1 in 6 chance a hurricane Category 3 or higher -- meaning capable of severe, house-flattening damage -- would hit Texas before the season was over.\n\nNow that a hurricane has hit Texas, those odds are not lower, Baule confirmed to Chron Tuesday. Houstonians may be tired, but the Gulf is just getting warmed up. \"If this is going to continue to be the favored track for tropical storms and hurricanes, we could absolutely get hit with another one,\" Lanza added.\n\nOn top of coming up with your own hurricane safety plan, Baule recommended that Houstonians tune into their local news outlets, whether it be cable TV, radio, or online, to get real-time updates on extreme weather events as they unfold. \"Local reporters tend to follow these things more closely than national oulets,\" Baule said. Baule also recommended that residents turn on weather alerts on their smartphones, which can sometimes issue tropical storm warnings days in advance.\n\nBaule also acknowledged that this time, city officials and meteorologists were caught a bit off-guard by the damage that Hurricane Beryl wrought, expecting the storm to graze westward of Houston instead of barreling right into the city. \"The impacts we saw from this were actually worse than what we expected,\" Baule said, \"but at the same time, it was a pretty modest storm.\"\n\n\"If we have another one, there's a fair chance it would be stronger,\" Baule added.\n\n(c)2024 the Houston Chronicle.

Beryl has left a trail of destruction behind it, from the Caribbean islands to the Gulf Coast of the US. It reached speeds of 160mph (257km/h), becoming one of the earliest Category 5 hurricanes in recorded history.\n\nIt was also amplified by climate change.\n\nThe hurricane has so far killed over 20 people and caused damage of at least $5 billion.\n\nIt started as a tropical wave off the coast of West Africa and rapidly intensified into a tropical storm due to favorable conditions -- including warmer sea surface temperatures. Over a few days, Beryl became a hurricane and continued to strengthen, reaching Category 4 status before making landfall in Grenada. From here it intensified even more to a Category 5 hurricane. Hurricanes are categorized from 1 to 5 on a scale based on their sustained wind speeds.\n\nAfter fluctuating between categories, Beryl made multiple landfalls, including in Tulum, Mexico, and finally near Matagorda, Texas, where it weakened to a tropical depression.\n\nBeryl's remarkable intensity and rapid development suggest a potentially dangerous hurricane season is upon us.\n\nScientists have noted that Beryl's extreme winds and heavy precipitation were likely strengthened by climate change, though natural variability also played a role.\n\nHurricanes form over warm ocean waters when moist air rises and creates a low-pressure area at the surface, causing surrounding air to rush in. As this air heats and rises, it cools and condenses, forming clouds and releasing latent heat. This further warms the system and allows it to grow. The Coriolis effect due to Earth's rotation causes the system to spin, and if conditions such as warm sea surface temperatures, low wind shear, and ample moisture persist, the system can intensify into a hurricane with powerful winds.\n\nHurricanes are a very natural phenomenon. However, they can be accentuated by climate heating.\n\nHotter waters can feed hurricanes by providing more energy and moisture to the storm system. As sea surface temperatures rise, the water evaporates more quickly, adding more moisture to the air above. This moist air then rises, condenses, and releases latent heat, which further warms the surrounding air and lowers the pressure at the storm's center.\n\nThis process intensifies the hurricane, leading to stronger winds and heavier rainfall. Warmer waters also allow the storm to maintain its strength over a longer period and potentially reach higher intensities, making the hurricanes more powerful and destructive.\n\nIt's hard to link global, large-scale phenomena like climate change to individual events like a hurricane. But all things being equal, warmer seas mean more powerful hurricanes -- and this is basically what we're seeing now.\n\nAs global temperatures continue to rise due to climate heating, the frequency and intensity of extreme weather events are becoming more pronounced. This is exactly what researchers projected, and it's exactly what's happening now.\n\nThis trend is driven by the accumulation of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. Primarily, these are from human activities such as burning fossil fuels, deforestation, and industrial processes. The increase in atmospheric carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases traps more heat in the Earth's atmosphere. And this heat causes a cascade of effects that disrupt weather patterns and increase the likelihood of extreme events.\n\nBeyond hurricanes, climate heating also encourages other extreme weather phenomena. Heatwaves are becoming more common and severe, leading to record-breaking temperatures and prolonged periods of excessive heat that can have devastating effects on health, agriculture, and infrastructure. This is what's happening in California now, for instance, where an intense heatwave is causing record-breaking temperatures.\n\nWarmer air also holds more moisture, which can result in heavier and more intense rainfall events. This increases the risk of flooding, particularly in areas unaccustomed to such conditions. Conversely, in regions where the atmosphere becomes drier, the risk of wildfires escalates, leading to more frequent and intense fire seasons.\n\nAdditionally, the changing climate is altering weather patterns in ways that make extreme events more likely. The jet stream, a major driver of weather in the northern hemisphere, is being affected by the warming Arctic. As the temperature difference between the Arctic and the equator decreases, the jet stream can become more erratic, leading to prolonged periods of extreme weather, whether it be heat, cold, or storms.\n\nThese shifts are not just theoretical predictions for the future -- they're observable trends unfolding before our very eyes.\n\nOver the past few decades, data has shown a clear increase in the number and severity of extreme weather events globally. Communities around the world are experiencing the impacts of these changes firsthand, from devastating hurricanes and floods to intense droughts and wildfires. The economic costs are substantial, with billions of dollars in damages and significant disruptions to livelihoods and ecosystems.\n\nAs communities rebuild and recover from Beryl's impacts, it's important to also keep in mind the broader lessons from this storm: more of this is coming. We can (and should) invest in local mitigation and resilience, but without tackling the long-term problem of reducing our greenhouse gas emissions, this type of event will only become worse.\n\nCountries must work together to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and implement policies that support sustainable development. International aid and disaster relief efforts are also crucial in supporting affected regions in the aftermath of powerful hurricanes.", "source": {"uri": "zmescience.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ZME Science"}, "authors": [{"uri": "mihai_andrei@zmescience.com", "name": "Mihai Andrei", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saffir\u2013Simpson_scale", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Saffir\u2013Simpson scale"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sea_surface_temperature", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sea surface temperature"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_change", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Climate change"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tropical_cyclone", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tropical cyclone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Landfall", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Landfall"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low-pressure_area", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Low-pressure area"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rapid_intensification", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rapid intensification"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latent_heat", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Latent heat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tulum", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tulum"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extreme_weather", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Extreme weather"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Condensation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Condensation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gulf_Coast_of_the_United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gulf Coast of the United States"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tropical_wave", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tropical wave"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caribbean", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Caribbean"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precipitation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Precipitation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Africa", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "West Africa"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matagorda,_Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Matagorda, Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Matagorda, Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexico", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mexico"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Mexico"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grenada", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Grenada"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Grenada"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coriolis_force", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Coriolis force"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth's_rotation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Earth's rotation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaporation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Evaporation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat_wave", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Heat wave"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fossil_fuel", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fossil fuel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenhouse_gas", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Greenhouse gas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmosphere", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Atmosphere"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Earth_Sciences/Atmospheric_Sciences", "label": "dmoz/Science/Earth Sciences/Atmospheric Sciences", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Environment", "label": "news/Environment", "wgt": 56}], "image": "https://cdn.zmescience.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Hurricane_Beryl_from_the_ISS.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9716615", "eventUri": "eng-9716615", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.09019607843137256, "wgt": 136, "relevance": 1}

Last week, it went inside Hurricane Beryl, while it was a Category 4 storm just south of Puerto Rico.\n\nThe drone intercepted the edge of the hurricane and sustained waves of over 25 feet and wind gusts of 53.48 knots (or about 61 mph), according to Saildrone Inc.\n\nThe device is one of the latest innovations in collecting data from hurricanes. It can collect important air and sea data from storms and is able to withstand the strongest of them, as seen with Hurricane Beryl, which eventually upgraded to a Category 5, making it the earliest storm to reach that category on record.\n\n\"You have to get pretty lucky to get a hurricane. So that's one advantage of the Saildrones,\" said Greg Foltz, principal investigator for Saildrone research at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. \"We can actually move them and get a lot more data that way, by moving them into the path of hurricanes.\"\n\nThe drone is one of 12 Saildrones to be deployed this hurricane season to collect data for NOAA. Saildrones are 1,000-pound uncrewed surface vehicles (USV) powered by wind and solar energy.\n\nThis Saildrone was expected to deliver hurricane monitoring data for NOAA beginning the first week of August, but it deployed from St. Thomas early to intercept Hurricane Beryl, according to Saildrone Inc. Director of Marketing Jenn Virskus.\n\nFoltz said the idea behind the Saildrone was to try to get unique measurements at the bottom of the hurricane, where it meets the ocean's surface.\n\n\"[It] is very difficult to do and hadn't really been done in the past, except if there happened to be an instrument in the path. So the idea was to put something that could be actively directed into a hurricane's path and then measure continuously as a hurricane went over it,\" Foltz said.\n\nSaildrones can collect a range of hurricane data including wave height, ocean currents and surface air temperature. The data is used directly in hurricane forecasting and advisories. Last hurricane season, it was used in dozens of forecasts and was able to warn people about the heights of waves or rip currents in the ocean, Foltz said.\n\nMost abortions performed last year in Florida done after 6 weeks, suggesting impact of new ban\n\nOne of the Saildrones is even a world record holder.\n\nThe 2024 Guinness Book of World Records includes for the first time, the \"highest wind speed recorded by a USV,\" earned during the Saildrone's maiden voyage in 2021, into the 126 mph winds of Category 4 Hurricane Sam.\n\nPerhaps the best-known way scientists collect data inside hurricanes is the hurricane hunters. NOAA and the Air Force collaborate on flights directly into the heart of storms, where researchers on board measure all kinds of data that helps feed the massive global supercomputer models that predict where storms might go next.\n\nThe hurricane hunters flew at least five missions into Beryl to collect and quality check data in storms before sending it to forecasters. Researchers inside the plane drop devices known as \"dropsondes\" into the storm, and these remote devices send important info back to scientists at the National Hurricane Center.\n\nSaildrones, Foltz said, are a complement to those efforts.\n\n\"It's not like we're going to replace anything that's already out there collecting data,\" Foltz said. \"It's like a big coordination effort when there's a hurricane hunter flying into a hurricane and we have a saildrone close by, so that's fun.\"\n\nOther NOAA data-collecting devices include an array of technology that goes in the water or stays in the air. For example, underwater gliders collect water-related data like temperature and salinity levels.\n\nFoltz hopes to keep building on what the drones can do. He thinks there's more to be done with getting data on things like sea spray, air bubbles in the ocean and better heat transfer measurements by adding more sensors to the drones.\n\n\"The main way we envision this helping people in the longer run, is to improve the models and proof of hurricane intensity forecasts for people, give them more time, make them more aware and be able to evacuate and prepare,\" Foltz said", "source": {"uri": "orlandosentinel.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Orlando Sentinel"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hurricane_Beryl", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hurricane Beryl"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Oceanic_and_Atmospheric_Administration", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unmanned_aerial_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Unmanned aerial vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tropical_cyclone", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tropical cyclone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unmanned_surface_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Unmanned surface vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knot_(unit)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Knot (unit)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puerto_Rico", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Puerto Rico"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Puerto Rico"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hurricane_hunters", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hurricane hunters"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocean_current", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ocean current"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_energy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Solar energy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guinness_World_Records", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Guinness World Records"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weather_forecasting", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Weather forecasting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temperature", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Temperature"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint_Thomas,_U.S._Virgin_Islands", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Saint Thomas, U.S. Virgin Islands"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Saint Thomas, U.S. Virgin Islands"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States Virgin Islands"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hurricane_Sam", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hurricane Sam"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dropsonde", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dropsonde"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Underwater_glider", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Underwater glider"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sea_spray", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sea spray"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rip_current", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rip current"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wind_speed", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wind speed"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supercomputer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Supercomputer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Air_Force", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Air Force"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Earth_Sciences/Atmospheric_Sciences", "label": "dmoz/Science/Earth Sciences/Atmospheric Sciences", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Science", "label": "news/Science", "wgt": 50}], "image": "https://www.orlandosentinel.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/20240709-AMX-US-NEWS-THIS-DRONE-CAPTURED-SCENES-INSIDE-1-MI.jpg?w=640", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9716615", "eventUri": "eng-9716615", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1215686274509804, "wgt": 133, "relevance": 1}

Beryl, however, rapidly accelerated from a minor storm to a category 4 event in just two days.\n\nThis deadly intensification was aided by unusually hot ocean temperatures along much of Beryl's path, scientists say, with seawater heated by the climate crisis helping provide the storm with extra energy over the past 10 days.\n\n\"Beryl would be astounding to happen anyway, but for it to form in June is completely unprecedented,\" said Brian McNoldy, a climate scientist at the University of Miami. \"It's just remarkable to see sea temperatures this warm.\n\n\"I don't think anyone would expect an outlier like this to happen, it exceeded expectations. With a climate-change influenced ocean, we are making extreme storms like this more likely to happen.\"\n\nWhile ocean temperatures around the world have been steadily marching upwards as the planet heats due the burning of fossil fuels, the past year has been \"off the charts\", according to McNoldy. Last year was the ocean's hottest on record, with marine heatwaves sweeping 90% of the globe's oceans. This surge in heat has barely paused, with sea surface temperatures records tumbling every single day for 12 months in a row until March.\n\nA slice of the tropical Atlantic stretching from Central America to Africa called the main development region is the main spawning area for most hurricanes and this stretch has been \"amazingly warm\" in recent weeks, McNoldy said. In places across the northern Atlantic, temperatures have been as much as 5C (9F) above normal in the past month.\n\nOcean temperatures in the region typically peak in September or October but the extra heat has delivered such conditions unusually early this year. \"In the Caribbean Sea it has actually been warmer than its usual peak since mid-May, which is absolutely crazy,\" said McNoldy. \"If the ocean already looks like it's the peak of hurricane season, we are going to get peak hurricanes.\"\n\nTemperatures across much of the Gulf of Mexico, meanwhile, are \"essentially as warm as bathtub water\", said Alex DaSilva, lead hurricane expert at AccuWeather. \"Those warm waters are at the surface, and they extend hundreds of feet down. Warm waters act like jet fuel for hurricanes, and it won't take long for temperatures to rebound in the wake of Beryl.\"\n\nThe persistently elevated ocean temperatures portend a potentially disastrous hurricane season, with the National Ocean and Atmospheric Administration forecasting eight to 13 hurricanes until November, up from the usual seven. The onset of the periodic La Ni\u00f1a climate conditions could further propel such storms. \"Beryl is a worrying omen for the rest of the season,\" McNoldy said. \"This won't be the last of these storms.\"\n\nWhile climate change isn't necessarily increasing the overall number of hurricanes, scientists have found evidence that storms are now becoming fiercer, gaining in strength quicker and even moving more slowly. Hurricanes are drawing their power from warmer oceans, while also unleashing more severe bouts of rainfall due to the extra moisture held in the Earth's atmosphere due to global heating.\n\nRising ocean heat poses new threats in terms of damaging hurricanes - some scientists have called for a new \"category 6\" classification to be added to storms above 192mph - but also to the vast network of life, including humanity, which depends on the marine expanse that covers 70% of the planet.\n\nOceans are soaking up vast quantities of human-created emissions and heat, which is shielding people on land from even worse temperature rises but also warping fish populations, dissolving away coral reefs and shellfish, robbing the seas of oxygen, and potentially upending foundational ocean currents.\n\nSuch dramatic changes to the oceans will have an extraordinary legacy beyond individual human lifespans, scientists warn. \"The time scale of the oceans is not as fast as the atmosphere,\" Celeste Saulo, secretary general of the World Meteorological Organization, said earlier this year. \"Once a change is established, I would say it's almost irreversible in time scales that go from centennial to millennial.\"", "source": {"uri": "inkl.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "inkl"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saffir\u2013Simpson_scale", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Saffir\u2013Simpson scale"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sea_surface_temperature", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sea surface temperature"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_change", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Climate change"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tropical_cyclone", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tropical cyclone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hurricane_Beryl", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hurricane Beryl"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climatology", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Climatology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocean", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ocean"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fossil_fuel", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fossil fuel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seawater", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Seawater"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Miami", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "University of Miami"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlantic_hurricane", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Atlantic hurricane"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlantic_Ocean", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Atlantic Ocean"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marine_heatwave", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Marine heatwave"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AccuWeather", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "AccuWeather"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caribbean_Sea", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Caribbean Sea"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gulf_of_Mexico", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gulf of Mexico"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Africa", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Africa"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_America", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Central America"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tropics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tropics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post-glacial_rebound", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Post-glacial rebound"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coral_reef", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Coral reef"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tropical_cyclone_scales", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tropical cyclone scales"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocean_current", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ocean current"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Meteorological_Organization", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "World Meteorological Organization"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Earth_Sciences", "label": "dmoz/Science/Earth Sciences", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Earth_Sciences/Atmospheric_Sciences", "label": "dmoz/Science/Earth Sciences/Atmospheric Sciences", "wgt": 33}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Earth_Sciences/Oceanography", "label": "dmoz/Science/Earth Sciences/Oceanography", "wgt": 25}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Climate_Change", "label": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Climate Change", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Earth_Sciences/Paleogeography_and_Paleoclimatology", "label": "dmoz/Science/Earth Sciences/Paleogeography and Paleoclimatology", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "news/Environment", "label": "news/Environment", "wgt": 75}], "image": "https://images.inkl.com/s3/article/lead_image/20741512/1000.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9716615", "eventUri": "eng-9716615", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1607843137254903, "wgt": 128, "relevance": 1}

Maura Healy declared this week \"Hurricane Preparedness Week,\" urging all residents to prepare for what meteorologist are saying will be an active season.\n\n\"Near-record warm ocean temperatures are expected to fuel more frequent and intense tropical storms, meaning there may be increased likelihood for us in Massachusetts to experience a hurricane,\" Healey said.\n\nOld times may remember some of the storms that have hit the state like Hurricane Bob, Hurricane Gloria, and others, but what are the worst ones to ever hit the state? And which ones did the most damage?\n\nFirst, for reference, you've probably heard hurricanes be referred to by categories, a metric for ranking how strong hurricanes are. According to the National Weather Service, here's how they work:\n\nThe last hurricane to make landfall in Massachusetts, Hurricane Bob started as a depression near the Bahamas and intensified to a Tropical Storm Bob late on Aug, 16 1991.\n\nWhen it hit Massachusetts, it caused more than $1 billion in damages. NOAA stated the center of the hurricane was moving between Boston and Scituate. The storm killed more than a dozen people, and knocked out power to 60% of southeastern Massachusetts.\n\nWind gusts of 125 mph could be felt in some Cape Cod towns.\n\nHurricane Season: How can you prepare for the 'active' hurricane season ahead? Here's what to know.\n\nThis hurricane is still referred to as \"The Big One,\" with NOAA saying it \"ranks as one of the most costly and deadly hurricanes in United States history.\"\n\nThe waves from the storm peaked in Gloucester at 50 feet, according to historical records, and the hurricane sustained winds at about 120 mph, with the maximum recorded wind gust recorded at at Blue Hill Observatory in Canton was 186 miles per hour.\n\nSections of Falmouth and New Bedford, Massachusetts were submerged under as much as eight feet of water, and rain brought severe flooding along the rivers, according to NOAA.\n\nThe storm caused 700 deaths, made about 63,000 people homeless, and cost $620 million in 1938 dollars. It knocked out 20,000 miles worth of power and telephone lines. Approximately 3,300 boats were destroyed during the storm.\n\nWell before living memory, this hurricane is often considered the most intense to hit New England since European colonization, killing at least 46 people when it struck Narragansett Bay on Aug. 25, 1635, NOAA stated.\n\nThe storm was devastating throughout southern New England.\n\n\"Buildings in Plymouth and Bourne blew down and flooded,\" The New England Historical Society wrote. \"The storm damaged Boston less than Providence, but downed trees throughout the colony.\"\n\nWhile accounts are limited, it's estimated that 46 people died in the storm.", "source": {"uri": "eu.enterprisenews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Enterprise"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Warmer ocean temperatures make strong storms possible.\n\nHurricane Dorian damaged the Bahamas in 2019, showing how warmer seas support strong storms. Warming is also happening in places that have been cooler in the past, like the northern Atlantic Ocean.\n\nThis creates new risks for people living in the Atlantic hurricane area. According to the latest data, the world's oceans are hotter than ever, making storms more potent.\n\nA hurricane starts as a group of storms over the ocean. Across the eastern Atlantic, a jet stream going west is known as the African Easterly Jet. It begins off the west coast of Africa and moves across the ocean.\n\nAs these winds blow over the ocean, they drain water and send it into the air, where it cools, condenses, and forms storm clouds. About 85% of the major storms in the Atlantic start off the coast of Africa.\n\nThese storms can become tropical depressions if they hit enough warm water and west-to-east winds. The Coriolis effect, which describes how things move across the Earth's surface as it spins, makes storms in the Northern Hemisphere spin counterclockwise.\n\nThe heat of the ocean surface and the depth of warm water are significant factors in determining the strength of a storm. When a tropical depression is over warm water, it soaks up more warm water vapor, making the system stronger and the low-pressure center smaller.\n\nThis is what makes a tropical storm happen. As the storm keeps picking up water vapor, it sets off a feedback loop that allows a hurricane's eye to form if the low-pressure center stays put.\n\nREAD ALSO: Hurricane Beryl Illustrates How Global Warming Could Intensify Storms, UN Weather and Climate Agency Warns\n\nScientists perform an \"attribution analysis\" to determine how a certain storm is related to climate change. They can figure out how a storm would have behaved in different climate conditions by simulating what the climate might have been like if temperatures hadn't been higher.\n\nIt was found that climate change made the oceans warmer and the storms rainier during the 2020 season. About 7% more water vapor can be held in the atmosphere for every degree the temperature rises.\n\nIn addition, storms are getting much stronger quickly because the oceans are warmer. This can happen in less than a day, making it harder for meteorologists to predict how storms will behave and send quick warnings.\n\nRecently, Hurricane Beryl hit Texas after bringing chaos to the Caribbean. Hot water temperatures helped Beryl go from a minor storm to a Category 5 hurricane quickly in just two days. It's happening more often that storm seasons get more robust, making them more dangerous and hard to plan.\n\nConsistently high ocean temperatures point to a storm season that could be very bad. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration says that there will be more storms than usual this year.\n\nClimate change may not be making more storms, but it is making them stronger, moving faster, and moving slower. This trend makes it clear that we must move immediately to stop and lessen the bad weather caused by global warming.", "source": {"uri": "sciencetimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Science Times"}, "authors": [{"uri": "austin_jay@sciencetimes.com", "name": "Austin Jay", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlantic_Ocean", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Atlantic Ocean"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tropical_cyclone", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tropical cyclone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Africa", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Africa"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_change", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Climate change"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_easterly_jet", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "African easterly jet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hurricane_Dorian", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hurricane Dorian"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_vapor", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Water vapor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jet_stream", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jet stream"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sea_surface_temperature", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sea surface temperature"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low-pressure_area", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Low-pressure area"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocean", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ocean"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlantic_hurricane", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Atlantic hurricane"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Bahamas", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Bahamas"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "The Bahamas"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hurricane_Beryl", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hurricane Beryl"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coriolis_force", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Coriolis force"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Condensation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Condensation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Hemisphere", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Northern Hemisphere"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Earth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meteorologist", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Meteorologist"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saffir\u2013Simpson_scale", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Saffir\u2013Simpson scale"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K\u00f6ppen_climate_classification", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "K\u00f6ppen climate classification"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Oceanic_and_Atmospheric_Administration", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United Nations"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caribbean", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Caribbean"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Earth_Sciences/Atmospheric_Sciences", "label": "dmoz/Science/Earth Sciences/Atmospheric Sciences", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 50}], "image": "https://1721181113.rsc.cdn77.org/data/thumbs/full/54806/820/0/0/0/warm-ocean-water-fuels-stronger-hurricanes-as-climate-change-intensifies-storms.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9716615", "eventUri": "eng-9716615", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1137254901960785, "wgt": 121, "relevance": 1}

The data helps forecasts", "body": "Within the 25-foot waves and violent winds of the disastrous Hurricane Beryl, one 23-foot long neon orange sailboat-like device stood out against dark ocean water with a front-row seat to the eye of the storm. The object in question wasn't a boat that got too close to the storm, but an uncrewed hurricane drone called the Saildrone Explorer.\n\nUnlike boats or planes with people in it, the Saildrone Explorer can hold its own on the sea surface in the eye of a hurricane -- and send back pictures and data to help scientists forecast storms. Last week, it went inside Hurricane Beryl, while it was a Category 4 storm just south of Puerto Rico.\n\nThe drone intercepted the edge of the hurricane and sustained waves of over 25 feet and wind gusts of 53.48 knots (or about 61 mph), according to Saildrone Inc.\n\nThe device is one of the latest innovations in collecting data from hurricanes. It can collect important air and sea data from storms and is able to withstand the strongest of them, as seen with Hurricane Beryl, which eventually upgraded to a Category 5, making it the earliest storm to reach that category on record.\n\n\"You have to get pretty lucky to get a hurricane. So that's one advantage of the Saildrones,\" said Greg Foltz, principal investigator for Saildrone research at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. \"We can actually move them and get a lot more data that way, by moving them into the path of hurricanes.\"\n\nThe drone is one of 12 Saildrones to be deployed this hurricane season to collect data for NOAA. Saildrones are 1,000-pound uncrewed surface vehicles (USV) powered by wind and solar energy.\n\nThis Saildrone was expected to deliver hurricane monitoring data for NOAA beginning the first week of August, but it deployed from St. Thomas early to intercept Hurricane Beryl, according to Saildrone Inc. Director of Marketing Jenn Virskus.\n\nFoltz said the idea behind the Saildrone was to try to get unique measurements at the bottom of the hurricane, where it meets the ocean's surface.\n\n\"[It] is very difficult to do and hadn't really been done in the past, except if there happened to be an instrument in the path. So the idea was to put something that could be actively directed into a hurricane's path and then measure continuously as a hurricane went over it,\" Foltz said.\n\nSaildrones can collect a range of hurricane data including wave height, ocean currents and surface air temperature. The data is used directly in hurricane forecasting and advisories. Last hurricane season, it was used in dozens of forecasts and was able to warn people about the heights of waves or rip currents in the ocean, Foltz said.\n\nOne of the Saildrones is even a world record holder.\n\nThe 2024 Guinness Book of World Records includes for the first time, the \"highest wind speed recorded by a USV,\" earned during the Saildrone's maiden voyage in 2021, into the 126 mph winds of Category 4 Hurricane Sam.\n\nOther hurricane-tracking devices\n\nPerhaps the best-known way scientists collect data inside hurricanes is the hurricane hunters. NOAA and the Air Force collaborate on flights directly into the heart of storms, where researchers on board measure all kinds of data that helps feed the massive global supercomputer models that predict where storms might go next.\n\nThe hurricane hunters flew at least five missions into Beryl to collect and quality check data in storms before sending it to forecasters. Researchers inside the plane drop devices known as \"dropsondes\" into the storm, and these remote devices send important info back to scientists at the National Hurricane Center.\n\nREAD MORE: How drones by air and sea help Florida forecasts. 'We can steer these into hurricanes'\n\nSaildrones, Foltz said, are a complement to those efforts.\n\n\"It's not like we're going to replace anything that's already out there collecting data,\" Foltz said. \"It's like a big coordination effort when there's a hurricane hunter flying into a hurricane and we have a saildrone close by, so that's fun.\"\n\nOther NOAA data-collecting devices include an array of technology that goes in the water or stays in the air. For example, underwater gliders collect water-related data like temperature and salinity levels.\n\nThe future of the Saildrone\n\nFoltz hopes to keep building on what the drones can do. He thinks there's more to be done with getting data on things like sea spray, air bubbles in the ocean and better heat transfer measurements by adding more sensors to the drones.\n\n\"The main way we envision this helping people in the longer run, is to improve the models and proof of hurricane intensity forecasts for people, give them more time, make them more aware and be able to evacuate and prepare,\" Foltz said", "source": {"uri": "bradenton.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Bradenton Herald"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hurricane_Beryl", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hurricane Beryl"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Oceanic_and_Atmospheric_Administration", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unmanned_aerial_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Unmanned aerial vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tropical_cyclone", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tropical cyclone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unmanned_surface_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Unmanned surface vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knot_(unit)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Knot (unit)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puerto_Rico", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Puerto Rico"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Puerto Rico"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hurricane_hunters", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hurricane hunters"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocean_current", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ocean current"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_energy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Solar energy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guinness_World_Records", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Guinness World Records"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weather_forecasting", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Weather forecasting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temperature", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Temperature"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint_Thomas,_U.S._Virgin_Islands", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Saint Thomas, U.S. Virgin Islands"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Saint Thomas, U.S. Virgin Islands"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States Virgin Islands"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hurricane_Sam", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hurricane Sam"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dropsonde", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dropsonde"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Underwater_glider", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Underwater glider"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sea_spray", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sea spray"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rip_current", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rip current"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wind_speed", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wind speed"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supercomputer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Supercomputer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Air_Force", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Air Force"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Earth_Sciences", "label": "dmoz/Science/Earth Sciences", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Earth_Sciences/Atmospheric_Sciences", "label": "dmoz/Science/Earth Sciences/Atmospheric Sciences", "wgt": 41}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Earth_Sciences/Oceanography", "label": "dmoz/Science/Earth Sciences/Oceanography", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Earth_Sciences/Data_Centers", "label": "dmoz/Science/Earth Sciences/Data Centers", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Data_Administration", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Data Administration", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "news/Science", "label": "news/Science", "wgt": 49}], "image": "https://www.miamiherald.com/latest-news/mhny8w/picture289855449/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1140/20230609-Hurricane%20STVI%20Deploy-1041%20Tow.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9716615", "eventUri": "eng-9716615", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.05882352941176472, "wgt": 121, "relevance": 1}

Additionally, some 2.7 million Texas homes lacked power.\n\nHoustonians know hurricanes. They endured the horrors of Ike and Harvey in 2008 and 2017, and they will rebuild from Beryl. Damaged homes will be restored. Smashed vehicles will be replaced. As the storm recedes, life will return to normal for many in the storm's wake.\n\nBut included in that \"normal\" must be an acceptance of how climate change fuels extreme weather, as well as an expectation that Texas' elected officials and industry leaders will drop their indifference (at the very least) and hostility (at best) to the realities of climate change.\n\nPart of that reality is the likelihood of stronger hurricanes. Already this year, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration predicted \"a very high likelihood (85% chance) of an above-normal Atlantic hurricane season.\"\n\nWhile Beryl was not an exceptional hurricane in terms of strength - it was a Category 4 storm in the Caribbean and a Category 1 storm when it hit Texas - it was unusual because it arrived so early. As National Public Radio reported, \"Most storms in June and July don't end up becoming major hurricanes. As the ocean slowly warms up over the course of the summer, bigger hurricanes become more likely.\"\n\nBut the Atlantic is already super warm, so here we are with a surprisingly early start to hurricane season.\n\nClimate change also has the potential to make these storms stronger. Warm oceans, coupled with sea level rise, are essential ingredients for more powerful hurricanes and greater storm surge.\n\nThis isn't a predicted future.\n\nThe hypocrisy from Texas officials about the risks climate change poses is astounding, but not surprising.\n\nLt. Gov. Dan Patrick - filling in for Gov. Greg Abbott, who bizarrely chose to stick with a planned trip to Asia during this calamity - has spoken with President Joe Biden about federal disaster assistance. But when it comes to the politics of climate change, Patrick and Abbott are always on the wrong side of science and history.\n\nFor example, in a 2023 statement dubbed \"Keeping Texas, Texas,\" Patrick said of the oil and gas industry, \"the left wants to destroy this industry in the name of climate change. That would destroy Texas and America.\"\n\nSince carbon dioxide and methane are key contributors to climate change, and since climate change is a key contributor to extreme weather, just what really could \"destroy\" Texas?\n\nWe've also seen Abbott falsely blame renewable energy sources for the widespread power outages during Winter Storm Uri in 2021, and state officials have targeted banks that take a stand on climate change. State lawmakers also have excluded renewable energy sources - wind and solar - from its new Chapter 313 tax incentives program.\n\nConnecting climate change to daily life can, at times, be difficult. One weather event - a hurricane that arrives unseasonably early - does not necessarily reflect a warming world.

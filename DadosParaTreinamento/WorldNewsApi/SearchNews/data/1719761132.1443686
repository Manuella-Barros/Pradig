Fiona Beal, 50, faces a life sentence after pleading guilty to murdering Nick Billingham, 42, whose mummified remains were found four-and-a-half months after he was last seen in November 2021. Beal, a \u2018highly capable and respected\u2019 Year 6 teacher, told friends they had both tested positive for Covid so she wouldn\u2019t be disturbed while clearing the blood away and building a makeshift grave. Detectives who traced her to a cabin in Cumbria in March 2022 found a journal in which she detailed her plan to lure Mr Billingham into the bath before killing him. She wrote: \u2018I had smoked all day. I had a bath, I left the water in. He had been pushing for sex. I encouraged the bath with the incentive of sex afterwards. \u2018While he was in the bath I kept the knife in my dressing gown pocket and then I had it in the drawer next to the bed. \u2018I brought a chisel, bin bag and cable ties up too. I got him to wear an eye mask.\u2019 She went on: \u2018My last words to him when he asked why was that he was not going to do to (another female) what he had done to me.\u2019 Fiona Beal\u2019s journal entry setting out the murder (Picture: Central News/Northants Police) Fiona Beal faces a life sentence (Picture: Northamptonshire Police/PA Wire) Beal appeared at the Old Bailey on Wednesday for the start of her two-day sentencing by Judge Mark Lucraft KC. During the hearing, prosecutor Hugh Davies KC read out a letter Mr Bellingham had written to Beal after he had an affair during their 17-year relationship. In the letter, Mr Billingham accepted his faults and described Beal as \u2018kind hearted\u2019, \u2018generous\u2019 and \u2018the most beautiful woman in the world\u2019. He wrote: \u2018I promise to never again belittle you or make you feel rubbish again. \u2018My body, my heart, my love has been yours since the day I met you and will be until the day I die. I love you with all my heart.\u2019 Beal pleaded guilty mid-trial at the Old Bailey to the murder of boyfriend Nicholas Billingham (Picture: Northamptonshire Police/PA Wire) The court heard a victim impact statement written by Mr Billingham\u2019s mum Yvonne Valentine in which she described visiting Beal for a Christmas drink while he was still presumed missing. She said: \u2018I remember that the house looked different; the furniture moved, new furniture and ornaments in the front room, which made it look nice. \u2018But all of this was you covering up that you had killed my son! You moved the furniture to obscure views to the garden \u2013 why?? To stop anyone seeing where you had buried my son! \u2018You sat in your front room with me, having a casual chat with me, having a Christmas drink with me and the whole time, you knew that you had killed my son and buried him only feet from where I was sat.\u2019 On the day of his death weeks earlier, Mr Billingham had worked on a house renovation before returning to the home he shared with Beal in Northampton. That evening, she killed him in a \u2018carefully planned domestic execution\u2019, Mr Davies said. Beal stabbed him in the neck and disposed of the body in the side return of their home like \u2018building waste\u2019, he added. She covered her tracks with a false story that they had Covid and needed to isolate. Similar messages were sent from Mr Billingham\u2019s phone from November 2 in which Beal pretended to be him.

When she went back to work, Beal received sympathy from those who had heard about the apparent break-up. But the court heard her mental health started to deteriorate in late February 2022. In a journal entry dated February 12, she wrote: \u2018I\u2019m not a total monster. I know what I did.\u2019 She also listed \u2018memories, messages, confession, final farewell\u2019, Mr Davies said. By February 28, Beal had been signed off work with anxiety, stress, depression and low mood, the court heard.

In the cabin, police found Beal\u2019s journals containing a confession to the killing. The journals triggered a police investigation, which soon established that Mr Billingham had not been seen or spoken to by telephone since the afternoon of November 1, 2021, the court heard. Beal was arrested in March 2022 after police discovered his body.

He said she \u2018accepted sympathy\u2019 which resulted from her \u2018false narrative\u2019 and \u2018took elaborate and sustained steps over a period of weeks to conceal her crime\u2019. They included disposing of his body \u2018as if it was building waste in her garden\u2019, posing as him in communications with his friends, colleagues and family, and even manufactured arguments between him and her. All this was done while she continued \u2018to deliver high-quality teaching to Year 6 pupils as if nothing had happened\u2019, Mr Davies said. Beal even \u2018actively lied\u2019 to her partner\u2019s mother when he was supposedly \u2018off grid\u2019 with another woman, he added. The original trial collapsed last June when it emerged that a key defence witness was a court custody officer who had conducted welfare checks on Beal in the cells.

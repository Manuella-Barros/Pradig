The accident resulted in the death of one fisherman, with another still missing.

The incident unfolded when four fishermen from Rameswaram set out for their daily catch.\n\nAccording to reports, their mechanised fishing boat, registered as ND-TN-10-MM-73, was near Neduntheevu when a Sri Lankan patrol boat approached. The Navy allegedly attempted to seize the fishing vessel on charges of illegal fishing. During this confrontation, the fishermen's boat capsized.\n\nThe boat, which was fully submerged, had four crew members on board identified as Mookhaiah (54) from Nallankulam, Muthu Muniyandi (57) from Ramayanapuram, Malaichami (59), and Ramachandran (64). The fishermen fell into the sea as their boat overturned.\n\nDespite a prompt search operation by fellow fishermen, Mookhaiah was found dead upon being brought to a Jaffna hospital, while the remaining two are undergoing treatment. The search for the fourth one is ongoing. The families of the affected fishermen have expressed their grief and anger, staging protests and roadblocks in the Rameswaram port area.

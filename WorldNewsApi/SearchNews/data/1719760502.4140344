Speaking on Tuesday at the 4th International Conference on SIDS (SIDS4) here, Mottley described as inadequate the current practice of international reviews of the state of SIDS every five to ten years. She emphasised the need for more frequent and structured engagement among leaders to effectively address the unique challenges faced by their nations. The PM proposed the staging of a meeting every two years to ensure continuous and focused dialogue. \u201cI call for a biennial assembly of SIDS heads at this stage, along with the establishment of a governance structure to oversee the implementation of the ABAS and all following outcomes.\u201d Mottley added that it must also command the highest attention of the other countries of the world: \u201cIf the representation of the larger countries who have capacity is at too low a level then we shall remain unequally yoked in our ability to see progress on the policy agenda.\u201d Addressing the urgency of the situation, she said: \u201cThe frequency and scale of natural disasters causing human suffering, loss or compromised livelihoods, irreparable physical damage, and high economic costs are now regrettably a horrifying global reality.\u201d Mottley criticised the gap between United Nations member states\u2019 commitments and their actual financial contributions, which undermines the progress of SIDS. \u201cThe chasm between United Nations member states\u2019 spoken commitment and finance implementation condemns us and contradicts our profession of seriousness and sincerity,\u201d she asserted, urging the international community to take tangible actions to bridge this gap and support SIDS more effectively. Mottley stressed the importance of international solidarity and cooperation in the fight against climate change, noting that geopolitical and national politics should not hinder progress. \u201cIt is geopolitics and national politics that is blocking progress in this world. And until we recognise that to fight the climate crisis we need all countries, irrespective of their geopolitics, irrespective of their national politics, we will be at risk of losing, regrettably, too many people whose lives should not be lost at the foot of this climate crisis,\u201d she warned. The PM also addressed the need for a more inclusive and fair global financial system. She highlighted the initiatives that provide a roadmap for supporting SIDS but emphasised that the speed and scope of these efforts must be increased. \u201cWe must build a more responsive, fairer, and more inclusive global financial system and we must do so with pace and with scope,\u201d she said. She concluded by expressing hope and calling for accelerated action. \u201cLet us now press gas,\u201d she urged, emphasising the need for swift and comprehensive measures to ensure resilient prosperity for SIDS.

{"id": 223728676, "title": "Remembering Palestinian journalist Amna Homaid", "text": "On April 24, Amna Homaid\u2019s torn body lay in the rubble of a house in Shati camp, in the Western part of Gaza city, as rescuers tried to find survivors. An Israeli attack had struck the building, killing her and her eldest son Mahdi. Her brother and her other five children were injured but survived. Her death was added to the dark statistic of more than 140 journalists and medical workers murdered in Gaza by Israel\u2019s genocidal onslaught, per the count maintained by the Gaza Media Office. This year \u2013 like last \u2013 more journalists have been killed from Palestine than from any other nation. Palestinian women journalists have always been at the forefront of Israel\u2019s violent occupation and the wars it has waged on Palestinians. Their bravery and dedication have helped shine light on the suffering and atrocities the Palestinian people have been through and continue to face. But Amna was more than a journalist; she was a poet and a feminist activist. She was born in Gaza in 1990 to a family who traced their roots to the Palestinian town of Isdud \u2013 what the Israelis now call Ashdod. As is the case for most women in Gaza, Amna\u2019s journey was marked by resilience and an unwavering commitment to education. She obtained a BA from the Islamic University of Gaza in 2016 and later joined a master\u2019s degree programme at Al-Aqsa University. Both of her alma maters have been completely destroyed by Israeli bombardment. She worked for several local newspapers and radio stations, lending her voice to the marginalised, conducting research and advocating for women\u2019s rights and the Palestinian cause. She lived in the Yarmouk neighbourhood, just a few kilometres away from Gaza\u2019s Mediterranean coast. Had she been born on the other side of the sea, she may have enjoyed a sprawling career and prominence, winning many awards and global recognition for her many gifts. As it is today, her final reward has been death at the hands of the Israeli army. Amna left behind a seven-month-old baby, Duha, as well as children Ali (10), Mohammed (9), Amir (5), and Ghana (4). Her husband \u2013 journalist and activist Saed Hassunah \u2013 has been unable to reach them. They had become separated in December after Israeli soldiers raided an apartment building in Gaza city where they had taken refuge, kidnapped and tortured him and forced Amna and the children to leave. After the Israeli army released Saed \u2013 beaten up, stripped and with no possessions \u2013 he made his way south, as he was unable to establish contact with his family for days. Injured and deeply worried about his wife and children, he suffered a nervous breakdown. Prior to this horrible ordeal, the family had survived Israeli bombings targeting the places where they had sought shelter twice. The second time Amna and Duha were injured. \u201cI can\u2019t stop thinking of them after the murder of Amna,\u201d Saed told me. \u201cI can\u2019t go to the north and they can\u2019t come to the south. We are separated. I could not even attend the funeral of Amna or bid her the last farewell. and I can\u2019t sleep, thinking of them.\u201d Amna\u2019s family are emblematic of all in Gaza who grapple with the atrocities unfolding there. The words of the United Nations special rapporteur on the occupied Palestinian territories, Francesca Albanese, ring with a sombre truth: \u201cThe colossal amount of evidence concerning international crimes committed by Israel in Gaza just over the past six months could keep the International Criminal Court busy for the next five decades\u201d. The horror of Amna\u2019s death is forever captured in a report aired by Al Jazeera Arabic. As correspondent Ismail al-Ghoul arrives at the scene of the bombing, one of Amna\u2019s sons, Mohammed, runs towards him. With tears streaming down his face and his voice shaking, the little boy calls out: \u201cUncle Ismail!\u201d \u201cYes, what happened my dear?\u201d the reporter asks. The boy pours out his heart: \u201cMy mom and my brother are trapped under the rubble, and my other siblings and uncle are wounded. I came out OK,\u201d he says, crying and not realising he has small pieces of shrapnel in his body. The reporter asks him what happened. Mohammed struggles to speak. Breathing heavily and sobbing, he says a rocket struck while the family were sitting together. As he is overcome by tears, a relative rushes to embrace him, offering what little solace could be found amid the unfolding genocide. Mohammed\u2019s words are a spectre in my mind, thousands of kilometres away in Canada and helpless to do anything against the savage Leviathan unleashed onto Gaza. I hope someday these words will echo in the halls of international justice. Before she was taken from us, Amna faced a smear campaign. Israel\u2019s Channel 14 broadcast a photograph of her and claimed that she was part of the Palestinian armed resistance and that her presence at al-Shifa Hospital proved Hamas \u201chid in the hospital\u201d. Instead of displaying solidarity with a fellow journalist under fire, the Israeli media chose to incite against her instead. Amna was indeed at al-Shifa, but left the hospital just before the siege began so she avoided death in the massacre of at least 400 people in March. This decision to leave prolonged her life by a few weeks. Her husband believes she was targeted for her reporting on the Israeli genocide. A few weeks before her murder, Amna penned a poignant reflection on her Facebook page: \u201cMy choices have always been a mix of bitter and astonishing experiences. Though the junctures are fraught with difficulty and fate hangs in the balance, I have never been one to waver, to bend, to retreat, or to falter. Nothing will deter me from upholding the sanctity of sacraments and carrying and delivering the message that I deeply realised at a young age.\u201d Amna\u2019s murder on April 24 is a loss to her family, her friends, the Palestinian people and anyone committed to building a better world. Her words of hope and dedication are an incredible testament to the power of the human spirit to survive through the unimaginable. I hope they inspire future generations to act as bravely as she did. Rest in power, Amna!", "summary": "Israeli Channel 14 aired her photo, claiming she was a &#039;terrorist&#039;.

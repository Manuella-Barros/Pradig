Some of the IDF forces have penetrated more than a mile inside the Palestinian enclave from the Rafah crossing gate, the images also show.\n\nThese ground operations follow a series of airstrikes on Rafah that have completely destroyed several buildings in the past 24 hours, and killed at least four people, according to a local hospital. Satellite images suggest these strikes are continuing, with one picture showing smoke still rising from one location.\n\nPeople could be seen running through the streets of Rafah in the aftermath of a strike on Wednesday in other footage obtained by CNN. Several carried children in their arms, some apparently bleeding and unconscious, towards Al Kuwaiti hospital.\n\nCNN footage also showed panicked children arriving in ambulances without their parents and one barely responsive child with a heavily bandaged arm being carried on a stretcher. Two body bags were also visible outside the hospital.\n\nFour people were killed and around two dozen injured by Israeli airstrikes in the Tal Al Sultan neighborhood in western Rafah on Wednesday, the hospital said.\n\nCNN has reached out to the Israeli military for comment on the incident.\n\nTell-tale signs\n\nRafah has become the central focus of Israel's war in Gaza, as Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu faces growing pressure from the extreme wing of his coalition to launch a full-scale ground operation in the city to destroy Hamas, while the more moderate wing has urged him to prioritize securing a ceasefire-for-hostages deal.\n\nDuring nearly seven months of war, more than 1 million Palestinians have fled to Rafah, where Hamas is believed to have regrouped after Israel's destruction of much of the strip's north. Gazans began fleeing the densely populated city on Monday after Israel's military issued a call for residents in the east of Rafah to \"evacuate immediately.\"\n\nIn the satellite images, some areas in Rafah show the tell-tale signs of being razed by bulldozers and other heavy machinery - vehicle tracks and large swaths of disturbed earth.\n\nThe new operations shown by the satellite images resemble the initial ground invasion of Gaza back in October 2023, and in other parts of the enclave since then: When the IDF moved into northern Gaza, it carried out a series of airstrikes shortly before moving ground forces in. Once IDF ground forces did move in, armored bulldozers worked with tanks and other military vehicles to bulldoze and raze buildings.\n\nThe IDF said in a statement on Wednesday that it was conducting a \"precise counterterrorism operation in specific areas of eastern Rafah,\" which included \"targeted raids.\" It also claimed to have \"eliminated terrorists and uncovered terrorist infrastructure, as well as underground shafts in several locations in the eastern Rafah area.\"\n\nThe IDF has released footage of its 401st Brigade Combat team conducting \"operational raids on suspicious buildings\" near to where it said its soldiers had been fired on by Hamas militants.\n\nThe IDF said that during the operation it \"eliminated about 30 terrorists and destroyed large amounts of terrorist infrastructure in the region.\"\n\nCNN previously confirmed through hospital sources in Rafah that at least 35 people had died in Rafah since Monday evening, including seven women and nine children.\n\nMore than 34,600 people have been killed in Gaza since October, according to Palestinian authorities in Gaza. Aid agencies have been warning Israel against launching a full-scale ground invasion of Rafah, saying \"any ground operation would mean more suffering and death\" for the 1.2 million displaced Palestinians sheltering in and around the city, OCHA spokesperson Jens Laerke told journalists in Geneva.\n\nNorthern Gaza is already experiencing a \"full-blown famine\" which is rapidly spreading across the strip, the World Food Programme warned over the weekend.", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

The tanks moved from near the Israeli community of Kerem Shalom to take control of the key crossing. This is the main crossing from Egypt into Gaza, and the IDF said that the area was being used by Hamas terrorists.\n\nThe advance followed two intense days of decision-making in Israel. On May 5, Hamas fired twin projectiles which they said were 114mm rockets at IDF troops near Kerem Shalom, which had become a staging area in recent weeks as the IDF shifted forces out of other parts of Gaza and gathered them in the Negev. Israeli leaders had vowed for months to launch a Rafah operation, but they faced challenges about how to evacuate hundreds of thousands of Gazans who had fled to Rafah in the early months of the war.\n\nAfter the rocket attack on May 5 killed four soldiers, Israel's war cabinet was moved to act. Hamas and Israel were still conducting ceasefire talks which had dragged on for months, but the two sides were too far apart to make a deal. On May 6, the IDF called for around 100,000 people to evacuate eastern Rafah and head northeast toward the Mawasi humanitarian zone. On the evening of May 6, the IDF began operations in eastern Rafah. By the morning, the tanks had reached the crossing. Infantry also moved in along the flank, penetrating north toward an area called Al-Bayuk and seeking to take the Salah al-Din road, a key east-west road that links Rafah crossing with Khan Younis and Gaza City.\n\n\"IDF ground troops began a precise counterterrorism operation based on IDF and ISA [Israel Security Agency] intelligence to eliminate Hamas terrorists and dismantle Hamas terrorist infrastructure within specific areas of eastern Rafah,\" the IDF said. \"Following intelligence that indicated that the Rafah Crossing in eastern Rafah was being used for terrorist purposes, IDF troops managed to establish operational control of the Gazan side of the crossing.\"\n\nThe first day of the Rafah offensive saw at least 20 terrorists eliminated, the IDF added. Tunnel shafts were struck and some fifty targets were hit around eastern Rafah and other areas of Gaza. Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant went to observe the progress of the operation, meeting with IDF artillery in the field. \"Yesterday, I directed the IDF to enter the Rafah area, take the crossing, and carry out its missions. This operation will continue until we eliminate Hamas in the Rafah area and the entire Gaza strip, or until the first hostage returns,\" he said.\n\n\"We are willing to make compromises in order to bring back hostages, but if that option is removed, we will go on and 'deepen' the operation- this will happen all over the [Gaza] strip - in the south, in the center and in the north. Hamas only responds to force, so we will intensify our actions, and the military pressure will result in us crushing the Hamas [terrorist] organization.\"\n\nIsrael had to contend with rocket fire from Gaza on May 6 and 7. Three launches took place on May 6 and six more projectiles were fired from the Rafah area toward Kerem Shalom on May 7. Another dozen launches were detected targeting the border area of Reim. This appeared to be the sum of the Hamas response, at least initially. The group did not appear to try to hold onto the crossing or areas next to it, instead melting away into other areas of Rafah. This has been the general Hamas tactic throughout much of the war, after initial attempts to fight Israel in October and November.\n\nOn other fronts, Israel faced escalation from Hezbollah in the north as well as from Iranian-backed militias in Iraq. Hezbollah began using drones and then expanded their attacks in the early afternoon. Sirens sounded in two dozen Israeli communities. Hezbollah attacks continued close to midnight on May 7, illustrating that the group would continue escalation. Several drones were launched from Iraq, and the IDF said that it intercepted one aerial target near the southern Israeli city of Eilat on the evening of May 7. The IDF had also intercepted a drone on the evening of May 6 and May 7.", "source": {"uri": "fdd.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "FDD"}, "authors": [{"uri": "hhanes@fdd.org", "name": "hhanes",

Nadav Shoshani gave a video briefing about the IDF's operation in Rafah, stating that on Monday night, IDF ground troops started \"a precise, intelligence-based counterterrorism operation\" in \"limited areas in eastern Rafah.\" According to Shoshani, the army has used phone calls, text messages, flyers, and media broadcasts to urge people in eastern Rafah to move temporarily to the Al-Mawasi humanitarian zone. He stated that the IDF has \"coordinated an increase\" in food, water, medicine, field hospitals, and tents, noting that \"the quick movement of civilians away from areas that were under Hamas's control enabled us to advance.\" During the operation, IDF soldiers killed 20 terrorists, destroyed an \"explosive vehicle,\" and found \"terror tunnel shafts,\" and the army established control of the Rafah crossing on the Gazan side. Shoshani added: \"Our mission remains the same: to bring home 132 hostages and to dismantle Hamas capabilities across Gaza.\"\n\n18 Rockets Fired from Gaza, Six at Kerem Shalom Crossing: On Tuesday, the Iron Dome intercepted five of 12 rockets fired from the Rafah area toward Re'im in southern Israel, and the other seven fell in open areas. Less than an hour later, Israeli Air Force fighter jets destroyed the launcher from which the rockets were fired. Earlier on Tuesday, six rockets were fired at the Kerem Shalom area from southern Gaza, causing no casualties. According to an IDF statement, \"These projectiles prevent the entry of humanitarian aid into Gaza.\" The statement added: \"The IDF will continue to operate to enable the necessary security conditions to reopen the Kerem Shalom Crossing to provide humanitarian aid to Gazan civilians.\" On Wednesday morning, COGAT, the Israeli entity coordinating aid for Gaza, announced that the Kerem Shalom crossing was reopened, and the IDF noted that \"trucks from Egypt carrying humanitarian aid are already arriving at the crossing,\" adding that the Erez Crossing is also open to allow aid to enter Gaza.\n\nIsraeli Forces Continue Operation in Rafah, Killing Terrorists and Destroying Terror Infrastructure: On Wednesday, the IDF said that its troops -- led by the 162nd Division, with guidance from the Shin Bet and Aman military intelligence -- are continuing the pinpoint operation in eastern Rafah against Hamas. In the past day, soldiers from the 401st Brigade and the Givati Brigade had a number of clashes with terrorists, killing them and finding terrorist infrastructure along with tunnel shafts in various locations in the area. They also began the process of destroying the infrastructures and tunnel shafts. In one incident, Givati Brigade soldiers killed a man who was carrying an RPG. Troops from the 401st Brigade are also continuing to conduct raids on the Gaza side of the Rafah crossing after intelligence indicated that the area is being used for terrorist activities. In addition, over the past day, Israeli Air Force aircraft have destroyed more than 100 terrorist targets in Gaza, including lookout posts, launching posts, military buildings, and other military infrastructures.\n\nIDF Carries Out West Bank Raids, Including Lengthy Operation in Tulkarem: The IDF on Tuesday announced the completion of an overnight operation in the West Bank city of Tulkarem that lasted for more than 20 hours. In the operation, troops from the Duvdevan special forces unit, the Haruv reconnaissance unit, the Border Police, and the Shin Bet destroyed three laboratories for manufacturing explosives, and engineering soldiers found a number of IEDs that were buried under roads. During an exchange of fire, troops killed one armed man and made six arrests, also seizing dozens of gun parts and military equipment and searching more than 60 buildings. In the West Bank city of al-Dhahiriya, troops arrested a man who assisted the terrorist who carried out the attack in Gan Yavneh. In the Huwara area, troops arrested one and confiscated tens of thousands of shekels in terrorist funds. Some 4,000 wanted persons have been arrested since the start of the war, about 1,700 of them members of Hamas.", "source": {"uri": "fdd.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "FDD"}, "authors": [{"uri":

despite international objections.\n\nRafah's mayor, Ahmed Al-Sofi, sent out a desperate appeal to the world begging for the assault to halt in its terrifying tracks after just three days of the planned six-week invasion.\n\nHe said: \"The streets of the city echo with the cries of innocent lives lost, families torn apart, and homes reduced to rubble.\n\n\"We stand on the brink of a humanitarian catastrophe of unprecedented proportions.\"\n\nBefore the strikes got underway Israel issued an order for 100,000 people to evacuate part of the city and move into humanitarian camps set up by the IDF.\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has come under intense pressure by his own people and worldwide governments for how he goes about ending the war.\n\nNetanyahu has claimed the assault on Rafah is a must as it will serve Israel's two goals -

Benjamin Netanyahu said Israel could \"stand alone\" if necessary.\n\nAfter seven months of war in Gaza, Israel has insisted victory is impossible without taking the city and eliminating the last remaining Hamas battalions.\n\nBut with more than a million displaced Palestinians sheltering there, the UN and Western powers have warned that an all-out assault could lead to mass civilian casualties and a humanitarian catastrophe.\n\nResidents and aid workers in Rafah said the sound of artillery and air strikes was constant on Thursday.\n\nLouise Wateridge, a spokeswoman for the UN aid agency for Palestinian refugees (UNRWA), told the BBC in the afternoon that she was at a health facility in the west and could \"hear and feel the bombardment coming closer\".\n\n\"The building is shaking on a frequent basis. There is this constant buzzing of drones,\" she said. \"The fear and nervousness that people [in Rafah] have had, has now become terror.\"\n\nPalestinian media said two people were killed on Thursday afternoon in an Israeli air strike in the al-Jneineh neighbourhood - one of the eastern areas which the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) ordered residents to evacuate before beginning its ground operation began on Monday night.\n\nAnother three people were reportedly killed in an air strike in the nearby Brazil neighbourhood, which is not in the evacuation zone but is next to the Egyptian border.\n\nHamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ) - which are proscribed as terrorist organisations by Israel, the US and other countries - said they were targeting Israeli forces on the eastern outskirts with mortars and anti-tank missiles.\n\nHamas also said it had blown up a booby-trapped tunnel east of Rafah underneath three Israeli military vehicles. The IDF said three of its soldiers were moderately wounded as a result of the explosion.\n\nOvernight, at least five people were reportedly killed when a family's home in the western Tal al-Sultan neighbourhood was hit in an Israeli strike. They included three children, one of them a one-year-old infant, medics said.\n\nThe IDF said on Wednesday evening that soldiers had been carrying out \"targeted operations on the terrorist infrastructure surrounding the Gazan side of the Rafah crossing and conducted operational raids on suspicious buildings in the area\", and that about 30 \"terrorists\" had been eliminated. It also said Israeli aircraft had struck targets in support of the troops.\n\nThe director of the Kuwaiti Specialist Hospital in central Rafah - one of only two hospitals still partially functioning in the city - told BBC Arabic on Thursday that it was facing a surge in casualties, including many \"unusual injuries caused by unusual weapons\".\n\nBut Dr Jamal al-Hamas said it did not have the diagnostic capabilities to treat them properly, adding: \"Even the X-ray machine is disabled due to Israeli shelling and there are no spare parts for it.\"\n\nHams said the situation had been made worse by the closure of the al-Najjar hospital in the city's east on Wednesday due to an evacuation order and nearby fighting.\n\nThe IDF has told displaced people to head towards an \"expanded humanitarian area\" stretching from nearby al-Mawasi to the city of Khan Younis and central town of Deir al-Balah. It said they would find field hospitals, tents and additional aid supplies. But Palestinians and UN officials said it was made up of neighbourhoods that were overcrowded and lacking in essential services or left in ruins by recent fighting.\n\nUnrwa's deputy director in Gaza, Scott Anderson, told the BBC that the agency had seen a \"significant movement of population, with over 80,000 people now displaced\" as the fighting moved \"further westward to the centre of Rafah itself\".\n\n\"Perhaps most worrying, because [the] Rafah and Kerem Shalom entry points are closed, we are beginning to run out of fuel that enables us to provide the response to the people who are being displaced, as well as the other people in Gaza,\" he added.\n\nThe World Health Organization also warned that hospitals in southern Gaza - including those outside Rafah - only had a three days of fuel left.\n\nOn Wednesday, the Israeli military announced it had reopened the Kerem Shalom crossing, a key aid entry point that had been closed for four days because of a Hamas rocket fire.\n\nIt released a video showing aid lorries entering the crossing on Thursday, but the UN said the fighting made it impossible for it to pick up the supplies.\n\n\"The challenge is one of security. The combat operations are very focused in the south-east part of Rafah. There is a very large IDF presence. There seems to be a very large militant presence as well,\" Anderson said.\n\n\"We're concerned about our ability to move staff and trucks safely in and out of the crossing to bring in humanitarian aid.\"\n\nIn response, the IDF said it took \"all operationally feasible measures to mitigate harm to civilians, including aid convoys and workers. The IDF has never, and will never, deliberately target aid convoys and workers.\"\n\nIt added: \"The IDF makes extensive efforts to enable the safe delivery of humanitarian aid, and has been working closely with various aid groups to co-ordinate and realise their vital efforts to provide food and humanitarian aid.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Israelis reacted with alarm and anger after US President Joe Biden said he had warned Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu that he would cut off further weapons supplies in the event of a full-scale assault on Rafah.\n\n\"I've made it clear to Bibi and the war Cabinet, they're not going to get our support if in fact they go into these population centres,\" he told CNN on Wednesday.\n\nLast week, the Biden administration paused one arms shipment that included a batch of 2000 pound bombs - one of the most destructive munitions in Israel's arsenal - over concerns about what was about to happen in Rafah.\n\nOn Thursday, Israel's far-right National Security Minister condemned the remarks, posting on social media that \"Hamas loves Biden\".\n\nLater, Netanyahu released a video in which he reminded Israelis that their country survived an arms embargo and emerged victorious in the 1948-49 Arab-Israeli War that followed its declaration of independence.\n\n\"Today we are much stronger,\" he said. \"If we need to stand alone, we will stand alone. I have said that if necessary - we will fight with our fingernails.\"\n\nThe IDF's chief spokesman also said it had the munitions required for operations in Rafah and other planned operations.\n\nWhite House national security spokesman John Kirby said Biden did not believe \"smashing into Rafah\" would advance Israel's objective of defeating Hamas.\n\n\"The argument that somehow we're walking away from Israel, or we're not willing to help them defeat Hamas just doesn't comport with the facts,\" he told reporters.\n\nIndirect talks in Cairo on a ceasefire and hostage release deal also appeared to once again grind to a halt on Thursday, with both the Israeli and Hamas delegations leaving.\n\nA senior Hamas official, Ezzat al-Rishq, said Israel's operation in Rafah and seizure of the Rafah crossing there \"aim to obstruct the efforts of the mediators\".\n\nIsrael launched a military campaign in Gaza to destroy Hamas in response to the group's cross-border attack on southern Israel on 7 October, during which about 1200 people were killed and 252 others were taken hostage.\n\nMore than 34,900 people have been killed in Gaza since then, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry.\n\nA deal agreed in November saw Hamas release 105 hostages in return for a week-long ceasefire and some 240 Palestinian prisoners in Israeli jails. Israel says 128 hostages are unaccounted for, 36 of whom are presumed dead.", "source": {"uri": "rnz.co.nz", "dataType": "news", "title": "RNZ"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

The operation is being carried out by the 99th Division and aims at \"the continued dismantling of terror infrastructure and eliminating terrorists in the area.\"\n\nTroops of the Nahal, Yiftah and Carmeli brigades entered the suburb to clear it of Hamas infrastructure.\n\nPrior to their entry, the Israeli Air Force struck some 25 sites in the area, including buildings used by terror groups, attack tunnels, observation posts, sniper positions and other infrastructure, the IDF said.\n\nThe IDF first operated in Zeitoun at the start of Israel's ground offensive in Gaza last year, weeks after Hamas's brutal October 7 attacks sparked the war, and launched another two-week-long raid in the neighborhood in late February.\n\nMeanwhile, the IDF and Shin Bet security agency announced on Wednesday that the commander of Hamas's naval forces in Gaza City, Ahmed Ali, was killed in a recent airstrike.\n\nAccording to the military, Ali was involved in managing various projects for Hamas's naval forces and advancing attacks against Israel and troops amid the ongoing war, most recently in central Gaza's Netzarim Corridor.\n\nIn southern Gaza, the IDF said that Israel had reopened the Kerem Shalom Crossing after days of closure, with COGAT, the Israeli Defense Ministry body responsible for civilian affairs in the Palestinian territories, sharing a video on social media on Thursday showing trucks filled with humanitarian aid crossing into the Strip.\n\nHowever, the United Nations claimed no humanitarian aid had arrived in Gaza by Thursday and that there was no one to receive the trucks on the other side of the crossing, after workers fled on Tuesday when the IDF took over the Palestinian side of the Rafah Crossing with Egypt.\n\nThat IDF operation early Tuesday led to the closure of the Rafah Crossing -- one of the main paths for aid into Gaza. The nearby Kerem Shalom Crossing was shuttered after a Hamas rocket attack from Rafah on Sunday killed four IDF soldiers and wounded 10 others stationed nearby. Another IDF soldier was lightly wounded in a rocket barrage fired by Hamas from Rafah at Kerem Shalom on Wednesday.\n\nWith the seizure of the Rafah Crossing, Israel now controls all of Gaza's crossings for the first time since it withdrew troops and settlers from the territory nearly two decades ago. The crossing has been a vital conduit for entry of food, medicine and other humanitarian supplies for Gaza's population of 2.3 million since the start of the war and is the only place where people can enter and exit, while Kerem Shalom is Gaza's main cargo terminal.\n\n\"The Hamas terrorist organization continues to deliberately endanger Gazan civilians and carry out attacks from within civilian areas to attempt to attack Israeli civilians and IDF troops,\" the IDF said in a statement on Wednesday.\n\n\"Moreover, the terrorist organization continues to carry out launches from populated zones in the area of Rafah toward the Kerem Shalom Crossing to attack IDF troops, as well as [harm] the functioning of the crossing,\" the military added.\n\nThe Tuesday operation did not appear to be the start of the full-scale invasion of Rafah that Israel has repeatedly said is necessary to destroy Hamas's military and governance capabilities and free 128 hostages abducted on October 7 believed to remain in Gaza.\n\nAid officials warn that the prolonged closure of the two crossings could cause the collapse of aid operations, worsening the humanitarian crisis in Gaza, where the UN says a \"full-blown famine\" is already underway in the north.\n\nThe UN World Food Program deputy executive director, Carl Skau, told The Associated Press that the agency had lost access to its Gaza food warehouse in Rafah, which he said was \"communicated as a no-go zone.\"\n\nThe US in recent days completed construction of a new off-shore aid pier that will be used to shuttle large amounts of aid into Gaza.\n\nA vessel carrying aid to the pier set sail from the Cypriot port of Larnaca on Thursday morning, marine tracking websites showed.\n\nAmerican officials have said the United States-flagged Sagamore will be used to offload supplies onto a floating pier built to expedite aid into the enclave.\n\nOn the Israeli side of the border, activists from a right-wing organization that opposes aid to Gaza while hostages are still held there said on Thursday morning that they had continued their attempts to block trucks on their way to Gaza overnight and in the early morning hours.\n\nThe group, which has drawn international anger, said that some 500 people, including relatives of hostages, blocked trucks near Eilat and delayed them for a few hours overnight Wednesday.\n\nOn Thursday morning, activists from the group blocked trucks near Mitzpe Ramon.\n\n\"We're shifting gear. We want the hostages home. No aid passes until the last hostage returns,\" the group said in a statement.\n\nIsraeli authorities -- facing intense international pressure to facilitate aid -- have been dispersing the crowds and ensuring that the shipments eventually reach their destination.\n\nIn a new crisis for Israeli-American relations, US President Joe Biden said Wednesday that Washington would not supply certain munitions to Israel if it moves ahead with a full-scale invasion of Rafah.\n\nThe US, Egypt and Qatar are simultaneously ramping up efforts to close the gaps in a possible agreement for a temporary ceasefire and hostage release deal. Israel has linked the threatened Rafah operation to the fate of those negotiations. CIA chief William Burns, who has been shuttling around the region for talks on the truce deal, met Wednesday with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, a US official said.\n\nThe war in Gaza erupted after Hamas's October 7 attacks, which saw some 3,000 terrorists burst across the border into Israel by land, air and sea, killing some 1,200 people and seizing 252 hostages, mostly civilians, many amid acts of brutality and sexual assault.\n\nThe ensuing war has killed over 34,800 Palestinians, according to Gaza health officials, though data issued by the Hamas-run authorities cannot be independently verified, and is believed to include both civilians and Hamas members killed in Gaza, including as a consequence of terror groups' own rocket misfires.\n\nThe IDF says it has killed over 13,000 operatives in Gaza, in addition to some 1,000 terrorists inside Israel on October 7, while 267 soldiers have been killed during the ground offensive against Hamas and amid operations along the Gaza border.", "source": {"uri": "timesofisrael.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Times of Israel"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinians", "type":

Gazans began fleeing the densely populated city on Monday after Israel's military issued a call for residents in the east of Rafah to \"evacuate immediately.\"\n\nIn the satellite images, some areas in Rafah show the tell-tale signs of being razed by bulldozers and other heavy machinery - vehicle tracks and large swaths of disturbed earth.\n\nThe new operations shown by the satellite images resemble the initial ground invasion of Gaza back in October 2023, and in other parts of the enclave since then: When the IDF moved into northern Gaza, it carried out a series of airstrikes shortly before moving ground forces in. Once IDF ground forces did move in, armored bulldozers worked with tanks and other military vehicles to bulldoze and raze buildings.\n\nA satellite image shows Rafah, Gaza, on May 5.

Two body bags were also visible outside the hospital.\n\nFour people were killed and around two dozen injured by Israeli airstrikes in the Tal Al Sultan neighborhood in western Rafah on Wednesday, the hospital said.\n\nCNN has reached out to the Israeli military for comment on the incident.\n\nRafah has become the central focus of Israel's war in Gaza, as Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu faces growing pressure from the extreme wing of his coalition to launch a full-scale ground operation in the city to destroy Hamas, while the more moderate wing has urged him to prioritize securing a ceasefire-for-hostages deal.\n\nDuring nearly seven months of war, more than 1 million Palestinians have fled to Rafah, where Hamas is believed to have regrouped after Israel's destruction of much of the strip's north. Gazans began fleeing the densely populated city on Monday after Israel's military issued a call for residents in the east of Rafah to \"evacuate immediately.\"\n\nIn the satellite images, some areas in Rafah show the tell-tale signs of being razed by bulldozers and other heavy machinery - vehicle tracks and large swaths of disturbed earth.\n\nThe new operations shown by the satellite images resemble the initial ground invasion of Gaza back in October 2023, and in other parts of the enclave since then: When the IDF moved into northern Gaza, it carried out a series of airstrikes shortly before moving ground forces in. Once IDF ground forces did move in, armored bulldozers worked with tanks and other military vehicles to bulldoze and raze buildings.\n\nThe IDF said in a statement on Wednesday that it was conducting a \"precise counterterrorism operation in specific areas of eastern Rafah,\" which included \"targeted raids.\" It also claimed to have \"eliminated terrorists and uncovered terrorist infrastructure, as well as underground shafts in several locations in the eastern Rafah area.\"\n\nThe IDF has released footage of its 401st Brigade Combat team conducting \"operational raids on suspicious buildings\" near to where it said its soldiers had been fired on by Hamas militants.\n\nThe IDF said that during the operation it \"eliminated about 30 terrorists and destroyed large amounts of terrorist infrastructure in the region.\"\n\nCNN previously confirmed through hospital sources in Rafah that at least 35 people had died in Rafah since Monday evening, including seven women and nine children.\n\nMore than 34,600 people have been killed in Gaza since October, according to Palestinian authorities in Gaza. Aid agencies have been warning Israel against launching a full-scale ground invasion of Rafah, saying \"any ground operation would mean more suffering and death\" for the 1.2 million displaced Palestinians sheltering in and around the city, OCHA spokesperson Jens Laerke told journalists in Geneva.\n\nNorthern Gaza is already experiencing a \"full-blown famine\" which is rapidly spreading across the strip, the World Food Programme warned over the weekend.\n\nThe-CNN-Wire\n\n\u2122 & \u00a9 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

Benjamin Netanyahu said Israel could \"stand alone\" if necessary. After seven months of war in Gaza, Israel has insisted victory is impossible without taking the city and eliminating the last remaining Hamas battalions.But with more than a million displaced Palestinians sheltering there, the UN and Western powers have warned that an all-out assault could lead to mass civilian casualties and a humanitarian catastrophe.Biden to halt some arms supplies if Israel invades Rafah US bomb delay is biggest warning yet for IsraelIsraeli police raid studio linked to Al JazeeraResidents and aid workers in Rafah said the sound of artillery and air strikes was constant on Thursday.Louise Wateridge, a spokeswoman for the UN aid agency for Palestinian refugees (UNRWA), told the BBC in the afternoon that she was at a health facility in the west and could \"hear and feel the bombardment coming closer\".\"The building is shaking on a frequent basis. There is this constant buzzing of drones,\" she said. \"The fear and nervousness that people [in Rafah] have had, has now become terror.\"Palestinian media said two people were killed on Thursday afternoon in an Israeli air strike in the al-Jneineh neighbourhood - one of the eastern areas which the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) ordered residents to evacuate before beginning its ground operation began on Monday night.Another three people were reportedly killed in an air strike in the nearby Brazil neighbourhood, which is not in the evacuation zone but is next to the Egyptian border. Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ) - which are proscribed as terrorist organisations by Israel, the US and other countries - said they were targeting Israeli forces on the eastern outskirts with mortars and anti-tank missiles.Hamas also said it had blown up a booby-trapped tunnel east of Rafah underneath three Israeli military vehicles. The IDF said three of its soldiers were moderately wounded as a result of the explosion.Overnight, at least five people were reportedly killed when a family's home in the western Tal al-Sultan neighbourhood was hit in an Israeli strike. They included three children, one of them a one-year-old infant, medics said.The IDF said on Wednesday evening that soldiers had been carrying out \"targeted operations on the terrorist infrastructure surrounding the Gazan side of the Rafah crossing and conducted operational raids on suspicious buildings in the area\", and that about 30 \"terrorists\" had been eliminated. It also said Israeli aircraft had struck targets in support of the troops. The director of the Kuwaiti Specialist Hospital in central Rafah - one of only two hospitals still partially functioning in the city - told BBC Arabic on Thursday that it was facing a surge in casualties, including many \"unusual injuries caused by unusual weapons\".

No nation came to our aid.\n\n\"Today, we again confront enemies bent on our destruction.\"\n\nNetanyahu continued: \"I say to the leaders of the world, no amount of pressure, no decision by any international forum, will stop Israel from defending itself.\"\n\nHe concluded by pledging: \"As the Prime Minister of Israel - the one and only Jewish state - I pledge here today from Jerusalem on this Holocaust Remembrance Day: If Israel is forced to stand alone, Israel will stand alone. But we know we are not alone because countless decent people around the world support our just cause. And I say to you, we will defeat our genocidal enemies. Never again is now!\"\n\nMeanwhile. the Israeli military is advancing against Hamas's terrorist buildup in Rafah. After launching the offensive on Monday, the troops were now \"in control of eastern neighborhoods of Rafah,\" the TV channel i24NEWS confirmed Thursday.\n\nThe military \"reiterated that the operation remains \"limited and targeted,\" showcasing footage of ground maneuvers as its forces occupy the eastern neighborhoods of the city,\" the TV channel reported. \"Israeli troops have begun extensive searches for terrorist tunnels and weapons in these areas.\"\n\nThe Israeli military was destroying Hamas's fighting capabilities and terrorist infrastructure. \"Amid the IDF's ongoing operation in the eastern part of Rafah in the southern Gaza Strip, some 50 gunmen have been killed by troops, according to the latest estimates by the military,\" The Times of Israel reported Thursday. \"Another 10 tunnel shafts have been found, and they are being prepared for demolition.\"\n\nThe news website described the IDF's push into Rafah as a limited operation, focused only on the eastern part of the city. \"The IDF currently does not plan to expand the evacuation order to other areas of Rafah, as the ongoing operation remains relatively limited in scope amid hostage negotiations with Hamas,\" The Times of Israel added.\n\nCentral Gaza: IDF deploys ground troops, hits Hamas terror targets\n\nThe Israeli military was also hitting Hamas targets elsewhere in Gaza, launching an operation in the central part of the Hamas-infested enclave.\n\n\"IDF troops began an operation against terrorist infrastructure and operatives in the area of Zeitoun in central Gaza,\" the military said in a press release Thursday morning. \"The operation began with a series of intelligence-based aerial strikes on approximately 25 terror targets, including military structures, terror tunnels, observation posts, sniper posts, and additional terror infrastructure.\"\n\nAfter a large-scale Israeli withdrawal from Gaza in early April amid mounting pressure from the Biden White House to scale down the military operation, the boots were back on the ground in central Gaza. \"IDF ground troops are currently operating to secure the area of Zeitoun,\" the military disclosed in

There is this constant buzzing of drones,\" she said. \"The fear and nervousness that people [in Rafah] have had, has now become terror.\"\n\nPalestinian media said two people were killed on Thursday afternoon in an Israeli air strike in the al-Jneineh neighbourhood - one of the eastern areas which the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) ordered residents to evacuate before beginning its ground operation began on Monday night.\n\nAnother three people were reportedly killed in an air strike in the nearby Brazil neighbourhood, which is not in the evacuation zone but is next to the Egyptian border and about 2.5km (1.5 miles) north of the Rafah crossing.\n\nHamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ) - which are proscribed as terrorist organisations by Israel, the US and other countries - said they were targeting Israeli forces on the eastern outskirts with mortars and anti-tank missiles.\n\nHamas also said it had blown up a booby-trapped tunnel east of Rafah underneath three Israeli military vehicles. The IDF said three of its soldiers were moderately wounded as a result of the explosion.\n\nOvernight, at least five people were reportedly killed when a family's home in the western Tal al-Sultan neighbourhood was hit in an Israeli strike. They included three children, one of them a one-year-old infant, medics said.\n\nThe IDF said on Wednesday evening that soldiers had been carrying out \"targeted operations on the terrorist infrastructure surrounding the Gazan side of the Rafah crossing and conducted operational raids on suspicious buildings in the area\", and that about 30 \"terrorists\" had been eliminated. It also said Israeli aircraft had struck targets in support of the troops.\n\nThe director of the Kuwaiti Specialist Hospital in central Rafah - one of only two hospitals still partially functioning in the city - told BBC Arabic on Thursday that it was facing a surge in casualties, including many \"unusual injuries caused by unusual weapons\".\n\n\"We have received some cases of torn abdomen and intestines, and cases of skull fractures with parts of the brain outside the skull,\" Dr Jamal al-Hams said. \"Some cases have lost major parts of the buttocks, in addition to cases of amputation of the lower limbs at the foot.\"\n\n\"I lived through all previous wars [in Gaza]... where injuries were always in a certain area and dealt with by one specialist. But now each case needs several specialists.\"\n\nBut he added: \"Unfortunately, the Kuwaiti hospital is a small hospital that does not have diagnostic capabilities - even the X-ray machine is disabled due to Israeli shelling and there are no spare parts for it.\"\n\nDr Hams said the situation had been made worse by the closure of the al-Najjar hospital in the city's east on Wednesday due to an evacuation order and nearby fighting.\n\n\"Residents were also ordered [by the Israeli military] to evacuate their homes and the doctors, like any other human beings, are looking for shelter for their families,\" Dr Hams added.\n\n\"But where should they go? Tents and other supplies were supposed to be provided in other safe areas. This has not been done.\"\n\nThe IDF has told displaced people to head towards an \"expanded humanitarian area\" stretching from nearby al-Mawasi to the city of Khan Younis and central town of Deir al-Balah. It said they would find field hospitals, tents and additional aid supplies.\n\nHowever, Palestinians and UN officials said it was made up of neighbourhoods that were already overcrowded and lacking in essential services, were still coming under bombardment, or had been left in ruins by recent fighting.\n\nUnrwa's deputy director in Gaza, Scott Anderson, told the BBC that the agency had seen a \"significant movement of population, with over 80,000 people now displaced\" as the fighting moved \"further westward to the centre of Rafah itself\".\n\n\"But perhaps most worrying, because [the] Rafah and Kerem Shalom entry points are closed, we are beginning to run out of fuel that enables us to provide the response to the people who are being displaced, as well as the other people in Gaza,\" he added.\n\nThe World Health Organization also warned that hospitals in southern Gaza - including those outside Rafah - only had a three days of fuel left. Fuel is also needed to power water pumps and sewage treatment plants.\n\nOn Wednesday, the Israeli military announced it had reopened the Kerem Shalom crossing, a key aid entry point that had been closed for four days because of a Hamas rocket fire.\n\nIt released a video showing aid lorries being unloaded, but the UN said the fighting made it impossible for its staff and lorries to pick up supplies.\n\n\"The challenge is one of security. The combat operations are very focused in the south-east part of Rafah. There is a very large IDF presence. There seems to be a very large militant presence as well,\" Mr Anderson said.\n\n\"We're concerned about our ability to move staff and trucks safely in and out of the crossing to bring in humanitarian aid.\"\n\nIn response, the IDF said it took \"all operationally feasible measures to mitigate harm to civilians, including aid convoys and workers. The IDF has never, and will never, deliberately target aid convoys and workers.\"\n\nIt added: \"The IDF makes extensive efforts to enable the safe delivery of humanitarian aid, and has been working closely with various aid groups to co-ordinate and realise their vital efforts to provide food and humanitarian aid.\"\n\nMeanwhile, indirect talks in Cairo on a ceasefire and hostage release deal appeared to once again grind to a halt on Thursday, with both the Israeli and Hamas delegations leaving.\n\nIsrael launched a military campaign in Gaza to destroy Hamas in response to the group's cross-border attack on southern Israel on 7 October, during which about 1,200 people were killed and 252 others were taken hostage.\n\nMore than 34,900 people have been killed in Gaza since then, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry.", "source": {"uri": "the-star.co.ke", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Star"}, "authors": [{"uri": "https@the-star.co.ke", "name": "https",

But, he clarified that Israeli forces aren't in Rafah yet.\n\n\"I made it clear that if they go into Rafah - they haven't gone in Rafah yet - if they go into Rafah,\" said POTUS during a television interview.\n\nThe American president said that he would not be supplying weapons that would be remembered historically as weapons used for the invasion of Rafah. He made these statements to clarify that his administration is not supporting the possible ground offensive in Rafah.\n\nIf ever the Israeli forces invaded Rafah and the U.S. pulled out its arms supplies, it could mark the start of a turning point in the relationship between the two power nations.\n\nRead Also: Biden Administration Approved More Bombs to Israel Despite Global Outrage Over Killing of 7 World Central Kitchen Workers\n\nAccording to CNN, IDF forces are expanding in Rafah.

Cairo collapsed on Thursday, an Israeli official told Xinhua.\n\nMeanwhile, a Xinhua correspondent covering the developments reported mass Israeli troops stationed on the border with Rafah.\n\nThe unnamed Israeli official confirmed that the Israeli delegation has left Cairo after talks with Hamas, the United States, Egyptian, and Qatari negotiators on a deal to end the hostilities and secure the release of hostages in Gaza.\n\nThe official did not elaborate on whether Israel will expand the offensive to more areas in Rafah at the southern end of Gaza, where about 1.2 million internally displaced Palestinians were taking refuge.\n\nAccording to Israel's state-owned Kan TV news, the talks were halted due to Israel's ongoing ground assault on Rafah.\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's wartime cabinet was scheduled to meet later on Thursday to discuss the continuation of the Rafah operation.\n\nCommenting on U.S. President Joe Biden's decision to pause some shipments of weapons to Israel if it deepens its assault on Rafah city, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said it has enough weapons to continue operations in Gaza.\n\n\"The IDF has armaments for the operations it is planning, also for the operation in Rafah,\" IDF Spokesman Daniel Hagari said in a statement. \"We have what we need,\" he stressed.\n\n\"The U.S. has so far provided security assistance to Israel and the IDF in an unprecedented manner,\" Hagari added, noting that \"even when there are disagreements between us -- we resolve them in closed rooms.\" \u25a0", "source": {"uri": "english.news.cn",

Vinesh performed outstandingly well to beat Yui Susaki, the Japanese champion and then the wrestlers from Ukraine and Cuba in the quarter-final and semi-final to qualify for the final.\n\nHowever, on the second weigh-in on the day of the Gold medal bout, Vinesh was found 100gms over the allowed category. As per reports, from jogging to cycling to sauna, everything was tried on Vinesh's part to shed those extra 2kgs before the official weigh-in on Wednesday. As per Article 11 of UWW (United World Wrestling) rules, if an athlete doesn't meet the weight criteria, he/she stands disqualified which means that they will finish last and hence Vinesh will return empty-handed.\n\nArticle 11, UWW\n\n\"The referees responsible for the weigh-in must check that all wrestlers are of the weight corresponding to the category in which they are entered for the competition, that they fulfil all the requirements of Article 5 and to inform any wrestler of the risk he runs if he presents himself on the mat in incorrect dress. Referees will refuse to weigh a wrestler who is not dressed correctly.\n\n\"If an athlete does not attend or fail the weigh-in (the 1st or the 2nd weigh-in), he will be eliminated of the competition and ranked last, without rank. If an athlete is injured during the first day, he doesn't have to attend the second weigh-in and will keep his results.\"\n\nThe weight tolerance wasn't applicable in the Olympics. There is a weight tolerance of 2kg allowed for World Cup and other international tournaments.\n\nAs per Article 8, UWW rules\n\n\"The medical control and a first weigh-in will be held the morning of the concerned weight category. The qualified athletes for the finals and repechages will be weigh-in again the second morning of the concerned weight category. No more weight tolerance will be allowed for the second weigh-in. 2kg weight tolerance is allowed for World Cup and for the International Tournaments (Except UWW Ranking Events).\"\n\nThere was another argument about whether Vinesh and her team could have withdrawn due to injury so that the match could have been forfeited and she would have at least been eligible for a silver medal since she had qualified for the final. However, Article 56 clearly states that if the athlete withdraws due to injury after the bout is completed, he/she will have to appear in the second weigh-in otherwise there will be an elimination.\n\nThe only way the athlete could have avoided a second weigh-in would have been in case of getting injured midway through the bout. And for the said wrestler to compete in the next bout, he/she would have to take a prior approval of a UWW doctor or a certified medical professional for the tournament.\n\nAs per Article 56, UWW rules\n\n\"For all the other type of injuries or diseases that happen after the first day of competition and out of competition, the concerned athlete will have to attend the second weigh-in otherwise he will be eliminated of the competition and ranked last, without rank.\"\n\nApart from appealing the decision and asking for possibly some more time, there was nothing Vinesh or IOA could have done.", "source": {"uri": "indiatvnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "India TV News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vinesh_Phogat", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Vinesh Phogat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_World_Wrestling", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United World Wrestling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sport_of_athletics", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sport of athletics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amateur_wrestling", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Amateur wrestling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yui_Susaki", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Yui Susaki"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cycle_sport", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cycle sport"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional_wrestling", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Professional wrestling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukraine", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Japan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cuba", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cuba"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Cuba"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFA_World_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "FIFA World Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Repechage", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Repechage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_Olympic_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Indian Olympic Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silver_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Silver medal"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Strength_Sports", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Strength Sports", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Strength_Sports/Arm_Wrestling", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Strength Sports/Arm Wrestling", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Martial_Arts/Sumo", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Martial Arts/Sumo", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Strength_Sports/Strongman", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Strength Sports/Strongman", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://resize.indiatvnews.com/en/resize/newbucket/1200_-/2024/08/78814-1723021813.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9797610", "eventUri": "eng-9797610", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-07", "textStart": 175, "textEnd": 183}], "sentiment": 0.2156862745098038, "wgt": 222, "relevance": 1}

Full details, weigh-in rules explained", "body": "Vinesh Phogat was disqualified from the women's freestyle 50kg wrestling competition at the Paris Olympics 2024 due to being overweight during the morning weigh-in.\n\nIn a devastating turn of events just hours before her highly anticipated gold medal bout, Indian wrestler Vinesh Phogat was disqualified from the women's freestyle 50kg wrestling competition at the Paris Olympics 2024 due to being overweight during the morning weigh-in.\n\nAccording to the rules set forth by the international wrestling governing body, United World Wrestling (UWW), any wrestler who fails the weigh-in test prior to the competition is immediately disqualified and relegated to the last position. This unfortunate circumstance means that Vinesh will not be eligible for any medal, despite having advanced to the finals of the event. Even if she had lost in the final match, she would have secured the silver medal.\n\nThe UWW rules about failing the weigh-in test state, \"If an athlete does not attend or fail the weigh-in (the 1st or the 2nd weigh-in), he/s will be eliminated from the competition and ranked last, without rank.\"\n\nWhile confirming the news, the Indian Olympic Association did not provide specific details regarding the weight discrepancy. However, multiple reports suggest that Vinesh was between 100-150 grams overweight on Wednesday morning.\n\nVinesh, who has historically faced challenges in meeting weight limits, barely made the 50kg upper limit on Tuesday morning. Despite winning three bouts, including a victory over the four-time world champion and Tokyo gold medalist Yui Susaki of Japan, Vinesh failed the weigh-in test on Wednesday morning. This unfortunate turn of events prevented her from advancing to the finals at the Olympics, making her the first Indian female wrestler to achieve such a feat in any weight category.\n\nHere's what UWW rules about weigh-in before every international wrestling competition\n\n*If changes are made in the final entries compared to the entries in Athena (ONLY after exceptional circumstances like injury (confirmed by a medical certificate)), the updated athletes' entry list must be submitted to the organiser by the team leader, without fail, at least at 12hrs the day before the weigh-in and the competition day of the concerned weight category.\n\n*No changes will be accepted after this time. For all competitions, the weigh-in is organised each morning for the concerned weight-category. The weigh-in and the medical control lasts 30 minutes.\n\n*The second morning of the concerned weight category, only the wrestlers who participate in the rep\u00aachages and finals have to come for the weigh-in. This weigh-in will last 15 minutes.\n\n*No wrestler may be accepted at the weigh-in if he has not undergone a medical examination the first morning.\n\n*Wrestlers must appear at the medical examination and the weigh-in with their licence and accreditation.\n\n*The only uniform allowed for the weigh-in is the singlet. After having been examined by qualified physicianswho are obliged to eliminate any wrestler who presents any danger of a contagious disease, the wrestler can beweighed-in.\n\n*No weight tolerance will be allowed for the singlet.Contestants must be in perfect physical condition, with their fingernails cut very short.\n\n*Throughout the entire weigh-in period, wrestlers have the right, each in turn, to get on the scale as many times as they wish.\n\n*The referees responsible for the weigh-in must check that all wrestlers are of the weight corresponding to the category in which they are entered for the competition, that they fulfil all the requirements of Article 5 and to inform any wrestler of the risk he runs if he presents himself on the mat in an incorrect dress.\n\n*Referees will refuse to weigh a wrestler who is not dressed correctly. The referees responsible for the weigh-in will receive the results of the draw and will be allowed to control only the athletes who are on this list.\n\n*If an athlete does not attend or fail the weigh-in (the 1st or the 2nd weigh-in), he will be eliminated of the competition and ranked last, without rank. If an athlete is injured during the first day, he doesn't have to attend the second weigh-in and will keep his results.\n\nOver the past year, Vinesh Phogat has been engaged in a fierce battle, not only for her career but also for her life. She emerged as a prominent voice in the protest against the former WFI chief and became India's greatest prospect for securing its inaugural wrestling gold medal at the Olympics. Displaying remarkable resilience akin to that of a lioness, she persevered through a challenging knee surgery that sidelined her from the Asia Games. Following her recovery, she made a triumphant comeback to the wrestling arena.", "source": {"uri": "dnaindia.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily News and Analysis (DNA) India"}, "authors": [{"uri": "chankesh_rao@dnaindia.com", "name": "Chankesh Rao", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vinesh_Phogat", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Vinesh Phogat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_World_Wrestling", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United World Wrestling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freestyle_wrestling", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Freestyle wrestling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wrestling", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Wrestling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silver_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Silver medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gold medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sports_governing_body", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sports governing body"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yui_Susaki", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Yui Susaki"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sport_of_athletics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sport of athletics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_Olympic_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Indian Olympic Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "World championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gold"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokyo", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Japan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wrestling_Federation_of_India", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wrestling Federation of India"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wrestling_singlet", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wrestling singlet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arena", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Arena"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asia", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Asia"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Surgery"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Wrestling", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Wrestling", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Wrestling/Amateur", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Wrestling/Amateur", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Wrestling/Professional", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Wrestling/Professional", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Wrestling/Backyard_Wrestling", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Wrestling/Backyard Wrestling", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Wrestling", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Wrestling", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://cdn.dnaindia.com/sites/default/files/styles/full/public/2024/08/07/2644815-untitled-design-2024-08-07t142348.799.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9797610", "eventUri": "eng-9797610", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.2235294117647059, "wgt": 219, "relevance": 1}

These categories have rules in place that don't allow athletes above that weight to participate in that competition. Essentially, sport does not want a bigger athlete to compete against a smaller athlete. But sometimes bigger athletes choose to cut weight, that is rapidly losing a set number of kilos before competition. It's quite a common practice in combat sports.\n\nAccording to United World Wrestling's (UWW) Olympics weigh- in rules, wrestlers have to weigh in on the morning of their competition. But before the weigh-in on Day 1, a wrestler is supposed to appear at a medical examination with their licence and accreditation, while wearing their singlet. The weigh-in period is 30 minutes on Day 1 and a wrestler can try weighing themselves multiple times. On Day 2, if applicable, a wrestler has 15 minutes to make the weight and this too is done on the morning of the competition.\n\nWhy was she disqualified despite making the weight on the first day?\n\nUWW rules state that an athlete needs to make the weight on all competition days. Since the Olympic wrestling competition in a weight category is held over two days, Vinesh needed to weigh 50kg or under on both days. And since she was not able to do so on Day 2, she was disqualified.\n\nAccording to UWW, \"If an athlete does not attend or fails the weigh-in (the 1st or the 2nd weigh-in), he will be eliminated from the competition and ranked last, without rank. If an athlete is injured during the first day, he doesn't have to attend the second weigh-in and will keep his results.\"\n\nCould Vinesh have salvaged a medal if she was injured?\n\nAccording to UWW, if an athlete is injured during the first day, he/she doesn't have to attend the second weigh-in and will keep his results. In Vinesh's case, she would have got the silver medal.\n\nBut if an athlete is injured after Day 1 of the competition, they have to attend the second weigh-in, according to the UWW.\n\n\"For all the other types of injuries or diseases that happen after the first day of competition and out of competition, the concerned athlete will have to attend the second weigh-in, otherwise he will be eliminated from the competition and ranked last, without rank.\"\n\nWhy do Olympic wrestlers have to weigh in on two days?\n\nAt the Olympics, starting rounds to semi-finals take place on the first day, and the gold medal and repechage rounds on the next day. If an Olympic wrestler has matches on the second day, they are bound to weigh in again on the second day, since they will be competing on that day as well.\n\nWas a two-day weigh-in always the rule?\n\nNo. In 2017, the UWW changed the format of Olympic wrestling. So instead of the competition in a weight category being conducted all in a day, they moved to a two-day system. This was done so that athletes wouldn't lose a huge amount of weight on one day and compete.\n\nHow can a wrestler weigh two kilos higher on Day 2, after weighing 50 kg on Day 1?\n\nMost wrestlers rely on extreme weight cutting measures in the last few days before a competition. This involves not loading any carbohydrates, not drinking water, and intense exercising. The main way a body loses weight quickly is through losing water. Many combat athletes often try to use saunas and cover themselves up and exercise in order to make the body produce more sweat.\n\nIn the case of two-day Olympic wrestling, Phogat weighed 50 kg on the first day and was able to compete. But through the day, the last couple of kgs that she had lost came back. She then spent the entire time after competition on Day 1 to Day 2's morning weigh-in trying to get her body to cooperate but missed out by a few grams.", "source": {"uri": "indianexpress.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Indian Express"}, "authors": [{"uri": "shashank_nair@indianexpress.com", "name": "Shashank Nair", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vinesh_Phogat", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Vinesh Phogat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_World_Wrestling", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United World Wrestling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sport_of_athletics", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sport of athletics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weight_cutting", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Weight cutting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combat_sport", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Combat sport"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amateur_wrestling", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Amateur wrestling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wrestling_singlet", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wrestling singlet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wrestling_at_the_Summer_Olympics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Wrestling at the Summer Olympics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silver_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Silver medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wrestling_at_the_2019_European_Games_\u2013_Women's_freestyle_50_kg", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wrestling at the 2019 European Games \u2013 Women's freestyle 50 kg"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Repechage", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Repechage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbohydrate", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Carbohydrate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gold medal"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Weight_Loss", "label": "dmoz/Health/Weight Loss", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Health/Weight_Loss", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Health/Weight Loss", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Religion_and_Spirituality/Cao_Dai", "label": "dmoz/Society/Religion and Spirituality/Cao Dai", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/History/On_This_Day_in_History", "label": "dmoz/Society/History/On This Day in History", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally_Challenged", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally Challenged", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 94}], "image": "https://images.indianexpress.com/2024/08/New-Project-2024-08-07T140006.045.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9797610", "eventUri": "eng-9797610", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1686274509803921, "wgt": 214, "relevance": 1}

Sources from her team revealed that the camp raced against time to help her make the hard 50kg limit in place in the Olympics, but fell short by a little over 100gm.\n\nHere's how the weight restictions work in the Olympics and how it's different from other UWW or international tournaments:\n\nWeigh-ins take place in the morning for any wrestlers competing that day. The tournament for each weight class will be contested over a two-day span, so any wrestlers that make the finals or the repechage will have to make weight on both days.\n\nDuring the first weigh-in, wrestlers will have 30 minutes to make weight. They have the right to get on the scale as many times as they wish. Contestants are weighed with their singlets, but nothing else. Athletes will also be examined to make sure they have no signs of any contagious disease and that their fingernails are cut very short.\n\nFor any wrestlers competing on the second day, the weigh-in will last 15 minutes. This is a non-negotiable window during which the wrestler must make the required weight or risk disqualification.\n\nAccording to the UWW, the medical control and a first weigh-in will be held the morning of the concerned weight category. The qualified athletes for the finals and repechages will be weigh-in again the second morning of the concerned weight category. No more weight tolerance will be allowed for the second weigh-in.\n\nTwo kilograms weight tolerance is allowed for World Cup and for the International Tournaments (Except UWW Ranking Events).\n\nThe Olympics follow a strict weight restriction without the 2kg weigh in tolerance.\n\nHow did this pan out in Vinesh Phogat's case?\n\nHours after Vinesh Phogat's disqualification from the 50kg wrestling final due to a failed weigh-in on Wednesday morning, a member of her camp revealed the distressing details of her weight-cutting ordeal. \"Her normal weight is 57kg, and she did everything to get down to 50kg,\" the member said. \"She was 49.9kg yesterday (Tuesday) morning, but the moment she had even a small meal, her weight bounced back to at least 53kg. She had to reach this weight to have the strength to fight in three bouts.\"\n\n\"After the semifinals last night, her weight was 52.7kg. She didn't sleep even a minute, didn't drink a sip of water, and didn't have a morsel of food. She spent the entire night running and using the sauna. She made it to 50.1kg but didn't have time to cut the last 100 grams. There was no leeway and no extra time to make weight.\"\n\nWhy does Vinesh lose her medal if she won the semifinal after making the right weight?\n\nAccording to Article 11 of the United World Wrestling's rule book, an athlete who fails to make the weight cut will be eliminated from the event. \"If an athlete does not attend or fails the weigh-in (the 1st or the 2nd weigh-in), he will be eliminated from the competition and ranked last, without rank.\"\n\nThe last clause there, without rank, strips her of the triumphs she amassed en route to the final.\n\nCuba's Yusneylis Guzman Lopez, who lost to Vinesh in the 50kg women's freestyle wrestling semifinals, has been named as the Indian's replacement for the gold medal bout.\n\n\"Vinesh failed second day weigh-in. According to the arcticle 11 of the International Wrestling Rules, Vinesh will be replaced by the wrestler who lost against her in the Semifinal. Therefore Yusneylis Guzman Lopez (Cuba) will compete in the Final,\" said the organisers in an official statement.\n\nThe statement further mentioned that the repechage bout between the top-seeded Japanese wrestler Yui Susaki, who lost her first-ever international bout to Vinesh in the opening round, and Ukraine's Oksana Livach, who suffered a 5-7 defeat against the Indian in the quarterfinals, will now be a bronze medal match.\n\nLatest on SportstarTable Tennis Live Score, Paris 2024 Olympics: Indian women's team 1-2 vs Germany in quarterfinal as Archana wins- match updatesTeam SportstarVinesh Phogat disqualified from Paris Olympics 2024, LIVE Updates: Vinesh in hospital due to dehydration;

For her 50kg category bout, she was 100gm overweight, leading to an automatic disqualification on perhaps the biggest day of her sporting career.\n\nNo amount of pleading by Indian officials to get some more time to shed those 100gm was going to change the rules and so that's how it stayed, ending Vinesh's tale of resilience at the Olympics.\n\nShe had scripted history by becoming the first Indian woman wrestler to reach the gold medal bout on Tuesday night and before this morning, she was assured of at least a silver medal.\n\nBut she will now be coming back empty-handed. The shattered 29-year-old had to be taken to the polyclinic inside the Games village due to severe dehydration earlier in the day.\n\n\"I met Vinesh at the Olympic Village Polyclinic a short while ago and assured her of complete support of the Indian Olympic Association, Government of India and the whole country. We are providing Vinesh all medical and emotional support,\" Indian Olympic Association President P T Usha said in a statement after the stunning turn of events.\n\n\"The Wrestling Federation of India has filed an appeal to UWW to reconsider the decision to disqualify Vinesh and IOA is following that up in the strongest possible manner,\" she added.\n\nThe protests and appeals can continue but the cold fact was that Cuban wrestler Yusneylis Guzman Lopez, who lost to Vinesh in the semifinals, replaced her in the final.\n\nContingent's Chief Medical Officer Dr Dinshaw Pardiwala explained the process of weight cut and said that every possible trick was used to ensure that Vinesh could be within the prescribed limit.\n\n\"The process of weight cut involves a calculated restriction of food and water along with sweating from exercises and sauna till the morning weigh-in. This weight cut causes weakness and energy depletion, which is counter-productive to participation,\" he said.\n\n\"...for energy restoration, limited water and high energy foods are given after weigh-in. Vinesh's nutritionist had calculated this to be 1.5 kg. There sometimes is also a rebound weight gain following competition,\" he added.\n\nPardiwala revealed that Vinesh had been merely given small amounts of water to prevent dehydration after three draining bouts on Tuesday.\n\n\"Her post participation weight was found to be increased. The coach initiated the normal process of weight cut that he has always employed with Vinesh and felt confident that it would be achieved.\n\n\"All possible drastic measures, including cutting off her hair, were used. However, she was not below her allowed weight of 50kg,\" he said.\n\nInternational rules stipulate that any grappler found overweight at the time of weigh-in ends up at the bottom of the final standings.\n\nIt is particularly devastating given that she had taken down defending champion Yui Susaki of Japan en route the finals on Tuesday in a remarkable performance and was to face American Sarah Ann Hildebrandt in the summit bout this evening.\n\n\"Vinesh failed second day weigh-in. According to the article 11 of the International Wrestling Rules, Vinesh will be replaced by the wrestler who lost against her in the Semifinal. Therefore Yusneylis Guzman Lopez will compete in the Final,\" the Paris Games organising committee said in a statement.\n\n\"Repechage Yui Susaki vs Oksana Livach (Ukraine) will become Bronze Medal Match,\" it added This means, that the 50kg category will offer only one bronze medal in the Games as against the usual two, which are decided after bouts between the losing semifinalists and the two repechage round winners. Vinesh was not the only weight-related disqualification in the 50kg category.\n\nOn Tuesday, Italy's Emanuela Liuzzi was also forced to forfeit her preliminary bout after being found overweight.\n\nAccording to UWW (United World Wrestling) rules, wrestlers have the right, each in turn, to get on the scale as many times as they wish throughout the weigh-in period.\n\n\"If an athlete does not attend or fail the weigh-in (the 1st or the 2nd weigh-in), he will be eliminated of the competition and ranked last, without rank,\" the rule states.\n\nThe Indian wrestling contingent was expectedly distraught. Vinesh had stated before the Games that it would be her final outing in the quadrennial showpiece and it remains to be seen if she would change her mind after this setback.\n\n\"Everyone here is feeling as if someone in the family has died. We don't know what has struck us. Everyone is shocked,\" India's national women's coach Virender Dahiya said.\n\nCutting weight is a painful process that wrestlers have to endure if their natural body weight is higher than the division in which they compete.\n\nVinesh's natural body weight is about 56-57kg and it takes massive effort for her to get down to 50kg.\n\nWhile in invitational tournaments, UWW allows for a grace of upto 2kg, no such relaxation exists for showpieces like Olympics, the world championships and the Asian Championships.\n\nAthletes competing in contact sports go without food and even water two days before the weigh-in.\n\nBoxer Nikhat Zareen had said after her defeat in Paris that she did not take either food or water for two days to stay within the weight limit and lost strength as a result.

Whatever has happened is terrible,\" said Lalit Kumar, the Dronacharya Award-winning wrestler coach of Aman Sehrawat who will be in action later in the competition.\n\nWhy does not Phogat get a silver and cannot compete for a bronze?\n\nAs per Article 11 of the United World Wrestling (UWW) rulebook, the wrestler failing to meet the weight at the weigh-in is disqualified. If such a scenario arises in boxing, the overweight pugilist gives a walkover to the opponent, but disqualification means the erring wrestler finishes last. \"If an athlete does not attend or fail the weigh-in (the 1st or the 2nd weigh-in), he will be eliminated from the competition and ranked last,\" says the rule.\n\nWas Phogat's semi-final win legal?\n\nHer run to the semis was perfectly legal. Weigh-ins happen in the morning of all competition days and the participating wrestlers need to make weight in each weigh-in. Vinesh made the weight on Tuesday morning, following which she would have fed herself to regain energy.\n\nWhat transpired on the night between the qualification and medal rounds?\n\nIn elite competitions, the qualification and medal rounds are held on separate days to allow wrestlers enough recovery time. The wrestlers usually weigh themselves at the end of the day and Phogat would have done the same to assess what and how much she should eat. The food intake also depends on wrestlers' body type and metabolism. The next morning, the wrestlers typically wake up three hours before the scheduled weigh-in and check their weight.\n\nDepending on how much they are in excess, the coaches and physiotherapists put them to work. A mat session or a gym session is typically followed by a sauna. Skipping is another go-to method. In Paris, the weigh-in window was 15 minutes, meaning Phogat had to weigh 50kgs (or less) for those 15 minutes following which she could have replenished herself. Weigh-ins happen in the singlet and no allowance is given for the weight of the singlet.\n\nWhile in domestic competitions and even in some international events, certain weight relaxation is allowed, at the Olympics, neither boxing nor wrestling allows any such luxury. Phogat's final was scheduled about 26 hours after her previous bout, giving her time to reset and recover.\n\nIs cutting weight so tough?\n\nIt is, but over time, wrestlers and boxers find a way to do it. Phogat's maintenance weight is around 56 kg and she has been a regular 53 kg wrestler over the past five years. To stay in a caloric deficit while maintaining the required muscle mass is tough. Wrestlers stop their water intake hours before the weigh-in to get rid of the water weight, making them feel weak and irritable. Post-weigh-in, the diet is usually carb-rich, with fruit juices and bananas being the go-to option.", "source": {"uri": "hindustantimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Hindustan Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vinesh_Phogat", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Vinesh Phogat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wrestling", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Wrestling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overweight", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Overweight"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boxing", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Boxing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dronacharya_Award", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dronacharya Award"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weight_class", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Weight class"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gold medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silver", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Silver"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_World_Wrestling", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United World Wrestling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sport_of_athletics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sport of athletics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional_wrestling", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Professional wrestling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronze", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bronze"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019_World_Wrestling_Championships_\u2013_Women's_freestyle_53_kg", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "2019 World Wrestling Championships \u2013 Women's freestyle 53 kg"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skeletal_muscle", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Skeletal muscle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wrestling_singlet", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wrestling singlet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weight_cutting", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Weight cutting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sauna", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sauna"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banana", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Banana"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Metabolism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calorie", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Calorie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gym", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gym"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Wrestling", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Wrestling", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Wrestling/Amateur", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Wrestling/Amateur", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Wrestling/Backyard_Wrestling", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Wrestling/Backyard Wrestling", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Wrestling", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Wrestling", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 89}], "image": "https://images.hindustantimes.com/img/2024/08/07/1600x900/Wrestler-Vinesh-Phogat---PTI-_1723027542055.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9797610", "eventUri": "eng-9797610", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.08235294117647052, "wgt": 205, "relevance": 1}

An entire nation's hopes were crushed under the weight of 100 grams.\n\nParis, Aug 7 (PTI) An entire nation's hopes were crushed under the weight of 100 grams.\n\nWith hours to go before Vinesh Phogat's gold medal bout on Wednesday, she stood on the scales: the figures on the display were horrifying. For her 50kg category bout, she was 100gm overweight, leading to an automatic disqualification on perhaps the biggest day of her sporting career.\n\nAlso Read | Vinesh Phogat Disqualified From Paris Olympics 2024: Wrestler Remains Champion in Hearts of 1.4 Billion People, Says President Droupadi Murmu.\n\nNo amount of pleading by Indian officials to get some more time to shed those 100gm was going to change the rules and so that's how it stayed, ending Vinesh's tale of resilience at the Olympics.\n\nShe had scripted history by becoming the first Indian woman wrestler to reach the gold medal bout on Tuesday night and before this morning, she was assured of at least a silver medal.\n\nAlso Read | Pakistan Test Squad Announced: Babar Azam, Mohammad Rizwan, Shaheen Shah Afridi Retained for Bangladesh Series.\n\nBut she will now be coming back empty-handed. The shattered 29-year-old had to be taken to the polyclinic inside the Games village due to severe dehydration earlier in the day.\n\n\"I met Vinesh at the Olympic Village Polyclinic a short while ago and assured her of complete support of the Indian Olympic Association, Government of India and the whole country. We are providing Vinesh all medical and emotional support,\" Indian Olympic Association President P T Usha said in a statement after the stunning turn of events.\n\n\"The Wrestling Federation of India has filed an appeal to UWW to reconsider the decision to disqualify Vinesh and IOA is following that up in the strongest possible manner,\" she added.\n\nThe protests and appeals can continue but the cold fact was that Cuban wrestler Yusneylis Guzman Lopez, who lost to Vinesh in the semifinals, replaced her in the final.\n\nContingent's Chief Medical Officer Dr Dinshaw Pardiwala explained the process of weight cut and said that every possible trick was used to ensure that Vinesh could be within the prescribed limit.\n\n\"The process of weight cut involves a calculated restriction of food and water along with sweating from exercises and sauna till the morning weigh-in. This weight cut causes weakness and energy depletion, which is counter-productive to participation,\" he said.\n\n\"...for energy restoration, limited water and high energy foods are given after weigh-in. Vinesh's nutritionist had calculated this to be 1.5 kg. There sometimes is also a rebound weight gain following competition,\" he added.\n\nPardiwala revealed that Vinesh had been merely given small amounts of water to prevent dehydration after three draining bouts on Tuesday.\n\n\"Her post participation weight was found to be increased. The coach initiated the normal process of weight cut that he has always employed with Vinesh and felt confident that it would be achieved.\n\n\"All possible drastic measures, including cutting off her hair, were used. However, she was not below her allowed weight of 50kg,\" he said.\n\nInternational rules stipulate that any grappler found overweight at the time of weigh-in ends up at the bottom of the final standings.\n\nIt is particularly devastating given that she had taken down defending champion Yui Susaki of Japan en route the finals on Tuesday in a remarkable performance and was to face American Sarah Ann Hildebrandt in the summit bout this evening.\n\n\"Vinesh failed second day weigh-in. According to the article 11 of the International Wrestling Rules, Vinesh will be replaced by the wrestler who lost against her in the Semifinal. Therefore Yusneylis Guzman Lopez will compete in the Final,\" the Paris Games organising committee said in a statement.\n\n\"Repechage Yui Susaki vs Oksana Livach (Ukraine) will become Bronze Medal Match,\" it added\n\nThis means, that the 50kg category will offer only one bronze medal in the Games as against the usual two, which are decided after bouts between the losing semifinalists and the two repechage round winners.\n\nVinesh was not the only weight-related disqualification in the 50kg category.\n\nOn Tuesday, Italy's Emanuela Liuzzi was also forced to forfeit her preliminary bout after being found overweight.\n\nAccording to UWW (United World Wrestling) rules, wrestlers have the right, each in turn, to get on the scale as many times as they wish throughout the weigh-in period.\n\n\"If an athlete does not attend or fail the weigh-in (the 1st or the 2nd weigh-in), he will be eliminated of the competition and ranked last, without rank,\" the rule states.\n\nThe Indian wrestling contingent was expectedly distraught. Vinesh had stated before the Games that it would be her final outing in the quadrennial showpiece and it remains to be seen if she would change her mind after this setback.\n\n\"Everyone here is feeling as if someone in the family has died. We don't know what has struck us. Everyone is shocked,\" India's national women's coach Virender Dahiya said.\n\nCutting weight is a painful process that wrestlers have to endure if their natural body weight is higher than the division in which they compete.\n\nVinesh's natural body weight is about 56-57kg and it takes massive effort for her to get down to 50kg.\n\nWhile in invitational tournaments, UWW allows for a grace of upto 2kg, no such relaxation exists for showpieces like Olympics, the world championships and the Asian Championships.\n\nAthletes competing in contact sports go without food and even water two days before the weigh-in.\n\nBoxer Nikhat Zareen had said after her defeat in Paris that she did not take either food or water for two days to stay within the weight limit and lost strength as a result.", "source": {"uri": "latestly.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "LatestLY"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vinesh_Phogat", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Vinesh Phogat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_Olympic_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Indian Olympic Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wrestling", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Wrestling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gold medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Droupadi_Murmu", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Droupadi Murmu"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mohammad_Rizwan_(cricketer)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mohammad Rizwan (cricketer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_World_Wrestling", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United World Wrestling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Babar_Azam", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Babar Azam"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dehydration", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dehydration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silver_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Silver medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_cricket", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Test cricket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional_wrestling", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Professional wrestling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Village", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Olympic Village"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shaheen_Afridi", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Shaheen Afridi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pakistan", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pakistan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Pakistan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangladesh", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bangladesh"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Bangladesh"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wrestling_Federation_of_India", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Wrestling Federation of India"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yui_Susaki", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Yui Susaki"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P._T._Usha", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "P.

While Phogat's weight was within limits yesterday when she reached the final, today it was not.\n\nAccording to the rules, to be eligible for a medal, an athlete's weight must be within limits on both days; otherwise, disqualification ensues.\n\nThe Indian wrestler had come a long way to clinch her maiden Olympic medal after being at the centre of a controversy involving former Wrestling Federation of India (WFI) president Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh, who was accused of sexually harassing female athletes.\n\nPhogat was one of the athletes who protested against him in 2023, demanding his removal from the post.\n\nFrom being dragged on the streets of her country to just a match away from clinching her first Olympic medal, Phogat's journey was arduous. Tragically, she missed the opportunity due to being overweight.", "source": {"uri": "assamtribune.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "assamtribune.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vinesh_Phogat", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Vinesh Phogat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wrestling", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Wrestling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wrestling_at_the_2019_European_Games_\u2013_Women's_freestyle_50_kg", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wrestling at the 2019 European Games \u2013 Women's freestyle 50 kg"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yui_Susaki", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Yui Susaki"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sport_of_athletics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sport of athletics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gold medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional_wrestling", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Professional wrestling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guwahati", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Guwahati"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Guwahati"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Japan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cuba", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cuba"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Cuba"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wrestling_Federation_of_India", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wrestling Federation of India"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brij_Bhushan_Sharan_Singh", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_harassment", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sexual harassment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Olympic Games"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Wrestling", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Wrestling", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Wrestling/Amateur", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Wrestling/Amateur", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Martial_Arts/Sumo", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Martial Arts/Sumo", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally_Challenged", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally Challenged", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 87}], "image": "https://assamtribune.com/h-upload/2024/08/07/1644165-vinesh-phogat.webp", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9797610", "eventUri": "eng-9797610", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Guwahati"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-07", "textStart": 10, "textEnd": 18}], "sentiment": 0.09019607843137245, "wgt": 162, "relevance": 1}

Phogat could not compete because she was 50 grams above the limits. Such is the situation wherein the basics of weight management in competitive sports are questioned. Experts and trainers assert that this is to a small degree of weight reduction and can be achieved and taken place before as well. For example, Indian female boxer Mary Kom has resorted to weight manipulation on dozens of occasions before fights.\n\nMary Kom faced a similar problem while participating in an open boxing championship in Poland where she had entered with 2 kgs more than her category. Afraid of being disqualified, she lost 2 kgs overnight to make it for the weigh-in. Though wrestling is different from boxing, the rules, and weight manipulation are totally related.\n\nMost of athletes use different techniques to reduce their weight within a very short period by subjecting themselves to heavy exercise and, in addition, putting on special attires that make the body sweat more. FTB suits are put on that increase the amount of heat output by the body. Among other ways of reducing weight, an athlete visits a bathroom several times to flush out excess water in the body.\n\nAlso Read: 'Come Back Stronger...': PM Narendra Modi On Vinesh Phogat's Disqualification\n\nThe big challenge for Phogat was the restriction on time for weight checks. Wrestlers are weighed before their respective matches and if they are competing on successive days they are weighed each day. On the day of the match, their weight is also measured in the morning. Wrestlers in the past had 30 minutes to trim down for the first weigh-in, but nowadays it is only 15 minutes for the other subsequent checks.", "source": {"uri": "news24online.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "News24"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vinesh_Phogat", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Vinesh Phogat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mary_Kom", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Mary Kom"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wrestling", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Wrestling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boxing", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Boxing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poland", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Poland"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Poland"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sport_of_athletics", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sport of athletics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narendra_Modi", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Narendra Modi"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Wrestling", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Wrestling", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Wrestling/Amateur", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Wrestling/Amateur", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Wrestling", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Wrestling", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Martial_Arts/Sumo", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Martial Arts/Sumo", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 71}], "image": "https://news24online.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Weight-controversy-after-Vinesh-Phogat-disqualification-1.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9797610", "eventUri": "eng-9797610", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.04313725490196074, "wgt": 156, "relevance": 1}

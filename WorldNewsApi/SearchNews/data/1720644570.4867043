The wedding took place across two days and was a fusion of cultures, as Zarah is half Pakistani and Rob is half Zambian. The couple met in Cardiff through a mutual friend back in 2021 and they connected instantly. Rob proposed two years later in a cave in Cappadocia, Turkey. \u201cThere were candles everywhere, a violinist was playing, and rose petals spelled out \u2018Will you marry me\u2019. Rob was down on one knee waiting for me as I entered the cave,\u201d Zarah recalls. \u201cOur wedding was nothing less of a fairytale either. Two days filled with love, joy, laughter and fun, surrounded by friends, family and loved ones. We did a traditional Pakistani wedding on day one, with 300 guests, at Vela Restaurant in Dublin. Irish Dholis, DJ Mayank and Bhanushal Prachi dancers brought the Bollywood element to the occasion,\u201d Zarah adds. Day two was held at Luttrellstown Castle, outside Dublin. \u201cWe had the Welsh and Irish flags flying high,\u201d Zarah continues. \u201cA harpist and cello player set a more classical mood during the ceremony and reception, and later on Tommy Sax fused pop songs with Bollywood tracks.\u201d Later in the evening the night sky was lit by silent fireworks and guests danced the night away to DJ Mayank\u2019s tunes.

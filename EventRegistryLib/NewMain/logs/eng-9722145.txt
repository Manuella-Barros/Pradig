What will matter is how they respond to pressure when the spotlight is on.\n\nWill they end up shining as brightly as a Usain Bolt or Carl Lewis, whose knack for performing when Olympic gold medals were at stake turned them into larger-than-life icons?\n\nOr will they be more like Jamaican sprinter Shericka Jackson and American hurdler Grant Holloway, among the best performers of their generation but still looking to parlay all that talent into a spot at the top of the Olympic podium?\n\n''Right now, I do not hold a gold medal in the Olympics,'' said Lyles, who counts the bronze medal he won in the 200 meters at the Tokyo Games among his biggest disappointments. ''I have multiple world championships, and national championships, as well. The only one that's missing from the list is an Olympic gold. And I'm planning on leaving with a lot of those.''\n\nThe dramas involving Richardson, Lyles and everyone else will play out in 48 events spread over 10 days, with most of the action taking place at the Stade de France, starting Aug. 2. As an added bonus, there will be a bonus: a first-of-its-kind $50,000 payout to all 48 gold medalists, courtesy of World Athletics, the organization that runs global track.\n\nThe near 2,200 athletes competing in the Olympics' biggest sport are well aware that the money is great, but the gold medal brings an air of immortality that only an Olympic title can.\n\n''The moment only comes once every four years,'' Holloway said. ''If you're not training to be an Olympic gold medalist, then what the hell are you doing? That's my mentality.''\n\nRichardson's first Olympics\n\nRichardson makes her Olympic debut after her much-discussed absence from the last Olympics due to a positive marijuana test.\n\nHer current form, her status as the reigning world champion, along with the absence of two-time defending champion Elaine Thompson-Herah, all make Richardson the sprinter to beat in the women's 100. But it won't be a gimme.\n\nShelly-Ann Fraser-Pryce is heading to her fifth (and final) Olympics and has won this race twice. Jackson is a 200 specialist (see below) but also one of the fastest in the world at this distance.\n\nLyles tries to win the sprint double\n\nLyles attributes a lot of his bad finish in 2021 to depression that kept him from focusing . That race is the only 200-meter sprint he's lost at a major championship.\n\nBy the time the 200 final comes around on Aug. 8, the 100 will be in the rearview mirror and we'll know if Lyles has a chance to complete a sprint double, a la Bolt, and Lewis before him. Lyles is the reigning world champ at 100, but he's less seasoned at that distance.\n\nJust last month, another Jamaican, Kishane Thompson, ran 9.77 to head into his first Olympics with the world's best time. Also, Jamaica's Oblique Seville beat Lyles head-to-head at a meet in Kingston in June. But a tune-up in Kingston and the Olympics in Paris are two different animals.\n\nDistance demons\n\nIn Tokyo, Sifan Hassan of the Netherlands pulled off one of the most amazing feat s in Olympic history by winning medals in the 1,500 (bronze), 5,000 (gold) and 10,000 meters (gold).\n\nShe's coming back for more, and has even floated the idea that she might do those three, then add the marathon, which takes place on the last day of the Olympics, to her schedule.\n\n''I will decide a week before,'' Hassan said in a recent interview. ''Maybe I'm gonna have great training somehow, somewhere.''\n\nAs always, Hassan, and her quest for medals, will face a stern challenge Faith Kipyegon of Kenya, who is the reigning world champion at 1,500 and 5,000 meters. Kipyegon broke her own world record at 1,500 in an Olympic tune-up this month, finishing in 3:49.04.\n\nHolloway's bad race\n\nHolloway is a three-time world champion in the 110 hurdles, and a favorite to win on Aug. 8. He was a favorite three years ago in Tokyo too, but weakened down the stretch, and fell to Hansle Parchment of Jamaica.\n\nHolloway is 9-3 in head-to-head matchups with Parchment, and even 2-1 against him at the Olympics. But the two victories came in preliminary rounds and that loss came with the gold medal on the line.\n\nJackson's bad day\n\nJackson is the only woman other than the late Florence Griffith Joyner to run the 200 meters in 21.48 or faster. So, why hasn't most of the world heard of her?\n\nAt the last Olympics, she put on the brakes too early in her opening heat, finished fourth and never even got to race in the final for the gold. It's a mistake she called the most devastating of her career, and one that has fueled her run to Paris.\n\nNow, more trouble. She failed to finish a July 9 tune-up race in Hungary, and it was unclear if she is healthy going into the Olympics. If Jackson isn't in the lineup, American Gabby Thomas, who comes in with this year's fastest time (21.78) and a bronze medal from Tokyo, would be the clear favorite.\n\nJumping for Ukraine\n\nAnyone who says sports and politics do not intersect might want to tune in Aug. 4, when Ukrainian high jumper Yaroslava Mahuchikh takes the field.\n\nMahuchikh is coming in just a few weeks after breaking a 37-year-old world record in her event, jumping 2.10 meters at an Olympic tune-up in Paris.\n\nWorld Athletics has not allowed Russians in international meets since the war with Ukraine broke out. It means Maria Lasitskene will not be on hand to defend her Olympic title. Lasitskene also wasn't present last year when Mahuchikh won the title on an emotional closing day at world championships.\n\n___\n\nAP Summer Olympics:

That race is the only 200-meter sprint he's lost at a major championship.\n\nBy the time the 200 final comes around on Aug. 8, the 100 will be in the rearview mirror and we'll know if Lyles has a chance to complete a sprint double, a la Bolt, and Lewis before him. Lyles is the reigning world champ at 100, but he's less seasoned at that distance.\n\nJust last month, another Jamaican, Kishane Thompson, ran 9.77 to head into his first Olympics with the world's best time. Also, Jamaica's Oblique Seville beat Lyles head-to-head at a meet in Kingston in June. But a tune-up in Kingston and the Olympics in Paris are two different animals.\n\nDistance demons\n\nIn Tokyo, Sifan Hassan of the Netherlands pulled off one of the most amazing feat s in Olympic history by winning medals in the 1,500 (bronze), 5,000 (gold) and 10,000 meters (gold).\n\nShe's coming back for more, and has even floated the idea that she might do those three, then add the marathon, which takes place on the last day of the Olympics, to her schedule.\n\n\"I will decide a week before,\" Hassan said in a recent interview. \"Maybe I'm gonna have great training somehow, somewhere.\"\n\nAs always, Hassan, and her quest for medals, will face a stern challenge Faith Kipyegon of Kenya, who is the reigning world champion at 1,500 and 5,000 meters. Kipyegon broke her own world record at 1,500 in an Olympic tune-up this month, finishing in 3:49.04.\n\nHolloway's bad race\n\nHolloway is a three-time world champion in the 110 hurdles, and a favorite to win on Aug. 8. He was a favorite three years ago in Tokyo too, but weakened down the stretch, and fell to Hansle Parchment of Jamaica.\n\nHolloway is 9-3 in head-to-head matchups with Parchment, and even 2-1 against him at the Olympics. But the two victories came in preliminary rounds and that loss came with the gold medal on the line.\n\nJackson's bad day\n\nJackson is the only woman other than the late Florence Griffith Joyner to run the 200 meters in 21.48 or faster. So, why hasn't most of the world heard of her?\n\nAt the last Olympics, she put on the brakes too early in her opening heat, finished fourth and never even got to race in the final for the gold. It's a mistake she called the most devastating of her career, and one that has fueled her run to Paris.\n\nNow, more trouble. She failed to finish a July 9 tune-up race in Hungary, and it was unclear if she is healthy going into the Olympics. If Jackson isn't in the lineup, American Gabby Thomas, who comes in with this year's fastest time (21.78) and a bronze medal from Tokyo, would be the clear favorite.\n\nJumping for Ukraine\n\nAnyone who says sports and politics do not intersect might want to tune in Aug. 4, when Ukrainian high jumper Yaroslava Mahuchikh takes the field.\n\nMahuchikh is coming in just a few weeks after breaking a 37-year-old world record in her event, jumping 2.10 meters at an Olympic tune-up in Paris.\n\nWorld Athletics has not allowed Russians in international meets since the war with Ukraine broke out. It means Maria Lasitskene will not be on hand to defend her Olympic title. Lasitskene also wasn't present last year when Mahuchikh won the title on an emotional closing day at world championships.\n\nAP Summer Olympics: https://apnews.com/hub/2024-paris-olympic-games",

What will matter is how they respond to pressure when the spotlight is on.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWill they end up shining as brightly as a Usain Bolt or Carl Lewis, whose knack for performing when Olympic gold medals were at stake turned them into larger-than-life icons?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOr will they be more like Jamaican sprinter Shericka Jackson and American hurdler Grant Holloway, among the best performers of their generation but still looking to parlay all that talent into a spot at the top of the Olympic podium?\n\nSports Roundup\n\nGet the latest D-FW sports news, analysis, scores and more.\n\nSIGN UP\n\nOr with:\n\nGoogleFacebook\n\nBy signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy\n\n\"Right now, I do not hold a gold medal in the Olympics,\" said Lyles, who counts the bronze medal he won in the 200 meters at the Tokyo Games among his biggest disappointments. \"I have multiple world championships, and national championships, as well. The only one that's missing from the list is an Olympic gold. And I'm planning on leaving with a lot of those.\"\n\nThe dramas involving Richardson, Lyles and everyone else will play out in 48 events spread over 10 days, with most of the action taking place at the Stade de France, starting Aug. 2. As an added bonus, there will be a bonus: a first-of-its-kind $50,000 payout to all 48 gold medalists, courtesy of World Athletics, the organization that runs global track.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe near 2,200 athletes competing in the Olympics' biggest sport are well aware that the money is great, but the gold medal brings an air of immortality that only an Olympic title can.\n\n\"The moment only comes once every four years,\" Holloway said. \"If you're not training to be an Olympic gold medalist, then what the hell are you doing? That's my mentality.\"\n\nRichardson's first Olympics\n\nRichardson makes her Olympic debut after her much-discussed absence from the last Olympics due to a positive marijuana test.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHer current form, her status as the reigning world champion, along with the absence of two-time defending champion Elaine Thompson-Herah, all make Richardson the sprinter to beat in the women's 100. But it won't be a gimme.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShelly-Ann Fraser-Pryce is heading to her fifth (and final) Olympics and has won this race twice.

There are big races, and then there are the Olympics.\n\nParis, Jul 10 (AP) There are big races, and then there are the Olympics.\n\nWhen Sha'Carri Richardson, Noah Lyles and all the other fastest runners and best jumpers and throwers of 2024 line up for the Olympic track and field meet, little of what they've done on the road to Paris will mean much. What will matter is how they respond to pressure when the spotlight is on.\n\nAlso Read | Kylian Mbappe Set To Wear Number 9 Jersey in His First Season for Real Madrid, Club Makes Announcement.\n\nWill they end up shining as brightly as a Usain Bolt or Carl Lewis, whose knack for performing when Olympic gold medals were at stake turned them into larger-than-life icons?\n\nOr will they be more like Jamaican sprinter Shericka Jackson and American hurdler Grant Holloway, among the best performers of their generation but still looking to parlay all that talent into a spot at the top of the Olympic podium?\n\nAlso Read | When is Paris Olympics 2024 Start Date? How Long Will Summer Games Last in France? Know Schedule Details.\n\n\"Right now, I do not hold a gold medal in the Olympics,\" said Lyles, who counts the bronze medal he won in the 200 meters at the Tokyo Games among his biggest disappointments. \"I have multiple world championships, and national championships, as well. The only one that's missing from the list is an Olympic gold. And I'm planning on leaving with a lot of those.\"\n\nThe dramas involving Richardson, Lyles and everyone else will play out in 48 events spread over 10 days, with most of the action taking place at the Stade de France, starting Aug. 2. As an added bonus, there will be a bonus: a first-of-its-kind $50,000 payout to all 48 gold medalists, courtesy of World Athletics, the organization that runs global track.\n\nThe near 2,200 athletes competing in the Olympics' biggest sport are well aware that the money is great, but the gold medal brings an air of immortality that only an Olympic title can.\n\n\"The moment only comes once every four years,\" Holloway said. \"If you're not training to be an Olympic gold medalist, then what the hell are you doing? That's my mentality.\"\n\nRichardson's first OlympicsRichardson makes her Olympic debut after her much-discussed absence from the last Olympics due to a positive marijuana test.\n\nHer current form, her status as the reigning world champion, along with the absence of two-time defending champion Elaine Thompson-Herah, all make Richardson the sprinter to beat in the women's 100. But it won't be a gimme.\n\nShelly-Ann Fraser-Pryce is heading to her fifth (and final) Olympics and has won this race twice. Jackson is a 200 specialist (see below) but also one of the fastest in the world at this distance.\n\nLyles tries to win the sprint doubleLyles attributes a lot of his bad finish in 2021 to depression that kept him from focusing . That race is the only 200-meter sprint he's lost at a major championship.\n\nBy the time the 200 final comes around on Aug. 8, the 100 will be in the rearview mirror and we'll know if Lyles has a chance to complete a sprint double, a la Bolt, and Lewis before him. Lyles is the reigning world champ at 100, but he's less seasoned at that distance.\n\nJust last month, another Jamaican, Kishane Thompson, ran 9.77 to head into his first Olympics with the world's best time. Also, Jamaica's Oblique Seville beat Lyles head-to-head at a meet in Kingston in June. But a tune-up in Kingston and the Olympics in Paris are two different animals.\n\nDistance demonsIn Tokyo, Sifan Hassan of the Netherlands pulled off one of the most amazing feat s in Olympic history by winning medals in the 1,500 (bronze), 5,000 (gold) and 10,000 meters (gold).\n\nShe's coming back for more, and has even floated the idea that she might do those three, then add the marathon, which takes place on the last day of the Olympics, to her schedule.\n\n\"I will decide a week before,\" Hassan said in a recent interview. \"Maybe I'm gonna have great training somehow, somewhere.\"\n\nAs always, Hassan, and her quest for medals, will face a stern challenge Faith Kipyegon of Kenya, who is the reigning world champion at 1,500 and 5,000 meters. Kipyegon broke her own world record at 1,500 in an Olympic tune-up this month, finishing in 3:49.04.\n\nHolloway's bad raceHolloway is a three-time world champion in the 110 hurdles, and a favorite to win on Aug. 8. He was a favorite three years ago in Tokyo too, but weakened down the stretch, and fell to Hansle Parchment of Jamaica.\n\nHolloway is 9-3 in head-to-head matchups with Parchment, and even 2-1 against him at the Olympics. But the two victories came in preliminary rounds and that loss came with the gold medal on the line.\n\nJackson is the only woman other than the late Florence Griffith Joyner to run the 200 meters in 21.48 or faster. So, why hasn't most of the world heard of her?\n\nAt the last Olympics, she put on the brakes too early in her opening heat, finished fourth and never even got to race in the final for the gold. It's a mistake she called the most devastating of her career, and one that has fueled her run to Paris.\n\nNow, more trouble. She failed to finish a July 9 tune-up race in Hungary, and it was unclear if she is healthy going into the Olympics. If Jackson isn't in the lineup, American Gabby Thomas, who comes in with this year's fastest time (21.78) and a bronze medal from Tokyo, would be the clear favorite.\n\nJumping for UkraineAnyone who says sports and politics do not intersect might want to tune in Aug. 4, when Ukrainian high jumper Yaroslava Mahuchikh takes the field.\n\nMahuchikh is coming in just a few weeks after breaking a 37-year-old world record in her event, jumping 2.10 meters at an Olympic tune-up in Paris.

What will matter is how they respond to pressure when the spotlight is on.\n\nWill they end up shining as brightly as a Usain Bolt or Carl Lewis, whose knack for performing when Olympic gold medals were at stake turned them into larger-than-life icons?\n\nOr will they be more like Jamaican sprinter Shericka Jackson and American hurdler Grant Holloway, among the best performers of their generation but still looking to parlay all that talent into a spot at the top of the Olympic podium?\n\n\"Right now, I do not hold a gold medal in the Olympics,\" said Lyles, who counts the bronze medal he won in the 200 meters at the Tokyo Games among his biggest disappointments. \"I have multiple world championships, and national championships, as well. The only one that's missing from the list is an Olympic gold. And I'm planning on leaving with a lot of those.\"\n\nThe dramas involving Richardson, Lyles and everyone else will play out in 48 events spread over 10 days, with most of the action taking place at the Stade de France, starting Aug. 2. As an added bonus, there will be a bonus: a first-of-its-kind $50,000 payout to all 48 gold medalists, courtesy of World Athletics, the organization that runs global track.\n\nThe near 2,200 athletes competing in the Olympics' biggest sport are well aware that the money is great, but the gold medal brings an air of immortality that only an Olympic title can.\n\n\"The moment only comes once every four years,\" Holloway said. \"If you're not training to be an Olympic gold medalist, then what the hell are you doing? That's my mentality.\"\n\nRichardson makes her Olympic debut after her much-discussed absence from the last Olympics due to a positive marijuana test.\n\nHer current form, her status as the reigning world champion, along with the absence of two-time defending champion Elaine Thompson-Herah, all make Richardson the sprinter to beat in the women's 100. But it won't be a gimme.\n\nShelly-Ann Fraser-Pryce is heading to her fifth (and final) Olympics and has won this race twice. Jackson is a 200 specialist (see below) but also one of the fastest in the world at this distance.\n\nLyles attributes a lot of his bad finish in 2021 to depression that kept him from focusing . That race is the only 200-meter sprint he's lost at a major championship.\n\nBy the time the 200 final comes around on Aug. 8, the 100 will be in the rearview mirror and we'll know if Lyles has a chance to complete a sprint double, a la Bolt, and Lewis before him. Lyles is the reigning world champ at 100, but he's less seasoned at that distance.\n\nJust last month, another Jamaican, Kishane Thompson, ran 9.77 to head into his first Olympics with the world's best time. Also, Jamaica's Oblique Seville beat Lyles head-to-head at a meet in Kingston in June. But a tune-up in Kingston and the Olympics in Paris are two different animals.\n\nIn Tokyo, Sifan Hassan of the Netherlands pulled off one of the most amazing feat s in Olympic history by winning medals in the 1,500 (bronze), 5,000 (gold) and 10,000 meters (gold).\n\nShe's coming back for more, and has even floated the idea that she might do those three, then add the marathon, which takes place on the last day of the Olympics, to her schedule.\n\n\"I will decide a week before,\" Hassan said in a recent interview. \"Maybe I'm gonna have great training somehow, somewhere.\"\n\nAs always, Hassan, and her quest for medals, will face a stern challenge Faith Kipyegon of Kenya, who is the reigning world champion at 1,500 and 5,000 meters. Kipyegon broke her own world record at 1,500 in an Olympic tune-up this month, finishing in 3:49.04.\n\nHolloway is a three-time world champion in the 110 hurdles, and a favorite to win on Aug. 8. He was a favorite three years ago in Tokyo too, but weakened down the stretch, and fell to Hansle Parchment of Jamaica.\n\nHolloway is 9-3 in head-to-head matchups with Parchment, and even 2-1 against him at the Olympics. But the two victories came in preliminary rounds and that loss came with the gold medal on the line.\n\nJackson is the only woman other than the late Florence Griffith Joyner to run the 200 meters in 21.48 or faster. So, why hasn't most of the world heard of her?\n\nAt the last Olympics, she put on the brakes too early in her opening heat, finished fourth and never even got to race in the final for the gold. It's a mistake she called the most devastating of her career, and one that has fueled her run to Paris.\n\nNow, more trouble. She failed to finish a July 9 tune-up race in Hungary, and it was unclear if she is healthy going into the Olympics. If Jackson isn't in the lineup, American Gabby Thomas, who comes in with this year's fastest time (21.78) and a bronze medal from Tokyo, would be the clear favorite.\n\nAnyone who says sports and politics do not intersect might want to tune in Aug. 4, when Ukrainian high jumper Yaroslava Mahuchikh takes the field.\n\nMahuchikh is coming in just a few weeks after breaking a 37-year-old world record in her event, jumping 2.10 meters at an Olympic tune-up in Paris.\n\nWorld Athletics has not allowed Russians in international meets since the war with Ukraine broke out. It means Maria Lasitskene will not be on hand to defend her Olympic title. Lasitskene also wasn't present last year when Mahuchikh won the title on an emotional closing day at world championships.", "source": {"uri": "apnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "AP NEWS"},

While the 200-meter sprint is highly anticipated, the 100-meter event has gained significant attention following impressive performances at national Olympic Trials, particularly from Jamaica and the US, where athletes like Kishane Thompson, have set high expectations.\n\nAccording to the World Athletics' official website, eliminating Christian Coleman, who is the fifth fastest man in the aforementioned category but did not qualify for the Olympics, here are the top five 100-meter runners to watch during the big tournament in Paris.\n\nWhile the entire world was focused on the US Olympic Trials, it quickly shifted to the Jamaican Olympic Trials. Kishane Thompson's heat time of 9.82 made him the second-fastest guy in the 100 meters. In the semi-finals of the same division, the athlete ran a 9.84, stunning everyone with his form. The best was yet to come, as in the finals he faced Oblique Seville, who had upset Noah Lyles at the Racers Grand Prix before the Jamaican Olympic Trials.\n\nThis time, however, Oblique attempted to outpace Kishane, but the 22-year-old simply jogged past him and even slowed down in the final 60 meters, being sure not to expose his full speed yet, registering an electrifying 9.77. This established a significant milestone in the sport for the Olympic season, and even Noah Lyles was taken aback by the timing of his new Jamaican competitor.\n\nMany questions lingered about Kenyan sprinter Ferdinand Omanyala, as he was unable to break the optimum 10-second mark this season, and when he did, he only finished second at the Prefontaine Classic with a 9.98. He arrived for the Kenyan Olympic Trials with little anticipation from the crowd, as he was already dominant in his nation's races.\n\nHe breezed through the heat with an average time of 10.09 and advanced to the finals. However, in the last round, he sprinted and outpaced every other athlete on the grid by many lengths, crossing the finish line in a scorching 9.79. It astounded everyone, and all critics were silenced by this blistering run.\n\nOblique Seville has raced on bigger venues previously, and the Jamaican crowd cheered as he overcame Noah Lyles in the Racers Grand Prix with a 9.82. There were high expectations for him, and he delivered, as the young athlete demonstrated excellent raw pace in the Jamaican Olympic Trials.\n\nHowever, in the finals of the 100-meter sprint, he matched his own fastest time of 9.82 seconds, falling only 0.05 seconds short of Kishane Thompson. With the silver medal around his neck, he plans to win the coveted gold on the bigger stage, which every Jamaican fan is looking forward to.\n\nNoah Lyles has made grandiose claims about his timing since the start of the 2024 season, claiming that he will set the 200-meter world record in 19.10. However, it will not be an effortless task, since Usain Bolt's 19.19 has stood firm since the 2009 Berlin World Championships. But the six-time world champion is not only focused on one category; he also aims to surpass the Jamaican icon for the most gold medals in a single Olympic event.\n\nHis expectations are great, and at the US Olympic Trials, he demonstrated that he is the fastest American man this season in the 100 meters, winning the final with a 9.83. He was undoubtedly beaten by the Jamaicans, but it is not yet the Olympics, and in track and field, outcomes can vary greatly in a short period of time.\n\nMany track legends point to Kenny Bednarek's 200-meter runs as examples of consistency. However, due to the Olympic Games, the athlete turned his focus to the 100 meters, and he was not disappointed.\n\nIn all categories, he has been undoubtedly behind Noah Lyles, but this has made him a strong rival, as he has consistently forced the six-time world champion to race faster than his regular pace. Bednarek finished second in the US Olympic Trials with a 9.87, but with this run, he set a new track and field record for his own career, and he will be expected to run quicker in the Paris Olympics.", "source": {"uri": "thesportsrush.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The SportsRush"}, "authors": [{"uri": "rahul_goutam_hoom@thesportsrush.com", "name": "Rahul Goutam Hoom", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamaica", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jamaica"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Jamaica"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sport_of_athletics", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Sport of athletics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noah_Lyles", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Noah Lyles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oblique_Seville", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Oblique Seville"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Athletics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "World Athletics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_Coleman", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Christian Coleman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stade_de_France", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stade de France"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/200_metres", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "200 metres"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/100_metres", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "100 metres"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ferdinand_Omanyala", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ferdinand Omanyala"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prefontaine_Classic", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Prefontaine Classic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/60_metres", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "60 metres"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gold medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sprint_(running)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sprint (running)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenny_Bednarek", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kenny Bednarek"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Athletics_Championships", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "World Athletics Championships"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_record", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "World record"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usain_Bolt", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Usain Bolt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silver_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Silver medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Track_and_field", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Track and field"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Olympic Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berlin", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Berlin"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Berlin"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Track_and_Field/Athletes", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Track and Field/Athletes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Antiques_and_Collectibles/Pins", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Antiques and Collectibles/Pins", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally_Challenged", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally Challenged", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://cdn-wp.thesportsrush.com/2024/07/569b7173-untitled-design-6.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9722145", "eventUri": "eng-9722145", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2862745098039217, "wgt": 187, "relevance": 1}

Noah Lyles undoubtedly dominated the field, but he was followed by a prancing Kenny Bednarek, who finished just 0.06 seconds behind him.\n\nThis remarkable sprinting display has astounded track superstars Justin Gatlin and Rodney Green. They addressed how these two athletes consistently exceed the expectations of the public at track meets in the Tidal League podcast, Ready Set Go.\n\nWhen the former Bahamian sprinter asked the four-time world champion about his thoughts on the 200-meter races at the US Olympic Trials, he simply stated that they went as expected. Gatlin goes on to say that Bednarek could have easily won the finals because of how he started the race, but when it came down to the final stretch's last 50-60 meters, Noah charged with all of his conserved pace and won by such a narrow margin.\n\nHe also notes that Lyles' semi-final success helped the athlete's mental state by giving him the confidence to carry the same form into the final. After Gatlin's take on the US Olympic Trials, Green mentions a new Kenny Bednarek who they saw after the event, saying:\n\n\"When they interviewed those guys, I think that's the most emotion I've seen from Kenny on TV ever in life, because he always just looks like 'yes, thank you,' you know one word answers, you know what I mean, open and s***, but that boy cussed on National Television...'I'm on your a***'\"\n\nJustin Gatlin was taken aback by this revelation, as he had no idea about the post-race interviews. The Bahamian sprinter goes on to say that he doesn't believe Kenny's statement was meant for his teammate, but he wanted to win the finals, so he pursued down the six-time world champion even though he was surpassed with 50-60 meters left in the race.\n\nGreen adds that, despite Noah's invincibility in the 200-meter sprints, he now has his own USATF teammate to defeat, since Kenny is one of the athletes with the ability to beat the six-time world champion and shatter his goals.\n\nAll of this heated track rivalry gets the track legend thrilled for the forthcoming Paris Olympics since winning gold will not be as straightforward as Lyles expects. Gatlin also explains how both athletes are passionate about anime and how the motivation they get from viewing those shows drives them to push themselves even farther beyond their current limits.\n\nThis entire scenario is creating a new benchmark in track and field, and it will be an excellent year for sports, with athletes like these two competing at their absolute peak. While Kenny Bednarek is already posing a challenge to the three-time world champion in the 200 meters, he has two Jamaican challengers to contend with in the 100-meter sprint.\n\nIn track and field, American athletes have always had to defeat Jamaicans to win the flashy gold medal at the Olympic Games. The classic rivalry between the two North American countries has propelled the sport to new heights, and this year, Noah Lyles will face two new competitors in the 100-meter men's category: Oblique Seville and Kishane Thompson.\n\nThe six-time world champion, Noah Lyles entered the 2024 Racers Grand Prix with high aspirations of securing the world lead as well as winning, but both were dashed by Oblique Seville, who won the race with a blazing 9.82.\n\nHowever, when he was the favorite in the 100-meter sprint finals at the Jamaican Olympic Trials, Seville witnessed a 22-year-old Kishane Thompson dashing ahead of him and slowing down before the finish line to win the finals with a 9.77, establishing a new world lead. These two will pose a significant threat to the American's gold medal chances since Lyles' current personal best in the aforementioned category is 9.83.", "source": {"uri": "thesportsrush.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The SportsRush"}, "authors": [{"uri": "rahul_goutam_hoom@thesportsrush.com", "name": "Rahul Goutam Hoom", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenny_Bednarek", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kenny Bednarek"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noah_Lyles", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Noah Lyles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justin_Gatlin", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Justin Gatlin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sprint_(running)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sprint (running)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Athletics_Championships", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "World Athletics Championships"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Bahamas", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "The Bahamas"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "The Bahamas"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Instagram"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USA_Track_&_Field", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "USA Track & Field"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gold medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Track_and_field", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Track and field"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oblique_Seville", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Oblique Seville"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Prix_motorcycle_racing", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Grand Prix motorcycle racing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/200_metres", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "200 metres"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/100_metres", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "100 metres"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_America", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "North America"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Olympic Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seville", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Seville"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Seville"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamaica", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jamaica"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Jamaica"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Track_and_Field", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Track and Field", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Track_and_Field/Running", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Track and Field/Running", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Track_and_Field/Athletes", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Track and Field/Athletes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally_Challenged", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally Challenged", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 83}], "image": "https://cdn-wp.thesportsrush.com/2024/07/6270fccf-untitled-design-3.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9722145", "eventUri": "eng-9722145", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.5686274509803921, "wgt": 182, "relevance": 1}

Such was the case for Jamaica's two sprint queens, Shericka Jackson and Shelly-Ann Fraser Pryce, who both had slow starts in their season openers.\n\nHowever, their entire viewpoint has altered since the Jamaican Olympic Trials, when both of them secured tickets to the Paris Olympics in their respective categories.\n\nThis shift in community perception caught the attention of Justin Gatlin and Rodney Green, who subsequently discussed the two Jamaican athletes on their Tidal League Podcast on the Ready Set Go YouTube channel.\n\nRight after starting the discussion, the Bahamian sprinter Rodney Green, congratulates Shelly-Ann, affectionately known as \"Mommy Rocket,\" on shutting down all of her critics as she prepares for her final track and field season and the Olympic Games. She began the year late, but despite a limited number of races, she qualified for the main event in the 100-meter division.\n\nJustin Gatlin offers similar pointers as Green, and he hopes that the athlete's esteemed track career ends gracefully. Green goes on to explain her overall plan behind such a performance at the Jamaican Olympic Trials, saying:\n\n\"I think that was her plan. Her plan wasn't to go out there and win, and...she was like, 'You know, yeah, I'mma try to win, but if I don't, that's fine. I just need to buy some time.' That's it.\"\n\nGatlin then discusses Shericka, noting that the athlete was considerably ahead of her Jamaican teammate and appeared to be in excellent shape before the Paris Olympics.\n\nHe also explains that her start to the season was certainly poor, but the 10.84 in the 100-meter Olympic Trials finals was the performance she required, and that she will improve it even further in the days leading up to the race with her training regimen.\n\nThe Bahamian sprinter believes that, while Elaine Thompson-Herah will not be present to defend her accolade, these qualified competitors will approach the contest with the same goal in mind: to bring home the gold medal for their country.\n\nWhile the Jamaican Olympic Trials astounded the track luminaries, they had a similar assessment of the country's rivals, who also demonstrated athletic prowess.\n\nAfter all of the Olympic Trials, the track community will have to wait to witness the usual American-Jamaican rivalry in the sport. In the women's division, Sha'Carri Richardson of the United States is chasing the 100-meter Olympic gold medal, much as Jamaica's Shericka Jackson is. Richardson did not qualify for the 200-meter event, but she remains motivated and confident in her 100-meter results.\n\nJustin Gatlin was caught off guard by Sha'Carri's dominance, as she ran a remarkable 10.71 in the finals, despite slowing down in the final few meters of the race. This causes her to conceal additional abilities that she intends to unleash at the Paris Olympics, as she will need to focus on the primary event, much like her competitors.", "source": {"uri": "thesportsrush.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The SportsRush"}, "authors": [{"uri": "rahul_goutam_hoom@thesportsrush.com", "name": "Rahul Goutam Hoom", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sprint_(running)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sprint (running)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamaica", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jamaica"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Jamaica"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shelly-Ann_Fraser-Pryce", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Shelly-Ann Fraser-Pryce"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justin_Gatlin", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Justin Gatlin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Track_and_field", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Track and field"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shericka_Jackson", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Shericka Jackson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omega_SA", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Omega SA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Instagram"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YouTube", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "YouTube"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Bahamas", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Bahamas"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "The Bahamas"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sport_of_athletics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sport of athletics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Olympic Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elaine_Thompson-Herah", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Elaine Thompson-Herah"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sha'Carri_Richardson", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sha'Carri Richardson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Olympic medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gold medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Track_and_Field/Athletes", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Track and Field/Athletes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Antiques_and_Collectibles/Pins", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Antiques and Collectibles/Pins", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally_Challenged", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally Challenged", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 77}], "image": "https://cdn-wp.thesportsrush.com/2024/06/87d8e8b4-untitled-design-20.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9722145", "eventUri": "eng-9722145", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2862745098039217, "wgt": 161, "relevance": 1}

In the Ready Set Go podcast on YouTube, Justin Gatlin wanted to know Rodney Green's 4\u00d7100-meter relay squad for the coveted race, and the way the Bahamian sprinter announced his team startled the retired four-time world champion.\n\nThe two track legends are well-known for their discussions on different current track and field topics, but they have always shown a special interest in relays. They also made their own predictions before the World Relays, with Team USA qualifying for the Paris Olympics based on the performance of the squad consisting of Courtney Lindsey, Kenny Bednarek, Kyree King, and Noah Lyles.\n\nHowever, even if they helped their country reach the coveted stage, the positions are not guaranteed since the US Olympic Trials revealed a lot of untapped potential among other athletes who were not on the aforementioned roster. Gatlin wishes to hear Green's team for the Paris Olympics, and he states:\n\n\"Coleman to Fred. Kenny just damn near ran almost 10.1 on that curve. Kenny he gonna fly...to Noah. That's what I'm going with.\"\n\nThe retired four-time world champion just paused for a moment and gasped, \"Wow!\" He expected Green to include Erriyon Knighton on the team, as Green has always stood for the young athlete, who he could have put on the third leg instead of Kenny Bednarek.\n\nThe two track icons then contend that the times that both of the aforementioned athletes ran in the US Olympic Trials completely altered Green's perspective of the relay squad.\n\nThe Bahamian sprinter goes on to say that if Knighton had run more races this year, establishing any significant time, he could have included him in the 4\u00d7100-meter relay, but his only significant race was the 200-meter sprint at the US Olympic Trials, as Bednarek did, but he also proved himself in the 100-meter category.\n\nPreviously, when Wallace Spearmon was featured on the Ready Set Go podcast, the hosts wanted to hear what the retired one-time world champion thought about the relays.\n\nWhen it comes to relays, Justin Gatlin and Rodney Green always remind their audience that the world record set by the prime Jamaican team at the 2012 London Olympics, which included Usain Bolt, Nesta Carter, Michael Frater, and Yohan Blake, has yet to be broken. The athletes set a time of 36.84 seconds, and few teams have come close to matching it.\n\nWhile it appears to be impossible in reality, Wallace Spearmon provides the podcast hosts with a hypothetical scenario in which four American athletes from various eras on a single American team will be able to defeat the prime Jamaican team.\n\nAfter some track and field humor, the one-time world champion gets straight to the point, putting Justin Gatlin in the first leg, himself in the second, Tyson Gay in the third, and Noah Lyles on the last leg of the 4\u00d7100-meter relay team. The four-time world champion and the Bahamian sprinter were impressed with Spearmon; he dispersed the athletes by understanding their strengths and weaknesses.", "source": {"uri": "thesportsrush.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The SportsRush"}, "authors": [{"uri": "rahul_goutam_hoom@thesportsrush.com", "name": "Rahul Goutam Hoom", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justin_Gatlin", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Justin Gatlin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Athletics_Championships", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "World Athletics Championships"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenny_Bednarek", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kenny Bednarek"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019_IAAF_World_Relays", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "2019 IAAF World Relays"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relay_race", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Relay race"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/4_\u00d7_100_metres_relay", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "4 \u00d7 100 metres relay"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sprint_(running)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sprint (running)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YouTube", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "YouTube"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Bahamas", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Bahamas"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "The Bahamas"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyree_King", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kyree King"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erriyon_Knighton", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Erriyon Knighton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sport_of_athletics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sport of athletics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noah_Lyles", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Noah Lyles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Track_and_field", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Track and field"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wallace_Spearmon", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wallace Spearmon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nesta_Carter", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nesta Carter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Frater", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Michael Frater"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyson_Gay", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tyson Gay"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yohan_Blake", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Yohan Blake"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_record", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "World record"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usain_Bolt", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Usain Bolt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/200_metres", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "200 metres"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "London"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "London"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamaica", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jamaica"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Jamaica"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Track_and_Field/Running", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Track and Field/Running", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Track_and_Field/Athletes", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Track and Field/Athletes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally_Challenged", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally Challenged", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 86}], "image": "https://cdn-wp.thesportsrush.com/2024/07/2a565fc5-untitled-design-2.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9722145", "eventUri": "eng-9722145", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2313725490196079, "wgt": 157, "relevance": 1}

However, the 100-meter sprint was a sight to behold because of the supremacy of Kishane Thompson, as the current 100-meter world lead holder.\n\nThe Jamaican performed admirably on the European circuit, holding off Botswanan challenger Letsile Tebogo, as posted by Track & Field Gazette on X. Even though Kisane proved himself at the Jamaican Olympic Trials, because he did not compete in any international events this year, critics had an opportunity to express their viewpoints on the athlete.\n\nKishane, on the other hand, had an easier job, shutting them down again with a 9.91, this time against a 0.6 headwind. Despite the fact that nature might be a hindrance for the Jamaican, he won the race.\n\nAside from the sprint victory, the athlete was seen slowing down at the final 40 meters, looking at the time to his left and Tebogo to his right. Focus is essential in a short sprint like this, but Kishane's ability to turn his head to study the field with nearly half of the race remaining is both astounding and unprecedented.\n\nThis feat has sparked great excitement in the track world, as people are blown away by the Jamaican athlete's performance.\n\nThis track enthusiast provided his study assuming that the headwind was not a factor in the race.\n\nThis supporter is too astonished to voice their feelings after seeing the sprint.\n\nOne fan relates the young athlete to a Jamaican track legend.\n\nThe way Kishane ran has also astounded this watcher, who is eager to see him reach his full potential.\n\nThe track world has yet to see more running action from the young Jamaican, but his performance thus far has astonished not just the community but also track luminaries, who are impressed by the presence of a new sensation in the sport's current generation.\n\nThe 22-year-old sprang to prominence in the track world after he ran a 9.82 in his first heat at the Jamaican Olympic Trials, moving up to second place in the 100-meter world lead rankings. However, the manner in which he improved in the same place in a matter of hours, clocking a 9.77 in the finals and surpassing Ferdinand Omanyala's world lead of 9.79, stunned everyone.\n\nAside from the dominant performance, Rodney Green notes in the Ready Set Go podcast, that the athlete has yet to reach his full potential, as he slowed down in the final 40 meters of the race. This is a concerning trait that American athletes will need to consider, as Kishane Thompson will develop significantly prior to the Paris Olympics.\n\nJustin Gatlin also agrees with the Bahamian sprinter's statement, adding that despite winning four World Championship titles and an Olympic gold medal, he has never seen anyone do this, especially in a major event such as the Olympic Trials.", "source": {"uri": "thesportsrush.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The SportsRush"}, "authors": [{"uri": "rahul_goutam_hoom@thesportsrush.com", "name": "Rahul Goutam Hoom", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Letsile_Tebogo", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Letsile Tebogo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamaica", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jamaica"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Jamaica"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sport_of_athletics", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Sport of athletics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sprint_(running)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Sprint (running)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gyulai_Istv\u00e1n_Memorial", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gyulai Istv\u00e1n Memorial"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Athletics_Continental_Tour", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "World Athletics Continental Tour"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Athletics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "World Athletics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/100_metres", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "100 metres"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Track_and_field", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Track and field"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Instagram"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hungary", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hungary"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Hungary"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Botswana", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Botswana"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Botswana"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Athletics_Championships", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "World Athletics Championships"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justin_Gatlin", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Justin Gatlin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Olympic medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Bahamas", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Bahamas"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "The Bahamas"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Track_and_Field", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Track and Field", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Track_and_Field/Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Track and Field/Organizations", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Track_and_Field/Running", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Track and Field/Running", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 80}], "image": "https://cdn-wp.thesportsrush.com/2024/07/b36f1817-untitled-design-8.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9722145", "eventUri": "eng-9722145", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.4431372549019608, "wgt": 143, "relevance": 1}

June 30th was the last day for all Olympic hopefuls to get qualifying marks that would allow them to compete in Paris.\n\nBy that day, it was almost set in stone for all who would represent Team USA in their respective events. However, the official list still needed to be named depending on scratches, world rankings, and relay pool discretions. Today, Team USA released the official list of the 120 athletes who have a chance to fight for gold.\n\nNoah Lyles And Kenny Bednarek Only American Sprinters To Contest The 100-Meter & 200-Meter Dash Double In Paris\n\nNoah Lyles and Kenny Bednarek were the only men to qualify for the 100-meter dash and 200-meter dash at the Olympic Trials. Joining them in the 100-meter dash will be Olympic silver medalist Fred Kerley. The 200-meter dash will have 20-year old and now two-time Olympian Erriyon Knighton.\n\nThe medal chances of all four men are relatively strong moving into Paris. Lyles is the reigning world champion in both events. Bednarek is the reigning Olympic silver medalist and has already run a lifetime best this season, which is faster than what he ran to win his silver medal. In addition to Kerley's Olympic medal, he was the world champion in the 100-meter dash in 2022. Knighton placed fourth in the 200-meter dash during the Tokyo Olympics and has medaled in every major championship since then.\n\nMORE FOR YOU\n\nApple iPhone 16 Pro Major Design Upgrade Coming, New Report Claims\n\nNYT 'Strands' Hints, Spangram And Answers For Tuesday, July 9th\n\nSketch OnlyFans Leak, Explained: Twitch Streamer Confirms He Created Adult Content During 'Dark Time'\n\nWhile the men will have two athletes attempting gold medal doubles, the women will have none. This will be the first time since 2004 that the U.S. women's short sprint events will have six different competitors.\n\nSha'Carri Richardson, most notably, did not make the team in the 200 meters. However, this gives her more time to focus on winning an Olympic gold medal in the 100 meters. Her world champion training partners, Melissa Jefferson and TeeTee Terry, will join Richardson in the 100 meters.\n\nOlympic bronze medalist Gabby Thomas leads the women's 200-meter team. Joining her will be world silver medalist Brittany Brown and three-time NCAA champion McKenzie Long.\n\nThe 4x100-meter relay pool for the men will consist of Christian Coleman, Kyree King, and Courtney Lindsey. Coleman, the 60-meter world champion and world record holder, missed the 100-meter team by one spot. However, naming Coleman to the relay pool is no surprise, considering he has been on almost every major championship relay since 2016. He also arguably has the best start of any American man.\n\nKing and Lindsey are training partners with Bednarek and participated in the relay that qualified the U.S. for the Olympics at the World Athletics Relay Championships in May.\n\nAleia Hobbs and Tamari Davis will join the women's relay pool. Hobbs has an Olympic silver medal in the 4x100-meter relay from Tokyo, and Davis was the first leg on the U.S. team that won the world championships last year in Budapest.\n\nQuincy Wilson Named To 4x400-Meter Relay Pool\n\nThe relay pool typically consists of the top four athletes in the relay's respective event, along with two discretionary picks. Quincy Wilson placed sixth at the U.S. Olympic Trials and had to wait to see if he would be asked to join the relay pool. On June 30th, Wilson made an Instagram post expressing that he was going to the Olympics. When the official roster came out several hours ago, Team USA listed his name in the relay pool.\n\nIf they pick Wilson to run on the relay, he will have multiple competition options. The Olympics contests a mixed and traditional 4x400-meter relay. Both relays have a prelim and a final, allowing teams to switch out athletes if needed. Track and field fans can see Wilson in any of these relay choices. This decision will be made when it is time for competition.\n\nThe men's 4x400-meter relay pool includes Bryce Deadmon and Vernon Norwood. Deadmon and Norwood have been staples on Team USA's relay for several championships. Both men have multiple Olympic and world medals in the relay.\n\nThe women's 4x400-meter relay pool will include Kaylyn Brown, Shamier Little, Isabella Whittaker, and Quanera Hayes. All of these women have major championship or NCAA experience.\n\nHobbs Kessler and Jasmine Moore Contest Historical Doubles\n\nMaking the Olympic team in two events is a challenging feat. Some combinations of events are more uncommon than others. Hobbs Kessler and Jasmine Moore are the two athletes walking on a path that very few have ever done.\n\nKessler is the first American male to make the Olympic team at both 800-meters and 1500-meters since Rick Wohlhuter in 1976. Earning a medal in both will be challenging, but Kessler has the strong potential to find his way onto the podium.\n\nHis performance in the 800-meters at the Olympic Trials was nothing short of spectacular. Kessler's personal best before the Olympic Trials was 1:45.80. To qualify for the team, he ran two personal bests, effectively dropping over two seconds off his time to run 1:43.64. If Kessler can continue on this competitive streak, he may earn a spot in the Olympic final.\n\nMoore is another athlete who will compete in a historic double. She is the first woman in American history to qualify for the Olympics in the long and triple jump. This is not the first time Moore etched her name into history. In 2022, she became the first American woman to qualify for both horizontal jumps for the World Athletics Outdoor Championships.\n\nGrant Fisher and Karissa Schweizer are the other athletes on Team USA who will run two events. They will both compete in the 5k and 10k.\n\nTo view the complete Team USA roster, readers can click here or visit the USATF website.", "source": {"uri": "forbes.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

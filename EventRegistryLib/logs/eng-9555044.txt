Luke Torian, D-Prince William, chair of the House Appropriations Committee, seen here in 2021, confirmed a budget deal.\n\nMICHAEL MARTZ Richmond Times-Dispatch\n\nGeneral Assembly budget leaders and Gov. Glenn Youngkin have reached a budget compromise that would use an additional $525 million in state revenues to pay for Democratic spending priorities without raising taxes and crossing the Republican governor's red line for a potential veto.\n\nHouse Appropriations Chairman Luke Torian, D-Prince William, confirmed on Thursday afternoon that assembly budget negotiators had reached a deal with Youngkin that they hope to approve on Monday in a special session that would last one day instead of three.\n\n\"We do have an agreement,\" Torian said.\n\nYoungkin's press secretary, Christian Martinez, said in a statement: \"Governor Youngkin is grateful for all the members of the General Assembly, as well as the leadership, and conferees for their ongoing efforts to deliver a budget. He looks forward to finishing the work to deliver on our collective priorities for all Virginians next week.\"\n\nDetails will not be available to legislators or the public until Saturday morning, but he said the compromise gives the assembly the additional spending it had insisted upon for K-12 public schools to begin addressing a systemic shortfall that the Joint Legislative Audit and Review Commission verified in a study last summer that shaped legislative elections last fall and budget priorities in the 60-day session that ended on March 9.\n\n\"All of our spending priorities are intact,\" said Torian, citing the assembly's push for more money for higher education, health care and transportation.\n\nNo sales tax expansion\n\nHowever, the $188 billion, two-year budget will not expand Virginia's sales tax to digital services. Youngkin had originally proposed the idea as part of a tax policy package that would have cut tax revenues by $1 billion as part of a plan to modernize the state tax code and plug what the governor called the \"big tech loophole\" that exempts video streaming and audio services from the tax levied on goods, such as compact discs and DVDs.\n\nDemocrats had rejected the governor's proposals to cut income tax rates and raise the sales tax by almost a penny, but kept the expansion to digital services, including those purchased from business to business. Those tax provisions in the budget that the assembly adopted on March 9 would have raised an additional $1 billion, but Youngkin said he would refuse to sign the budget, potentially leaving the state without money to operate on July 1 for the first time in Virginia history.\n\nThe budget deal also does not include a requirement by the Democratic-controlled assembly that Virginia rejoin the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, a multistate compact that would seek to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases that scientists say contribute to global warming and climate change. Youngkin pushed the State Air Pollution Control Board to withdraw the state from the compact because of concerns about the costs of surcharges on carbon pollution that consumers would pay in their electric bills.\n\nThe assembly also allowed Youngkin to keep most -- but not quite all -- of the $85 million it had appropriated in the current budget for his lab school initiative, although it does not include an additional $60 million that he had sought in the budget he proposed in December.\n\n\"There is no new money for lab schools,\" Torian said.\n\nSkill games\n\nTorian said the proposed budget deal does not include electronic skill games.\n\nThe VA Merchants and Amusement Coalition announced that beginning Thursday at 5 p.m., hundreds of participating convenience stores would stop selling Virginia Lottery tickets \"until Governor Youngkin and members of the Virginia General Assembly come to an agreement on a path forward for skill games.\"\n\nMichael Martz (804) 649-6964\n\nmmartz@timesdispatch.com\n\nTags Lee-national The Economy Trade Politics Revenue Services Finance Law Ecology Banking Be the first to know\n\nGet local news delivered to your inbox!\n\nSign up!

He looks forward to finishing the work to deliver on our collective priorities for all Virginians next week.\"\n\nDetails will not be available to legislators or the public until Saturday morning, but he said the compromise gives the assembly the additional spending it had insisted upon for K-12 public schools to begin addressing a systemic shortfall that the Joint Legislative Audit and Review Commission verified in a study last summer that shaped legislative elections last fall and budget priorities in the 60-day session that ended on March 9.\n\n\"All of our spending priorities are intact,\" said Torian, citing the assembly's push for more money for higher education, health care and transportation.\n\nNo sales tax expansion\n\nHowever, the $188 billion, two-year budget will not expand Virginia's sales tax to digital services. Youngkin had originally proposed the idea as part of a tax policy package that would have cut tax revenues by $1 billion as part of a plan to modernize the state tax code and plug what the governor called the \"big tech loophole\" that exempts video streaming and audio services from the tax levied on goods, such as compact discs and DVDs.\n\nDemocrats had rejected the governor's proposals to cut income tax rates and raise the sales tax by almost a penny, but kept the expansion to digital services, including those purchased from business to business. Those tax provisions in the budget that the assembly adopted on March 9 would have raised an additional $1 billion, but Youngkin said he would refuse to sign the budget, potentially leaving the state without money to operate on July 1 for the first time in Virginia history.\n\nThe budget deal also does not include a requirement by the Democratic-controlled assembly that Virginia rejoin the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, a multistate compact that would seek to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases that scientists say contribute to global warming and climate change. Youngkin pushed the State Air Pollution Control Board to withdraw the state from the compact because of concerns about the costs of surcharges on carbon pollution that consumers would pay in their electric bills.\n\nThe assembly also allowed Youngkin to keep most -- but not quite all -- of the $85 million it had appropriated in the current budget for his lab school initiative, although it does not include an additional $60 million that he had sought in the budget he proposed in December.\n\n\"There is no new money for lab schools,\" Torian said.\n\nSkill games\n\nTorian said the proposed budget deal does not include electronic skill games.\n\nThe VA Merchants and Amusement Coalition announced that beginning Thursday at 5 p.m., hundreds of participating convenience stores would stop selling Virginia Lottery tickets \"until Governor Youngkin and members of the Virginia General Assembly come to an agreement on a path forward for skill games.\"\n\nMost common fast food chains in Virginia Most common fast food chains in Virginia #20.
